RANGERS' BALKY LOSS COSTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Texas Rangers lost a game Friday night because
of a balk as well as their slow-footed cleanup hitter because he
was successful in stealing a base.
</P>
<P>
   A slide that has seen the Rangers lose nine of their past 11
games has perhaps reached the ridiculous stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' catcher Ivan Rodriguez said, shaking his head
after Jeff Zimmerman's balk brought in the final run in the
Rangers' 4-3 loss to the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like this is getting worse and worse,'' said Rafael
Palmeiro, who left the game in the fifth with tightness in his left
hamstring and was unavailable in a crucial situation. ``We've got
to find a way to get this thing turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were headed that way when Esteban Loaiza cruised
into the sixth with a 3-0 lead. But Jeff Conine homered off him in
that inning, and Mike Bordick smacked a two-run home run in the
seventh. That made it a 3-3 game and set up the ending in the ninth
that had the Rangers fighting off new levels of overall
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose, everything you do is magnified,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``Everything becomes more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as stepping off the pitching rubber properly with the
winning run at third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like that in my life,'' said Loaiza,
who gave way to Zimmerman after eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman got in trouble in the ninth when Cal Ripken led off
with a single to left and Will Clark doubled to right, moving
pinch-runner Mark Lewis to third.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Greg Myers, but he never got a chance to swing
the bat. Zimmerman was looking in for the sign from Rodriguez but
tried to step off the rubber and was called for a balk by both home
plate umpire Ian Lamplugh and third base umpire Brian O'Nora.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zimmerman started his motion, stopped, then stepped back off
the rubber,'' Lamplugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Oates didn't argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no doubt in my mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Zimmerman, ``Nobody came out to argue, so it must have been
pretty blatant. I didn't see the signs from Pudge, so I wanted to
step off the rubber and have him go through them again.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the deciding play, but losing Palmeiro could be much
more painful. He is listed as day-to-day but so was Rusty Greer
when he was scratched from the lineup in New York with a tight
hamstring. Two days later he was on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll know more (Saturday), but it's going to take something
really severe for me not to play,'' Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro injured himself by stealing second base without a throw
in the fifth. He said the hamstring ``grabbed'' him as he took his
last step and slipped. Scott Sheldon went in to run for him.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's absence might have cost the Rangers in the seventh
after Chad Curtis reached with a one-out single off Orioles starter
Jason Johnson and Rodriguez drew a walk. Palmeiro should have been
up but instead it was Sheldon, who was 0-for-3 for the season
before that at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to manufacture a run, Curtis broke for third on a 1-1
pitch and was thrown out easily by Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get to third base with one out,'' Curtis
said. ``(Johnson) had been kind of slow to the plate, and Myers
didn't look like he was throwing the ball well. I just didn't get a
good jump. I should have stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates, whose team led 3-1 at the time, approved of Curtis'
aggressiveness, especially since the Rangers had already stolen
twice off Johnson and Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, you might as well get used to it,'' Oates said. ``We're
going to do some things. We're not going sit back and wait for a
three-run homer because it's not coming.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-timed balk might help, but those plays are going against
the Rangers right now. nn

EDITORIAL: STUMBLING EFFORTS IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, April 29:
</P>
<P>
   In East Timor, where pro-Indonesian militias went on a rampage
last summer, the United Nations has taken on an ambitious
reconstruction mission with inadequate means. Not surprisingly, the
results to date have been disappointing. Unless faster progress can
be achieved in creating jobs, resettling refugees and establishing
the rule of law, there is a serious risk of new violence.
</P>
<P>
   International peacekeepers belatedly put a stop to the violence,
which came after the East Timorese voted for independence. But by
the time U.N. administrators moved in six months ago, conditions
were desperate. Pro-Jakarta militias had burned much of the
territory's housing and destroyed its agricultural economy. The
abrupt withdrawal of Indonesian civil servants left East Timor
without police, teachers and other essential services.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the United Nations has made only modest progress.
Some schools have been reopened, although they still lack trained
teachers. Emergency medical and dental clinics have been
established, many of them staffed by private relief agencies. But a
staggering 80 percent of East Timor's 800,000 people still have no
work, and nearly 100,000 remain in refugee camps across the
Indonesian frontier. There is no functioning police force or
courts, no reliable water, power or transportation systems.
</P>
<P>
   The chief U.N. administrator, Sergio Vieira de Mello, has been
hampered by an inadequate budget, unrealistic staff ceilings and
the slowness of donor nations in providing the funds and volunteers
they have promised for Timor's reconstruction. Of more than $500
million pledged late last year, only $40 million has been
delivered. Washington has so far sent about $8 million of the $13
million it promised for U.N. and World Bank reconstruction efforts.
Donor nations have been slow in providing the local governance
experts the U.N. needs.
</P>
<P>
   These problems have been magnified by the workings of the
notoriously slow U.N. bureaucracy and the U.N. mission's reluctance
to give more responsibility to local residents. If the rebuilding
effort continues to lag in the months ahead, Jakarta could be
tempted to exploit the continuing poverty and chaos, launching new
military forays from Indonesian-controlled West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's violence in East Timor galvanized international
attention and action. That commitment must now be sustained with
adequate resources and a renewed sense of urgency.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: A BROAD BAN ON SNOWMOBILES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, April 29:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Donald J. Barry, the assistant secretary of the
interior for fish and wildlife and parks, announced the effective
end of recreational snowmobiling in all but a handful of America's
national parks. The ban is not the result of new legislation or new
regulations. It is the result of a new commitment to laws and rules
that have been on the books for years, including executive orders
that prohibit the use of off-road vehicles except where authorized.
Barry's announcement represents one of those moments, so vital to
the health of our national parks, when the Park Service stands back
and compares its public mission with the status quo. Without such
moments from time to time, we would still be feeding black bears
along the roads in Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, this announcement does nothing more than urge park
superintendents across the national park system to bring their
parks into compliance with the law, and particularly with the laws
that regulate the enforcement of environmental standards. It
exempts Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota and some parks in
Alaska, which have slightly different legal standing with regard to
snowmobile use. It also exempts Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but
only because those parks are in the midst of drafting a
court-ordered environmental impact statement concerning winter use,
a process that is likely to lead in mid-autumn to a ban on
snowmobiling there as well.
</P>
<P>
   What Barry's announcement underscores is the simple principle
that America's national parks should lead the nation in adherence
to environmental law. Recreation is not incompatible with strict
adherence. It is enhanced. For years snowmobiling has been
tolerated even though it violated the law, and its environmental
impact had scarcely been monitored until recently. But now that the
impact of snowmobiling is clearly understood and the extent of its
pollution clearly documented, overlooking the law has become
intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   There will be sharp debate as the effects of Barry's
announcement are felt and as Yellowstone and Grand Teton approach
snowmobiling bans. The  &UR; c &LR; ongressional delegations from Wyoming,
Montana and Idaho have promised oversight hearings late in May to
challenge the order. But an end to snowmobiling is the right step,
the only one consistent with the ethic, and the laws, governing the
National Park Service.

LAWYER FIRES AT IMMIGRANTS, AND 5 PEOPLE ARE KILLED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A white immigration lawyer went on a shooting spree on the
outskirts of Pittsburgh Friday afternoon, killing five people,
including a Jewish woman, two Asian men, one Indian and one black
man and critically injuring a sixth, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, identified by the police as Richard Baumhammers, 34,
was pulled over in his Jeep and arrested at 3:30 p.m. in the town
of Ambridge, two hours after the police uncovered a 15-mile trail
of death that ran through two shopping centers and crossed three
townships.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers stays with his parents in Mount Lebanon, Pa., where
neighbors described the family as ``pillars of the community.''
Baumhammers &UR;  &LR; is licensed to practice law in Georgia and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   He was arraigned last night on one count of criminal homicide in
the shooting at a martial arts school, and the FBI has joined the
investigation by the Alleghany County police to determine whether
the spree was a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   The killings followed another shooting spree with racist
overtones in Pittsburgh on March 2. In that incident, a black man
opened fire in two fast-food restaurants during lunchtime, after
proclaiming, ``I'm just out to shoot white men.''
</P>
<P>
   The gunman in that case, Ronald Taylor, surrendered to the
police, but his actions left a deep reservoir of fear and grief.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania responding to the latest
shootings, said Friday night to a Republican group he was
addressing in Pebble Beach, Calif.: ``Not again. Those are the
first words that come to mind. Not again.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Across Pennsylvania, and particularly in
southwestern Pennsylvania, we are struggling to make sense of what
appears to be yet another brutal racist rampage.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials got the first call related to the
killings at 1:43 p.m., when a fire alarm went off at the home of
one of Baumhammers' next-door neighbors, said Paul Wolf, acting
superintendent for the Mount Lebanon police.
</P>
<P>
   When police officers and firefighters arrived at the house, Wolf
said, they found the body of a neighbor, Anita Gordon, 63, who had
been shot to death. The house was also burning after a rug was set
on fire. Gordon is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   About 1:49 p.m., the police received a call about a shooting in
neighboring Scott Township, at an Indian grocery in the Scott Town
Center. A 30-year-old man had been killed by multiple gunshots.
Another victim was taken to Mercy Hospital, and remained in serious
condition Friday night. Police did not release their names, though
he was identified by The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as Patil Sandip,
24, of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Kretzler, owner of Travel Connection, was working next door
to the grocery when he said he heard loud sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were pounding on the wall next door,'' Kretzler
said. ``I thought, `What in the world are they doing over there?'''
</P>
<P>
   He said he then saw a man walking away from the grocery with his
arm extended backward pointing a revolver at the grocery. ``Then he
calmly and coolly walked along the sidewalk to his car,'' Kretzler
said, adding that the man sat in his black Jeep Cherokee for about
a minute before driving off. The police said they believe
Baumhammers next fired shots through the windows and front door of
a nearby synagogue, the Beth El Congregation in Mount Lebanon. He
then went on to another synagogue, Ahavath Achim, in Carnegie, and
fired shots outside, shattering the windows. No injuries were
reported in those incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The next report of gunfire came at 2:25 p.m., Wolf said, this
time at a Chinese restaurant, Ya Fei Chinese Cuisine, in adjacent
Robinson Township.
</P>
<P>
   Two Asian men there were shot from five to six feet away, said
Wolf, one in the face and one in the chest. Both were pronounced
dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   A cook there, Vinh Truong, said an employee ran into the kitchen
and told everyone to escape, but Truong said he found his
brother-in-law, whom he identified as Tony, on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after that, a dispatcher in Beaver Township received
the next call. This time, the police found the body of a
25-year-old black man at the C.S. Kim Karate School, who died from
a single gunshot wound to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting at the martial arts school, the police said,
Baumhammers drove toward Pittsburgh. The police in Aliquippa
spotted his Jeep and followed it across the Ohio River into
Ambridge, where officers from both towns arrested Baumhammers at
about 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Officers cornered his vehicle and drew their weapons, but
Baumhammers calmly surrendered, police officials said. A handgun
and spent shells were found in his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers was taken to the Center Township police station,
were he was questioned for five hours. During the interrogation,
his only comment was to ask to speak with a lawyer, an official
with the Center Township police told a reporter in a televised
interview.

EDITORIAL: THE DECLINE OF THE EURO 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, April 29:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The value of the euro has plunged more than 20 percent against
the dollar in the 16 months since its adoption by 11 members of the
European Union. The drop, from almost $1.20 in January 1999 to
about 90 cents Friday, upsets Europeans who find a falling currency
embarrassing. A deeper issue is that some Europeans fear the euro
might be on the verge of free fall, which would raise the price of
imports, thereby reducing living standards and adding to
inflationary pressures. To keep inflation in check, the European
Central Bank might decide to raise interest rates to slow the
economy. U.S. exporters worry that a falling euro _ which means a
rising dollar _ will turn Europeans away from U.S. products.
</P>
<P>
   These fears are exaggerated. Currencies rise and fall.
Fluctuations of the euro are far from alarming. Indeed, the basket
of currencies that make up the euro rose in value before its formal
introduction. Between the summer of 1998 and now, the value of
those currencies has hardly budged. The United States has been
growing at a fast rate, attracting a steady inflow of European
capital. Europe has grown more slowly, leading to an outflow of
capital. The imbalance has more people wanting to sell euros than
buy them. These trends are likely to prove temporary.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the United States and Europe of ordinary
fluctuations in the euro-dollar exchange rate is modest. Both
import relatively few goods, compared with the overall size of
their economies. The impact of a falling euro on the living
standards of Europeans is small. Nor does a falling euro raise
import prices enough to substantially affect inflation. The danger
is that the European Central Bank will raise interest rates anyway,
just to maintain the value of the euro high enough for Europe to
keep bragging about its new currency _ a dangerous trap for a
continent whose unemployment rates hover at more than twice the
U.S. level.
</P>
<P>
   Europe appears to be making more of the euro's problems than its
fluctuations deserve. Most of the continent is recovering well.
Inflation is subdued. When the euro was born, many Europeans
boasted that it would challenge the dollar for international
supremacy. Those hopes have been temporarily dashed. But the euro
is young. As the European Union expands, so too will use of the
euro. The euro is here to stay, though its value will continue to
move up and down.

THEOLOGIANS WARY OF SIMPLIFICATION OF VIEWS ON GAYS AND CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scholar A, Scholar B and Scholar C _ the reasons for anonymity
will be obvious _ have four things in common. First, they are all
respected Protestant theologians well known for their work on
religion and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Second, they have all articulated carefully modulated arguments
for why Christian churches should not revise their teachings to
bless same-sex unions or ordain gay men and lesbians who do not
intend to live by their church's existing sexual standards.
</P>
<P>
   Third, they were all asked on Thursday to tape interviews for a
televised discussion of these questions.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, they all said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, I hate this issue,'' Scholar B said. ``I've been
burned on it before.'' An hour earlier, Scholar A had used
strikingly similar language in begging off. An hour later, so would
Scholar C.
</P>
<P>
   None of these theologians absolutely ruled out being interviewed
at some undetermined time in the future. They just sounded like
Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane: Please, God, let this cup pass
from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``In principle, I'd be willing to think about it,'' Scholar B
said, which was just about as far as any of the three would go.
Part of their hesitation _ but only part of it _ stemmed from the
wariness, ingrained in almost every scholarly psyche, of what the
news media, especially television, can do with complicated views.
</P>
<P>
   And their views are complicated. ``I'm basically in support of
the Vermont law,'' Scholar C said, for example, referring to that
state's new law creating a form of civil union that extends to gay
and lesbian couples many of the rights and benefits attached to
marriage. But for reasons it would be interesting to hear, he
opposed approximating those same-sex civil unions to Christian
marriage, with its biblical and sacramental dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Scholar A had turned down a request for a
sound-bite comment on the controversy over homosexuality within the
United Methodist Church, which, along with the Presbyterians (USA)
and the Episcopal Church, will be debating homosexuality-related
questions at national meetings over the next three months. (And in
the background, of course, is the Supreme Court, which heard oral
arguments on whether the Boy Scouts have a right to exclude gay
members, some of them touching on religion and morality, the day
before the theologians were contacted.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure my views could be condensed,'' Scholar A said.
The three theologians' concerns clearly went beyond the normal
resistance of academics to the simplification of the news media.
Scholar B worried about the way these issues were typically forced
into a debate format: ``Here's Mr. Compassion,'' he said, ``and
here's me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was evidently not the theologians alone who risked being
pegged as anti-gay and anti-compassion. Scholar B mentioned how
family members had felt the ``heat'' for his previous public
statements; he could not agree to an interview without consulting
them first.
</P>
<P>
   Scholar A recalled the last-minute withdrawal of an invitation
to speak at a Midwestern church; his views, the pastor said, would
be offensive to some people.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, the three theologians expressed the
fear that taking a conservative position on issues involving
homosexuality seemed to eclipse almost everything else they wanted
to address as scholars and church leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For Scholar C, these issues are a recent and relatively minor
part of a large body of work long seen as more liberal than
conservative. Yet ``in some circles, I've been typecast,'' he said,
as though homosexuality, rather than a wide range of other topics,
including economic justice and dialogue with other religions, were
``my issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholar A said much the same thing. ``I've not wanted to be so
prominently identified with my position on this issue,'' he said.
It is not that he doubts the importance or cogency of the case he
tries to make, he explained, nor does he want to back away from it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ``this seems to be an issue where the church has things out
of proportion,'' he said, lamenting the fact that the same kind of
energies are not mobilized around other issues close to his heart
and his scholarship, like the distribution of material goods and
the search for nonviolent ways of living.
</P>
<P>
   Three scholars are hardly a national sample. Other theologians
of measured, complex views will no doubt be found to take their
places. But three strikeouts in a row inevitably leaves one mulling
over the dynamics that reduce society's differences about
sexuality, morality, religion and law to shouting matches and
bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   As thoughtful conservatives _ at least on this topic _ these
three theologians confront not only simplification but also the
ideological intolerance and labeling rampant in university
environments and the polarized atmosphere within the churches.
Measured liberals may well face similar pressures: condemnations
from angry conservatives on the other side and criticism from
dissatisfied militants on their own.
</P>
<P>
   American culture is hypersensitive to censorship. What truly
constrains full and open public discussion, however, may be far
more subtle but no less effective.

PUBLIC HOLDS T. REX-SIZE APPETITE FOR PREHISTORY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dinosaur-mania is back and, fittingly, bigger than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Two summer dinosaur movies, a dinosaur documentary that was the
highest-rated in cable television history, the real-life discovery
last week of what could be a fossilized dinosaur heart and an
upcoming museum exhibit of a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton are giving
the public a giganotosaur-size helping of the extinct behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   Equally enormous is the public appetite for all things
prehistoric and big, still unsated even after one of the
biggest-grossing movies ever, 1994's ``Jurassic Park,'' and its
sequel ``The Lost World.'' The two films together grossed more than
$585 million at the domestic box office, and another sequel is in
the works.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment industry types and fans of dinosaurs agree their
fascination will endure until something bigger comes along - if
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're big and they're cool and they're dead and we wonder,''
said teacher Jim White, while leading 100 seventh- and eighth-grade
students through ``Jurassic Park - The Ride'' at Universal Studios
on a recent afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Odano, who creates dinosaur replicas for museums, said
there have been more fossil discoveries in the past 20 years than
in the previous 120 years combined, meaning the story of dinosaurs
will not soon end. One of her most recent expeditions was to
Argentina to cast a mold for the skeleton of a giganotosaur
discovered there. The meat-eater, at 45 feet long, was a foot
longer and a ton heavier than the famed T. rex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that awe will ever end,'' said Odano, owner of
Valley Anatomical Preparation. ``It's like radio; what you imagine
is better than what you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is giving people plenty of opportunities to stretch
their imaginations. Consider the current offerings out there:
</P>
<P>
   -- The Discovery Channel scored its best ratings ever with
``Walking with Dinosaurs,'' a documentary featuring computer
animatronics and on-location filming to more accurately represent
the world dinosaurs inhabited. The show first aired April 16 and
will repeat this summer.
</P>
<P>
   -- IMAX Theatre is offering ``T. Rex: Back to the Cretaceous''
at Universal CityWalk, the only place fans can see the spectacle in
Greater Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   -- On May 19, the Disney film ``Dinosaur'' will open nationwide.
Another technological marvel, this animated film reportedly cost
well more than the previous most-expensive-movie-ever-made, the
$200 million ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   The public fascination sometimes starts from the ground up.
Donalyn Hodge, a British Columbia resident visiting Southern
California's theme parks, said her sons teach her about dinosaurs,
reiterating what they learn in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not around anymore,'' said her eldest son, Chad Hodge,
14, as his mother picked out T-shirts in the Jurassic Park gift
shop at Universal Studios. ``It's a gateway into another world.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossil discoveries in the United States have given real-life
shape to that other world. Last week, a North Carolina State
University-led team announced it had found the fossilized remains
of the heart of a dinosaur uncovered in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   And in November, ``Sue,'' one of the most fought-over dinosaur
skeletons ever, will visit the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural
History as part of a national tour. The 1990 discovery of the T.
rex fossil set off a tug-of-war for control among the federal
government, an auction house, an American Indian tribe and
commercial dinosaur hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Chiappe, associate curator of vertebrate paleontology at
the county museum, said recent finds are giving the
multimillion-dollar movies a run for their money on the
exhilaration scale. His own expedition uncovered hundreds of
dinosaur eggs on a plain in Chile in 1997. They contained the first
known fossilized dinosaur embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding wonderful creatures ... to the point that it's
very, very hard to keep up,'' Chiappe said.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Hettema, the Universal Studios executive who oversaw the
construction of the Jurassic Park ride, said the attraction of
dinosaurs resides not in the details but in the very fact they
existed. He marvels at the irony that so much at the forefront of
technology is devoted to the ultimate in throwbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having the best leading man or best leading lady in
your story,'' said Hettema, senior vice president of attraction
development. ``There's so much drama about their very existence.
There's a sense of mystery.''

D.C. RALLY BARES DEEP DIVISIONS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MARC SANDALOW &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is hardly surprising that there is opposition to
Sunday's rally by gays and lesbians, which is expected to draw
hundreds of thousands to the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   What is astonishing is that the most vocal critics of ``The
Millennium March'' come from within the gay community itself.
</P>
<P>
   The huge march _ sponsored by corporate giants like United
Airlines and Showtime and featuring big-name entertainers and
prominent politicians _ has bared huge schisms in the gay
community.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades after the first gay march on Washington, the
movement has become so big, so mainstream and so fragmented that
some of its own members are openly rebelling.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism has ranged from complaints about the involvement
of corporate sponsors to concerns that AIDS is being given too low
a priority, that the national organizers ignored grassroots input
and that gays of color are not properly represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``This march appears to be nothing more than a convenient time
to party,'' wrote Tom Ammiano, president of the San Francisco Board
of Supervisors, in a recent opinion piece in the Bay Area Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Four gay elected officials from New York, in a statement urging
people to boycott the event, wrote: ``Our past marches on
Washington unified the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender
communities. The Millennium March on Washington is having the
opposite effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissent has obliged promoters to lower their original
estimate that more than a million marchers would show up, though
they still believe they will attract enough people to claim the
largest gay march in history.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many turn out, the size of the crowd is certain to
be a topic of dispute. The biggest gay march to date was held in
1993, when the National Park Service estimated that 300,000 people
attended a rally; organizers said the number was between 750,000
and a million.
</P>
<P>
   The park service stopped estimating crowd sizes after promoters
of the 1995 ``Million Man March'' filed suits over what it believed
was a lowball estimate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, less than a year after the assassination of San
Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk and just 10 years after the
Stonewall riots in New York City, about 100,000 marchers came to
Washington in what Ammiano described as a ``rag-tag'' collection of
civil rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents hollered obscenities and warned tourists to stay off
the streets, while Jerry Falwell led prayers in the Rayburn House
Office building, saying ``God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and
Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1987 march, which coincided with the unveiling of the AIDS
quilt, attracted about a quarter of a million people.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to previous marches, many participants arriving in
Washington Friday said they had little intention of making a grand
political statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's good to let people know that we are doctors and
lawyers, and ordinary people,'' said Andrew Cross, a real estate
agent from San Diego. ``But I'm here to see people. I'm here for
the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers have drawn up an eight-point agenda for the rally,
including an end to job discrimination, a call for racial justice,
support for hate-crimes legislation and attention to AIDS and other
gay-related health issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to energize and galvanize the gay, lesbian,
bisexual transgender community,'' said the event's co-chairman,
Duane Cramer, rattling off the four groups that comprise what
activists call GLBTs.
</P>
<P>
   Rallying on the mall in front of the U.S. Capitol, organizers
hope to remind politicians of the potency of their electoral power,
which they say is about the size of the Latino or Jewish vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time there has ever been a queer march in an
election year,'' Cramer said. ``We expect the largest GLBT vote in
history this November.''
</P>
<P>
   The festivities begin Saturday morning with a mass ``wedding''
for same-sex couples at the Lincoln Memorial conducted by Rev.
Elder Troy Perry, founder at the Universal Fellowship of
Metropolitan Community Churches.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, a concert at RFK Stadium featuring Melissa
Etheridge, Garth Brooks, Queen Latifah, Michael Feinstein, k.d.
lang cq lower case  &LR; and the Pet Shop Boys will raise money for the
Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   The main event Sunday features six hours of speeches from
community leaders and politicians, though the most recognized names
are entertainers, including Ellen Degeneres, Anne Heche and
Margaret Cho.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore each declined
invitations to speak but will be represented in video
presentations.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial potential of hundreds of thousands of visitors
has not been lost on Washington's businesses. Nightclubs passed out
leaflets for parties to visitors arriving at Ronald Reagan National
Airport, while other establishments offered discounts to
march-goers.
</P>
<P>
   The site's official Web site offers merchandise emblazoned with
the march's logo _ prompting harsh words from critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a marketing event in search of a political purpose,''
lamented New York attorney Bill Dobbs, who was so frustrated with
the organizers that he helped create an organization and Web page
opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Millennium March title _ which has no mention of gays,
lesbians, bisexuals or transgenders _ is an affront to some
activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to hide the identities,'' Dobbs said. ``They are
trying to water it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Some dissenters acknowledge that their frustrations are the
result of the movement's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago there was a broader oppression that everyone
identified with,'' said Ammiano, who attended each of the previous
gay rallies in Washington in 1979, 1987 and 1993. ``Back then, we
didn't publicly fragment ourselves.'' Like Ammiano, California
state Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, attended
previous Washington marches, and will miss this one. However, she
does not share his skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm baffled by the resistance to the march,'' said Migden,
dismissing the power struggle within the gay community as ``inside
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think your average lesbian or gay cares a bit about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say to a kid in Iowa, `Are you going to the march or
not?' the answer has to do with whether he can afford it, whether
he can get off work, and whether his buddies are going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to think that any march serves the community's
interest,'' she said.

<P>
   NASSAU, Bahamas _ Survivors of a shipwreck that stranded more
than 250 Haitians on a barren island of the Bahamas 200 miles
southeast of here said Friday that they had fled Haiti aboard a
stolen boat in a desperate attempt to escape the mounting violence
that has swept through their homeland as elections approach.
</P>
<P>
   Their journey, which some said was motivated by the recent
murder of a prominent radio commentator and government critic, Jean
Domi- nique, became a doomed within days of leaving Haiti, the
survivors said.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly ran out of gas, food and water. Some were forced to
drink sea water, they said, making them even weaker. Finally their
drifting, 50-foot sailboat sank off Flamingo Cay, a small island
where they were discovered on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Although several of the 222 survivors who arrived here Friday
aboard a Bahamian naval vessel said that as many as 18 of their
comrades died during the journey, the figure could not be
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Bahamian authorities said only two deaths could be verified and
that several dozen others had been already been hospitalized and
treated for dehydration and kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the everyday deaths back in Haiti that still
preoccupied the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in misery,'' said Francisco Martinez, a Haitian whose
parents were from the Dominican Republic. ``The chiefs in Haiti are
killing people. They burn down houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's discovery of hundreds of stranded Haitians
comes after more than 300 other Haitians were rescued by Bahamian
authorities in two previous incidents in the last week. The surge
in boats packed with illegal immigrants coursing through Bahamian
waters on their way to Florida has led local officials to increase
aerial surveillance, but they are alarmed because they cannot
handle a continued, large influx on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come in every year, but it has been some time since we
have seen the amount we are seeing now,'' said Senior Cmdr. Raymond
Farquharson of the Royal Bahamas Defense Force. ``We know
conditions in Haiti are deteriorating. People are trying to get
out. It is a big problem for the Bahamas. We do not have the
resources to get them here, feed them and make arrangements to
repatriate them.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bahamian immigration official said his government would
repatriate the latest group ``as soon as possible.'' Joseph
Etienne, a Haitian diplomat in Nassau said his government was
taking steps to discourage any further illegal immigration, a
difficult promise to keep, given the Haitian authorities' inability
to stem the wave of election-related violence that has wracked the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the survivors said they were active in electoral
campaigns and had received death threats and had gone into hiding.
Others said the increasing instability was too much to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran,'' said Jonas Louis, a fisherman from Arcahaie. ``We
hid in places before we robbed the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and five others spotted a boat whose crew had
gone ashore to eat. Quickly, they stole it and took off to herd
dozens of passengers on board. The boat, which had a small outboard
motor as well as a sail, ran out of fuel within two days of
leaving. The seas were rough, and water was leaking into the boat,
which drifted towards Flamingo Cay. Without water or food, the
situation grew desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drank water from the sea,'' Louis said. ``Some people died
because they could not stand it. I cannot say how many.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahamian officials who interviewed the Haitians, said they waded
ashore from their crippled boat. There, they were spotted on
Wednesday night by several passing sailboats. In quick order, a
joint U.S.-Bahamian rescue effort was underway. Brian Dudas, a
Coast Guard medical corpsman, flew into Flamingo Cay on Wednesday
night to find a sole Bahamian Defense Force member dressed in
camouflage standing watch on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just trying to keep order,'' Dudas said. ``From what I
saw, everybody was just laid out on the beach, just pretty much
crashed out.''
</P>
<P>
   He helped load the most seriously ill Haitians onto a
helicopter, but he said that the scene quickly grew unruly as more
healthy people tried to climb on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like pushing people out of the helo just before we took
off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, more than 200 dazed and desperate Haitians were
still on the island, clearly visible as Coast Guard Lt. Chuck Bell
maneuvered his Jayhawk helicopter over the white sands. Clothes and
people were scattered among the rocks and shrubs, while others
huddled under a makeshift tent rescuers had built from tarpaulins,
sticks and branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unreal,'' Bell said. ``You flew over, and you could see
the boat they came in on. The water here is crystal clear, and you
could see the boat submerged with its mast sticking out. On the
beach, there were massive amounts of people with clothes and
blankets everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   More rescue crews arrived on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of emotionally distraught people,'' said
Coast Guard Ensign Breck Smith. ``A lot were looking at photos,
which I assume were of the people who were lost the day before.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is stationed in Clearwater, Fla., said a Bahamian
doctor had already set aside five Haitians to be stabilized and
evacuated as quickly as possible, since there were few medical
supplies at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patients were in a serious degree of shock,'' he said.
There was no way to treat them. We showed up with 25 liters of IV
fluid and started plugging people into IVs and getting them out
when an aircraft arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Crew members of one cutter quickly had to secure the area when
they began to distribute food and water to the remaining Haitians,
who had survived for some time with neither.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were getting overrun,'' said Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for the Bahamas. Wednesday's discovery
was the third such interception of Haitians in less than a week.
Last Saturday, 200 Haitians were rescued after their boat ran
aground near Harbour Island. On Tuesday, 123 Haitians were plucked
from their sinking ship off the coast of Great Inagua island. Even
as rescue efforts were underway on Flamingo Cay on Thursday,
Bahamian authorities sent two charter planes to the Haitian capital
with most of the Haitians rescued in the previous incidents, said
Farquharson.
</P>
<P>
   Bahamians fear that the influx may continue. In recent years,
Haiti has been paralyzed by a political standoff that has left the
nation without a parliament or constitutionally appointed prime
minister. Millions of dollars in much-needed foreign aid has been
blocked because of the legislative impasse, while efforts to have
elections to establish a new parliament have been marked by delays,
accusations and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the survivors said they did not want to return to Haiti,
adding that they preferred to die here if they could not continue
on to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many have died already,'' said Louis. ``To Miami. We want
to go to Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not possible. Yet the desperation of these Haitians to
reach the United States touched one Simeon Hall, who wondered why
their cause was not championed the way that keeping Elian Gonzalez
in the United States was championed by Miami's Cuban exile
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should get an Elian Gonzalez here,'' said the
president of the Bahamas Christian Council. ``That would change
things. The policy of the Americans would change. The duplicitous
approach America has taken towards Cubans and Haitians is
obvious.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, the pastor of a Haitian congregation in Nassau said he
did not wish to see more of his countrymen attempt the dangerous
voyage that often ends in death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem in Haiti is they have no jobs,'' said Henri
Cher-Amie, the pastor of the Calvary Haitian Baptist Church. ``I
talk to some guys who have the boats, and I tell them to be careful
not to give people hope, that when they come to the Bahamas it will
be wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, as the last of the Haitians slowly walked off
the ship to buses and vans that would take them to detention
centers, the scene at dockside had a surreal flavor. As the
Haitians filed silently down the gangplank, a party boat filled
with wobbly revelers drinking and dancing to ``La Bamba'' bobbed in
the nearby waters. Elsewhere, in the shadow of the huge cruise
ships, tourists went about buying trinkets, taking pictures and
having their hair braided. Hardly any of them noticed the Haitians
boarding the buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you enjoy your cruise?'' echoed the voice of a DJ as the
party boat pulled in behind the vessel that had brought the
Haitians to Nassau. ``Did you have a good time?''
</P>
<P>
   A few Haitians craned their necks to look. But most stared
straight ahead as the buses began to leave the dockside. Though
they did not understand English, they understood the question was
not meant for them.

HERSHISER HAS ACCEPTED ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ That's Orel Hershiser, reliever. If it takes some
getting used to, that's understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser has been in the major leagues for 17 years, and nearly
all of them as a starting pitcher of note.
</P>
<P>
   But at 41, he signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers to join the
bullpen. And after three early-season starts, he now finds himself
a full member of the bullpen for the first time since he earned a
spot in the Dodgers rotation in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   If it takes some adjusting, Hershiser downplays it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no different,'' Hershiser said. ``I just come to the
ballpark. I'm just kind of hoping and waiting for an opportunity.
That's my role now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with it. I'm fine. It's what I prepared to do.
I'm not taken back. Why does it have to be a big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Friday's game against the Marlins, Hershiser had made
only one appearance as a reliever _ his first since 1989. His role
in the bullpen, however, is undefined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to figure that out right now,'' said Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson. ``But I wouldn't hesitate to put him back as
a starter.''
</P>
<P>
   __ New Hispanic marketing firm: The Dodgers have gone outside in
an attempt to improve their reach to the Hispanic community,
announcing an agreement with Alternative and Innovative Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Dodgers hired Kris Rone to head their
marketing department, renaming the position executive vice
president. Rone is fourth in the organizational structure, behind
only chairman Bob Daly, president Bob Graziano and general manager
Kevin Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams have gone to an in-house representative, but
because the Hispanic community is such a big part of our marketing
plan in Los Angeles, we decided it would be best to hire a firm
that is an expert in this field,'' Rone said.
</P>
<P>
   AIM has contracted with the Dodgers for specific projects in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hundley hot: Catcher Todd Hundley, who suffered through a
disappointing first season with the Dodgers both at the plate and
behind it, returned home the team's hottest hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley, who was recovering from elbow surgery last year,
returned to Dodger Stadium on Friday 11 for 25 in his past seven
games, with three home runs and six RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm healthy and everything feels good,'' Hundley said. ``Just
trying to win some games.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley knew he would be watched closely this season, but he
claims no special pleasure if his hot start has deflected
criticism: ``I don't really give a (hoot) to tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Olson watch: Right-handed Gregg Olson (forearm strain) has
been eligible to come off the disabled list for the past two weeks,
but manager Davey Johnson said he was uncertain when the reliever
would be activated.

   ``He's had a couple of decent side works, but he's not really
where he was when we broke camp,'' Johnson said. ``I think I'd
still like to see him a pitch couple of (minor-league) games to
make sure he's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said it was undetermined when Olson might make a rehab
appearance.

   __ Short hops: Team vice president Tommy Lasorda was interviewed
by Bill Bavasi and Bob Watson last week for the U.S. Olympic
manager's position. Lasorda is favored to get the nod, but an
announcement is not expected until Monday at the earliest. . . .
Bullpen coach Rick Dempsey, who was fined $1,000 and suspended for
18 games last year for his part in a brawl with the Mariners, on
Tigers coach Juan Samuel getting suspended for 15 games for
throwing punches against the White Sox: ``I got 18 games and I
didn't hit anybody. I just knocked somebody down. But I'm
satisfied.''

SCHOENEWEIS KEEPS PRIORITIES IN FOCUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calilf. _ Scott Schoeneweis is in a groove, so please,
please, don't disrupt him.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed pitcher doesn't want to know that he's tied for
the American League lead in victories with four, or that he ranks
eighth in the league in ERA (3.15), or that he's fourth in innings
pitched (34 innings).
</P>
<P>
   Opposing batters are hitting .222 against Schoeneweis this
season, and he wants to keep it that way. And the only way he feels
he can remains on this roll is to look straight ahead and don't get
distracted. Don't change a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stay focused and not get carried away,'' he said.
``I don't read the sports section. I read the money section and the
front page.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis' attitude is the same when he's on the mound _ look
straight ahead, focus, execute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is really impressing me with his ability to stick
with his game plan,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``He's not afraid
to throw his fastball in, he uses both sides of the plate real
well, he changes speeds and he uses his slider effectively. He has
tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Schoeneweis is afraid this is a dream, and he doesn't want
to wake up.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Angels) put a lot of faith in me,'' he said. ``They went
out on the line for me. I'm glad I could return the favor.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Then again: On the other end of the spectrum is Ramon Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz has better stuff than Schoeneweis but is more likely to
lose focus on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to let his emotins be his ally,'' Scioscia said.
``When he does that, he'll take huge steps quickly. He's shown
better stuff than the results (1-2, 5.06 ERA) would indicate. But
he's not going to reach the level we all want him to reach until he
can bottle those emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher is expected to join the rotation in less than two
weeks, and someone will have to go to make room for him. If Ortiz
is the odd man out, he'll be headed back to the minors, not to the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The bullpen) is not an option,'' Scioscia said. ``He's been
trained as a starter, and we don't want to mess with his shoulder
(small cartilage tear).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Controlled arguing: So far, Scioscia has not been shy about
leaving the dugout to argue with umpires. However, the discussions
have been tame. Scioscia hasn't gone nose-to-nose with an ump yet,
like his former manager Tommy Lasorda often did.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be times when it's more heated than others,
it depends on how bad the play was,'' Scioscia said. ``For the most
part, you want to be rational. Certainly, you're going to have
flare ups with umps, that's inevitable. But the nature of my
position is to fight for the 25 guys. I can't worry about the
feelings of an umpire.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Numbers game: Darin Erstad's 44 hits in April (going into
Friday's game) are an American League record. The previous record
of 43 hits was set in 1998 by Kansas City's Hal Morris. The
major-league record for hits in April is 47, set in 1998 by
Colorado's Dante Bichette.

STARS DOMINATE SHARKS BEHIND ZUBOV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Sharks forward Vincent Damphousse didn't know what to
say.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly does one say after being absolutely flattened?
</P>
<P>
   Damphousse decided to go with your generic: ``We know we played
poorly. It was our worst effort in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars didn't merely win the first game of their second-round
series against San Jose last night at Reunion Arena. They took the
fight right out of the Sharks' mouths with a 4-0 victory that put
them up 1-0 in their best-of-seven series, with Game 2 not coming
near fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   After you play a game as the Stars did in Game 1, you want to
get back on the ice as soon as possible. Especially with defenseman
Sergei Zubov back.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Zubov, who didn't play in the first round because
of a knee injury, helped turn what had been a pretty good Stars
bunch in the first round to the group that looks as though a return
trip to the Western Conference Finals might be only a sweep away.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' 2-for-26 power play of the first round contributed
two goals last night. Welcome back, Sergei. The Stars held the
Sharks scoreless, and basically shotless, on their six power plays.
Welcome back, Sergei.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really seems to make the real easy play,'' Stars center
Mike Modano said of Zubov, who assisted on both Stars power-play
goals. ``We weren't going to sit and wait to see if they were going
to play or not. We wanted to get our game out and dictate the
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, playing their first game since closing out Edmonton a
week ago, did exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   What worked for them against Edmonton _ Modano, the defensive
pair of Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk and goalie Ed Belfour
_ worked once again in Game 1. What didn't work against Edmonton _
the power play and Joe Nieuwendyk _ started working in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I was happy about is we got some good efforts from
all 12 forwards,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``That's what
gave us good play today. We didn't have any weak players up
front.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk, the playoff MVP a year ago, scored his first goal of
this year's playoffs at 2:48 of the third period. The Stars have
scored 18 goals in the playoffs. They've had 13 goal scorers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been spread out, which is good,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``I
think that's a big key for our club.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk's goal, which was followed not too long after by
another from Brenden Morrow, put the stamp on a result that was
sealed early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Goals by Aaron Gavey (his first this playoffs) and Modano (his
third) gave the Stars a 2-0 lead after the first period. The Sharks
started out bad only to watch it get worse. The one flurry of
honest-to-goodness chances San Jose had at the beginning of the
second period amounted to nothing but frustration.
</P>
<P>
   What Belfour didn't stop, the Sharks flat-out missed.
</P>
<P>
   There were blown two-on-ones. There were missed empty nets. And,
yes, there were Belfour saves. He finished with 18 in all for his
ninth career playoff shutout, his second this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that was the difference there,'' Sharks winger Todd
Harvey said of the failed beginning to the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Said Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor: ``We gave them life, and we
had to try to take it back again.''
</P>
<P>
   They did. What does it say for the Sharks when their best play
of the night came from defenseman Bryan Marchment. He made an
diving save on a Guy Carbonneau shot at an empty net at 15:27 of
the second period, but Marchment should never outshine players such
as Sharks captain Owen Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   He did. Nolan was not a factor, in large part because Hatcher
and Matvichuk wouldn't let him be.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever life the Sharks had left, the Stars' penalty-killing
unit sucked out. The Sharks were 0-for-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think that disheartened them,'' Hatcher said
before adding a big but ... ``I don't think either team played
their best game. I don't think they played their best game. And I
know we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars say they can get better.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks know they have to or they can forget another Game 7,
like they won against St. Louis on Tuesday. They won't make it to
No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had put up a little bit more tonight,'' Sharks coach
Darryl Sutter said after the game, ``but I know we will.''
</P>
<P>
   He took the words right out of the Stars' mouths. They all saw
the St. Louis series, and those who didn't have been reminded. The
Sharks looked like the worst team in the world losing to the Blues
in Game 6 only to win Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all realize it is going to get tougher,'' Nieuwendyk said.
``They are going to be a better team in Game 2.'' nn

NOTHSTEIN GETS WIN IN HEATED MEN'S MATCH SPRINTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRISCO, Texas _ Tempers flared during the best-of-three men's
match sprint semifinal between Marty Nothstein and Jeff Labauve at
last night's U.S. Olympic Team Trials for Track Cycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my semifinal ride, I rode the first one real aggressive _
easily beat Labauve,'' Nothstein said. ``In the second one, I was
just basically saving energy and made it close. He made a few
comments, and a little bit of rage took over. I wanted it take it
out in the final ride and make a statement, and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Labauve: Don't expect any favors from Jeff Solt in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   Solt endured Nothstein's wrath later during the evening's
best-of-three final, and the United States' elite sprinter swept
his opponent in dominating fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein extended his hand toward Labauve after his semifinal
victory while the two circled the 250-meter oval. Labauve refused
to part with a handshake, and the two exchanged words while on the
track.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein declined to reveal Labauve's choice of words, but he
remained peeved after his triumph against Solt in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made one \Rstatement\S that was pretty bad, and I remember
for a long time,'' said Nothstein, who won the silver medal in the
event during the 1996 Atlanta Games. ``It happens, though. You try
to win like a champion and lose like a champion. I've been racing
at the highest level for the last seven years, and he's yet to even
reach that level.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just basically treaded on some thin ice at that point, but
I was mad at myself for falling into it and wasting the energy
doing it, to be honest with you. I shouldn't even do that. I'm
above that. I've got bigger things to come, but you guys are all
loving this.''
</P>
<P>
   No such fireworks erupted during the women's match sprints.
</P>
<P>
   Tanya Lindenmuth swept the best-of-three final from Jennie Reed
in methodical fashion as they head toward the July 7 selection
date.
</P>
<P>
   Only three Olympic Team berths exist for the four women's track
cycling events at the 2000 Sydney Games. Most expect Chris Witty to
represent the United States in the 500-meter time trial, and Erin
Veenstra-Mirabella _ probably this country's best track endurance
rider _ remains the favorite to compete in the individual
3,000-meter pursuit and points race.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Lindenmuth and Reed jockeying for what likely will
be the one sprint position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely an important win,'' Lindenmuth said. ``It's
2000. My goal was that I needed to make the top two here. I
accomplished that, but I wanted to race well and prove to myself
that I could race well, be patient and be confident. I did that in
all of my events. I was patient, and I was alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, their battle remains far from over. Their
performances during upcoming World Cup events in Moscow; Cali,
Columbia; and Mexico City will bear significance and should ensure
a fight to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we're both here, I think it definitely will be,''
Lindenmuth said. ``We're 1 and 2 right now. We're right where we're
supposed to be, and on any given day, it could be her or it could
be me. This might sound stupid, but it could just depend on how the
sun or moon is.''

NOTHSTEIN GOING FOR THE GOLD AND NOTHING LESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRISCO, Texas _ He has changed his workout routine. He has
juggled his coaches. He has altered his diet.
</P>
<P>
   He has taken a little from his old coaches, plus something from
his new ones, and hammered together the golden game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go into Sydney with no excuses,'' Marty Nothstein,
America's best sprint cyclist, said yesterday under the Frisco sun.
``That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been to the Olympics. Second place, match sprint, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Though his wife, Christi, has the silver medal proudly displayed
in the family foyer, you get the feeling that Nothstein grimaces
every time he passes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty does not like to lose,'' said Des Dickie, who will coach
the U.S. sprint cyclists in the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   And so Nothstein trains. He shows up in Texas in the middle of
April to spend time with Dickie, the new U.S. coach, to learn his
methods, to learn about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the year,'' said Nothstein, who is 29. ``I don't know
how many more chances I'll get after this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can make the Olympic team in 2004, but I don't want
to just make teams. I want to win medals.''
</P>
<P>
   Medals, he has by the dozens. But first, the rock story.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 14, growing up in Trexlertown, Pa., Nothstein and
his kid brother were nabbed throwing stones at a neighbor's house.
The neighbor, a gentleman named Heinz Walter, whose name is now
part of cycling folklore, issued young Marty a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Why don't you take all that energy down to the local velodrome
and make something of yourself?
</P>
<P>
   Well, how's he doing, Heinz?
</P>
<P>
   In Italy in 1994, Nothstein became the first male American
sprint cyclist in 82 years to win a world championship. Two days
later, he added a gold medal in the Keirin event and became the
only U.S. cyclist ever to win two world titles in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Nothstein has won three golds and seven overall medals
in the world championships, plus a record 19 U.S. titles on the
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty,'' Dickie noted, ``is motivated by success. If he is
there, he wants to succeed. He will not put his bike on the line if
he doesn't think he is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to be ready in Sydney not once, but twice. In
addition to the match sprint, Nothstein will be among the favorites
in the Keirin, a mass-start sprint where the cyclists are paced by
a motorcycle until the final two laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal all along has been to go down to Sydney and win a gold
medal,'' Nothstein said. ``I plan on going down there and
accomplishing my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   He talks the same way that he rides a bicycle, riding the thin
edge between arrogance and self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   After a less-than-bountiful medal harvest by the U.S. cyclists
at the Atlanta Olympics, Nothstein will be one of the ones on all
the magazine covers and at the head of all the medal-hopefuls
lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' he said at yesterday's U.S. Olympic Trials at
the Superdrome. ``I like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the load. I want to be the guy who's expected to win. I
can race well under pressure. I wouldn't even call it pressure. I
know what I can do, and I know I can win. And as long as you guys
think I can, too, well, we're all on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-2 and 215 pounds, Nothstein has the prototype modern
body for his side of the sport. But his racing savvy, born of 11
years of racing at a world-class level, makes him unlikely to lose
on a U.S. track.
</P>
<P>
   With first place in yesterday's match sprint under his belt,
Nothstein will ride today in a special Trials event designed only
to see him break the Superdrome record for one lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan on demolishing it, to put it bluntly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks ahead, Nothstein plans to compete at World Cup
events in Colombia, Mexico and Italy, before shifting into one
final gear for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the guy _ we know that, everyone knows that,'' U.S. coach
Dickie said. ``He's won the worlds, and he's kept in the top five
riders in the world. And at that level, on any given day, any of
those guys can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Nothstein knows, the magazines will be calling. Soon,
he'll be branded as America's great golden cycling hope.
</P>
<P>
   Bring it on, said Marty Nothstein, who was in a league of his
own at these Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned, Mr. Heinz Walter.

STARS REMAIN WARY OF TOOTHLESS SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Derian Hatcher stood in a corner of the Dallas Stars'
locker room and, being a proper gentleman and a professional
athlete, wise in the ways of bulletin board fodder, did everything
he could not to state the obvious after Friday night's shockingly
easy 4-0 victory over San Jose at Reunion Arena to open the second
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So allow me to do the honors: The Sharks have turned into
guppies.
</P>
<P>
   Past experience and the Sharks' stunning seven-game upset of the
No. 1 seeded Blues, had us expecting the reincarnation of ``Jaws'',
complete with double rows of dagger-like teeth, and renowned ax
murderer Bryan Marchment as an added bonus.
</P>
<P>
   What we got instead was ``Flipper'' and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Would you guys like to drop back by Sunday for more punch and
cookies?
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher, asked if he was surprised by how unphysical this game
was, frowned and sidestepped the question as neatly as he did most
of the Sharks' would-be hits Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want to answer that right now,'' Hatcher all
but whispered after most of the media crowd around his locker had
thinned out. ``Honestly, I thought both teams were flat tonight. I
look for both teams to get better and I can just about guarantee
it's going to get more physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, a wise man. Because these certainly weren't the
Sharks we've come to know and hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we didn't get their best game tonight,'' Hatcher
added, ``but we're ready for it when it comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Sharks were chippy, as usual. There was the normal
amount of post-play slaps and shoves, sniping and insults. But the
Stars kept their composure and the Sharks never unleashed the
physical game we were absolutely sure they'd put on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at times they really tried to run around and finish
hits,'' Stars forward Scott Thornton said, ``but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   All you need to know about this game is that the Stars outhit
the Sharks, 38-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked a little hesitant,'' Sharks center Vincent
Damphousse admitted. ``We didn't do what we did against St.
Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   With Sergei Zubov back leading the power play, the Stars got
first-period goals from Aaron Gavey and Mike Modano and two more in
the third from Joe Nieuwendyk and linemate Thornton; but strangely,
the game actually turned in the second period, when neither team
scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had five great chances in the second period and missed
them,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock pointed out. ``And they failed on
three odd-man rushes that could have turned the game around.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with Eddie Belfour playing perhaps his finest game ever
against the Sharks _ which isn't necessarily saying much, because
he has never played particularly well either for or against them _
the Stars held their 2-0 advantage and then blew the listless
Sharks out in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our missed chances were more important than anything to do
with their 2-0 lead,'' San Jose coach Darryl Sutter said. ``We had
four quality chances we didn't hit the net on. We were emotionally
flat and it probably showed up in the execution part of those
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Execution isn't the Sharks' trademark, though. They're not known
for precision passing, or a great offense or a shutdown defense,
though they can do all those things well enough. But their game is
beating the hell out of the other team.
</P>
<P>
   That never came close to happening Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play as physical as we wanted to,'' Sharks center
Mike Ricci said, ``and that's why we didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did their occasional cheap shot _ Marchment, being
Marchment, took a stupid penalty by cross-checking Brenden Morrow
in the back late in the third period _ lure the Stars into
retaliation, which was the key to the Sharks' upset of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've learned a lot the last two years,'' Guy
Carbonneau said. ``You look at two years ago when we lost to
Detroit in the playoffs, we kind of got rattled a little bit and
took bad penalties. Last year we really made a commitment to play
aggressive in trying to keep our cool. I think we learned really
well from that and you're seeing the same thing this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edmonton came really hard at us (in the first round). We gave
our hits and we took our hits but we didn't lose our cool. You look
at what St. Louis did and they took bad penalties at bad times.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Sutter said, is why it's one thing to beat the
regular-season champs, a distinction the Blues earned this year,
and another to go up against the defending Stanley Cup champs,
especially when that team has had a full week to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to do with the team that was fresher than the other,''
Sutter said, a lame excuse, since the Sharks themselves had almost
three full days to rest after wrapping up their series with the
Blues on Tuesday. But that's Sutter, a man known for his fine
whines.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks showed up as the all-you-can eat catfish special
Friday night, but they've been on that platter before and lived to
tell about it. Hatcher's right.
</P>
<P>
   From this point, it's going to get worse before it gets better.

STARS' ZUBOV MAKES PRESENCE FELT ON POWER PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It took the Stars about 15 seconds to feel the
difference on their power play between Sergei Zubov playing or
watching.
</P>
<P>
   With San Jose's Todd Harvey serving a penalty in the first
period, Zubov settled the puck behind the net and moved up ice,
where he zipped a pass to Brett Hull into the San Jose zone and
left Sharks winger Jeff Friesen frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Hull slapped a pass to an open Zubov near the goal line, where
his shot was deflected by Sharks goalie Steve Shields to a even
more open Mike Modano, who promptly pumped in the shot for a
two-goal lead at 14:01.
</P>
<P>
   Good night, San Jose. Hello, power play and hello Sergei Zubov.
</P>
<P>
   In their 4-0 victory against the Sharks in Game 1 of their
second-round series last night at Reunion Arena, the Stars' special
teams were indeed special with their quarterback at the helm after
missing the past 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just looked like the same guy who left us in Florida,''
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``The wilder the game gets the
better he plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Zubov, who last month signed a five-year, $25 million contract
and was having one of his best seasons, had been teetering on the
day-to-day routine after suffering a collateral]partially torn
ligament in his right knee at Florida on March 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one, he's a great defenseman, and any time you get a
player of his caliber it's going to help,'' Stars defenseman Derian
Hatcher said. ``There's not many guys in the league who can do what
he did with the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' power play last night matched the number of goals it
scored in the entire first-round series against Edmonton. The Stars
were 2-for-26 against the Oilers. They are 2-for-7 against the
Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy who has been out as long as he's been, I thought he
stepped in and did a great job for us,'' said Stars center Joe
Nieuwendyk, who scored his first goal of this year's playoffs on a
Zubov-led power play. ``He moves the puck very nicely and really
opens up a lot on the power play. He's probably a big reason why we
had a couple goals on the power play.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty much their power play,'' Sharks defenseman Mike
Rathje said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Stars grabbed a 2-0 lead in the first period thank to
Zubov's set up, they stretched their lead to 3-0 on Nieuwendyk's
power-play backhander past Shields. The assists? Jamie
Langenbrunner and Zubov.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he was huge in the power play,'' Sharks coach
Darryl Sutter said. ``He's a part of their transition game, moving
the puck. You're talking about one of the top puck movers in the
game; you put him back in the lineup, it makes a huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the power play where his difference was felt.
</P>
<P>
   With Hitchcock remaining true to his word that Zubov would play
as much as needed, Hatcher and Darryl Sydor saw their load decrease
with Zubov's return. He played 17 minutes and 22 seconds in 22
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely nice,'' Hatcher said. ``I have no idea what I
played tonight, but it's definitely nice not playing so much. \RMy
body\S feels like I played way less tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. After averaging nearly 29 minutes of ice time against
the Oilers in Round 1, Hatcher played 25:35 last night.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov also saw some action on the Stars' penalty kill that shut
down the Sharks unit to 0-for-6.
</P>
<P>
   So, now the Sharks are faced with the question of trying to
contain Zubov, who probably isn't in his top playing condition.
</P>
<P>
   What should they do?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess all you have to do is to try to keep the puck away
from him,'' Stars center Scott Thornton said. ``That's the best you
can do.''

SHARKS LOOKING FOR HITS

<P>
   DALLAS _ Sharks captain Owen Nolan didn't make an appearance for
the media after last night's 4-0 loss. Maybe because he spent much
of the game wearing a bullseye on his sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were keying on Nolan, no question. That was expected,''
said Vincent Damphousse, Sharks center and Nolan's linemate. ``Now,
we have to bump some of their players.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, Nolan ran face first into a Scott Thornton
elbow that sent him sprawling to the ice spilling blood. Early in
the second period, Nolan was swatted on the wrists with a stick. He
dropped his stick and headed to the bench slumped over.
</P>
<P>
   Neither occurrence kept Nolan, who had four shots, out of the
game. Nolan didn't practice Thursday and was smarting from blocking
an Al MacInnis slap shot in Game 7 against St. Louis, said Sharks
coach Darryl Sutter. Sutter said Nolan was a game-time decision and
that Nolan made the call to play. So, is Nolan hurting?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was obvious,'' Sutter said. \Nsubheds:Special teams
The Sharks entered Game 1 with the worst penalty-killing unit of
the eight remaining playoff teams at 79.5 percent. After giving up
two last night, they have allowed 10 goals on 46 power plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do better on the power play,'' Mike Ricci said.
``We lost that battle along with a lot of other battles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks were 0-for-6 on their power play and managed only two
shots through the first four power plays. \Nsubheds:That first goal
The Sharks know how important getting the first goal is. In their
past five games against the Blues, the team that scored first won.
Against Dallas, the point of scoring first is magnified.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Sharks spotted the Stars a 2-0 first-period lead
and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get a lead and they just literally frustrate you and kill
you in the neutral \Rzone\S,'' Sharks coach Darryl Sutter said.
``And then after \Rthe game\S people wonder what's wrong or what
happened. Well, that's what happened, they literally shut you
down.'' \Nsubheds:Little battles Thursday, coach Darryl Sutter said
you hope to learn how important winning the battle of the
intangibles, such as faceoffs, is in the playoffs. Last night, the
Stars won 60 percent of their faceoffs and seemed to win every big
faceoff in their own zone. \Nsubheds:Light night for Marchment The
Sharks' Bryant Marchment logged nearly 22 minutes of ice time but
landed only two hits. In the second period, he dived toward the
crease and deflected a Guy Carbonneau puck that was headed for the
back of an open net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just diving for the puck,'' Marchment said. ``I was
trying to protect the goal. I didn't know where I was.''
\Nsubheds:Time to step up Coach Darryl Sutter called a 15-minute
meeting after the game. Afterward, several Sharks admitted they did
not appear ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to refocus,'' defenseman Mike Rathje said. ``Our
second and third lines have to step up and do like they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Marchment agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a great hockey club, but we didn't play with any
sense of urgency,'' he said. ``But we have to be ready to play
teams like them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuses. This is the playoffs, so if we have to
come ready to play well.''

LONG LAYOFF, BUT NEVER A DULL MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Has this been fun, or what?
</P>
<P>
   I take back any criticism about the NBA's craven pandering to TV
interests with its postseason scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   By putting almost an entire off-season between the second and
third games of the playoff series between the Jazz and Sonics to
help boost pathetic ratings, the NBA inadvertently exposed us in
Seattle to some delightful hijinks.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the source of the sillies was a sort of tribute to a
TV movie Monday about the Three Stooges. The last few days around
the Sonics have often seemed like one giant shouting match, wherein
each participant began with Moe's favorite threat: ``Why, I oughta
... ''
</P>
<P>
   But, really, this is the same old Sonics in the spring. It just
that when George Karl, Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp were going
haywire before our eyes, there was only one off-day between games.
</P>
<P>
   Now with so much free time _ the U.S. took Panama, Grenada,
Kuwait and Elian Gonzalez combined in less time than the NBA took
to get to Game 3 _ the spilling of bile, venting of gas and
wringing of hands has become an Oprah mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you old enough to remember, the Sonics lost the
first two games of this series _ not atypical for a seventh seed
against a second seed _ in a sufficiently desultory fashion that we
journalists have been inspired to tell basketball players and
coaches how to do basketball.
</P>
<P>
   In kind, basketball players and coaches have been inspired to
tell journalists how to do journalism.
</P>
<P>
   This has been great stuff, because both sides know so much about
what they are talking about.
</P>
<P>
   The pinnacle was reached earlier this week, when coach Paul
Westphal was in print and on radio and TV berating media members
for what they were saying. At the same time, the NBA was fining
Payton and the Sonics a combined $35,000 for what he (begin italic)
didn't (end italic) say, and reserve Chuck Person was blaming the
media exclusively for the defeats in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the mini-off-season, words, not jump shots, have
become the coin of this wonderfully absurd new NBA realm. That's
bad news for the jocks, because in this game, we hacks finally can
post them up and deal on them.
</P>
<P>
   As you may have read this week, Payton has demanded control of
the ball while abdicating his responsibilities as leader and
captain.
</P>
<P>
   After practice Wednesday, he said in regards to motivating
teammates that he ``ain't talking to nobody ... tell (Westphal and
Wally Walker) to talk to Vin (Baker). I'm going to talk to myself.
And that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast those selfless remarks with Payton's words in the P-I
Nov. 4, when he talked about how much more he liked his new
teammates than his old ones:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got guys who don't want to communicate with you
and walk off to the side, you think he's got an attitude about
something because you didn't pass the ball to him, or he didn't get
enough playing time,'' Payton said. ``It's crazy. You go into the
locker room and you feel that. A lot of us didn't get along. We
weren't hanging out. Now, about eight or nine of us hang out every
day. We like each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunno if these guys are still hanging out, but there's no doubt
it's Payton who has walked into the corner with an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Simon described it best: Still crazy after all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the momentary state of Payton's affections, it matters
less Saturday because the NBA plans to interrupt this rhetorical
gluttony with an actual game. And if the Sonics win, there will be
only three off-days to discuss it until Game 4 here Wednesday. With
time so tight, the Sonics and the media will be in the market to
hire that speed talker from the old Federal Express TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't fashionable to entertain a notion of a Sonics triumph,
not with the prospective hiring of Lenny Wilkens to replace
Westphal and/or Walker and/or both as Topic A at the water cooler.
</P>
<P>
   But the facts are that the Jazz historically have been lame on
the postseason road _ 23-58, or .283, including a 3-6 record in
Seattle _ and the fury in the Sonics camp could burn an entire
container ship's worth of adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those factors are sufficient for a team that has lost 13
of its past 18 games and wrenched through two new starting lineups
is dubious. But since that makes no sense for the Sonics, it would
seem likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   And if it happens Saturday, it can happen Wednesday. Two home
victories won't mean that the franchise is any less screwed up
long-term, but they will add greatly to the confusion and
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Logic, linear thinking and enlightenment have never been parts
of this Sonics team, nor any Sonics team in the past several years.
Those characteristics are the property of the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But because this stretched-out series has way more time for talk
than walk, the wise money says to doom the broom.
</P>
<P>
   Never has an NBA team been better equipped to chat its way out
of an 0-2 hole.

SKINNER CAPTURES POLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Forgive Mike Skinner if he's not too excited
about taking his third career NASCAR Winston Cup pole Friday. It's
just that the Ontario native, who has yet to win a race, has been
here before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If omens mean anything, then maybe our chances are getting
better of winning our first race,'' Skinner said after qualifying
No. 1 Friday for Sunday's NAPA Auto Parts 500 at California
Speedway. ``But the biggest thing we've got to work on is getting
this car to drive good (in the race). That's going to better our
chances (of winning) more then a good qualifying spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, who finished second in the DieHard 500 at Talladega,
Ala., two weeks ago, circled the two-mile oval at a track-record
186.061 mph. Jimmy Spencer was second at 185.979 mph with Ricky
Rudd third at 185.830.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lap was good, but it wasn't a perfect lap,'' Skinner said.
``The car pushed a little bit (at the start of the lap). If I had
got good and straight off the corners, I would say it was an
awesome lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just tried to focus on hitting our marks. I really didn't
have a lot of confidence in that lap standing up. I was a little
surprised that it held up, but I will take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, whose last pole came in 1994, nearly slipped by
Spencer, but the veteran scrubbed off too much speed heading into
the tri-oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get that close to the pole, you're a little upset
because naturally you want to be on the pole,'' Spencer said. ``We
got a little bit too loose in (turns) three and four, so that hurt
us a little bit. That little bit cost us the pole, but man, this
year we've been worrying about if we were gonna make the races, so
to start second is a pretty big accomplishment for (our) team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goals were to try to be in the top 25. That's very
important for practice and for the race, so being second is pretty
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Former CART veteran Scott Pruett, who qualified second at Las
Vegas and third at Texas, topped the rookie qualifiers with a
185.204 mph circuit, which was good enough for sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The . . . car ran well,'' said Pruett, who hasn't finished
higher then 19th this season. ``We weren't sure if we were headed
in the right direction, but as it turned out, it looks like
everything worked out all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Darrell Waltrip, who is retiring at the end of the 2000
season, had his best qualifying attempt of the season. The former
Winston Cup champion will start seventh following a lap of 185.014
mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give me those provisional (starts) and it seems every
time we use them up, that's when we go to work,'' Waltrip said.
``That was a great run for us. I think this team is coming around.
Now I've got to put the `V' in our Victory Tour somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Notables who failed to qualify were Jeff Gordon (26th), Tony
Stewart (31st) and Dale Earnhardt (36th). They can either make an
attempt during second-round qualifying this morning or stand on
their time.

SHENG, DOUBLES TEAM ADVANCE TO SEMIS

<TEXT>
<P>
   OJAI, Calif. _ Only three are left standing.
</P>
<P>
   Thousand Oaks' Phil Sheng and the Harvard-Westlake doubles team
of Prakash Amritraj and David Frankel survived tough competition to
advance to the semifinals of the 100th Ojai Tournament today at the
Thacher School.
</P>
<P>
   The finals are scheduled for 2 p.m. at Libbey Park.
</P>
<P>
   Sheng, the No. 1 seed, won a tough three-set match over Rio
Mesa's Quinn Borchard 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 and will be playing Claremont's
Daniel Clemens at 8 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a huge first serve, then he just wins the game just
like that. I had to work twice as hard to win this game and that
was the difference of the first set,'' Sheng said of the only set
he's lost in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reads (the shot) so well and is really quick at the net. I
give him credit. He made me have to go for the bigger passing shot.
I returned it really well when he served and volleyed to me, but I
give him credit. He had some unbelievable volleys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines gave up only four games in their quarterfinal
match, in which they beat Beverly Hills' Raymond Hekmat and David
Nguyen 6-4, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   They face Bakersfield's Bryan Mercado and Jordan Widelock at
Thacher today at 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tough losses: Harvard-Westlake's Andrew Rosenfeld led 5-1 in
the first set against Daniel Clemens of Claremont. After that, it
was all Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld hit a couple of double faults and Clemens gained
enough momentum to break Rosenfeld's next serve to turn the match
around and beat him 7-6 (9-7), 3-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Crespi's Stephen Amritraj lost to Rio Mesa's Borchard 6-7 (7-0),
7-5, 6-3 in the quarters, and Burbank's Tigran Martiroysan lost to
Jason Kao 7-5, 7-5 of Sunny Hills.

 SOX-INDIANS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Apres le deluge last weekend in Boston, the Red
Sox-Indians rivalry was revived Friday night at Jacobs Field, where
the Sox were last seen drenched not by rain, but by champagne.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Game 5 of the American League division series, which
became the stuff of legend, Jimy Williams could not wave in Pedro
Martinez from the bullpen to silence Cleveland bats, and this time,
when Troy O'Leary came up against Indians reliever Paul Shuey with
the game still hanging in the balance, his drive died in David
Justice's glove.
</P>
<P>
   With much less at stake than the last time they met, the Indians
defeated the Sox, 4-3, before a crowd of 42,885 relieved that the
Cleveland bullpen threw three shutout innings after being so
pitiful in the last three games of the postseason last October,
when the Sox outscored the Tribe, 44-18.
</P>
<P>
   Message game? ``No,'' said Indians starter Dave Burba, who was
trailing, 3-1, until the Indians rallied for three runs in the
bottom of the sixth against Sox lefthanders Pete Schourek and Rheal
Cormier. ``A message game would be 20-2, like they did to us last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Burba was referring to the 23-7 beating the Sox laid on the
Indians in Game 4 last October, the night before O'Leary hit a
three-run home run off Shuey to break an 8-all tie and send the Sox
to a 12-8 clinching win in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, with the Indians clinging to a one-run lead,
Shuey, the fourth Indians pitcher, faced O'Leary leading off the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I thought about the last pitch I threw him,'' Shuey
said. ``This was a real similar deal. I almost threw the same
pitch. This one was a little higher and farther out, and he just
wasn't able to pull it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary was able, however, to put a good swing on the ball,
launching a deep drive into the left-center-field gap. But Justice,
never breaking stride and ignoring center fielder Jacob Cruz as he
arrived on the scene, made a tough backhanded catch just before the
ball reached the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He killed me there,'' O'Leary said. ``He made a great play.
But that's what he's out there for.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's sense of recall Friday night needed a little prodding.
Asked if he was thinking about the last time he faced Shuey, his
face went blank and he said, ``What did I do?'' A split-second
later, when it came back to him, he shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was last year,'' he said. ``This year, you forget it
and try to win a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's a great team over there. My God, every time you
look up, there's (Jim) Thome, (Robbie and Sandy) Alomar, Justice.
And (Travis) Fryman, he's not as big a name, but he's dangerous,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had taken a 1-0 lead on Trot Nixon's double and a single
by Nomar Garciaparra, who all but threw his bat at a low and
outside pitch and golfed the ball into left field, extending his
hitting streak to 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   But after Fryman's leadoff home run in the fourth tied the
score, the Sox took the lead in the fifth when Burba walked Nixon
and Brian Daubach, and Garciaparra beat out a chopper to short to
load the bases for O'Leary, who in Game 5 a year ago hit a grand
slam off Charles Nagy.
</P>
<P>
   Against Burba, O'Leary hit a drive to the right-field track for
a sacrifice fly that brought home one run, and Carl Everett's bloop
single to center scored another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was blowing in,'' O'Leary said. ``Later on in the
summer, that ball might have gone out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians broke through in the sixth against Schourek and
Cormier to seize the lead. Schourek, who had allowed just three
hits in the first five innings, gave up a ground-rule double to
Fryman and singles by Robbie Alomar and Manny Ramirez to make it
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Williams summoned lefthander Cormier to face Justice, who
whacked a single to right, tying the score, and sending Ramirez to
third when Nixon's throw to the plate bounced away from catcher
Scott Hatteberg for an error. Richie Sexson flied to shallow center
for the second out, but Thome, who came into the game 0 for 13
against lefthanders, lined a single to right against his ex-hunting
buddy for the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this was one I let slip away,'' said Schourek, who
has now made four starts in which he has allowed three runs or
fewer but has only a 1-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lead halfway through the game,'' he said, ``and didn't
do enough stuff to hold them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cormier had not allowed a hit to a lefthanded batter until
Justice and Thome delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have some tough hitters over there,'' Williams said.
``They put some good at-bats on us that one inning.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the rivalry returns. It'll be Ramon Martinez vs. Chuck
Finley Saturday, with Pedro waiting in the wings for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's emotion there,'' Shuey said. ``We want to beat those
guys. They embarrassed us last year.''
</P>

LAWYER FIRES AT IMMIGRANTS, AND 5 PEOPLE ARE KILLED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (Moves reference to Baumhammers being white from lede to 4th graf;
ADDS father's occupation in 3rd graf ;  ADDS that 1st victim was
next door neighbor in 10th graf; ADDS 2 grafs at end with sister's
reaction)  
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A immigration lawyer went on a shooting spree on the outskirts
of Pittsburgh Friday afternoon, killing five people, including a
Jewish woman, two Asian men, one Indian and one black man and
critically injuring a sixth, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, identified by the police as Richard Baumhammers, 34,
was pulled over in his Jeep and arrested at 3:30 p.m. in the town
of Ambridge, two hours after the police uncovered a 15-mile trail
of death that ran through two shopping centers and crossed three
townships.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers stays with his parents in Mount Lebanon, Pa., where
neighbors described the family as ``pillars of the community.''
Baumhammers &UR;  &LR; is licensed to practice law in Georgia and
Pennsylvania. &UR;  &LR; His father, Andrejs, is a periodontist who teaches
part time at the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Bauhammers, who is white, was arraigned last night on one count
of criminal homicide in the shooting at a martial arts school, and
the FBI has joined the investigation by the Alleghany County police
to determine whether the spree was a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   The killings followed another shooting spree with racist
overtones in Pittsburgh on March 2. In that incident, a black man
opened fire in two fast-food restaurants during lunchtime, after
proclaiming, ``I'm just out to shoot white men.''
</P>
<P>
   The gunman in that case, Ronald Taylor, surrendered to the
police, but his actions left a deep reservoir of fear and grief.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania responding to the latest
shootings, said Friday night to a Republican group he was
addressing in Pebble Beach, Calif.: ``Not again. Those are the
first words that come to mind. Not again.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Across Pennsylvania, and particularly in
southwestern Pennsylvania, we are struggling to make sense of what
appears to be yet another brutal racist rampage.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials got the first call related to the
killings at 1 p.m., when a fire alarm went off at the home of one
of Baumhammers' next-door neighbors, said Paul Wolf, acting
superintendent for the Mount Lebanon police.
</P>
<P>
   When police officers and firefighters arrived at the house, Wolf
said, they found the body of Baumhammers' next door neighbor, Anita
Gordon, 63, who had been shot to death. The house was also burning
after a rug was set on fire. Gordon is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   About 1:49 p.m., the police received a call about a shooting in
neighboring Scott Township, at an Indian grocery in the Scott Town
Center. A 30-year-old man had been killed by multiple gunshots.
Another victim was taken to Mercy Hospital, and remained in serious
condition Friday night. Police did not release their names, though
he was identified by The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as Patil Sandip,
24, of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Kretzler, owner of Travel Connection, was working next door
to the grocery when he said he heard loud sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were pounding on the wall next door,'' Kretzler
said. ``I thought, `What in the world are they doing over there?'''
</P>
<P>
   He said he then saw a man walking away from the grocery with his
arm extended backward pointing a revolver at the grocery. ``Then he
calmly and coolly walked along the sidewalk to his car,'' Kretzler
said, adding that the man sat in his black Jeep Cherokee for about
a minute before driving off. The police said they believe
Baumhammers next fired shots through the windows and front door of
a nearby synagogue, the Beth El Congregation in Mount Lebanon. He
then went on to another synagogue, Ahavath Achim, in Carnegie, and
fired shots outside, shattering the windows. No injuries were
reported in those incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The next report of gunfire came at 2:25 p.m., Wolf said, this
time at a Chinese restaurant, Ya Fei Chinese Cuisine, in adjacent
Robinson Township.
</P>
<P>
   Two Asian men there were shot from five to six feet away, said
Wolf, one in the face and one in the chest. Both were pronounced
dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   A cook there, Vinh Truong, said an employee ran into the kitchen
and told everyone to escape, but Truong said he found his
brother-in-law, whom he identified as Tony, on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after that, a dispatcher in Beaver Township received
the next call. This time, the police found the body of a
25-year-old black man at the C.S. Kim Karate School, who died from
a single gunshot wound to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting at the martial arts school, the police said,
Baumhammers drove toward Pittsburgh. The police in Aliquippa
spotted his Jeep and followed it across the Ohio River into
Ambridge, where officers from both towns arrested Baumhammers at
about 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Officers cornered his vehicle and drew their weapons, but
Baumhammers calmly surrendered, police officials said. A handgun
and spent shells were found in his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers was taken to the Center Township police station,
were he was questioned for five hours. During the interrogation,
his only comment was to ask to speak with a lawyer, an official
with the Center Township police told a reporter in a televised
interview.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Daina Baumhammers Pack, a radiologist in
Millersville, Md., said Friday night when reached by telephone:
``This is an absolutely devastating thing for our family. It's the
most awful thing that can happen to a family, and I feel terrible
for the victims' families and for my own parents.''
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Elm Spring Road, Lois Castello, said that the
Baum-H hammers had lived on the street a long time. She said the
son lived there, ``but not all the time.''

A GREEN HOUSE EFFECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is what home should be like for the weary. A
place for timely hitting. Clutch defensive plays. A break when it's
needed.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Los Angeles Dodgers, some Shawn Green. A LOT of
Shawn Green.
</P>
<P>
   Coming home after a roller-coaster road trip and carrying
four-game losing streak, the Dodgers rallied to drop the Florida
Marlins 5-3 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Green was all over this victory, driving in two runs, scoring
twice and throwing out a runner at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams (2-1) got the win in relief of an effective Carlos
Perez, and Jeff Shaw pitched a scoreless ninth to earn his sixth
save.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were down 3-2 in the bottom of the seventh when they
scored three times. Devon White singled, was sacrificed to second,
and Gary Sheffield walked against Florida rookie starter Brad Penny
before the Marlins called on left-hander Armando Almanza to face
Green.
</P>
<P>
   But Green lined a doubled down the right-field line. White
scored easily and Sheffield was waved in. As Sheffield was charging
home, Kevin Millar's relay from first baseman Kevin Millar bounced
in front of catcher Mike Redmond and into a camera well. Green took
third on the throw and scored on the throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins took the brief 3-2 lead with an unearned run in the
seventh. Adams opened the inning and was greeted by a David Berg
single.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond's bouncer then should have been a double play. Dodgers
managerDavey Johnson had elected to rest struggling second baseman
Mark Grudzielanek, and instead of starting infielder Jose Vizcaino,
gave F.P. Santangelo the nod.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo fielded Redmond's grounder cleanly, but his throw was
wideof shortstop Kevin Elster and sailed into left for an error.
Berg came all the way around to score.
</P>
<P>
   In attendance early Friday night was Scott Boras, the important
agent who has shortstop Alex Rodriguez ready to become a free agent
at the end ofthe season. But the Dodgers don't need to shell out
some $20 million a year for Rodriguez when they have Elster making
like Cal Ripken Jr. in his prime.
</P>
<P>
   Elster came up in the fourth with the Dodgers down 2-0 and the
bases loaded courtesy of a Green single and a pair of Penny walks.
The Dodgers and the bases loaded had not been a happy match lately,
but Elster calmly lined a single to left-center to score two and
even thescore at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Elster's six home runs and 15 RBI are both second on the club
only toSheffield (seven, 16).
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins started the scoring with a pair of runs in the
second, butit could have been worse if not for Green.
</P>
<P>
   Perez fell into trouble on his own making when he hit third
baseman Mike Lowell to open the inning. Kevin Millar singled in
front of Gary Sheffield in left, with Lowell stopping at second.
</P>
<P>
   But the Marlins then picked up consecutive RBI singles from the
bottom of the order, Berg and Redmond lining basehits to put
Florida up 2-0. They tried to make it 3-0 on Redmond's hit to
right, Berg being wavedhome by third base coach Fredi Gonzalez.
Apparently, not everyone in theNational League has heard about
Green's arm.
</P>
<P>
   The right fielder fired home, easily throwing Berg out at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite allowing the two runs, Perez turned in his best
performance of the season, and for now anyway, probably cemented
his spot in the rotation. He went six strong innings, giving up the
two runs on five hits. He walked one, hit a batter and struck out a
season-high six before leaving for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of
the sixth.

ERSTAD A HIT, BUT ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calilf. _ The way the Anaheim Angels have pitched
lately, they'd need nine Darin Erstads in the lineup to be
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, they still have only one, which would explain their
11-2 loss to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays Friday night before 31,888 at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Even Erstad, who has established an American League record for
hits in the month of April (45), has an off-night now and then.
Friday he went 1 for 4, his league-leading average dipping to .459.
The 45 hits are the most in any month by any player in Angels
history, breaking Garret Anderson's record of 44 set in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But even four homers by Erstad would have made little difference
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jason Dickson, coming off his best start of the
season (0 earned runs in 7 innings against the same Devil Rays),
didn't make it out of the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   He was shelled for six runs and seven hits in 1 innings, leaving
the game because of a strained left hip-flexor. There was no word
on how he sustained the injury, other than the possibility he hurt
it dodging line drives that whizzed past his head during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson's performance and more shoddy work from the bullpen shed
light on what is starting to become more rule than exception. In
the first 12 games of the season, the Angels had allowed a total of
48 runs, or 4.0 runs per game. In their last 12, they've allowed 86
runs, or 7.2 per game. Of those 12, the Angels' opposition has
scored in double figures five times.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Angels have fallen to 11-13, the first time
they've been two games below .500 since they were 0-2 on April 4.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson and the Angels were finished Friday before the stadium
lights warmed up. He gave up three runs and five hits in the first
inning, and it would have been worse if not for the hard-hit double
play ball he got out of Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn more than made up for it, though, hitting a three-run
homer off Dickson in the second inning, before adding a single in
the third, another homer in the sixth and a single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had four of the Devil Rays' 19 hits, which are the most
ever in club history in a nine-inning game. Dave Martinez had three
hits, and Fred McGriff, Vinny Castilla and John Flaherty had two
each in support of starter Esteban Yan (1-1), who allowed only a
two-run homer to Garret Anderson (No. 4) in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays are certainly happy to see the Angels on their
schedule today and Sunday _ they are 4-1 vs. the Angels this
season; 5-12 against the rest of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Down, 8-2, after four innings, the Angels offense appeared to
pack it in for the night. They got only two hits hit in the final
five innings _ Erstad's eighth-inning single and Troy Glaus'
ninth-inning double.

BRUINS, WAVES CONCENTRATE ON DEFENSE

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Gambling isn't in their blood. So the UCLA and
Pepperdine men's volleyball teams won't take chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win,'' said UCLA setter Brandon Taliaferro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to win on Saturday,'' said Pepperdine interim coach
Jeff Stork.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents on the court share the same view off it: A win tonight
in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference championship,
starting at 7 at Pepperdine, earns the victor a berth in next
week's NCAA Final Four in Ft. Wayne, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   The loser will await word Sunday from the three-person NCAA
committee about the at-large berth, feeling like a guy at a
roulette table powerlessly awaiting to see if the ball lands on his
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't know what three people are thinking,'' UCLA coach
Al Scates said, ``and I don't know who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   So the second-seeded Waves (22-4) and fourth-seeded Bruins
(26-5) will meet for the third time this season. Each has a home
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The match will be won or lost above the net, for each team
relies on its blocking. Eight UCLA players combined for 43 blocks
in Thursday's semifinal victory over Loyola Marymount, led by Scott
Morrow's 10. Pepperdine was outblocked by USC 29-26 in the Wave's
four-game victory, but Andre Breuer had one solo and eight assists
against just one error.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams also distribute the hitting. Six Bruins had between
11 and 15 kills against LMU, and four Waves had between 15 and 27
kills against the Trojans.

CHURCHILL DOWNS CEO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT HOLLYWOOD PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The waitress at a Laguna Beach sandwich shop
greeted Churchill Downs Inc. CEO Tom Meeker with a friendly ``Hey,
baby!'' one afternoon this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Go Baby Go!' '' Meeker recalled. ``She said, `No,
that's a horse-racing term.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she just happened to have watched the National
Thoroughbred Racing Association's TV commercials and remembered the
slogan. Or maybe she's one of a legion of Southern Californians who
are horse-racing-aware. Meeker prefers to believe the latter.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with employees and horsemen on opening night at
Hollywood Park _ which Churchill Downs Inc. purchased for $140
million in September _ Meeker delivered a refreshingly optimistic
message about the sport's future. He rejected what he called
``Chicken Little talk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As horsemen and track operators, we should have a smile from
ear to ear,'' he said. ``We are at the cusp of something big.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeker's mere presence Friday, the first of Hollywood Park's 65
days and nights of racing, sent the message that the 62-year-old
track is a cornerstone of Churchill Downs Inc.'s burgeoning
simulcast network. He planned an early morning flight home to
Louisville to attend Churchill Downs' own season-opening card this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, a relaxed Meeker:

GREEN-HOUSE EFFECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is what home should be like for the weary. A
place for timely hitting. Clutch defensive plays. A break when it's
needed.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Dodgers, a little Shawn Green. OK, a !ital!lot of
Shawn Green.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back to this strange place called home following a
disappointing road trip and with a four-game losing streak, the
Dodgers rallied to drop the Florida Marlins 5-3 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Green was all over this victory, driving in two runs, scoring
twice, collecting three hits and throwing out a runner at the
plate. He looked like a guy who could earn his $84 million.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams (2-1) got the win in relief of an effective Carlos
Perez, and Jeff Shaw pitched a scoreless ninth to earn his sixth
save.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had played only five of their first 21 games at home
before Friday, and were trailing 3-2 in the seventh when they
finally shook the road blues and acted like Dodger Stadium was a
place they could embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything had kind of been catching up to us,'' Green said.
``It's like we had the flu, finally broke the fever and started
feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   Devon White opened the bottom of the seventh with a single off
Florida rookie starter Brad Penny. A bunt from F.P. Santangelo _
whose throwing error in the top of the inning had allowed the
Marlins to take the 3-2 lead _ moved White to second, before Penny
walked Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins called on left-hander Armando Almanza to face Green,
who quickly doubled down the right-field line. White scored easily
and Sheffield was waved in.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield was coming hard to the plate with the go-ahead run on
what looked like a close play when first baseman Kevin Millar's
relay bounced in front of catcher Mike Redmond and into a
photographers' well. Sheffield scored and Green, who had gone to
third on the throw home, trotted in on the throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn Green did it again,'' said Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   This came on top of Green singling and scoring one of two runs
on Kevin Elster's basehit in the fourth, and his throwing David
Berg out at home in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Like it was all in a day's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be the calmest guy I've ever played with,'' Shaw
said. ``He just goes about his job and gets it done. You can't tell
if he went 0 for 4 or 4 for 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez might have been looking for a little job security himself,
and probably earned it with his best outing of the year. The
left-hander went six innings, allowing two runs on five hits. He
walked one and struck out a season-high six.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my best game this season,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez threw 92 pitches, 60 for strikes, and even appeared to
have a little more velocity. Perez said it was all about control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't pay me to throw hard, they pay be to get batters
out,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez wanted to pitch longer than the six innings, but Johnson
was happy to get a strong start from the left-hander who only a few
weeks ago was headed back to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos pitched well,'' Johnson said. ``It's another step in
the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster's timely two-run single off Penny in the second raised
his RBI total to 15, one behind Sheffield's team-high 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really needed that,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Penny pitched well but took the loss to fall to 3-2 for
Florida.

ERSTAD A HIT, BUT...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. The way the Anaheim Angels have pitched lately,
they'd need nine Darin Erstads in the lineup just to be
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, they have only one Erstad, which would explain their
11-2 loss to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays Friday night before 31,888 at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Even Erstad, who established an American League record for hits
in the month of April (45), has an off-night now and then. He had
only one hit in four at-bats on Friday, as his league-leading
average dipped to .459.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 45 hits are the most in any month by any player in
Angels history, breaking Garret Anderson's record of 44 set in July
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, not even four home runs by Erstad would have made
little difference.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jason Dickson, coming off his best start of the
season (0 earned runs in 7 innings against the same Devil Rays),
didn't make it out of the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   He was shelled for six runs and seven hits in 1 innings, leaving
the game because of a strained left hip. Dickson said he's felt a
nagging pain for a couple days but thought he could get through the
game. That's why he didn't tell manager Mike Scioscia of his injury
until the Angels were in a 6-0 hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd rather get a little heads up,'' Scioscia said. ``But
it's not something you'd be able to hide. It's Jason's makeup not
to alibi, not to look for ways out of games. His makeup is not to
make excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no excuse for the way the Angels have pitched lately,
particularly out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson's performance and more shoddy work from the bullpen shed
light on what is starting to become more rule than exception.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 12 games of the season, the Angels had allowed a
total of 48 runs, or 4.0 runs per game. In their last 12, they've
allowed 86 runs, or 7.2 per game. Of those 12, the Angels'
opposition has scored in double figures five times.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Angels have fallen to 11-13, the first time
they've been two games below .500 since they were 0-2 on April 4.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Scioscia held his first post-game team meeting
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just talked about a couple things, nothing big,'' Scioscia
said. ``We haven't done a lot of things well the last couple games.
It's not about effort. If anything, they're trying a little too
hard. Particularly the pitching staff. They're not executing the
way they can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows when it's necessary,'' Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn
said of the meeting. ``He had what he had to say. That's why we got
him, for these situations. He knows the difference between getting
beat and beating ourselves. He said it's not effort, it's a mental
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickson and the Angels were finished Friday before the stadium
lights warmed up. He gave up three runs and five hits in the first
inning, and it would have been worse if not for the hard-hit
double-play ball he got out of Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn more than made up for it, though, hitting a three-run
homer off Dickson in the second inning, before adding a single in
the third, another homer in the sixth and a single in the seventh
off Angels relievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do?'' Dickson said. ``On one hand, you want to
tough it out. But six runs in two innings doesn't give your team a
chance to win. Live and learn. . . I guess I should have given them
a heads-up ahead of time. Next time I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn had four of the Devil Rays' 19 hits, which were the
most ever in club history in a nine-inning game. Dave Martinez had
three hits, and Fred McGriff, Vinny Castilla and John Flaherty had
two each in support of starter Esteban Yan (1-1), who allowed only
a two-run homer to Garret Anderson (No. 4) in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays are certainly happy to see the Angels on their
schedule today and Sunday _ they are 4-1 vs. the Angels this
season; 5-12 against the rest of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Down, 8-2, after four innings, the Angels offense appeared to
pack it in for the night. They got only two hits hit in the final
five innings _ Erstad's eighth-inning single and Troy Glaus'
ninth-inning double.

 ELLISON ECLIPSES GATES IN STOCK  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, the swashbuckling
executive who built a career out of tweaking Microsoft, passed
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on Friday as the world's richest
man.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison's 24 percent stake in Oracle of Redwood Shores inched up
to $53 billion Friday, compared with $51.7 billion for Gates' stake
in Microsoft of Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, 55, who lives in Atherton, passed Gates, 44, earlier
this week, if you ask Oracle how many shares he holds: 689 million.
But documents filed with the federal Securities and Exchange
Commission in April indicate that Ellison had options to sell 27
million of those shares within 60 days _ meaning he may not
actually own them today.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Gates probably still officially holds the Midas
title, according to Forbes magazine, which estimates that Gates
also has $10 billion in outside investments versus $200 million in
real estate holdings for Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   But it's no less stunning that the flamboyant Ellison, who is
known for buzzing Silicon Valley at all hours in his corporate jet
and racing his yacht around the world, has come so close to
eclipsing the nerdier Gates, who prefers to go off on retreats with
a stack of research papers and technical reports.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, Forbes estimated that Gates was the richest man
with $85 billion compared with $13 billion for Ellison. Gates has
become such a fixture at the head of the list that there is even a
Web site _ the Bill Gates Personal Wealth Clock
( &LR; www.webho.com/WealthClock &LR; ) _ that purports to calculate Gates'
current wealth based on the price of Microsoft stock. (The numbers
differ, incidentally, because the Web site operator uses the number
of Microsoft shares Gates held in 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the prime reasons Ellison has come so close to passing
Gates is that Microsoft's shares have tumbled 15 percent this past
year over concerns about the landmark U.S. antitrust trial against
Microsoft. Government antitrust lawyers recommended yesterday that
Microsoft be split in two.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle shares, meanwhile, have surged 485 percent over the past
12 months, partly fueled by the growth in the Internet and
technology as a whole. Some critics say that Oracle has nearly as
much dominance in database software as Microsoft has in PC
software.
</P>
<P>
   That's a little ironic, because Ellison has lambasted Gates for
racking up his fortune by using Microsoft's monopoly hold on
personal computer software. Ellison once said ``Gates should be
jailed'' for trying to drive rivals out of business.

 MICROSOFT SPLIT URGED  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microsoft should pay the ultimate price for its
dominance in the software industry and be cleaved into two distinct
companies, according to a proposal filed Friday with the federal
judge overseeing the landmark antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   The document, filed jointly by the Department of Justice and
attorneys general of 17 states, proposes splitting the software
behemoth into two pieces: one that sells applications like Word and
another centered on the Windows operating system. The plan is aimed
at breaking Microsoft's stranglehold on the desktop and
jumpstarting competition in the software market.
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled
that Microsoft broke state and federal antitrust laws designed to
promote a level playing field by using its monopoly in the
operating systems market to pulverize rivals. That, in turn, hurt
consumers by limiting choices, the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decree will not limit Microsoft's ability to add new
features to its products or otherwise to innovate,'' said Joel
Klein, the Justice Department's antitrust chief. ``But by turning
loose the power of competition in the operating systems business,
this decree will stimulate innovation throughout the software
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's development is just the latest salvo in a battle that
has already lasted two years and could drag on for several more.
And many legal, software and consumer experts are divided whether a
breakup would encourage real competition. Some even say the move
could backfire for consumers by driving up software prices and
handcuffing other high-tech companies that fear similar reprisals
from an emboldened Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup of Microsoft would be the first of a U.S. monopoly
in 16 years _ since American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph's split into the
eight regional ``Baby Bells.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This breakup is nonsensical,'' said Helen Chaney, a public
policy fellow at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy,
a free market think tank. ``People keep talking about (the) AT&AMP;T
breakup, but this is different. This is not going to change the
dynamics in the market and it's going to create a lot of needless
regulation and cost taxpayers a bundle because the government will
have to continually monitor the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates derided the proposal as
``disturbing'' and reiterated confidence that the appeals court
will overturn Jackson's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``These remedies would not allow us to deliver new software
products like we have in the past,'' Gates said. ``These
regulations do not help the software industry. They retard the
speed at which it will move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft stock, which has fallen 25 percent since Jackson's
April 3 ruling, fell 6 cents in regular trading, closing at $69.75.
In after-hours trading the stock edged up to around $70.44.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, Microsoft's various Windows operating
systems would comprise one company; the other would be made up of
the rest, including the extremely popular Office suite of products
and the company's Web navigation tool, Internet Explorer. The
operating systems company would receive a one-time license to
integrate Internet Explorer into its software, but would eventually
have to develop its own. Only one company could retain the
Microsoft name; and the company's two or three largest shareholders
_ including Gates _ would have to choose stock in one company. The
two entities could not combine for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the structural remedies _ which would not be
enacted until the appeals process is concluded _ the proposal
includes conduct curbs. Those would go into effect immediately
after the completion of the remedies phase of the trial and stay in
place until three years after the structural remedies went into
affect.
</P>
<P>
   Those measures include restricting Microsoft from retaliating
against any computer maker that decided to use a competing product
or offering discounts on the Windows operating system to selected
computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft could not insist that computer makers agree to license
other Microsoft software in order to receive a license for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers would also be free to modify the Windows startup
sequence to remove icons for Microsoft products or display
competitors' products. Microsoft would make available the technical
information that competing software makers use to make their
products compatible with Windows, and it could not interfere with
the performance of such software.
</P>
<P>
   Two states, Ohio and Illinois, filed a separate remedy statement
supporting only behavioral restrictions on the company for several
years. If those didn't achieve the stated goals, a structural
remedy would then be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has until May 10 to file its response to the
government's remedies _ though the company has signaled it will ask
for an extension. The Justice Department and states have a week to
respond. On May 24, Jackson is scheduled to hold hearings on the
proposals; he could make his final ruling on Microsoft's fate as
soon as June.
</P>
<P>
   Many anti-Microsoft groups hailed the final proposal, after
several weeks in which other remedies ranging from behavioral curbs
to splitting the company into several smaller ``clones'' were
suggested, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of software overall will come down when the
competitive pressures are unleashed here,'' said Mike Pettit,
executive director of ProComp, an anti-Microsoft trade group based
in Washington, D.C. ``When you look at AT&AMP;T, the net effect was the
prices in all areas went down in both local and long-distance
service.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many questions remain.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, whether the government's proposal _ if actually enacted
_ will restore competition in a marketplace that has changed
drastically in the two years since the case was filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that Windows holds a high market share now, but
other technologies are threatening to unseat Microsoft,'' Chaney
said. ``The government should ask itself what it's planning to
achieve in this case. Already, the market is moving away from the
Windows platform and into other platforms like Web-based
software.''
</P>
<P>
   If the company is broken up, the most obvious winners are the
makers and distributors of Linux, the increasingly popular
alternative operating system based on Unix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux and open source is going to win against Microsoft no
matter what happens _ this accelerates that,'' said Larry Augustin,
chief executive of VA Linux, a Sunnyvale company that provides
servers and workstations based on Linux.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader applications market, Augustin believes a breakup
``will create more excitement, because there will be less fear that
Microsoft will enter a potential market.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Augustin worries about the legal fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a saying that Microsoft may get what it deserves, but
everyone else may get what Microsoft deserves as well,'' he said.
``It could lead to the breakup of other companies where it doesn't
make as much sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Others postulate that Microsoft could become like the Hydra
monster of Greek myth, which could sprout heads almost as quickly
as a swordsman cut one off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this breakup plan were to make it all the way through
appeals, it could create a lot of confusion in the marketplace,''
said Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Giga Information Group.
``Long term, we'd find a lot more benefit, but it might be with two
very dominant companies instead of one.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts seem to think Microsoft shareholders could be a winner
because investors could own stock in two extremely powerful
entities, instead of just one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you split a pretty dynamic company like that in half, it
dilutes overall value,'' said William Welch, managing director of
Fiduciary Asset Management, with $155 million in assets. ``Still,
Microsoft split in two is still going to be Microsoft, and I think
it should be bought for long-term growth potential.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally there's the question of whether the idea of a pair
of Microsofts will ever become a reality. Silicon Valley antitrust
attorney Rich Gray thinks the Justice Department proved its case
that Microsoft illegally protected its Windows monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   But he concedes that a breakup of the world's biggest software
company is far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft will have some good arguments'' on appeal, he said.
``They may even have a better than a 50-50 chance'' of overturning
Jackson's decision. ``But nothing is a sure thing.''

FIDELITY, SCHWAB SCORE BEST IN CUSTOMER SURVEY OF ONLINE
BROKERS  BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A hush-hush study by J.D. Power, one of the
nation's leading market research firms, shows sharp differences in
customer satisfaction at the major online brokerage firms. The news
is good for Charles Schwab Corp. and bad for E-Trade Group. The two
Bay Area companies dominate the fast-growing industry.
</P>
<P>
   The survey covering 13 Internet brokerage services showed
Fidelity Investments did the top job of keeping its customers
happy, followed closely by San Francisco's Schwab. Menlo Park,
Calif.'s E-Trade had the second-worst customer satisfaction record,
barely beating out Citibank, the industry laggard.
</P>
<P>
   Power, widely known for its auto industry customer satisfaction
surveys, issued the confidential brokerage report to clients in
March based on questionnaires submitted to 6,706 online investors
at the beginning of the year. The Chronicle obtained a copy.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of online stock trading is soaring in the Bay
Area and nationwide. The industry added more than 3 million
accounts in the first three months of 2000, bringing total U.S.
accounts to more than 15 million, according to the brokerage firm
Solomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Gap Viewed as Significant
</P>
<P>
   Power, based in Agoura Hills , Calif., declined to discuss the
performance of specific companies. But Nancy Salk, research
director at the firm's Connecticut office, said researchers found a
significant gap between brokers at the top of the survey and those
at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw very distinct strengths and weaknesses among them,''
Salk said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Salk said, the industry is doing better at satisfying
customers. From May 1999, when Power conducted its first brokerage
survey, to January, the industry's average customer-satisfaction
score increased 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rising tide lifted all boats, including Citibank and
E-Trade, which improved their satisfaction scores a few notches.
The better scores in part reflect improved reliability of company
Web sites, which were notoriously prone to slowdowns and outages
early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Power's scores are an index based on six measures of customer
satisfaction, including customer service, company integrity and
reputation, information and education and reliability of brokerage
Web sites. Among the questions investors were asked were how easy
it was to get through to their broker, how reliable was the firm's
Web site, how well questions were answered and whether orders were
executed accurately.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Tradition of Service
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said it is not surprising to see a gap
between Fidelity and Schwab, which were in the brokerage business
before online investing took off, and E-Trade, which came of age in
the Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schwab and Fidelity have a long tradition of high-quality
customer service and support,'' said Stephen Franco of U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray. ``E-Trade is a more technology-controlled firm as
opposed to a customer-controlled firm.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade has had phenomenal success in attracting customers and
has had to scramble to build an infrastructure to support its
booming business.
</P>
<P>
   High Marks for Fidelity
</P>
<P>
   Top marks for Fidelity, which recently adopted the name
Powerstreet for its Internet business, reflect its history as a
brokerage and mutual fund company that invested heavily in
telephone and branch support. ``We take customer support very
seriously and built the infrastructure for it,'' said Tracey
Curvey, chief of the company's brokerage business.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, E-Trade stressed its push to build its customer
support operations, including hiring more than 300 new service
employees in recent months. ``We are making incredible strides in
customer service,'' said spokesman Patrick di Chiro.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade has also come out on top in rankings that emphasize
reliability and ease of use of Internet sites, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank, meanwhile, said it had not seen the Power report and
could not comment on it directly. Citibank's online banking and
brokerage services continue to rank very high in surveys of
respected publications, such as Forbes, Worth, Smart Money and
Money magazines, said spokesman Mark Rodgers.

MP3.COM RULED IN VIOLATION OF COPYRIGHTS  &HT;     BY BENNY EVANGELISTA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The nation's biggest record labels scored a key
victory Friday when a federal judge ruled that Internet music
portal MP3.com Inc. infringed on copyright laws by running a
virtual online jukebox service called MyMP3.com
</P>
<P>
   The decision by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New York means
MP3.com of San Diego is liable for a huge civil penalty amounting
to billions of dollars in damages sought by the Recording Industry
Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page ruling is the first in a number of copyright
infringement suits filed by record companies or artists against
high-tech companies that are rewriting the rules for distributing
music for free online.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts say the ruling by itself only affects the
portal's MyMP3.com service and shouldn't set new legal precedents
that would affect other lawsuits against San Mateo, Calif.'s
Napster Inc. or stall the growing use of MP3 and other formats to
swap songs via the Internet. MyMP3.com was launched in January by
the pioneering online music portal as a jukebox service that would
allow members to listen to any song they own from any computer
linked to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com copied songs from about 45,000 CDs into the
MP3-compression format and stored them on audio files accessible
through the Web. All MyMP3.com members had to do was prove they
already owned the song to gain access to the Internet version.
MP3.com argued its customers were legally entitled to listen to
their music in any form they chose.
</P>
<P>
   But the major record companies represented by the recording
industry trade group said MP3.com violated copyright law because
it, and not the individual music fan, made unauthorized copies.
</P>
<P>
   Current laws allow music fans to make copies of songs or albums
for their own use, but not for broad distribution or resale.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Rosini, a copyright law attorney with Franklin, Weinrib,
Rudell &AMP; Vassallo of New York, said yesterday's ruling reaffirmed
``a very long-rooted, old media maxim that people own copyrights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't surprise me,'' he said. ``If they (the record
companies) had not won, it would have set back copyright laws as we
know it a couple of hundred years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the concept of what MP3.com is doing, but I don't know
that the law supports it, and I'm not surprised by the judge's
decision,'' said Jim Burger, a computer and software licensing
attorney with Dow, Lohnes &AMP; Albertson law firm of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com executives said they would appeal the ruling and had no
plans to shut down their MyMP3.com service unless ordered by the
judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a victory for the record labels, it's a loss,''
MP3.com chief executive Michael Robertson said in a statement after
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``New technologies for delivering music are here to stay, and
the technology trend is moving in only one direction, forward,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said his company's system was superior to those of
Napster and other software programs that swap music over the
Internet because MP3.com requires users to purchase CD's before
accessing the music on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   A Redwood City, Calif., company, called MyPlay Inc., offers a
similar service. MyPlay has the record industry's support because
the customers do the work of uploading songs into ``virtual
lockers,'' said co-founder David Pakman.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear just how much the recording association can
collect. Theoretically, the damage award could be in the billions
because the suit against MP3.com originally asked for $150,000 in
damages for each unauthorized copy of a song.
</P>
<P>
   However, legal experts say it is doubtful the judge would assess
anywhere near the full amount against a company that has never
showed a profit and as recently as the first quarter of this year
lost $8.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rakoff's ruling did not provide details about how he arrived at
his decision, but he told attorneys for both sides to expect a
full, written ruling in a week or two. The next step will include
court hearings on penalties.

 NEWS ANALYSIS: MICROSOFT BREAKUP SCHEME MAY ASSUME TOO MUCH  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When and if the Justice Department gets its way
and Microsoft is divided into separate operating-system and
application companies, the immediate result will simply be to
replace one monopoly with two.
</P>
<P>
   The company that gets Windows will still hold a position of
overwhelming dominance in the market for PC operating system
software. The other company _ the one that gets Microsoft Office
and the rest of the current company's products _ will have an
equally tight grip in business productivity software, still the
heart of the whole desktop software market.
</P>
<P>
   The plan creates no new competitors in either arena. It gives no
direct assistance to existing alternatives _ Mac OS, BeOS, Linux
and other Unix derivatives in the OS market, Corel, Lotus, Sun and
others in the applications arena.
</P>
<P>
   So why do the Justice Department and the 17 state attorneys
general who joined it in submitting this plan think it will revive
competition?
</P>
<P>
   Their argument depends on a series of assumptions about the
likely  &LR; indirect  &LR; consequences of the proposed breakup. Though not
implausible, these assumptions are by no means proven.
</P>
<P>
   The key assumptions:
</P>
<P>
   -- The new applications company, once cut loose from the entity
that markets Windows, will choose to offer versions of its
programs, especially Office, for other operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   -- The availability of such programs for other operating systems
will make customers more willing to adopt those systems in
preference to Windows. That in turn will make PC manufacturers more
willing to offer non-Windows operating systems preinstalled on
their hardware, either in place of or alongside a Microsoft system.
</P>
<P>
   The government's proposal, however, won't  &LR; require  &LR; the
applications company to develop products for non-Windows systems.
Instead, the government is apparently convinced the invisible hand
of capitalism _ the existence of a market opportunity from which
the new company could profit _ will induce it to move its
applications to other operating platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft already offers a version of Office, with most of the
features of its standard Windows version, for one other operating
system, Apple's Mac OS. That product has helped keep the Apple
alternative afloat; indeed, many industry watchers doubt that
Apple's revival in recent years, under the tutelage of CEO Steve
Jobs, could have occurred if Jobs hadn't managed in 1997 to
persuade Bill Gates to pledge publicly to keep developing Office
for the Mac for at least five more years.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Mac OS (in its current form, anyway) doesn't run
on the Intel and Intel-compatible chips that power roughly 95
percent of the world's personal computers, the availability of
Office for the Mac doesn't do much to bring competition into the
computing mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, several non-Windows operating systems
already available for Intel-based PCs: IBM still maintains its OS/2
product; Menlo Park, Calif.'s Be Inc. continues to improve its
multimedia-oriented BeOS; and several versions of Unix, an
industrial-strength OS mainly used for servers and high-end
workstations, have been adapted to run on PCs.
</P>
<P>
   For the future, though, all eyes are on Linux, the Unix
derivative that's distributed free and maintained by a worldwide
community of volunteer programmers. It has already proved its
mettle as an alternative to Microsoft's Windows NT and 2000 in
parts of the marketplace, chiefly for use on Internet servers.
</P>
<P>
   But servers are one market and the mainstream desktop quite
another, and so far, Linux has made only limited inroads into the
latter. Though it works with most up-to-date PCs, it still lacks
software ``drivers'' needed for compatibility with many older and
less-popular graphics cards, network adapters and the like.
Installing it can still be complicated, though Linux developers are
working hard to alleviate that problem.
</P>
<P>
   And the selection of applications, utilities, plug-ins and games
available for it, though growing, remains far more limited than the
options for Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's not obvious that enough users are likely to
adopt Linux in the near term to create a market large enough to
induce the new Microsoft-descended applications company to develop
Office for that platform _ even if the company makes its decisions
strictly on the basis of its own economic self-interest, without
regard to its former OS colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Office were to become available, it's not clear how
soon, if ever, the other obstacles would be overcome enough to
attract masses of home and business users.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Office on Linux could actually choke off the
competition that's emerging in the Linux applications market, where
Sun Microsystems is promoting its StarOffice package, Corel is
trying to revive its WordPerfect Office suite and several smaller
companies also have strong offerings.

 IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR MICROSOFT  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As antitrust officials sought a breakup of
Microsoft Corp. Friday, workers at the software giant's spiffy new
Mountain View, Calif., campus were enjoying barbecued chicken and
bags of popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   As they ate, the Microsofties were volunteering their time at
tables set up by about a dozen local charities and community
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The event almost seemed scientifically designed to place the
company in a good light and counter the perception that Microsoft
is in fact an evil corporation that desires nothing less than total
world domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might seem kind of fishy,'' Microsoft spokeswoman Nikki
Wiebe said of the timing of the charity get-together. ``But
actually this had been planned for months.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the picnic in Mountain View summed up the general
reaction to news of a potential breakup of Microsoft: business as
usual.
</P>
<P>
   From consumers in stores to members of computer support groups,
the consensus was that since the case still has a long way to go,
it's too early to mourn or celebrate, depending on where you stand
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Microsoft's Bay Area employees are toeing the
company's line that a breakup is unwarranted and that it should be
fought in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anyone working here who thinks there's
much validity to the case,'' said Dick Craddock, manager of
Microsoft's Mac Internet Explorer group. ``That may be the party
line, but it's also the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an expected thing,'' said Jon DeVaan, senior vice
president of the company's consumer group. ``The mood here is
actually pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft received a vote of support from the 150 or so members
of the Windows-loving San Francisco PC Users Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason to break up the company,'' said Butler
Crittenden, the group's president. ``I don't see that they're using
any competitive strategies that are different from other
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing that consumers in general do need protection from
the greedy clutches of big business, he said antitrust officials
chose the wrong target in going after Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally need to be protected from the pharmaceutical
industry,'' Crittenden said. ``I'm diabetic and the price of
insulin keeps going up.''
</P>
<P>
   At the CompUSA outlet in downtown San Francisco, restaurant
consultant Lance Feldman was unfazed by word of the Justice
Department's tactics as he added a $229.99 copy of Microsoft's
Office 2000 to his shopping basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they're hitting Microsoft with a lot,'' he said.
``Instead of regulating them over the years, they're going for a
quick fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman, like others interviewed, said he was more worried about
the impact this would have on Microsoft's share price than on the
company itself.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers at the Microsoft retail outlet in San Francisco's
Metreon center were amusing themselves with all the cool gadgets on
display. Uncertainty about the company's future wasn't much of a
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Shari Wildschutte of Concord, Calif., was one of the few with a
strong position on the breakup question. ``There need to be
sanctions,'' she said. ``Too few people own too much of
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Wildschutte said she has no particular beef
with Microsoft. She feels pretty much the same about all big
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Tyde, founder of the Bay Area Linux Users Group, which
promotes use of the Linux operating system, said that ``it's about
time'' government authorities moved to curb Microsoft's predatory
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't matter whether the government busts up
Microsoft,'' he said. ``Linux will overtake Windows in the long run
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is pretty much what Bill Gates has been saying,
that the tech market is competitive because there's always going to
be someone coming along with a new idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily disagree with that,'' Tyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Raines Cohen, co-founder of the Berkeley, Calif., Mac Users
Group, offered a similarly contradictory perspective.
</P>
<P>
   He said a breakup of Microsoft will punish the company ``for its
past behavior.'' But at the same time, he observed that development
of new applications for the Macintosh operating system has never
been stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I support the breakup,'' Cohen said. ``But as a
consumer advocate, I'm cautious about introducing any change into a
dynamic market.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 5-year-old Adam Lundblad summed it up best. While
playing a computer game at Metreon's Microsoft store, he only shook
his head when asked what would be gained by the Justice
Department's proposed action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said.

   Last Thursday the National Archives, as part of its routine
declassification of government records, released thousands of
secret documents from President Richard Nixon's National Security
Council, which was led by his national security adviser, Henry
Kissinger. Many deal with the war in Vietnam, which ended 25 years
ago Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The records capture the sulfurous scent of anger and desperation
at the White House and the American Embassy in Saigon as the war
went wrong, at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The following excerpts convey a whiff of that rage.
</P>
<P>
   _TIM WEINER
</P>
<P>
   March 17, 1970: A telephone conversation between Nixon and
Kissinger touches on the Army's investigation of the My Lai
massacre, in which American troops murdered hundreds of Vietnamese
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   P: It's a pretty cheap shot to allow the generals to be put on
the rack for the My Lai business. It was covered up because it was
in the interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   K: My first instinct was the same but some of the stories are
awful. Four hundred people were killed there and it went on for
days ... I don't think the public likes it.
</P>
<P>
   P: We know why it was done. These boys being killed by women
carrying that stuff in their satchels.
</P>
<P>
   May 1972: In three top secret-eyes only memos to Kissinger,
Nixon explains his thinking behind escalating the bombing and
mining of North Vietnam's harbors. He demands better propaganda
from the CIA. And he denounces ``sabotage'' of his war effort
within his own government.
</P>
<P>
   May 9: You have often mentioned the necessity of creating the
impression in the enemy's mind that I am absolutely determined to
end the war and will take  &UR; whatever steps are necessary &LR;  to
accomplish this goal. The time to take those steps is now ... I
cannot emphasize too strongly that I have determined that we should
go for broke ... Our greatest failure would be to do too little too
late.
</P>
<P>
   May 10: On an urgent basis, I want the CIA to implement ...
broadcasts, leaflets and every other device so that the North
Vietnamese ... are told of the massive public support for the
president's decision ... and any other story that might discourage
the North Vietnamese leaders.
</P>
<P>
   May 19: I am thoroughly disgusted with the consistent failure to
carry out orders that I have given over the past three and a half
years ... I have ordered, on occasion after occasion, an increase
in the quantity and quality of weapons made available to the South
Vietnamese. All that we have gotten from the Pentagon is the
run-around and a sometimes deliberate sabotage of the orders I have
given ...
</P>
<P>
   The performance in the psychological warfare field is nothing
short of disgraceful. The (intelligence bureaucracy) has labored
for seven weeks and when it finally produced, it produced not much
more than a mouse. Or to put it more honestly, it produced a rat
... I do not simply blame (the director of central intelligence,
Richard) Helms and the CIA. After all, they do not support my
policies because they are basically for the most part Ivy League
...
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon deserves an even greater share of the blame ... The
crowning insult to all this injury is to have the military whine
around to (Vice President Spiro) Agnew that they were not getting
enough support from the commander-in-chief in giving them targets
they could hit in North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   I want you to convey directly to the Air Force that I am
thoroughly disgusted with their performance ... I want you to
convey my utter disgust to (the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
senior American commanders in Vietnam). It is time for these people
either to shape up or get out.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 22, 1972: A series of top secret cables from Kissinger in
Saigon to the White House explain a sticky situation. Days before
the 1972 presidential elections in the United States, after months
of secret negotiations, Kissinger had declared: ``Peace is at
hand.'' But he had not yet explained its terms to the president of
South Vietnam, Nguyen Van Thieu.
</P>
<P>
   I will proceed with some shock tactics with Thieu today ... We
face the paradoxical situation that the North, which has
effectively lost, is acting as if it has won, while the South,
which has effectively won, is acting as if it has lost. One of the
major tasks now is to restore realities and get the psychological
upper hand ...
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to exaggerate the toughness of Thieu's position. His
demands verge on insanity. ... He is totally oblivious to the scope
of North Vietnam's concessions.
</P>
<P>
   If North Vietnam offers to sign a peace agreement, Kissinger
continues, then ...
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given Thieu's present state of mind, it is not at all certain
that he would maintain his outward balance and my trip might just
push him over the edge ...
</P>
<P>
   (But the alternative) is another round of war. I know the
president's objections to ending the bombing, but I do not think
they apply to the present situation. Ending the bombing would
support the public impression that an agreement is near. Failure to
end it would ask Hanoi to endure several more weeks of punishment
because of a refusal by Saigon to go along with an agreement in
which North Vietnam made almost unbelievable concessions ...
</P>
<P>
   While we have a moral case for bombing North Vietnam when it
does not accept our proposals, it seems to be really stretching the
point to bomb North Vietnam when it has accepted our proposals and
when South Vietnam has not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Eds: The United States bombed Hanoi severely during Christmas
1972.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   That same day, Oct. 22, the American ambassador in South
Vietnam, Ellsworth Bunker, sent top secret cables to the White
House describing Thieu's side of the conversation with Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   Thieu responded by saying ... ``The issue is the life and death
of South Vietnam and its 17 million people ... Our position is very
unfortunate. We have been very faithful to the Americans and now
feel we are being sacrificed ... If the United States wants to
abandon the South Vietnamese people, that is their right ... If we
accept the document as it stands, we will commit suicide _ and I
will be committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 1, 1974: Nixon has already resigned. The fall of Saigon is
seven months away. In a characteristic cable, Graham Martin, the
final U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, sends a situation report to
Kissinger, now secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Propaganda by those American puppets of Hanoi (in the American
press and among American politicians) has almost totally obscured
the fact that enormous changes have taken place here in the past
year: It is now my objective conclusion that South Vietnam's forces
have matured into an effective military machine, increasingly
capable of handling, successfully, the entire range of the
capabilities possessed by North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces
arrayed against it ...
</P>
<P>
   Winning more money for the war from Congress, and winning the
upper hand in the war, Martin continues ...
</P>
<P>
   Will require a determination to take on the well-organized
propaganda apparatus and expose its gross distortions for what they
really are: the most blatant and vicious campaign to deceive the
Congress and the American people that has been mounted since the
early '50s ...
</P>
<P>
   It will also require overcoming the tendency of the bureaucracy
to be paralyzed by the passion to be ``credible'' and
``apologetic'' to the critics on the Hill being manipulated by the
network of Hanoi puppets ...
</P>
<P>
   Washington is where the trouble is _ not Vietnam. I do not
minimize the difficulties, but I regard the achievement of the goal
as a perfectly feasible one _ assuming, as I do, that the new team
in Washington has the guts and the same capacity for plain hard
work as currently is in evidence in Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   Given the importance of the stakes _ nothing less will do.
Martin.

Saigon to the White House explain a sticky situation. Days before
the 1972 presidential elections in the United States, after months
of secret negotiations, Kissinger had declared: ``Peace is at
hand.'' But he had not yet explained its terms to the president of
South Vietnam, Nguyen Van Thieu.
</P>
<P>
   I will proceed with some shock tactics with Thieu today ... We
face the paradoxical situation that the North, which has
effectively lost, is acting as if it has won, while the South,
which has effectively won, is acting as if it has lost. One of the
major tasks now is to restore realities and get the psychological
upper hand ...
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to exaggerate the toughness of Thieu's position. His
demands verge on insanity. ... He is totally oblivious to the scope
of North Vietnam's concessions.
</P>
<P>
   If North Vietnam offers to sign a peace agreement, Kissinger
continues, then ...
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given Thieu's present state of mind, it is not at all certain
that he would maintain his outward balance and my trip might just
push him over the edge ...
</P>
<P>
   (But the alternative) is another round of war. I know the
president's objections to ending the bombing, but I do not think
they apply to the present situation. Ending the bombing would
support the public impression that an agreement is near. Failure to
end it would ask Hanoi to endure several more weeks of punishment
because of a refusal by Saigon to go along with an agreement in
which North Vietnam made almost unbelievable concessions ...
</P>
<P>
   While we have a moral case for bombing North Vietnam when it
does not accept our proposals, it seems to be really stretching the
point to bomb North Vietnam when it has accepted our proposals and
when South Vietnam has not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Eds: The United States bombed Hanoi severely during Christmas
1972.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   That same day, Oct. 22, the American ambassador in South
Vietnam, Ellsworth Bunker, sent top secret cables to the White
House describing Thieu's side of the conversation with Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   Thieu responded by saying ... ``The issue is the life and death
of South Vietnam and its 17 million people ... Our position is very
unfortunate. We have been very faithful to the Americans and now
feel we are being sacrificed ... If the United States wants to
abandon the South Vietnamese people, that is their right ... If we
accept the document as it stands, we will commit suicide _ and I
will be committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 1, 1974: Nixon has already resigned. The fall of Saigon is
seven months away. In a characteristic cable, Graham Martin, the
final U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, sends a situation report to
Kissinger, now secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Propaganda by those American puppets of Hanoi (in the American
press and among American politicians) has almost totally obscured
the fact that enormous changes have taken place here in the past
year: It is now my objective conclusion that South Vietnam's forces
have matured into an effective military machine, increasingly
capable of handling, successfully, the entire range of the
capabilities possessed by North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces
arrayed against it ...
</P>
<P>
   Winning more money for the war from Congress, and winning the
upper hand in the war, Martin continues ...
</P>
<P>
   Will require a determination to take on the well-organized
propaganda apparatus and expose its gross distortions for what they
really are: the most blatant and vicious campaign to deceive the
Congress and the American people that has been mounted since the
early '50s ...
</P>
<P>
   It will also require overcoming the tendency of the bureaucracy
to be paralyzed by the passion to be ``credible'' and
``apologetic'' to the critics on the Hill being manipulated by the
network of Hanoi puppets ...
</P>
<P>
   Washington is where the trouble is _ not Vietnam. I do not
minimize the difficulties, but I regard the achievement of the goal
as a perfectly feasible one _ assuming, as I do, that the new team
in Washington has the guts and the same capacity for plain hard
work as currently is in evidence in Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   Given the importance of the stakes _ nothing less will do.
Martin.

<P>
   It is OK for the federal government to print ``In God We Trust''
on umpteen billion pieces of currency, but it is by no means OK for
the state of Ohio to use the motto, ``With God, All Things Are
Possible'' on its official seal or anywhere else, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ruled the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati
last week in a 30-page decision that reads like
Thomas-Aquinas-takes-the-bar-exam. Lesser minds may have trouble
following the logic, but in the end it comes down to something like
this: References to a particular religion are forbidden; general
references to God are not.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's slogan is a quotation from the New Testament and is
therefore clearly Christian, the court said. ``In God We Trust''
comes from ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' by Francis Scott Key and is
not a reference to a specific faith.
</P>
<P>
   The latest skirmish over the separation of church and state has
its roots in 1959, when the Ohio Legislature approved ``With God,
All Things Are Possible,'' as the state's official motto. It had
been the idea of a 12-year-old Cincinnati boy who was concerned
that Ohio was the only state without a motto.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio had a history of motto trouble. In 1866, the legislature
had approved the motto ``Imperium in Imperio,'' Latin for ``An
Empire Within an Empire.'' But there was a great outcry over the
``pretentious feudal meaning'' of the phrase, according to the Ohio
Historical Society, and the legislation was repealed a year later.
Ohio remained motto-free for almost 92 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 1959 motto languished in obscurity until 1996, when Sen.
George Voinovich, a Republican who was then the governor of Ohio,
returned from a trip to India, where he noticed the slogan,
``Government Work Is God's Work'' on a public building. He began
pushing to have Ohio's motto inscribed on a building at the state
Capitol, prompting the American Civil Liberties Union to file a
lawsuit to have it banned.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Columbus ruled that the motto could be used,
as long as the state did not cite its Christian origin. But the
appeals court overturned that ruling in its 2-1 decision last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the words of Jesus speaking about salvation,'' said Mark
Cohn, the lawyer who handled the case for the ACLU. ``It's an
expression of Ohio looking favorably on Christianity. It's not the
same as `In God We Trust.' No one knows what that means.''
</P>
<P>
   As the length of the opinion suggests, this was not an easy call
for the appeals court. Quoting from a 1972 Supreme Court case about
public financing of private schools, the opinion noted that the
line of separation between church and state, ``far from being a
wall, is a blurred, indistinct and variable depending on all the
circumstances of a particular relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous court decisions, and there have been many, have
approved the use of the words ``under God'' in the Pledge of
Allegiance, the decision noted. And it was long ago settled that
prayers could be recited at the opening of Congress. For a public
body to invoke divine guidance is not a step toward the
establishment of a religion, one ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   The mottos of some states include the word ``God,'' the opinion
said, but Ohio's is the only one that contains a direct quotation
from either the Old or New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is
taken directly from the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 19, Verse 26, in
which Jesus is quoted as saying, ``It is easier for a camel to pass
through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the
kingdom of God.'' Asked who, then can be saved, Jesus replied,
``With men, this is impossible, but with God all things are
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU argued that the motto, therefore, constitutes an
endorsement of the Christian religion, but lawyers for the state
contended that the origin of the words is irrelevant. In fact, they
said, few people know the origin of the motto, which was intended
only to encourage hope and acknowledge the humility of Ohio's
government and its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the line, the appeals court ruled, the state of Ohio
had crossed it. ``While the words of the motto might not overtly
favor Christianity,'' the court said, ``as the words of Jesus,
they, at a minimum, demonstrate a particular affinity toward
Christianity in the eyes and ears of a reasonable observer.'' The
Ohio Legislature, the court added, ``in following the suggestion of
the 12-year-old boy who suggested the words of Jesus as the
official motto of the state, has given an unconstitutional
preference to Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   It is probably unnecessary to mention that the state of Ohio
plans to appeal.

   DETROIT _ For anyone living inside Washington's Beltway during
an election year, it often appears as though political campaigns
are taking over the country. The hinterlands complain loudly about
the number of advertisements on television and radio. Fund-raisers
raise seemingly enormous sums.
</P>
<P>
   But drive 525 miles northwest to the Motor City, home to some of
the world's largest companies, and the perspective changes. In a
typical year, the auto industry spends more than 100 times as much
on advertising as the presidential candidates combined. Even the
nearly $70 million that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas raised before
the first vote was cast in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1
seems like spare change in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't even get the attention of a top auto executive about
anything less than $250 million,'' said Gerald Meyers, a former
chairman and chief executive of the American Motors Corp. ``They
drool more down the sides of their mouths at breakfast than $70
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry ad spending is enormous _ $1 in every $7 of all
advertising spending in this country _ because the companies are
huge. General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler each have about
eight times the annual sales of the Microsoft Corp., and are each
considerably larger than all the world's airlines put together.
Years of budget cuts in Washington, coupled with mergers in the
auto industry, have left few government departments operating on
the same scale as the automakers; the nation's annual military
budget is now only 74 percent larger than GM's annual revenue,
although the armed forces are still able to employ far more people
because soldiers earn much less than auto workers.
</P>
<P>
   With some Americans increasingly inured to advertising, media
manipulation has become more important. The media operations of
automakers dwarf those of the presidential campaigns. GM has 150
press officers worldwide; the Bush campaign has only four. Both
also have many media assistants who are not authorized to talk to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   While auto shows do not yet attract the 15,000 journalists who
show up for the Democratic and Republican conventions, they are
drawing more attention, like the 4,000 journalists who have shown
up for New York's auto show, which ends April 30. More than a third
of the 5,700 journalists who covered Detroit's auto show in January
were from overseas, because mergers have made the industry more
global.
</P>
<P>
   There are some differences, of course, between the political and
automotive press. Newspapers and TV networks pay the bills for the
political journalists who troop on and off campaign buses. But
automakers pay for many journalists covering the introductions of
new models at auto shows and elsewhere; a few organizations,
including The New York Times, decline free trips.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers put reporters up in luxury hotel rooms costing up
to $600 a night, often inviting spouses and domestic partners, too,
although the manufacturers have cracked down to prevent journalists
from bringing along dirty laundry to be cleaned at $5 a shirt and
up. And while the political campaigners trudge to places like Des
Moines and Manchester, N.H., the automakers compete to fly
journalists to exotic settings that will provide unusual backdrops
for photography: BMW's Land Rover showed off its Discovery sport
utility vehicle by shuttling writers and photographers to the Gobi
Desert in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   If politicians get their message across on surprisingly small
budgets, do automakers get their money's worth as they try to
establish their brand images through much more extensive
advertising and public relations? The executives say they have
little choice about the spending, and that their ads are not just
another part of the ``white noise'' of American culture. There are
two dozen automakers in this country, some selling scores of models
_ 75 in GM's case _ so it takes much more advertising than it does
to promote a few presidential candidates. News coverage also
reinforces political campaign advertising and the public's
awareness of politicians' names in a way auto executives can only
dream about.
</P>
<P>
   Negative ads may be cost effective for politicians, but they are
rare in the auto industry. Any given car competes with so many
other models that it is hard to criticize all of the alternatives
even with a big ad budget. Auto executives also change jobs often
enough that they do not want to hit a potential future employer too
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a gentleman's club _ they don't like to beat each
other to death,'' said Jack Trout, a marketing consultant in
Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced marketers like Roger Adams, who made his name at
PepsiCo by reviving Mountain Dew and is now general manager of GM's
Buick division, unsurprisingly contend that auto ads are better
than campaign ads. ``A lot of political advertising is a blatant
sell, and that turns people off,'' said Adams, who has begun to
revive Buick by hiring Tiger Woods, the golfer, as its ad pitchman.
``If I see another Bush ad, I think I'll scream _ it's all `I've
done this, I've done that.'''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Twenty years after the death of Tito,
Yugo-nostalgia wafts through the remnant of the Yugoslavia he
created. And everywhere here, despite the continuing sway of
Slobodan Milosevic, there is a strong feeling of fin-de-regime,
that another era of personal rule is coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   A mysterious radio station called Radio Nostalgia, its owners
and finances unclear, plays songs of the Tito era and has become
one of the most popular in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Prompt anyone over 30 about the past and they will immediately
talk about how respected Yugoslavia used to be, how wonderful were
the summers on the Croatian coast, how easy it was to travel the
world without a visa, how shopping trips to Italy were common and
how often young people were sent abroad, to the United States or
Europe, for vacations and school.
</P>
<P>
   To be the pampered buffer between East and West, anti-Soviet and
anti-imperialist and members neither of the Warsaw Pact nor NATO,
meant easy access anywhere. Yugoslav Communism was relatively
liberal and relatively rich, and could seem a form of model for the
rest of Eastern Europe. Tito helped found the nonaligned movement,
which had real meaning in a world of competitive superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   So when Tito died on May 4, 1980, after a long illness, millions
of people wept _ as millions of Russians did when Stalin died in
1953 _ for an uncertain future without the nation's guiding star.
But Yugo-nostalgia is not the same sad plaint as Communist
nostalgia in the rest of the East. Yugoslavia is the one place in
Europe that was almost surely better off in the past, closer then
than now to acceptance and inclusion in the West and further,
politically, from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in this incredibly shrinking country, when even tiny
Montenegro talks of independence, there is a continuing sense of
bewilderment, poverty and farce, of helplessness as the Milosevic
era goes through its lengthy death throes.
</P>
<P>
   With ethnic wars, Western sanctions and visa restrictions, most
people under 30 have barely traveled, not even to Croatia.
Milosevic himself, indicted for war crimes, cannot travel abroad.
He cannot even go to Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic that he
titularly rules as the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his influential wife, Mirjana Markovic, present
his defiance in the face of Washington and NATO's bombing as the
act of a new Tito, the founder of a new bloc of anti-hegemonistic
nations _ like Russia, China and Belarus _ that will stand up to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serbs are sophisticated enough to take this as pathetic
nonsense. They know they are associated with a group of countries
that care less about Yugoslavia than Yugoslavia cares about them.
</P>
<P>
   While China has helped the regime greatly with credits, loans
and investments, and the Russians have helped with deliveries of
energy, both have much more business to do with the United States.
Vladimir Putin won the Russian presidency, not a Communist, and he
has met with the Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic. Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov has even urged Belgrade to be more reasonable
toward the U.N. mandate in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Tito _ Tito!'' was the reassuring but empty slogan in
the years that followed his passing 20 years ago, an era when a
clumsy collective presidency ran the country and decentralization
seemed to be an answer to disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of Communist ``brotherhood and unity,'' a new
form of enforced multiethnicity, Tito had tried to draw a line
under Yugoslavia's bloody past. But nationalism stayed alive in
people's minds, to emerge with vengeance after 1989, when the rest
of Communism was disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism was the simplest alternative ideology for Communist
parties seeking to keep their hold on power. Even though he kept a
portrait of Tito in his office until 1991, Milosevic tried to ride
the new tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic originally saw his role as a Serbian Tito, running a
Yugoslavia that the Serbs would dominate. ``His main miscalculation
was to think the West would never allow the disintegration of
Yugoslavia,'' said Aleksa Djilas, a historian and political
analyst. ``If we had a time machine, and could go back to 1990
knowing what we know now, I'm not sure the West would have allowed
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one even thinks ``After Milosevic _ Milosevic!''
Instead, one graffiti scrawl in Belgrade, referring to Tito, reads:
``And even the lockmaker was better.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fecklessness of the so-called democratic opposition
to Milosevic, the circles around the regime _ held together by
money, privilege, corruption and power _ are edgy, if not yet
disloyal. Even those who believe that the Socialists can remain on
top understand there will have to be a different leader. But the
problem with Milosevic handing over to a loyalist is that the West
has indicted his most trusted allies.
</P>
<P>
   Disaffection with the regime is widespread, undermined only by
fear of the future and of the opposition's chaotic rivalries. Yet
any fair election _ and there will be local and federal elections
this year and vital Serbian elections before the end of next year _
seems sure to deliver a stinging blow to the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Some here like to quote Markovic, who once warned opponents that
the Communists came to power through armed struggle, not
negotiations, and will leave the same way. But the country has
choked on blood and fratricidal wars that have brought it only
disintegration and decline. And Milosevic cannot be sure, if he
tries to override a clear loss in elections, that the army and
police will back him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when his term as Yugoslav president expires next year, he
could take another role _ possibly as Yugoslav or Serbian prime
minister, or remain as Socialist Party leader _ to keep influence
over the country and over his own fate, especially in the face of
Western demands that he be extradited. In any event, Djilas
believes that Milosevic is a legalist who will not only hold
elections but also abide by them if the results are clear enough.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the finest novel by Ivo Andric, the Bosnian-born
novelist most famous for writing ``Bridge over the Drina,'' is
``Bosnian Chronicle.'' Set in the Napoleonic era, it is a story of
Western power and rivalries, represented by the French and Austrian
consuls, played out in a small outpost of a relatively indifferent
Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   As Napoleon finally begins to suffer defeat after defeat, the
French consul, Daville, finds that he is treated differently. Even
in his own mind, there has been a sudden shift that leaves him
feeling ``only a great emptiness,'' as he comes to think about life
``without Napoleon as the basic assumption.'' He was, Andric
writes, ``sharing the experience of thousands of French people at
that time, exhausted in the service of a regime that had in fact
been defeated long ago, because it had been obliged to ask of
people more than they could give.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, 20 years after Tito's death, Serbs feel what Daville
felt. The Milosevic regime has exhausted them and itself through
one sacrifice after another, some self-inflicted, some imposed.
While no one foresees the end, everyone feels it coming.

<P>
   The prospect or hope or threat that a big new casino may be on
the way to the Catskills, just 90 miles from Manhattan, stirs mixed
emotions among New York's casino frequenters. Residing within 90
minutes of the Monticello Raceway, the proposed site of yet another
gambling enterprise, means reducing by almost half the time it
takes to get to the action in Atlantic City or in Connecticut. That
is the promise. The threat is identical: In an hour and a half you
can be dropping the family savings into the latest in slot machines
or at old-style craps, blackjack and like diversions.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of gambling shows little sign of abating. Along with
most casino patrons, I remain agnostic about the moral and social
considerations. Granted, gambling may not be the most edifying of
pastimes; gamblers could assuredly broaden themselves by reading
best sellers and watching wrestling instead of whiling away the
hours in clockless rooms. On the other hand, whose business is it
if adults find pleasure in throwing away their money, and why
shouldn't it be thrown away in New York instead of Connecticut or
New Jersey? (Compulsive gamblers no doubt require treatment, but
not, most players must agree, at the expense of everyone else or as
an excuse for crackdowns by busybodies.)
</P>
<P>
   What needs to be added in favor of casinos, moreover, is an
appeal that goes beyond the basic ``gaming,'' as its promoters
prefer to call gambling. Casino visitors find themselves part of a
welcoming community with one thing on its collective mind. Along
with the opportunity to take a flier against the odds on a
sprinkling of roulette numbers, there is admittance to a
camaraderie of hope in opposition to fate's negative forces.
</P>
<P>
   That is what you can see in the busloads of anticipation that
roll up to the casinos every morning. That is what you can hear in
the cheers, hollers and squeals for a craps shooter in the throes
of a hot roll or when the dealer goes bust against the whole
blackjack table or when the slots light up and the coins clang in
their jolly fashion. It is not just the joy of winning, but of
winning as part of a team. The relationships are not enduring, but
they offer a sort of stimulation that workaday existence rarely
provides. Those heady moments of unity and celebration keep players
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   In my own preferred casino pastime, poker, the situation is
different from most other games, since the patrons compete against
one another, and the house takes its cut regardless of who wins.
But here, too, the contestants, though competitors, are united in
the action.
</P>
<P>
   Poker players tend to spend more time with one another than
players at other casino games; it is not unusual for an enthusiast
to fiddle with his chips and study his down cards for 10 hours at a
stretch. After a couple of shift changes, players and dealers are
on a first-name basis. If you weaken and drop out around midnight,
be assured that on your return for the early-morning activity, you
will find some of the companions you left behind still at it.
</P>
<P>
   But morning or night, when you join in, you immediately become
part of a small, dedicated fraternity, bound like Freemasons by the
rules of the society. There is a sense in the poker room of being
among the anointed, at several degrees of separation from the
robots at the slots or the suckers battling the odds at games with
names like Caribbean Stud, which bear a deceptive resemblance to
real poker but which the poker vet scorns as inventions that give
the house a considerable edge.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say a poker table is always a convivial place;
tension can make for testiness. But it is not unusual for a player
who has just lost a big hand to a worthy competitor to offer
sincere congratulations to the winner. Conversation at the table is
not wide ranging and initiates tend to be careful about giving
offense. Politics is generally avoided and racial or ethnic slurs
are definitely out. The main subject, a safe one, is about the
straight you didn't make or the miracle flush that you caught on
Fifth Street. Everyone can share in the lamentation or rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   But set aside snobbery; even slot-machine addicts feel they are
part of a club. Whatever game you favor, the casino makes it easy
to join up. Women and men, blacks and whites, the disabled and the
able bodied _ all are welcome. Democracy prevails: Among these
strangers, the player finds a home. As the poker regulars like to
say, all you need is a chair and a chip.
</P>
<P>
   That is the special lure of the casino, be it upstate or
downstate or on the reservation. For your time at the table or at
the machine, loneliness is abolished; you are among a cadre of the
like minded. Win or lose, the world seems a friendlier place.
</P>
<P>
   All right, if you win, it is a little more friendly.

<P>
   Look closely at a few typical events on the campaign trail these
days and the true targets of this presidential election quickly
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Al Gore recently talked about education (a major
concern to suburban mothers) in Columbus, Ohio (the swing city in a
swing state). George W. Bush unveiled his new ``compassionate
conservative'' agenda on health care, home ownership and tax cuts
(another bid for the center, especially women, who rank health care
high) in Cleveland and St. Louis (both in traditionally swing
states with a combined total of 32 electoral votes). Gore went to
the drug store with an older woman who lacks prescription drug
coverage (big, big issue with the elderly).
</P>
<P>
   Every presidential candidate at this stage of the game swears he
would fight for every state and every vote in this richly diverse
country. But the ugly little truth is that some states are more
important than others, not just because they are big (with a lot of
electoral votes) but because they are up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   As the primary season was dominated by New Hampshire, the
general election campaign will most likely be ruled by an arc of
big industrial states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan,
Illinois and Missouri. Or, as a gleeful David Leland, chairman of
the Ohio Democratic Party, puts it: ``Bush was here yesterday and
Gore was here last week. I suspect we'll see a lot of both.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a demographic corollary: Some groups of voters will get
more attention than others _ like elderly voters, the legendary
800-pound gorillas of politics, who used to be reliably Democratic
but in recent elections have swung toward the Republicans; married
suburban mothers, an important part of the Clinton vote but now a
battleground between Bush and Gore; and Catholics, once the
quintessential Reagan Democrats, pulled one way by their cultural
conservatism and another by their instincts on domestic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the strategic thinking in the parties these days
revolves around these groups and these states. For example, Celinda
Lake, a Democratic pollster, talks about ``the Reagan seniors, aged
60 to 70,'' who tend to be more affluent than older retirees but
also very responsive to the idea of expanding Medicare to cover
prescription drugs _ which many of them suddenly need.
</P>
<P>
   Put the geography and the demographics together, and a
65-year-old woman (a high likelihood of voting) in a Macomb County,
Mich., suburb, with an affection for the Bush family (a Republican
advantage), a concern for the country's values (ditto) and mounting
medication bills (a Democratic advantage) can look like ground zero
in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This targeting also explains why some candidates for the vice
presidential nomination become so compelling _ like Gov. Tom Ridge
of Pennsylvania, the popular Catholic governor of a battleground
state, who suddenly appeals to so many Republicans. Some Democrats
say Bush has a problem with white Catholics, not just because of
the criticism over his visit to Bob Jones University in the primary
season, but also because of the Southern conservative dominance of
the party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge would neatly provide geographic and cultural balance,
although his support for abortion rights carries risk for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the effort will be confined to those states in the
middle, of course. For some time to come, each candidate will be
probing for weaknesses and targets of opportunity in the other's
base. Most notably, Bush is making forays into California, which
the Democrats carried by wide margins in the last two elections;
the Republicans are running advertising aimed at Hispanics, hoping
that Bush's appeal to that voting bloc in Texas is transferable.
And Gore is paying attention to Florida, a Republican-leaning state
whose governor, Jeb Bush, has a personal stake in the election.
</P>
<P>
   But most experts see the electoral map as pro-Republican in the
South and Mountain West, pro-Democratic on the West Coast and
Northeast, and up for grabs in much of the industrial heartland.
Charles Cook, who publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter,
said, ``They don't have strong liberal tendencies like the
Northeast or the West Coast and they don't have strong conservative
tendencies like the Southern and Rocky Mountain states.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Teeter, a pollster long active in Republican politics, said
of that arc of battleground states: ``Because they're big, they
have all the elements in them that the country has _ they have
rural areas that are Republican, small towns that are Republican,
suburbs with a lot of swing votes, big cities with union members
and blacks that are Democratic.'' This long-running role in
presidential politics, he added, has given rise to the axiom that
no Republican has ever been elected president who didn't win Ohio.

</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This political map can change, and has. Most notably, the once
solidly Democratic South realigned to the Republicans in
presidential voting in the late 1960s. For much of the 1980s, the
Republicans were considered to have an ``electoral lock'' on the
presidency because of their strength in the South and California.
But California, which has 54 electoral votes, began turning to the
Democrats in 1988, when Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
nominee, lost it narrowly in what was nationally a sweeping defeat
for the Democrats. In the last two elections, Democrats have
anchored their victories on the coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The important demographics can also shift. The over-60 vote went
to the Republicans by a surprising margin of 10 percentage points
in the 1998 midterm elections, according to the exit polls.
``Senior women are anywhere from 12 to 15 percent of the
electorate,'' said Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster. ``They will
vote at an 80 to 85 percent clip.''
</P>
<P>
   Many pollsters say the tug of war for older voters will be
between their attraction for Republican leadership on values _
including Bush's promise to ``uphold the honor and dignity of the
office'' and a general concern over the country's moral direction _
and Democratic promises to protect Medicare and Social Security.
``Once very specific Medicare and Social Security issues go off the
table, values concerns come back,'' said Stan Greenberg, a
Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Bolger, a Republican pollster, grumbled that at the height
of the campaign, ``Democrats wake up every day saying, `What is it
we gotta do today? Oh, yeah, scare seniors and make sure the black
vote gets out.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer moms'' have become almost a cliche in presidential
politics, but married mothers are, if anything, likely to be more
important in this election than in years past. In large part, this
reflects Bush's greater personal appeal to this group and his
careful courtship on issues and style; from the start, his promise
of compassionate conservatism and emphasis on issues like education
showed his determination to close the gender gap.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press
showed how much better Bush was doing among mothers than the last
Republican nominee. In April 1996, 60 percent of mothers said they
were backing Clinton, while 37 percent said they were backing Dole.
Last month, 41 percent of mothers said they were backing Gore,
while 52 percent were backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the soccer mom cliche,'' Cook said, ``but I have to
tell you that middle- and upper-middle-income white women who
economically ought to be Republicans but on social and cultural
issues _ abortion, guns, education and health care _ gravitate to
the Democrats, will be important.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the demographic trends that cut across state lines,
states also have their idiosyncracies. The auto industry's
dominance in Michigan, for example, makes it almost inevitable that
the Bush campaign will try to paint Gore there as an environmental
extremist.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the focus on swing voters, the cardinal rule of
politics is to cultivate your base. Still, as this unusually long
post-primary, pre-convention political season drags on, the
battlegrounds are clear. And assuming the election stays
competitive, it will only get worse. ``If you want to know what
hell is like for a voter, it's a swing presidential state with a
key Senate race and an open congressional race,'' Bolger said.
``They're going to see so many political messages that there won't
be any actual news _ just 30 minutes of 30-second spots.''

THE CHALLENGE TO CHINA'S RULERS

   SHANGHAI, China _ Surely China's rulers never dreamed that a
spiritual movement started by a former grain company clerk could
turn into the most serious challenge to their authority since the
pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989. But that is what the brutal
suppression of the group called Falun Gong has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive media coverage of China's actions _ which have led to
at least a dozen deaths, alleged death by torture, thousands of
cases of abuse and the harassment of tens of thousands _ has
blighted the human rights reputation of the government.
</P>
<P>
   But little light has been cast on why so many people feel Falun
Gong, founded seven years ago and now claiming millions of
adherents, is worth dying for. Nor is it widely understood in the
West that aspects of the movement, or cult, suggest that its
followers are misled and its leader deluded, or even a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a closer examination of Falun Gong's beliefs and
practices challenges some of the easy assumptions about Beijing's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong's founder, Li Hongzhi, was one of many self-styled
masters of traditional Chinese breathing exercises, known as
qigong, to emerge during a resurgence of the discipline in the late
1980s and early 1990s. The exercises are meant to focus the body's
vital energy, which traditional Chinese medicine calls qi. This
energy has its mundane uses, like improving one's health and sense
of well-being. But there has always been a supernatural
undercurrent to its cultivation, which has included the belief that
qigong can also be used to develop the ability to fly, to move
objects by telekinesis and to heal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Li differentiated himself from other qigong masters by wrapping
his regimen in a cosmology that promises salvation through the
refinement of one's character until the body literally evolves into
another form of matter. At that point, the saved person is capable
of flying to paradise, which may exist out in the cosmos, or in
another dimension.
</P>
<P>
   He said interracial children are the spawn of the ``Dharma
Ending Period,'' a Buddhist phrase that refers to an era of moral
degeneration. In an interview last year, he said each race has its
own paradise, and he later told followers in Australia that, ``The
yellow people, the white people, and the black people have
corresponding races in heaven.'' As a result, he said, interracial
children have no place in heaven without his intervention.
</P>
<P>
   He also included many China's folk superstitions, including
references to fox and weasel spirits, which make Falun Gong
attractive to the masses. It offered a homegrown religion, not the
staid precepts of state-sanctioned Buddhism and Taoism, or the
foreign feel of Christianity. And it did so at a time when
religious interest was on the rise, as disillusioned Chinese sought
spiritual solace in the wake of the massacre of pro-democracy
demonstrators in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Li preaches a number of other peculiar doctrines, among them
that the Earth is gradually being infiltrated by aliens. ``Some
people you see walking on the streets are, in fact, not humans,''
he told followers last year. He reports seeing green, blue and
multicolored beings in other dimensions, and says the magician
David Copperfield can fly. Li claims that he, too, can fly, though
he says it is against his enlightened nature to do so in public.

   None of this is metaphorical. In an interview last year, Li said
all of the things he talks about are real, though he is constrained
in describing them by the limitations of human language. What makes
such pronouncements more than harmless eccentricity is that Li also
exhorts his followers to ``defend the Fa,'' or law, as described by
his teachings, praising those who confront China's often brutish
state police.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Jimmy Zhou, an accountant and emigrant to the United
States, who returned to China late last year to help keep the
banned movement alive. Soon afterward, he was arrested, beaten and
humiliated for a week before being released.
</P>
<P>
   That Zhou should have to suffer for his beliefs is an ugly
commonplace of totalitarian societies, though in this instance that
may well play into the hands of the movement the government is
trying to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them in the tradition of millennarian movements in
Chinese history, movements that talk about a new world coming and
have often spelled the end of a regime,'' says Merle Goldman, a
professor of Chinese history at Boston University. ``They start out
as nonpoliticized movements, but the way the government reacts
politicizes them.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhou insists, based on Li's teachings, that the French had
discovered a 2-billion-year-old nuclear reactor in Africa, evidence
of a prehistoric civilization that practiced Falun Gong. Li's
teachings also instruct Zhou that mankind has been ``left in
complete destruction'' 81 times and that another round of
destruction may be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou spoke ominously of this coming upheaval. ``Something is
going to happen,'' he said. ``That doesn't mean a catastrophe, but
there will be some sudden change that will be good for good people,
but bad for bad people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is just this sort of theologizing that disturbs Chinese
leaders. China has an uneducated, increasingly restive population,
one historically prone to swift and often disastrous alignments
behind charismatic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Beijing's crackdown on the group was neither swift
nor unconsidered. On April 25 last year, more than 10,000 Falun
Gong followers surrounded Beijing's leadership compound on the 10th
anniversary of the start of the 1989 pro-democracy protests. This
amounted to a direct challenge to the party, and as such, Falun
Gong's act was inherently political and certain to provoke a harsh
response. Beijing claimed the demonstration was orchestrated by Li,
who first denied, then admitted, being in China the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Until that demonstration, however, Falun Gong was tolerated and
even enjoyed the open support of some government officials.
Millions of followers congregated in public parks and plazas across
the country each morning for group exercises. The Chinese press
grew increasingly critical of the group in 1998 and early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, after Beijing Television broadcast a program
critical of the group, Falun Gong followers besieged the station.
The municipal government told the station to resolve the dispute
before the sensitive anniversary of the 1989 pro-democracy killings
on June 4, a date on which the government is wary of any
gatherings. The TV station buckled, fired the reporter who had
produced the program and broadcast a positive piece on Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   In the following months, the group staged dozens of such actions
across the country, culminating in the Beijing demonstration on
April 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong is no more tolerant of the Western press. When I
wrote last year about a $600,000 New Jersey home bought by Li's
wife (Li said the house was actually a gift from a follower that
was later returned), Li's spokesman, Zhang Erping, told me on the
telephone, ``How does it feel to know that millions of Falun Gong
practitioners in China know your name.'' Afterwards, I received
dozens of e-mail messages and faxes from angry Falun Gong
followers, including one from Lili Feng, an assistant professor at
Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, who warned, ``You will get
paid back for what you said and did by gods.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong has not been implicated in any violent acts, though
Beijing clearly fears any mass movement it does not control. But it
is particularly affronted by religious faith. Atheism is the
official party, and preferred state, faith.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Beijing regime has no moral credibility with
which to fight an expressly spiritual foe. It cannot put forward
its own view of spirituality, since it hasn't got one. The upshot
is that the party is increasingly threatened by any belief system
that challenges its ideology. And if the followers of such a belief
system demonstrate an ability to organize as well, the party may
well feel it has no option but to attack it to retain its hold on
power.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Falun Gong constitutes a genuine threat to the
party, Richard Baum, acting director of the Center for Chinese
Studies at UCLA, said: ``Only in the sense that it has the ability
to organize thousands of followers beyond the reach of the state.
In a `normal' society, there would not be repeated displays of
state force against thousands of passive, peaceful citizens who
were committing no crime other than bearing witness to their
beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong followers show no sign of giving up the fight. One of
them, Wang Jinzhi, has been detained three times for her beliefs
and is now banned from entering the country, where she has a
husband and child. But she said on Thursday from Japan, ``I believe
that in the near future not only China but the whole world will
recognize Falun Gong as the law of the universe that created
life.''

<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ On the radio waves and television
screens, the conflict often appears stark and simple: The battle in
Zimbabwe, it seems, is a battle between blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressors are the landless black supporters of President
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Their enemies are the prosperous white
farmers, who own more than half of that country's fertile land. The
issue is land redistribution and the prominent victims are white
men whose haggard faces feature on the evening news here in
Zimbabwe's neighbor, South Africa, and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But what, then, accounts for the predominantly black body count?
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, 11 people have been killed in Zimbabwe. Of
those victims, only two were white. In reality, the people bearing
the brunt of that country's seething political violence are poor,
landless and overwhelmingly black.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the struggle in Zimbabwe is less about race
and land than it is about one ruling party's struggle to keep its
virtual monopoly of power. For while Mugabe rages about the white
enemy, his supporters have quietly recognized that ordinary blacks
pose the more potent political threat.
</P>
<P>
   It is the black majority that has the power to end the ruling
party's overwhelming control of Parliament in coming elections, now
tentatively scheduled for May. And for the first time in 20 years,
the ordinary blacks of Zimbabwe _ who are weary of soaring
inflation, deepening poverty and government corruption _ seem
inclined to do just that. Most of the blacks who died were killed
because they opposed Mugabe's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a situation where more and more black people are
saying, `Let's get rid of this government,''' said John Makumbe, a
political science professor at the University of Zimbabwe. ``And
violence is being perpetrated against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole land and race issue is a classic diversion of
attention from the real issues which are facing this country, high
levels of unemployment, inflation and poverty,'' Makumbe said.
``What you really have is a government under siege trying to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the government call it old-style despotism. And it
rings a strikingly discordant note in a corner of the world where
democracy and freedom of political expression has flourished in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, four democracies here at the foot of the continent _
South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Mozambique _ elected presidents
in contested elections that were deemed free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   And leaders from this region who have willingly and freely given
up power _ men like Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Sir Ketumile
Masire of Botswana _ are winning respect as elder statesmen as they
mediate conflicts in Burundi and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Mugabe, who once inspired and sheltered black
freedom fighters across the region. But today, as he and his allies
support illegal land invasions of white-owned farms and stand by
without condemning attacks on opposition party members, many people
cannot help but shake their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe and his party, many critics say, have become too hungry
for power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's almost a caricature of all the things people think black
African leaders do,'' said Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa.
``He seems to be wanting to make a cartoon of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shattered because Mugabe is one of the most highly
qualified and most able leaders,'' Tutu said, in remarks to
European journalists that were published in news reports here.
``One just wants to weep. It's very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's governing party currently controls all but three seats
in Parliament. But it seems likely that voters will whittle away at
that dominant position.
</P>
<P>
   In February, voters handed Mugabe his first political defeat
since he became president 20 years ago. They rejected a
constitutional amendment that would have expanded his powers and
allowed the government to seize white-owned land without
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The serious attacks on black opponents began within weeks of
that defeat. And government critics say the ruling party has
deliberately played down those killings, hoping to distract the
public with vigorous rhetorical attacks on Zimbabwe's white
minority, who dominate the economy but make up less than 2 percent
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The black victims include an electrician, a policeman, a
pregnant woman and the driver of Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition
party leader; they were killed in clashes with supporters of the
government. Last week, two people were stoned to death.
</P>
<P>
   The killings typically receive only cursory mention in
Zimbabwe's government-controlled media and little coverage in the
foreign press, according to the Media Monitoring Project of
Zimbabwe, which monitors news coverage about that country.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers like The Daily News, Zimbabwe's only independent
daily, have reported more extensively on the deaths, noting they
are typically politically motivated with little to do with race or
land.
</P>
<P>
   But on April 22, the office of the Daily News was firebombed.
The government detained a South African photographer in connection
with the explosion, which shattered the newspaper's windows, but
injured no one.
</P>
<P>
   But journalists at the newspaper, which is critical of the
government, blame supporters of Mugabe. Two weeks ago, the
newspaper's editor in chief, who is black, received a death threat,
warning him to stop criticizing the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think race is the primary thing,'' said William Saidi,
the assistant editor of the Daily News. ``The general plan is to
silence all opposition.''

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, April 30:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM-VILLAGES (Khanh Hau, Vietnam) _ Vietnamese villages are
insular places. They absorb the pressures of history, adapt to them
and go on very much as before. In an often-repeated saying, the
mandate of the emperor stops at the village gate. ``Rural
communities have always been the real areas of negotiation,'' said
Shaun K. Malarney, a scholar of Vietnamese village life. The
history of Vietnam is not just the history of great national
events, he said; it is thousands of histories of individual
villages. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHASIA-TERROR (Undated) _ The State Department has for the
first time identified South Asia as a major hub of international
terrorism, accusing Pakistan, a traditional U.S. ally, and
especially Afghanistan of providing safe haven and support to
international terrorist groups. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-TRIBUNAL (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam) _ Sen. John Kerry
said Saturday that Cambodia and the United Nations had reached a
compromise that would allow the creation of an international court
to try former leaders of the Khmer Rouge. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-ECON (Seoul, South Korea) _ For a decade, experts have
watched North Korea suffer through one of the worst economic slides
of recent history and wondered when the country would finally
collapse. In the last year or so, though, as North Korea's
still-small modern sector has risen impressively, the question
seems to have shifted. Now people wonder who will win the horse
race between a dying Stalinist economy and a sprouting new one that
represents the country's first tentative steps into global
capitalism. By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   HUMAN-RIGHTS-FORUM (Geneva) _ After six weeks of review, debate
and bargaining at the annual session of the main U.N. human rights
forum, which ended on Friday, China emerged free of condemnation of
its human rights record while Russia and others were chastised. By
Elizabeth Olson.
</P>
<P>
   MOZAMBIQUE-REBUILD (Durban, South Africa) _ The angry waters
have receded in Mozambique but thousands of people remain homeless.
The floods swept away schools and clinics, crops and cattle. And
nearly two months after the torrential rains ravaged the country,
the painful work of rebuilding is only just beginning. By Rachel L.
Swarns.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-JAPAN (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ In their first meeting
as the new leaders of Russia and Japan, President Vladimir Putin
and Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori pledged Saturday to meet often,
call each other by their nicknames and to try to conclude a
long-sought peace treaty by the end of the year. Such a treaty
would formally end decades of antagonism between the two countries
over a group of islands seized by Russia at the end of World War
II. By Patrick E. Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-U.N. (Pristina, Kosovo) _ The eight-member delegation
from the U.N. Security Council, which came to Kosovo to give a
stern message to all sides to stop the violence and to urge on the
U.N. mission here, wound up its visit Saturday somewhat muted by
the complexities on the ground. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   RUBIN-PROFILE (Washington) _ During nearly eight years at the
side of the first woman to serve as secretary of state, James Rubin
fulfilled a number of roles: friend, adviser, protege, gossip
buddy, fashion consultant and self-described ``intellectual mate.''
Now, at 40, he is leaving Washington behind to move to London with
another high-powered woman, his wife, Christiane Amanpour, the CNN
foreign correspondent, who gave birth to their son a month ago. By
Christopher Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   CHECHNYA-GROZNY (Grozny, Russia) _ Now that the Russian
authorities have captured Grozny, they do not seem to know what to
do with it. The cost of rebuilding the ravaged city appears to be
more than the Kremlin is prepared to bear, especially since it
still faces a formidable task of restoring the rest of the battered
republic. By Michael R. Gordon.

<P>
   BUSH-ADVISER (Washington) _ Donald L. Evans has almost always
been present at the pivotal junctures in George W. Bush's life, an
important witness to the evolution of both the man and the
candidate and an integral part of his political campaigns. But
while Evans has attracted public notice over the last year solely
for his work as Bush's national finance chairman, his role is much
broader, deeper and less tidily defined than that. By Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-GORE-SURPLUS (Washington) _ This is the first presidential
election in memory where the candidates have a budget surplus to
discuss, not a deficit, and their sharply contradictory approaches
on how to use it are perhaps the biggest differences between Vice
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   NC-REPUBS (Asheboro, N.C.) _ As is so often the case in
Republican politics these days, the race for this state's
Republican nomination for governor has become a charge toward the
right, with candidates showing little restraint _ and often little
concern for the facts _ in painting each other as closet liberals.
By Kevin Sack.

<P>
   Malcolm Nance was kibitzing last week with the owner of a San
Diego travel agency who bragged that he had just sent some clients
on a trek to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Are you aware that they declared a state of emergency
in western Nepal two weeks ago?''' Nance recalled. ``The State
Department has put out advisories on numerous armed robberies by
Communist insurgents. I said, `You know, you could become liable if
your customers are kidnapped.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nance, a Navy veteran, is the chief consultant at Real World
Rescue, one of the leading companies that teach travel safety to
government and humanitarian agency workers, business travelers and,
increasingly, leisure travelers who are roaming the third world and
sometimes running into the kinds of trouble _ like kidnapping _
that aren't much covered in those cheery travel guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have terrorists now who specifically target Western
tourists, like in the Philippines,'' said Nance. He was referring
to an incident last Sunday on Sipadan Island in Malaysia, where 21
people, including 10 foreigners, were kidnapped from a luxury
diving resort. Islamic rebels from the nearby southern Philippines
claimed responsibility for the abduction. An American couple from
Rochester, N.Y., managed to escape after they frustrated the
terrorists by refusing demands to swim out to the kidnappers' boat.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, tourists have become primary targets,
Nance said. So-called special interest travel, encompassing
adventure travel, eco-tourism and journeys to exotic locales, is
the fastest-growing segment of the $519 billion U.S. travel market,
according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The model victim is no longer the U.S. government official, no
longer the corporate executive _ it's the first Western traveler
who's in sight when a kidnapper's goals need to be met,'' Nance
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nance's vocabulary brims with alarming terms _ hostage-taking,
for one _ that are seldom uttered by travel agencies. But a glance
at the travel warnings stacked up on a State Department Web site
(www.travel.state.gov) shows how trouble can intrude into an
itinerary with the urgency of a sudden dose of food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Examples abound. In March, two 19-year-old American women were
murdered in a beach resort in Costa Rica where, five months
earlier, two elderly Americans had been killed in a robbery. In
1999, rebels murdered eight foreigners _ four Britons, two
Americans and two New Zealanders _ among a group of tourists at
luxury camp sites in Bwindi National Park in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   In Algeria, ``U.S. citizens should not move anywhere in Algeria
unless accompanied by a known Algerian citizen,'' the State
Department said in a recent advisory. In Yemen, tribal clans have
kidnapped hundreds of foreigners, including the Polish ambassador,
over the last decade. American citizens were most recently
kidnapped there in January and October.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of countries like Yemen, if you're a tourist and you
happen to encounter that tribe that has a particular complaint that
day, they're going to say, `Hey, let's take him,''' said Nance, who
says he is amazed at how many people ignore the State Department's
``Travel Warning'' list.
</P>
<P>
   Nance's company, whose clients include organizations with
worldwide reach like the Peace Corps, teaches ways to avoid risk,
as well as survival skills to use when trouble does occur.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the courses designed for government and military
workers, and partly based on military survival and evasion training
techniques from the Vietnam War era, trainers pose as terrorists to
subject clients to a simulated ordeal of being abducted and held
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, isn't there an easier way to buy your way out of
potential trouble on the road? As a young comedian, Woody Allen
joked that he refused to join a gym to work on his self-defense
skills, opting instead to pay his body-building trainer ``to walk
me home at night.'' In fact, many top business people and some
leisure travelers now make their trips accompanied by travel
escorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while we'll hear people say, `Oh, can we hire
someone to go to Africa with us?''' Nance said. ``But that's having
bodyguards, which is a very specific thing for people with very
specific amounts of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Shuman, 29, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., calls himself a ``VIP
host.'' He said more and more people are hiring security guards to
accompany them _ even on domestic trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people at a certain level, like in these Internet
companies with a lot of money coming in really quickly _ people
flying in on their Gulfstreams and Citations _ having security can
be kind of a fashion statement,'' he said. ``Security looks cool,
almost like the Secret Service. But having security also can solve
a real problem. For one thing, it keeps them from getting bothered
when they're in a restaurant or a club.''

   Monopoly Medicine
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's future? Split in two, if the government gets its
way. The Justice Department and states suing Microsoft told a
federal judge those are the appropriate remedies for a company the
court has ruled is a ``predatory'' monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   The government proposal calls for Microsoft's Windows operating
system to be placed in one company, while the other company would
get the rest including the Word word processor, Excel spreadsheet
and the MSN Internet service. There are also a smorgasbord of curbs
on Microsoft's conduct that would last three years. And the two
companies cannot get back together for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is now in the lap of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
But appeals could take years. Microsoft calls the plan ``extreme,
reckless and not justified by the evidence in the case.'' Two of
the 19 states in the suit apparently agreed, declining to support
the breakup proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Never-Ending Argument
</P>
<P>
   The abortion debate has lately been dominated by efforts to ban
``dilation and extraction,'' a late-term procedure that abortion
opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.'' Nebraska and two dozen
other states have banned it, but a Supreme Court argument last week
on the Nebraska law produced strong hints that all such bans may be
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Most justices appeared to agree with a lower court that the ban
is so vaguely worded as to put doctors at risk of prosecution for
performing any sort of late-term abortions, even constitutionally
protected second-trimester ones, which occur well before the point
of fetal viability.
</P>
<P>
   That Whining Sound Of Lost Money and Lives
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a study showing malaria is a major impediment to
African development, the World Bank announced that it would pledge
$500 million toward the eradication of the disease. The
announcement came in Abuja, Nigeria, at the first international
summit on the disease, which kills 3,000 Africans a day, most of
them children.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 27 African economies from 1965 to 1990, done by
Harvard's Center for International Development and the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, concluded that sub-Saharan
Africa's gross domestic product would now be $400 billion instead
of $300 billion if malaria had been eliminated in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The first line of defense is mosquito nets dipped in
insecticide, a fact which Jeffrey Sachs of the Harvard Center for
International Development, said might induce Americans to
contribute more money to cure the disease. ``Bed nets,'' he pointed
out, ``aren't going to end up in bank accounts in Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Whispers
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ordered an overhaul of
security measures at the State Department after a laptop computer
containing sensitive files on arms proliferation vanished from her
intelligence bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers scheduled hearings into a series of
security lapses at the department, including the discovery of an
eavesdropping device in a conference room _ which resulted in the
expulsion of a Russian diplomat _ and the 1998 theft of documents
by a man in a tweed coat within view of Albright's office.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to protecting government secrets, she said, ``99
percent is a failing grade.''

   Monopoly Medicine
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's future? Split in two, if the government gets its
way. The Justice Department and states suing Microsoft told a
federal judge those are the appropriate remedies for a company the
court has ruled is a ``predatory'' monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   The government proposal calls for Microsoft's Windows operating
system to be placed in one company, while the other company would
get the rest including the Word word processor, Excel spreadsheet
and the MSN Internet service. There are also a smorgasbord of curbs
on Microsoft's conduct that would last three years. And the two
companies cannot get back together for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is now in the lap of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
But appeals could take years. Microsoft calls the plan ``extreme,
reckless and not justified by the evidence in the case.'' Two of
the 19 states in the suit apparently agreed, declining to support
the breakup proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Never-Ending Argument
</P>
<P>
   The abortion debate has lately been dominated by efforts to ban
``dilation and extraction,'' a late-term procedure that abortion
opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.'' Nebraska and two dozen
other states have banned it, but a Supreme Court argument last week
on the Nebraska law produced strong hints that all such bans may be
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Most justices appeared to agree with a lower court that the ban
is so vaguely worded as to put doctors at risk of prosecution for
performing any sort of late-term abortions, even constitutionally
protected second-trimester ones, which occur well before the point
of fetal viability.
</P>
<P>
   That Whining Sound Of Lost Money and Lives
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a study showing malaria is a major impediment to
African development, the World Bank announced that it would pledge
$500 million toward the eradication of the disease. The
announcement came in Abuja, Nigeria, at the first international
summit on the disease, which kills 3,000 Africans a day, most of
them children.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 27 African economies from 1965 to 1990, done by
Harvard's Center for International Development and the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, concluded that sub-Saharan
Africa's gross domestic product would now be $400 billion instead
of $300 billion if malaria had been eliminated in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The first line of defense is mosquito nets dipped in
insecticide, a fact which Jeffrey Sachs of the Harvard Center for
International Development, said might induce Americans to
contribute more money to cure the disease. ``Bed nets,'' he pointed
out, ``aren't going to end up in bank accounts in Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Whispers
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ordered an overhaul of
security measures at the State Department after a laptop computer
containing sensitive files on arms proliferation vanished from her
intelligence bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers scheduled hearings into a series of
security lapses at the department, including the discovery of an
eavesdropping device in a conference room _ which resulted in the
expulsion of a Russian diplomat _ and the 1998 theft of documents
by a man in a tweed coat within view of Albright's office.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to protecting government secrets, she said, ``99
percent is a failing grade.''

   At Long Last, Gene Therapy
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of hype and dashed hopes, after more than 4,000
patients with more than a dozen diseases were treated
unsuccessfully in hundreds of studies, gene therapy has finally
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in France reported that they inserted new genes into
cells of three babies with a rare genetic disease that prevents
them from growing immune systems. Without treatment, the babies
would be killed by microorganisms that ordinarily pose no threat.
With gene therapy, the babies developed normal immune systems and
went home from the hospital to live openly in the microbe-laden
world.
</P>
<P>
   Ritalin for Nasdaq?
</P>
<P>
   To economists, financial markets are efficient price discovery
mechanisms. But after watching the Nasdaq stock market soar and
plunge, then plunge and soar during the month of April, investors
and the general public may be wondering if the folks who bought and
sold technology stocks knew what they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the 10 biggest one-day gains in Nasdaq history came
during April. So did four of its biggest one-day declines. In the
19 days it was open during April (markets were closed April 21 in
observance of Good Friday), the Nasdaq lost 1 percent or more of
its value 11 times, according to Birinyi &AMP; Associates, a stock
market research firm. It rose more than 2 percent seven times. The
selloffs were more severe than the rallies: For the month, the
Nasdaq fell by more than 15 percent, even after rising 6 percent
for the week that ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's Big Decision
</P>
<P>
   The New York Senate race was thrown for a loop, as Rudolph
Giuliani, the mayor of New York and presumptive Republican nominee,
announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The
disease, Giuliani said, was caught in its earliest stages, when,
medical professionals noted, chances for a cure are excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's announcement stirred speculation that he would sit
out the race against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but the mayor said he
would put discussion about his political future on hold until he
and his doctors had decided on the best course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Killers From Outer Space
</P>
<P>
   A killer rock from outer space is a new suspect in the greatest
murder mystery of all time, a mass extinction a quarter-billion
years ago that wiped out most animal species on earth, including
trilobites, the three-lobed predators that once ruled the seas.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in the April 15 issue of Earth and Planetary Science
Letters announced the discovery in Australia of a previously
unknown crater about 75 miles wide, one of the largest ever found.
Its dating, while imprecise, tentatively ties it to the sudden
disappearance, 247 million years ago, of trilobites, other marine
invertebrates and early reptiles. The demise of the dinosaurs 65
million years ago has also been linked to the collision of a huge
cosmic object with Earth, so all chicken littles should start
scanning the skies with renewed anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The Universe's Baby Steps
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, astronomers have taken clear pictures of the
infant universe. To make the pictures, a balloon-borne telescope
called Boomerang captured traces of radiation emitted from the
roiling gases of the cosmos some 13 billion years ago, when it was
a mere 300,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cloudy shapes in the pictures confirmed cosmology's
leading theory: that the universe was born in a fiery explosion.
But they did not reveal other features that must have existed if
the theory, called inflation, is correct. Scientists are waiting
for better pictures and furiously recalculating.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfire at the National Zoo
</P>
<P>
   A gunman opened fire Monday at the Washington's 111-year-old
National Zoo, wounding seven children, one critically. Police
arrested Antoine Jones, 16, on Tuesday and are holding him without
bail. Prosecutors said they intend to try him as an adult on
attempted murder charges. If found guilty, he could face life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were not certain what provoked the shootings at
one of Washington's most popular tourist attractions, but community
leaders noted a pattern of violence against schoolchildren in the
District of Columbia, at least 17 of whom have been killed this
school year.
</P>
<P>
   Solidarity at the Ballpark
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball players aren't known for political
activism, but the Elian Gonzalez case spurred more than a dozen
players and coaches to sit out games last Tuesday, in support of a
work stoppage by Cuban-Americans in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez and coach Cookie Rojas, both
Cuban-born, left Shea Stadium before the Mets' game with the
Cincinnati Reds, while Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez, a Cuban
defector, wore street clothes in the dugout at Yankee Stadium. Reds
outfielder Alex Ochoa, whose parents are Cuban, played because his
team was riddled by injuries. ``They need me to play.'' he said.

   KEY-STATES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Every presidential candidate at
this stage of the game swears he will fight for every state and
every vote in this richly diverse country. But the ugly little
truth in presidential politics, which no candidate dares
acknowledge, is that some states are more important than others,
not just because they are big (with a lot of electoral votes) but
because they are up for grabs. As the primary season was dominated
by New Hampshire, the general election campaign will likely be
ruled by an arc of big industrial states, including Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Missouri. By Robin Toner.

<P>
   FALUN-GONG-REVIEW (Shanghai) _ Surely one of the more unlikely
foreign policy problems ever to have afflicted the ruling Chinese
Communist Party must be the one caused by its brutal suppression of
Falun Gong, a spiritual movement that now claims millions of
adherents. Amidst the moral revulsion against the Chinese
government's actions, however, little has been written that might
help anyone understand why so many people feel Falun Gong is worth
fighting and dying for, and little is understood in the West about
those aspects of the movement, or cult, that might suggest that its
followers are misled and their leader deluded, or even a fraud. By
Craig S. Smith.

   RELIGION-REFERENCES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The latest skirmish over
the separation of church and state has its roots in 1959, when the
Ohio legislature approved ``With God, all things are possible,' as
the state's official motto. It had been the idea of a 12-year-old
Cincinnati boy who was concerned that Ohio was the only state
without a motto. By Jane Fritsch.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-ADS-REVIEW (Detroit) _ The Auto industry's spending on ads
is enormous _ $1 in every $7 of all advertising spending in this
country. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   GAMBLING-REVIEW (Undated) _ By now the argument over gambling
has become academic; its appeal shows no sign of abating. Granted,
gambling may not be the most edifying of pastimes; gamblers could
assuredly broaden themselves by reading best sellers and watching
wrestling instead of whiling away the hours in clockless rooms. On
the other hand, whose business is it if adults find pleasure in
throwing away their money? By Walter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   NIXON-VIETNAM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Last Thursday the National
Archives, as part of its routine declassification of government
records, released thousands of secret documents from President
Richard Nixon's National Security Council, which was led by his
national security adviser, Henry Kissinger. Many deal with the war
in Vietnam, which ended 25 years ago Sunday. The records capture
the sulfurous scent of anger and desperation at the White House and
the U.S. Embassy in Saigon as the war went wrong, at home and
abroad. By Tim Weiner.

   Moving in `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   YUGOSLAVIA-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ Twenty years after the death of
Tito, Yugo-nostalgia wafts through the remnant of the Yugoslavia he
created. And everywhere here, despite the continuing sway of
Slobodan Milosevic, there is a strong feeling of fin-de-regime,
that another era of personal rule is coming to a close. Today, in
this incredibly shrinking country, when even tiny Montenegro talks
of independence, there is a continuing sense of bewilderment,
poverty and farce, of helplessness as the Milosevic era goes
through its lengthy death throes. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-TRAVEL-REVIEW (Undated) _ So-called special interest
travel, encompassing adventure travel, ecotourism and journeys to
exotic locales, is the fastest-growing segment of the $519 billion
U.S. travel market, according to industry estimates. By Joe
Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   ZIMBABWE-REVIEW (Durban, South Africa) _ Over radio waves and on
television screens, the conflict often appears stark and simple:
The battle in Zimbabwe, it seems, is a battle between blacks and
whites. The truth is that the struggle in Zimbabwe is less about
race and land than it is about one governing party's struggle to
keep its virtual monopoly of power. For while President Mugabe
rages about the white enemy, his supporters have quietly recognized
that ordinary blacks pose the more potent political threat. By
Rachel L. Swarns.

   GAMBLING-REVIEW (Undated) _ By now the argument over gambling
has become academic; its appeal shows no sign of abating. Granted,
gambling may not be the most edifying of pastimes; gamblers could
assuredly broaden themselves by reading best sellers and watching
wrestling instead of whiling away the hours in clockless rooms. On
the other hand, whose business is it if adults find pleasure in

   NIXON-VIETNAM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Last Thursday the National
Archives, as part of its routine declassification of government
records, released thousands of secret documents from President
Richard Nixon's National Security Council, which was led by his
national security adviser, Henry Kissinger. Many deal with the war
in Vietnam, which ended 25 years ago Sunday. The records capture
the sulfurous scent of anger and desperation at the White House and
the U.S. Embassy in Saigon as the war went wrong, at home and
abroad. By Tim Weiner.

   YUGOSLAVIA-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ Twenty years after the death of
Tito, Yugo-nostalgia wafts through the remnant of the Yugoslavia he
created. And everywhere here, despite the continuing sway of
Slobodan Milosevic, there is a strong feeling of fin-de-regime,
that another era of personal rule is coming to a close. Today, in
this incredibly shrinking country, when even tiny Montenegro talks
of independence, there is a continuing sense of bewilderment,
poverty and farce, of helplessness as the Milosevic era goes
through its lengthy death throes. By Steven Erlanger.

   ZIMBABWE-REVIEW (Durban, South Africa) _ Over radio waves and on
television screens, the conflict often appears stark and simple:
The battle in Zimbabwe, it seems, is a battle between blacks and
whites. The truth is that the struggle in Zimbabwe is less about
race and land than it is about one governing party's struggle to
keep its virtual monopoly of power. For while President Mugabe
rages about the white enemy, his supporters have quietly recognized
that ordinary blacks pose the more potent political threat. By

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of thunderstorms and areas of torrential rain will
plague a large part of the central and southern Plains Sunday and
Monday. A slow disturbance moving east from the southern Rockies
will draw abundant moisture north from central Texas to Kansas and
western Missouri. Rain amounts of 1 to 3 inches will be common by
early Monday, resulting in local flooding. Severe thunderstorms and
a few tornadoes will form later Sunday from the Texas panhandle to
Kansas where a cold front will lift the humid air. In the wake of
the front, showers and some mountain snow will linger in the
central Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and a few sprinkles will linger over northern New
England, but increasing northerly breezes will deliver dry, cool
air to most of the Northeast. Farther west, sprawling high pressure
will promote mild and dry conditions with light winds from the Ohio
Valley to the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FIRE AND WIND
</P>
<P>
   Gusty winds have been hampering firefighters battling a major
blaze that is sweeping across the Tonto National Forest in Arizona.
The pressure difference between high pressure over the Northwest
and a developing storm system over the Southwest has been
responsible for the strong breezes blowing across much of the
interior West. But, fires also generate wind. The contrast between
the hot air near the flames and the surrounding cooler air results
in complex, turbulent wind flows that can further fan the flames.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago, the Bonanno crime family _ once one of
the nation's most feared Mafia organizations _ was galloping toward
extinction. Undermined by deadly rivalries and by federal
investigations, the family was shunned by the other New York Mafia
families as a fractious, unreliable partner.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonannos' ranks and power declined so sharply in the late
1980s and early 1990s that the Federal Bureau of Investigation
disbanded a squad whose sole job had been to focus on the family's
leaders and criminal operations.
</P>
<P>
   But aided by the FBI's inattention, the Bonanno mob has revived
to become one of the most potent and dangerous Mafia groups in the
New York region, organized crime experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials grudgingly attribute the recovery to
Joseph C. Massino, who they say gained control of the family in
1993 after serving a prison term for racketeering and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Massino learned from the mistakes of other bosses who
unwisely attracted attention to themselves,'' said Lewis D.
Schiliro, who retired this month as assistant FBI director in
charge of the New York office. ``He is the undisputed leader of the
family, a low-key guy who avoids the spotlight, who has brought
back discipline and order.''
</P>
<P>
   The man law enforcement officials contend is responsible for the
Bonannos' comeback says his accusers have it all wrong. ``I did my
time; I paid my dues,'' Massino, 57, said in a telephone interview.
``They can claim whatever they want, but it's not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there is such a thing as the Mafia,'' he
added. ``A bunch of Italian guys go out to eat, and they say it's
Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   According to New York Police Department intelligence reports,
Massino's success in rebuilding the empire inspired other mobsters
to nickname him the Ear. Dennis R. Hawkins, chief of investigations
for the Brooklyn district attorney's office, said detectives
believe the nickname attests to Massino's gift for keeping his ear
to the ground to detect possible danger.
</P>
<P>
   And his hearing seems to be acute. Massino is described by
investigators as an electronic wizard keenly aware of the most
advanced listening devices used by agents to eavesdrop on Mafia
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Based on electronic eavesdropping and Mafia informers, federal
and state investigators say that although the Genovese family
remains the largest and most dangerous mob organization in the
region and the country, the Bonannos have replaced the Gambino
family as the second most powerful of the five Mafia groups in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   A heavyset man, 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing about 200
pounds, Massino lives with his wife, Josephine, in a modest home in
Howard Beach, Queens. It is about a block from where his close
friend John J. Gotti, the boss of the Gambino family, lived before
he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1992 for murder and
racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Massino is often at King Caterers, a company
at 60 Smith St. in suburban Farmingdale, Long Island, that provides
sandwiches, hot dishes and snacks for street vendors, and at the
Casablanca Restaurant at 62-15 60th Lane in Maspeth, in the borough
of Queens. Investigators suspect that these businesses are his main
spots for discreet meetings with Bonanno lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone at King Caterers, Massino said he was a
legitimate businessman, working both as a consultant for that
company and, in his spare time, as a manager of real estate
properties, including the Casablanca building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the street for seven years and on parole for
five,'' he said. ``If I did anything, wouldn't I have been
pinched?''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say that Massino has tried to insulate himself
from possible indictments by meeting with only a few top aides who
relay his orders and through careful screening of new members.
Under his leadership, no defectors have implicated him in crimes,
even as mob turncoats have provided crucial testimony in the
convictions of the leaders and numerous soldiers in other families,
especially in the Gambino, Colombo and Lucchese groups.
</P>
<P>
   As the power of other Mafia families withered in the late 1990s,
Massino increased the Bonanno ranks of active ``made'' soldiers and
capos, or captains, to about 110 from a low of 80 in the early
1990s, investigators said. A ``made'' or inducted soldier takes the
blood oath of ``omerta,'' swearing loyalty and obedience to the
Mafia under penalty of death for betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and police investigators maintain that Salvatore Vitale,
52, of Dix Hills, N.Y., the brother-in-law of Massino, is the
family underboss and his closest confidant.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Spero, 71, of Brooklyn, who law enforcement officials
say is the Bonanno consigliere or counselor _ the
third-highest-ranking leader _ is facing federal racketeering and
murder charges. But the officials think that even if Spero is found
guilty, his conviction will probably not be a significant blow to
Massino. The investigators said that Spero, who has pleaded not
guilty, had already been replaced by Anthony Urso, 63, of Franklin
Square, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel J. Castleman, who is in charge of organized crime
investigations for the Manhattan district attorney's office, said
that the Bonannos were very strong right now. ``They are the only
family with an undisputed leadership and without serious internal
struggles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonanno gangsters have long been the area's premier mob
traffickers in narcotics, according to the authorities. One crew is
composed mainly of Sicilian-born members, known as Zips, Sicilian
slang for rural residents and farmers. Investigators say the crew
maintains close ties with Mafia clans in its homeland and that it
is believed to handle much of the family's heroin deals.
</P>
<P>
   But the family's largest booty, law enforcement officials said,
comes from illegal bookmaking on sports and numbers gambling and
from loan-sharking in Brooklyn and in Queens, where most of its
operations are centered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their bread and butter,'' said Schiliro, the former FBI
official. FBI and police investigators estimate that gambling and
loan-sharking rings net the family more than $20 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mob relies on bookmaking and loan-sharking because it's
low risk and the public thinks these are victimless crimes,'' said
Frederick Martens, former executive director of the Pennsylvania
Crime Commission, who teaches criminology at the College of New
Jersey in Trenton. ``It's easy money and inevitably will be used as
feeder money to set up fronts and to buy into legitimate
businesses, especially in the construction and the garbage-removal
industries.''

</P>
<P>
   For decades, the crime family reaped millions of dollars a year
from extortion, fraud, phantom jobs and other corrupt alliances
with union officials, but convictions of Bonanno leaders in the
late 1980s and early 1990' are thought to have shattered most of
those labor rackets.
</P>
<P>
   With that income gone, the Bonannos were one of the first Mafia
crime families to cash in on the Wall Street bull market in the
late 1990s, the authorities said. In the last three years, Frank
Coppa and Frank Lino, who the authorities say are Bonanno capos,
have been indicted in multimillion-dollar stock market swindles;
Lino has been convicted, and Coppa, who has pleaded not guilty, is
awaiting trial in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The family's roots and its name date back to 1931, when Joseph
C. Bonanno was anointed boss of one of the five Mafia families
established that year. Bonanno ruled for 30 years until he was
forced into retirement in 1966 after a power struggle with bosses
in other families.
</P>
<P>
   A later Bonanno kingpin, Carmine Galante, who had been convicted
of heroin trafficking, was gunned down in Joe and Mary's Restaurant
in Bushwick, Brooklyn, in 1979 on orders from rival bosses who
feared he wanted to move in on their rackets.
</P>
<P>
   Galante's murder ignited a bloody purge in the early 1980s.
Massino was then a capo who sided with the winning faction led by
Philip Rastelli, investigators and federal prosecutors say.
Rastelli's reign ended with his conviction in 1986 for labor
racketeering, and the gang was left rudderless for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonanno fortunes were further crippled by a celebrated
undercover investigation. An FBI agent, Joseph D. Pistone, using
the name Donnie Brasco, was accepted into a Bonanno crew. The agent
surfaced in 1981, and his investigation led to a dozen convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Police and FBI intelligence reports say the other major mob
families became alarmed by the Bonannos' bloody feuds and the
family's infiltration by the FBI; those groups branded the Bonannos
as reckless outlaws, or Mafia pariahs. Until the mid-1990s, the
other families banned criminal collaborations with Bonanno members.
The family was ousted from the Commission, the New York mob's
version of a board of directors, which resolves disputes among
families and sets policies, the investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Massino's only conviction was in 1986, in the middle of the
Bonanno family's decline. He was found guilty on federal charges in
Brooklyn that he had extorted payoffs from moving and storage
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro and other Mafia experts say the family is now welcomed
as a partner by other mobsters. Investigators say that Massino took
two measures that bolstered the family's security and discipline:
he reined in ``cowboys,'' younger members who commit violent crimes
like drug-related murders and robberies that attract scrutiny, and
he prohibited capos from using small storefront clubs as regular
meeting places because they invite easy surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former FBI officials said monitoring of the Bonanno
family was minimized in the late 1980s because the gang's decline
seemed irreversible. Instead, they said, agents concentrated on the
formidable Gambino and Genovese families.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame the FBI,'' Martens, the former head of the
Pennsylvania Crime Commission, said. ``Every law enforcement agency
has limited resources, and you have to react to the most serious
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, crackdowns by federal and state agencies in the
mid-1990s are credited with weakening the Gambino and Genovese
families, culminating in the convictions of Gotti, the Gambino
boss, and Vincent Gigante, the Genovese chief.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former FBI officials acknowledged that it was a
mistake in 1988 to merge the Bonanno squad with a unit responsible
for investigating the Colombo family. Separate squads for each
family were re-established in 1996, and officials say the Bonanno
family is now being actively investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson to be learned is that you cannot de-emphasize
vigilance on any of the families,'' said J. Bruce Mouw, a former
FBI agent who was in charge of the Gambino and Bonanno squads in
New York. ``All are capable of comebacks.''

COMMENTARY: POLITICAL DIVAS 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Diva is driven by wants and whims. The Diva
hoards the spotlight. The Diva lets loose when something is Not
Pleasing. The Diva Will Survive.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Ross or John McCain?
</P>
<P>
   You decide.
</P>
<P>
   Senator McCain said he was going to drop out of the presidential
race. But he hasn't quite gotten around to it yet. He's still
clutching the microphone and waiting for his closeup. And he's
still scuffling with W., trying to out-macho, out-patriot and
out-moralize the man who beat him.
</P>
<P>
   There was John McCain on Thursday on the front page of The New
York Times, shown on a tour of the Hanoi Hilton with his son
(trailed by a brace of Washington pundits), while poor W.
languished on A24 with his big speech calling for civility.
</P>
<P>
   There was John McCain on Friday on ``The Today Show,'' telling
Matt Lauer what it felt like to be beaten with bamboo sticks and
bayoneted by his captors. He, his wife, Cindy, and their
13-year-old, Jack, were treated to the trip to Vietnam by NBC.
Whass-uppp with that? Taking freebies from a broadcaster he helps
regulate as Commerce Committee chairman doesn't exactly square with
his McClean image, even if the Senate Ethics Committee did OK the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   There he was again this weekend, volunteering to help out his
pal Rudy Giuliani by taking over his gigs on the Sunday talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam for the 25th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, he
got embroiled in two diplomatic kerfuffles.
</P>
<P>
   He fell into an escalating war of words with the Vietnamese
Foreign Ministry, after he said ``I think the wrong guys won,''
trashed his captors for killing some of his comrades, and
criticized the Vietnamese for carrying hammer-and-sickle banners.
</P>
<P>
   He also got involved at Ho Chi Minh airport when the Vietnamese
_ perhaps in retaliation _ refused to let a member of his
entourage, Tucker Carlson of The Weekly Standard and Talk magazine,
leave the country, claiming his exit visa was not in order.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who stayed behind for five years the first time the
Vietnamese would not let his comrades leave with him, argued for
two hours this time before leaving Tucker in the hands of the U.S.
Embassy and flying off with the rest of his group. (Tucker was
sprung later that day.) ``Straight Talk Express'' becomes
``Midnight Express''?
</P>
<P>
   The senator seems to have Sudden Attention Withdrawal Disorder.
In 1960, Thomas Dewey wrote to Richard Nixon, telling him, if he
lost, not to make important decisions for six months because his
thinking would be so distorted. Nixon passed along the advice to
George Bush in '92. But McDiva didn't get the advice.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, the senator offered a melodramatic mea culpa on
the Confederate flag, confessing he really did think it should come
down. It was a slap at W., who is still stuck with the old
mealy-mouthed, pandering position that it is best if the state
decides.
</P>
<P>
   W. said last week he wanted to ``end the arms race of anger''
between the two parties. But he can't even stop it in his own.
McCain threw a hissy fit when he thought W. was maneuvering him
into a position where he'd have to say _ eyeball to eyeball _
whether he wants to be considered for VP. He doesn't want to seem
selfish if he refuses, or a supplicant if he agrees.
</P>
<P>
   He resents feeling manipulated or patronized _ especially by the
princeling. ``It's not a character trait of John's to say `yes,
sir, no, sir' to anybody,'' says a McCain adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Even away from the pressures of the campaign, he is too quickly
prickly. In Vietnam, when he heard about a Robert Novak column that
began ``Gov. George W. Bush's advisers consider his May 9 meeting
in Pittsburgh with Sen. John McCain to be like a visit to an
incompetent dentist: all pain and little satisfaction,'' he
threatened to cancel the summit, insisting the Bushies treat him
like an equal and bargain on policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   As in other respects, the Republicans are becoming like
Democrats. Republicans used to just fall into line behind their
leader after the primaries. Now they have those Who Dissed Whom,
Who Gets What, psyche-stroking reconciliation sessions, which
reached a hilarious apogee with Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain hasn't turned into Jesse Jackson yet. But if he
remains prickly and unassuageable, the question may begin to
ricochet, with greater and greater impatience: ``What does John
want?''

ASIAN FAITH ENTERS AMERICAN MAINSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACIENDA HEIGHTS, Calif. _ As a mist-laden dawn spread across
this Los Angeles suburb, a group of brown-robed Buddhist monks and
nuns gathered in a shrine for their daily liturgy, chanting a
teaching about the impermanence of matter. Around them, 10,000 tiny
statues of the Buddha filled niches in the walls, and three immense
Buddha figures peered benignly down from above an altar.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the morning, you feel your heart touch the Buddha's
heart,'' said the Venerable Hui Chuan, vice abbot of Hsi Lai
Temple, a 15-acre complex of buildings whose design replicates
traditional Chinese temple architecture. ``And Buddha's heart is so
happy, so full of kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its dedication 12 years ago on a hillside tract, the Hsi
Lai temple has never been an obscure religious site. It is likely
to become even less so in this election year, a result of its role
in the Democrats' 1996 fund-raising problems. In a now-famous
incident, Vice President Al Gore stopped here that year to attend a
luncheon, at which, it was later disclosed, a longtime Gore
fund-raiser arranged for $55,000 in illegal contributions to be
made to the Democratic National Committee. (The woman, Maria Hsia,
an immigration consultant, was convicted on five felony counts last
month for her role in arranging illegal campaign donations to the
Democrats.)
</P>
<P>
   During the Democratic primaries earlier this year, Gore's
opponent, former Senator Bill Bradley, cited the temple fund-raiser
to try to raise doubts about Gore's integrity. It is expected that
the Republican nominee, presumably Gov. George W. Bush, will do the
same in the general election campaign, raising the possibility that
references to the temple will show up in televised political
commercials this fall.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, it may serve to call attention to an important
trend within American religion, the emergence of Buddhism _ as a
result of recent immigration from Asia and also conversions _ from
its former image as an ``alternative'' faith largely associated
with such bohemian literary figures as Jack Kerouac and Allen
Ginsburg, to a much more mainstream status, with an estimated two
million adherents.
</P>
<P>
   Hsi Lai Temple, whose name is translated as ``Coming to the
West,'' offers an example of the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated 12 years ago and costing nearly $30 million, it is the
largest Buddhist monastery in the United States, part of an order
founded in Taiwan by a monk born in China, the Venerable Master
Hsing Yun.
</P>
<P>
   His original monastery in Taiwan, founded in 1967 and called Fo
Guang Shan, has grown into a worldwide movement with more than 100
temples, emphasizing ``humanistic Buddhism,'' applying the Buddha's
teachings on kindness and compassion to daily life. Hsi Lai, also
known as the International Buddhist Progress Society, is the
largest among the movement's 19 American temples. Others can be
found in Queens and Piscataway, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Chandler, a Harvard University doctoral student who has
written his dissertation on Fo Guang Shan, said Master Hsing Yun
oversaw one of the largest Buddhist organizations in Taiwan. Like
many other Chinese Buddhists, Chandler said, it draws on two
traditions, Ch'an (known as Zen in Japan), which emphasizes
meditation, and Pure Land, which preaches a spiritual discipline
intended to allow adherents to be re-born after death into a
paradise of enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   Hsi Lai's devotees are overwhelmingly Chinese from Taiwan. But
to spread Buddhism, the temple tries to reach out to native-born
Americans, Chandler said, adding that the temple's invitation to
Gore should probably be viewed in this context. ``How better to
symbolize you're OK to mainstream American culture than to have the
vice president there?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Among temple personnel these days, the Gore issue seems little
more than a distraction. Their true interest, they say, is
promoting spiritual education and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our responsibility is to the dharma,'' said the Venerable Man
Yee, one of the nuns, referring to the essential teachings of
Buddhism. ``That is the main purpose of our Master Hsing Yun, to
propagate the dharma and educate the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Venerable Hui Chuan said: ``There are media-press that will
only focus on the political parts. But Hsi Lai Temple is a
multifunctioning temple.''
</P>
<P>
   Its intention, he said, is to ``make Buddhism Americanized,''
ensure that a new generation of Chinese in the United States know
their Buddhist heritage and have the temple itself function as a
cultural bridge between East and West.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Hsi Lai is intended to be accessible to people with
little knowledge of Buddhism or Chinese culture. Maps are available
of the temple complex, which is laid out as an elongated triangle,
a shape intended to resemble the leaf of a bodhi tree _ the tree
under which the Buddha sat when he attained enlightenment 2,500
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the grounds, signs in English and Chinese offer
explanations of statues and buildings. Visitors may join a tour or
pick up a tape player at an information desk for a self-guided
walk. A rack provides free pamphlets of Master Hsing Yun's
lectures, with titles like ``The Essence of Buddhism'' and ``A
Guide for Young Buddhists.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also Sunday morning English-language classes on
Buddhist principles. Citing them, temple personnel say publicity
about the Gore visit may actually have helped in arousing public
curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had more people join the English dharma class,'' said
the Venerable Man Yee, who once worked as a real estate agent in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   More tangible signs of the temple's ambitions can be found in
nearby communities. A 20-minute drive away, in Rosemead, the temple
has bought a cluster of classroom buildings once owned by the
Methodists to serve as the campus of Hsi Lai University, offering
degrees in Buddhism, religious studies and business administration,
as well as courses in English as a second language. Its president,
Naichen Chen, said the institution had 350 students, having begun
with a handful a decade ago, when classes were held at the temple.
This year, it began publishing a scholarly journal on Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   The dean of students, Ananda W.P. Guruge, a former ambassador to
the United States from Sri Lanka, said he found the political
attention paid to the temple to be ``very hurtful.'' But he
predicted that, in the end, it would not harm the image of
Buddhists in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murry, the university's database administrator, said he
and other Buddhists regarded the negative publicity as an
opportunity to practice values of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gives people a chance to shine by putting up with
it,'' Murry said, ``because Buddhism is very tolerant.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, the temple's most recent project sits atop a ridge
in Whittier, Calif., a city settled by Quakers, and where President
Richard M. Nixon went to college. On the grounds of the Rose Hills
Memorial Park, the temple has built a three-story pagoda, with
orange tile roofs and brass bas-reliefs of the Buddha. It is a
columbarium, with 25,000 niches, each to hold an urn containing
ashes of the dead. The building's balconies afford expansive views
of the Los Angeles basin and, to the east, the San Gabriel Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the largest Chinese Buddhist pagoda in North America,''
said a young woman who guided a visitor around, adding, ``at this
time.''

COMMENTARY: DIRTY WINDOWS POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So now it's official. The Justice Department has requested a
breakup of Microsoft into two companies _ one piece that gets the
rights to Windows and a defenestrated rump that gets the rights to
everything else, mainly Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent column I offered a metaphor: a baron who controls
two castles along the Rhine, and extracts tolls from passing
traffic. The Justice Department proposal is like letting the baron
keep one castle, while giving the other to his nephew. That
metaphor suggests that such a breakup would make things worse, with
two robber barons instead of one levying tolls on those who pass
by. Why, then, does Justice think otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   As best I understand it, the argument is that neither castle is
impregnable by itself. Both Office and Windows are near-monopolies
sustained in part by ``network externalities'' _ economese for the
incentive people have to use the same products that other people
are using. But _ or at least so the argument goes _ the dominance
of Windows is partly sustained by the dominance of Office, and vice
versa. People who might use WordPerfect are deterred by the fact
that Microsoft Word works better with Windows; people who might
switch to Linux are deterred by the fact that there is no Linux
version of Word.
</P>
<P>
   If this is true, then putting the castles under separate
ownership might loosen the control of both castle lords over
passing traffic. Over time Windows would become only one of several
competing operating systems, and Office would become only one of
several competing office suites.
</P>
<P>
   Now one question is whether separating the two pieces of the
company would really eliminate the monopoly power of each piece.
This is plausible for the downstream applications like Office;
after all, rivals to Office survive even now, and would probably do
much better once Office lost its home-court advantage. But remember
that the objective of antitrust policy is to help consumers, not
disgruntled rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the proposed breakup would undermine the dominance
of Windows seems much less compelling. And if Windows remains
dominant _ if the upstream baron still controls a crucial choke
point _ then the breakup would still be a bad thing for consumers;
a baron who controls only one castle has less incentive to hold
down tolls than one who controls the whole stretch of river, even
if there are several downstream barons.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose that slicing Microsoft at the waist does lead to a
true competition among operating systems, that once Powerpoint runs
on Linux, the dominance of Windows will fade away. There is still a
puzzling question: If your objective is to introduce competition in
operating systems, why not introduce competition in operating
systems? That is, why not follow the advice of a number of
Microsoft critics _ like Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution,
who argues that any solution that leaves Windows intact is no
solution at all _ and break Microsoft into three or four parts, an
applications company and several rival sellers of Windows?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the major objections to such a ``vertical'' breakup
of Windows apply with even greater force to Justice's actual
proposal. Some have worried that creating rival Windows companies
would lead to the emergence of rival, incompatible versions of
Windows; well, what could be less compatible than a completely
different operating system? Others have worried that breaking up
Windows would amount to expropriation of intellectual property, and
would put a chill on future investment; well, if the Justice plan
works and eliminates Microsoft's market power, how is that
different?
</P>
<P>
   The only explanation I can give of Justice's half-measures is
political: fear that a straightforward proposal to slice up the
operating-system market would seem too radical. So the plan is to
achieve the same result by stealth and indirection. But
half-measures in economic policy have a way of being worse than a
clear decision either way. This plan could produce the worst of
both worlds: It could place a chill on investment even while
raising prices and creating system incompatibilities.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a plea for clarity: If the court determines that
Microsoft's sins warrant dismantling of its Windows monopoly, then
so be it. But let's not try to break Windows while pretending we
aren't.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETON, Mass. _ When Corey Johnson told teammates on the
Masconomet High School football team that he was gay, the two other
starting linebackers responded characteristically. Big, steady Dave
Merrill quietly absorbed the almost physical shock, then began
worrying if the revelation would divide the team. He decided to
take it on as a challenge, a test of the captaincy he shared with
Johnson and a test of his own character. Jim Whelan, the artist,
looked into Johnson's eyes and saw a need for instant support. He
broke the silence by saying, ``More than being teammates we're your
friends, and we know you're the same person.''
</P>
<P>
   Their reactions were critical in the risky, uncharted, carefully
planned campaign to bring out of his increasingly claustrophobic
closet an American icon, the hard-hitting football hero. The
campaign involved Johnson's parents, teachers and coaches, as well
as a gay educational agency, all encouraged by the administration
of a school with a long history of diversity training. One measure
of their success will be seen Sunday when Johnson, who turned 18 on
Friday and will graduate in June, speaks in Washington at the
Millennium March for Equality.
</P>
<P>
   For gay activists trying to shatter stereotypes, Johnson is a
rare find, a bright, warm quick study who also wrestled and played
lacrosse and baseball as he earned three varsity letters on a
winning football team. For athletes, whose socialization often
includes the use of homophobia by manipulative coaches, he is a
liberating symbol. And for school systems struggling with such
complex issues as diversity, tolerance and jock culture, his story
is a hopeful model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday I want to get beyond being that gay football
captain,'' Johnson said, ``but for now I need to get out there and
show these machismo athletes who run high schools that you don't
have to do drama or be a drum major to be gay. It could be someone
who looks just like them.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 8 inches and 180 pounds, Johnson had to make up for
drama-club size with the speed and brutality of his blocking and
tackling. ``He hit like a ton of bricks,'' said Whelan, who became
his friend in seventh grade because, he recalls, ``he had a strong
mind, he liked to think and he was unwilling to accept injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in school, including the girls he refused to date (``It's
not fair to use people as pawns,'' he said) were attracted by his
friendliness and sly wit. Asked for publication in the yearbook how
football captains spent the night before a game, he said: ``I go to
sleep early with my Tinky Winky.'' And he indeed has one of those
purple Teletubby dolls ``outed'' by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, crammed
in a corner of a stereotypically messy room filled with trophies,
athletic posters and balled-up T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great kid with a mind of his own,'' said Coach Jim
Pugh, who faced down a booster club president who wanted Johnson's
captaincy revoked. ``My issues with him were not gay-related. They
were about who knows better how you step out on certain defensive
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he had suspected his homosexuality since sixth
grade, but suppressed thinking about it. In the high school's
``elite jock mix'' of heterosexual innuendo and bravado, he came to
realize ``this just isn't me.'' His crushes were on other boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``In health class a teacher told us that in every large group of
friends, one turns out gay,'' he said. ``When I was lonely and
depressed and isolated, I kept thinking, `Why does that have to be
me?' I wanted to live a quote normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, in the first game of his varsity career, as
a sophomore starting at both right guard and middle linebacker, his
blocking was so effective and he made so many sacks that the line
coach awarded him the game ball. Yet, he was so afraid that
everyone would hate him when his secret was revealed that he was
often unable to sleep at night or get out of bed in the morning. He
would reach out on the Internet, in a teen chat room on a site
called Planetout.com finding other gay youngsters, even other gay
football players. For years, he has exchanged e-mail messages with
a gay right guard in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's decision to come out began taking shape during his
family's 1998 Super Bowl party in the living room of its rented
townhouse in this suburb 25 miles north of Boston. One of his
uncles pointed at the comedian Jerry Seinfeld in a television
commercial and described him with a gay slur, and said that such
``sick'' people needed to be ``put into institutions.'' Another
uncle laughed. Corey's mother, unaware at the time of Johnson's
sexual orientation, chided her brothers and asked them not to use
such language.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson went into the bathroom and cried. A month later, he told
his guidance counselor and biology teacher that he was bisexual. He
says he was a virgin at the time. Later, he told his lacrosse coach
that he was gay. All three were supportive. They also began to
understand his moodiness and mediocre grades.
</P>
<P>
   He told no one else during that summer or during the football
season of his junior year. He joined the school's Gay Straight
Alliance, which was made up mostly of straight girls. Since he was
known for defending kids being hazed or bullied, no one found this
remarkable. In December 1998, the football team voted Johnson and
Dave Merrill co-captains.
</P>
<P>
   After Christmas vacation, he decided to tell his parents. His
father already knew. He had read an exchange between Johnson and a
gay e-pal. For months, his father held the secret; he did not want
to burden his wife, absorbed in ministering to her dying mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dropped the ball,'' he said in retrospect. ``What if Corey
had done something to himself?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   A burly, 45-year-old, chain-smoking former marine who drives a
Pepsi-Cola truck, Rod, who is actually his stepfather, had helped
raise Johnson since the boy was 1. He and Johnson's mother, Ann,
who gave birth to Corey when she was single, were married 12 years
ago. Johnson never knew his biological father, though he kept his
last name. (For reasons of ``privacy and safety,'' Rod and Ann
agreed to be interviewed only if their last name was not published.
They also have a 10-year-old daughter.) Ann's reaction, according
to both of them, was the unreserved love she had always offered,
but now it was tinged with fear; if people found out, would they be
mean to her son, would they hurt him?
</P>
<P>
   That spring, Donna Cameron, a health teacher at the school and a
Gay Straight Alliance adviser, took the group to a conference of
the Gay Lesbian and Straight Education Network, a national
organization that works with Massachusetts' Safe Schools program.
Johnson attended a sports workshop led by Jeff Perrotti, the
organization's Northeast coordinator. Perrotti talked about
challenging the entitlement of athletes and finding a way for all
students to be treated as well.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the session, Johnson raised his hand and said he
was a football captain and wanted to come out and needed help.
</P>
<P>
   Perrotti, a 41-year-old openly gay former high school teacher,
said he immediately realized what this meant. ``A football captain
is an icon,'' he said last week, ``and one coming out would raise
the expectations of what was possible. It would give hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Masco, as Masconomet is called up here, is the regional high
school of 1,300 students for affluent, predominately white Boxford,
Topsfield and Middleton. The phrase ``Only in Masco,'' used by
friends and critics, often refers to its liberal commitment to
diversity and alternate education. Pugh, the football coach, a
warm, steady 50-year-old from Long Island, N.Y., seems equally at
home on the field and in what he calls his ``touchy-feely world''
as a special-education teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Perrotti consulted with Bob Norton, the principal of Woburn High
School, who had been a football and hockey coach. Johnson's mother
came to school for meetings with the staff and Perrotti. It was
decided that Johnson would first tell his junior classmates on the
team, on April 8, 1999, more than a year after he had first told
some teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before that meeting, Cameron, 52, the Gay Straight
Alliance adviser, who had been out as a lesbian to friends and
family, came out to her students. ``I didn't want Corey to stand
alone,'' she said last week. ``I wanted to put a second human face
on what for most of the kids was just an abstract when they used
gay slurs. As it turned out for both Corey and me, kids found it
even easier to talk to us about other problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before the meeting, Johnson came out to Pugh. It was
fine with him, Pugh said, as long as everyone remembered that the
football season was about football and that it would not become a
``media circus'' that would spoil everyone else's experience. That
attitude prevailed; a major magazine was turned away last fall, and
until now there has been no mainstream national exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Ann and Rod were not persuaded about even this controlled coming
out. Rod said: ``I felt he was putting a target on his back.'' Ann
said: ``We were afraid for him that he would be hurt. But if I said
no, then we were acting as if we were ashamed of who he was.''
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, in Pugh's classroom, Johnson told his teammates
that he was gay, that he hoped for their support and not to worry.
``I didn't come on to you last year in the locker room and I'm not
going to do it now,'' he said. ``Who says you're good enough
anyhow?''
</P>
<P>
   That lightly dropped remark had been scripted in the preliminary
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, in the hall, players asked Merrill if it was a joke.
The news spread quickly through the school. There were several
scrawled gay slurs, but no one was going to go bashing the football
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first the team was meek about it,'' Johnson said, ``people
didn't talk to me, and when they saw it was still just me, they
asked all kinds of questions. They wanted intimate details. They
thought it would be cool to know more about the subculture. When
they heard abut a gay bar called the Ramrod, they asked me to get
them T-shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Whelan, visiting his girlfriend at college, met an openly gay
``fun guy,'' who he thought would be perfect for Johnson. He told
them about each other and tried to fix up a double date.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic incidents were football related. The president
of Masco's active booster club, the father of four past, present
and future players, demanded that Johnson be removed as captain for
``unit cohesiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Pugh told the father that he was the divisive one and that it
was not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The night before a game, the captain of the Lynnfield team made
anti-gay remarks in a pep rally speech. His coach benched him.
</P>
<P>
   At the game, an opposing lineman shouted gay slurs in Johnson's
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't stop laughing,'' said Johnson said. ``Here, I had
come out to my teachers, my parents and my team, and this guy
thought he could intimidate me?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Perrotti like to say that the team bonded through
the experience, but other players are not so sure. While Whelan and
Merrill attended and spoke at gay-rights conferences, and the team
once sang the gay anthem, ``YMCA,'' after Johnson had a
particularly good game, there was an element of distraction.
Merrill said ``some kids were nervous and had to be talked to.''
Masco dropped from 10-1 in 1998 to 7-4, but Pugh attributes that to
the loss of last season's quarterback and star running back.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems never did materialize. When younger players
complained to Merrill about having to shower with a gay teammate,
he would growl, as he would to most complaints, ``You're a football
player, just suck it up.'' But then, Masco football players have
traditionally never showered at school.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson's parents and many of his teachers and coaches
think he should go to college in the fall, he said he has decided
to ``become an activist'' for a year and to intern in the network's
San Francisco office. Merrill is going to the University of New
Hampshire, without a football scholarship but confident that he
will walk on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll know now I'll be able to make it in the real world,'' he
said. ``I handled it. I was mature. We were a unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Whelan is going to the Rhode Island School of Design in the
fall. That ``fun guy'' he spotted finally met Johnson, at a gay
conference. Whelan was right. They liked each other. The fun guy,
Michael, became Johnson's first boyfriend, and next month Johnson
will take him as his date to the Masconomet senior prom.
</P>
<P>
   The season isn't over yet.

SPORTS COLUMN: STRIP THE ALPHABET FROM THE SOUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Fight is expected to begin about 11:30 p.m. EDT; story may be
updated.) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As soon as Lennox Lewis steps into the ring at Madison Square
Garden on Saturday night against Michael Grant, what has been his
undisputed world heavyweight championship will suddenly be
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Because Lewis has not defended the title against the World
Boxing Association's No. 1 contender, the uncelebrated John Ruiz,
Lewis will be automatically stripped of the WBA crown.
</P>
<P>
   Against the 6-foot-7 Grant, the 6-5 Lewis will be defending only
two-thirds of boxing's wacky world, those areas governed, however
immodestly or improperly, by the World Boxing Council and the
International Boxing Federation.
</P>
<P>
   But boxers should no longer let themselves be subject to these
three self-styled sanctioning bodies, which exist primarily because
their usually different champions and rankings provide fake
credibility for promoters and television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of letting the alphabet-soup organizations strip the
title from boxers, the boxers should strip the alphabet from the
soup.
</P>
<P>
   Boxers, managers and promoters should just ignore the
proclamations of the WBA, the WBC, the IBF and any of the lesser
alphabetic sanctioning bodies that create ``championship'' fights
out of paper pronouncements instead of out of punches in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   The line of succession could define the true champion in each
weight division, not the WBA, WBC or IBF edicts. Especially an IBF
edict.
</P>
<P>
   In all the Lewis-Grant hype last week, maybe you haven't noticed
that on the other side of the Lincoln Tunnel, a much more important
bout has begun. The IBF is on trial on bribery, racketeering,
conspiracy and tax evasion charges in federal court in Newark,
N.J., where C. Douglas Beavers, the IBF's ratings chairman from
1983 to 1998, is singing.
</P>
<P>
   Threatened with prosecution, Beavers began cooperating with
federal agents in 1997; he secretly recorded more than a hundred
conversations with Robert W. Lee Sr., the IBF president, and other
officials regarding bribes for higher rankings. Among the alleged
$338,000 in payoffs, according to Beavers, were several from the
promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
   King, one of 14 unindicted co-conspirators, has denied paying
bribes to the IBF, but on the witness stand, Beavers recalled the
time he refused Lee's order to return Beavers' $5,000 share of a
King payoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Don King's a street guy and wouldn't ask for the money
back,'' Beavers testified last Tuesday. ``If you're running an
illegal business, you don't ask for bribes back. What's he going to
do, sue me?''
</P>
<P>
   Beavers, who said one reason he didn't return the $5,000 was
that he had already spent it, also told of collecting $100,000 from
the promoter Cedric Kushner, an unindicted co-conspirator who has
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   If the IBF, meaning primarily Lee and his son Robby, is found
guilty of corruption, its credibility and authority will be gone.
Boxers, managers and promoters would no longer need to abide by its
ratings, no longer need to pay sanctioning fees.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, boxers, managers and promoters never needed to do
that. The IBF (based in East Orange, N.J.), as well as the WBA
(based in Venezuela) and the WBC (based in Mexico) have ruled the
boxing rankings only because nobody else has bothered with them.
</P>
<P>
   That's why boxing has always been so corruptible. Nobody is
really in charge except, ostensibly, the WBA, the WBC and the IBF,
all of which simply assumed their authority, like dictators do. And
until this IBF trial, nobody has challenged their authority.
</P>
<P>
   By its nature, boxing has never attracted seminarians. In a
sense, nobody can break any laws in boxing because, to a great
extent, there are no laws except for the jungle law: survival of
the fittest.
</P>
<P>
   But if the IBF is found to have broken the nation's laws
regarding bribery and racketeering, then boxers, as well as
managers and promoters, will no longer need to abide by the IBF
edicts. Maybe they will also realize that they no longer need to
abide by the WBA or WBC edicts.
</P>
<P>
   At least financially, the Home Box Office promoters have begun
to ignore those edicts in some of its contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told each of our elite champions,'' said Seth Abraham of
HBO, alluding to Lewis, Oscar De La Hoya, Roy Jones Jr. and Prince
Naseem Hamed, ``that you're bigger than any of the governing
bodies' belts, that as long as you do not lose in the ring, we will
not pay you one penny, one shilling, one farthing less. If you're
stripped of a title, your HBO contract will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the `championship' belts,'' he added, ``the `jewels' in
them are glass and the belt is plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the belts are as fake as all the alphabet-soup
sanctioning bodies. And as unnecessary.

   GROZNY, Russia _ Galina Kuzmichova endured the battle of Grozny.
And now that the fighting is over she has done her bit to restore
the Russian Orthodox church here, one of the city's foremost
symbols of Russian culture.
</P>
<P>
   She has cleaned the icons and swept away the debris. But the
church is still a ruin, and the Russian authorities have yet to
take any steps to rebuild it.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin billed the capture of Grozny as a psychological and
military turning point in its battle with Islamic rebels seeking an
independent state in Chechnya. And President-elect Vladimir Putin
vowed to rebuild the Chechen capital when he made a surprise visit
here during the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Grozny appears to have been left on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The laborers who toil in the spring sun to repair the train
station have not been paid for two months. Teachers have
refurbished a school without government support. The pace of the
reconstruction is so glacial that those who fled the city during
the war complain that there is still not much to return to. Those
who hid in their basements and waited for the shooting to stop have
discovered that there was little reward for staying.
</P>
<P>
   Viseet Vakhayev, 36, escaped with his wife and three children
during the fighting. Since the Russian flag was hoisted over
Grozny, he has repeatedly visited the city to see if it is feasible
for his family to come back. And Friday he turned away with
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have cleaned up the streets a bit, but there is no effort
to restore the city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Street after street remains lined by rubble and bombed-out
buildings. Many people are still living in their basements or
temporary shelters. Water is trucked in, and there is no
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of more than 400,000, Grozny was once the
largest Soviet city in the northern Caucasus. It was established in
1818 as a Russian fortress. In February, the Russians suffered
enormous casualties to seize the city, which has a large ethnic
Russian population.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Russian authorities have captured Grozny, they
do not seem to know what to do with it. Russian authorities have
required residents to register, but many are still in the process
of doing so. Thousands of people live in the city, though nobody
seems to know exactly how many, and the streets are largely empty.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the cost of rebuilding the ravaged city appear to be
more than the Kremlin is prepared to bear, especially since it
still faces a formidable task of restoring the rest of the battered
republic.
</P>
<P>
   Even keeping order in Grozny is not easy. The city is ringed by
Russian checkpoints, and only residents with Grozny credentials are
allowed to pass. Fifteen miles to the northwest, a base is being
prepared for the 42nd Army Division, part of the Kremlin's plan to
set up a permanent garrison to control the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these precautions, however, rebel fighters have begun to
sneak back into Grozny. Russian military officials say there are as
many as 400 militants, including 50 snipers, in the city. Shooting
often erupts at night. And Russian militia keep their guns trained
on the city's rooftops when they escort journalists through the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stay at our command posts much of the time, and when we go
into the city we never go without our armored personnel carriers,''
said Roman, a 19-year-old member of the Russian militia from the
Krasnodar. His unit was dispatched to Grozny to police the city.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Nikolai Koshman, Russia's senior representative in the
region, met in Moscow Friday to discuss the situation in Grozny.
Koshman has been wary of pouring huge sums into Grozny for fear
that it will take money from the reconstruction of the rest of the
republic. But Putin has been loath to write the city off and
promised in March to restore it gradually.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's meeting, however, it was announced that Grozny
was still too unsafe to open up access to it.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian officials debate what to do, Grozny's residents
have tried to restore a semblance of city life, but they are
getting little support. The streets are still largely deserted, and
a hazy smog hangs over the city, the result of oil wells that have
been set on fire during the war and are still aflame.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Emergency Ministry has cut back on its food
distributions. It used to provide bowls of kasha to Grozny
residents; now only pensioners and veterans qualify. Children 16
and under get a small ration of bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have not gotten any better,'' said Natalaya Fuznetsova,
13, who was standing near the food lines.
</P>
<P>
   The main city project is to restore train service to Moscow next
month. Russian troops are fixing the railroad tracks. But city
residents rebuilding the station are toiling without pay in the
hope that the train will be an economic lifeline for their city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The railroad is the life of the city,'' said Lisa Batayeva,
the 47-year-old director of the planned Grozny-to-Moscow train.
``So far, the workers have not received anything, but they have
been promised that they will be paid.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The authorities have turned a deaf ear to attempts by some
residents to put the war behind them. Galina Grebtsova, 64, an
ethnic Russian, was fetching firewood in January when a Russian
missile slammed into her house, burying her 24-year-old daughter
under a mound of debris. She is still trying to recover the body.
She has sent several letters to the Emergency Service asking them
to help _ to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Grozny is in Russian hands, the authorities have sought
to create new symbols of their victory. A Grozny thoroughfare has
been renamed Bislan Gantamirov Street in honor of the former Grozny
mayor who was jailed for embezzlement but released by the Russians
so he could fight with them during the war.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian authorities seem curiously indifferent to the
old symbols. At the Church of St. Michael, a group of elderly
Russian women were busy preparing for Orthodox Easter, which is to
be celebrated Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For the believers, it has been a long wait. Before the latest
war, the city was lawless and some Islamic militants had little
tolerance for the Russian clergy. Two of its priests were kidnapped
and one was murdered. A small grave lies in the center of the
church, the tomb of an elderly Russian woman who was stabbed in the
chapel by a marauder.
</P>
<P>
   The roof of the church has been bashed in and its walls have
crumbled. Still, the faithful are hoping the Russian Orthodox
Church officials will dispatch a priest to Grozny so they can hold
an Easter service. And while they wait they are cleaning what they
can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect a priest will come, and we have cleaned the icons,''
Kuzmichova said. ``But we have no construction materials.''

SUMMER BLOCKBUSTERS BEGIN ROLLING OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``n'' California news file.) &HT;    By DAVID BLOOM

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With his new film ``Gladiator'' about to open,
director Ridley Scott has a promise for moviegoers: ``Audiences
ain't seen anything like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a boast heard all around Hollywood these days.
</P>
<P>
   The summer season arrives next weekend with the debut of
``Gladiator,'' the first in a legion of blockbuster pictures, many
of them animated and effects-filled extravaganzas, that will march
into theaters weekend after weekend through Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these big films cost more than $100 million to make and
market. But they can bring in several times that, financing a big
portion of the studios' operations for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Special effects are a big reason for the steep costs of many of
these films. Not only do they have to be good; in order to really
be competitive, they have to look better than last year's wonders.
And that puts added pressure on studios to create more imaginative
worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience expects, demands, the latest state of the art in
special effects,'' said Art Rockwell, entertainment analyst and
president of Rockwell Capital in Burbank. ``If you're going to have
a credible picture, you can't have teens saying this is no better
than a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer films have become the equivalent of a theme park's hot
new ride. If they don't provide new thrills, fans won't show up for
the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to see perfect images these days,'' said Wolfgang
Petersen, who directed ``The Perfect Storm,'' a state-of-the-art
seagoing disaster flick based on the nonfiction best seller. ``I
mean, 50 years ago, they would have made this movie in a bathtub
with people using a piece of wood to stir the models in the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   But making images wondrous enough to impress an ever-more
visually sophisticated audience can be an expensive risk. As
DreamWorks production executive Walter Parkes points out: ``CG
(computer-generated special effects) is a double-edged sword. It
also can be the reason why a film goes over budget.''
</P>
<P>
   There (italics on)are(italics off) ways to save some money on
your blockbuster, though, even if it looks like you're doing just
the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Disney's latest animated effort, ``Dinosaur'' -
which merges 3-D, computer-generated dinosaurs with live-action
backgrounds - has been the subject of a great deal of speculation
over its costs, with some reports as high as $280 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cook, chairman of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group,
declined to say exactly how much the studio had spent, but said it
was considerably less than that. Other estimates have placed the
film's cost at $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the high-end estimates were inflated because the movie
had been in development for so long, about 10 years, while the
studio tried to create computer animation software that would make
realistic-looking dinosaurs - and who knows what else in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (the cost) is time and labor,'' Cook said. ``Any time
you're dealing with new technology and doing breakthrough work,
it's going to be more expensive. But in a lot of regards, we were
laying a foundation for the next group of films we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another approach: New Line Pictures is spending $130 million to
$160 million, according to reports, to film an adaptation of J.R.R.
Tolkein's ``The Lord of the Rings.''
</P>
<P>
   But the executive overseeing the project, Fine Line Features
President Mark Ordesky, figures he's getting a bargain. Not only is
director Peter Jackson shooting in his native New Zealand, which
saves a hefty percent on labor and materials, he's actually
shooting three features at once, one for each of the three books of
the Ring trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had shot these in traditional fashion (producing and
releasing one, then repeating the process twice), it would have
taken a decade to finish,'' Ordesky said. ``We'll have all three
films in the can, shot, a year before the first one hits movie
screens.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has good reason to suspect there'll be some interest in
the resulting films, the first of which will be released in 2001: A
trailer for the trilogy posted on the Internet recently was
downloaded more than 6.6 million times in its first five days.
</P>
<P>
   New Line may be unique in getting three probable blockbusters
for what others may spend on one. No other studio is so fortunate,
though Fox with its ``Star Wars'' sequels and Warner Bros.' with
the back-to-back shooting of two ``Matrix'' sequels can come close.
</P>
<P>
   In realty, though, few studios enjoy the comfort of having a
virtual sure thing at the box office, despite the sums being
committed. Still, psychologically, the higher the ante the safer
the bet feels, as far as studio executives are concerned.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The reason they're doing it is because the expected return is
quite high,'' said financial analyst Rockwell. ``If you're going to
compete for a major summer attraction, you have to be willing to
put big bucks behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer is still endless kids on vacation looking for something
to do,'' added Dave Davis, senior vice president of the Los Angeles
investment bankers Houlihan Lokay Howard &AMP; Zukin. ``And even though
the movie business tries and tries to become a 52-week business,
it's still basically a summer, the Christmas holidays and a couple
of other holiday weekends kind of business.''
</P>
<P>
   And big films can corner a big chunk of that business.
</P>
<P>
   If a studio has a good year, said Brad Ball, Warner Bros.
Pictures president of domestic theatrical marketing, it'll sell $1
billion worth of tickets in the United States. A single summer
blockbuster could easily generate 15 percent of that total by
itself.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, given the moneymaking possibilities, a nine-figure
price tag can look like a bargain these days. And there will be a
bunch of profitable movies this summer, it appears.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of quality, a lot of films from everybody,``
said Tom Sherak, chairman of the 20th Century Fox Domestic Picture
Group. ``Every studio looks healthy. I'm hearing a lot of good buzz
on a lot of films. There's no 800-pound gorilla.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a marked contrast from last summer, when Sherak and Fox
were riding what was more like a 1,000-pound gorilla: ``Star Wars
Episode I: The Phantom Menace.'' Studios scurried to release their
films on dates far from the prequel's mid-May debut, and for good
reason: It went on to become the second-highest grossing film of
all time, behind ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no `Star Wars' this year,'' said DreamWorks marketing
executive Terry Press. ``I find it a much healthier environment.
The only problem with the summer is the movies stack up like planes
(about to land) at Kennedy Airport on a Friday afternoon. That is
expensive because then it's who screams loudest (with
advertising).''
</P>
<P>
   And that, Press said, is the reason marketing budgets can jump
to $50 million or more for some films, most of it for television
advertising, spent at a time of year when fewer people are inside
watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   Film expenditures have shot up and profit margins have plummeted
in recent years, in part because of those rising marketing costs,
according to analyst Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason why marketing got so expensive is you have
to protect your film's production expenses,'' he says. ``But you're
going to spend this money because you can make it back'' and plenty
more.
</P>
<P>
   Or, just as likely, not. Summers past were littered with the
bloated carcasses of such misjudged megaproductions as ``Wild Wild
West,'' ``Speed 2,'' ``Batman &AMP; Robin'' and ``Small Soldiers.'' And
this year will be no different.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business, it's like the biggest gamble in the world
next to Las Vegas,'' said Fox's Sherak. ``You're putting all this
money up ... And you could be gone (from theaters) in the first
weekend. But to be successful, you have to get up to bat. You have
to be swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' Press, for one, thinks that approach may not be the
best. That's because the focus on big numbers can obscure the most
important one, down on the bottom line. Sometimes a film that costs
very little can contribute far more to a studio's profits, she
said, pointing to the huge success of ``The Blair Witch Project,''
which cost a pittance to make, was bolstered by about $15 million
in marketing expenditures and raked in $140 million last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that they think (blockbusters are) what audiences
want, but last year, a movie about annoying people in the woods
with a black-and-white camera made a ton of money and had none of
this,'' Press said.

CITY STREET REPAIRS WOEFULLY LAGGING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The streets of Los Angeles _ neglected for decades
_ are still crumbling faster than they are being repaired, despite
a massive increase in spending under Mayor Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mayor's proposal to launch the city's largest-ever
street repair program, Los Angeles still lags woefully behind in
patching thousands of miles of broken blacktop.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan proposed in his 2000-01 budget spending $17.5 million
more than last year to repair a record 245 miles of streets. But
that's still 15 miles fewer than the number of miles that are
deteriorating, leaving a backlog of 4,000 miles to be repaved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never been on track since the 1930s,'' said Greg
Scott, the city's Street Services director, who is credited with
expanding the street paving program and finding innovative ways to
get more road improvements per dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Under Riordan, the number of miles of broken roads repaired has
soared nearly 500 percent over five years, including the proposed
15 percent increase in the coming financial year.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city with the largest urban street system in the
nation, it would cost $1.5 billion over 10 years to rebuild or
repair the system of 6,500 miles of roads cracked and deteriorating
because of years of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   The potholed and rutted streets carry a heavy price for
motorists, who face heavy charges amounting to hundreds of dollars
a year per car because of road-caused damage.
</P>
<P>
   According to the city's latest estimates, there are 3,000 miles
of streets that need to be resurfaced, and 1,000 miles that need to
be completely rebuilt, an even more expensive and time-consuming
undertaking, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the city would have to resurface 350 miles of
streets each year for the next decade to catch up, and then
resurface 260 miles of streets each year after that to stay caught
up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The backlog, street officials say, is the result of years of
fixing too few streets - the city repaved roughly 50 miles a year
between the 1950s and the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It costs an average of $130,000 to repave one mile of street,
Scott said, but depending on the width of the street, the cost can
reach $400,000 per mile.
</P>
<P>
   During the current budget year, which ends June 30, the city is
resurfacing a record 220 miles. In the spending plan Riordan
unveiled last week for the fiscal year beginning July 1, he
proposes to use surging revenues from a booming economy to help fix
more miles of city streets as well as sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make the city a better place,'' Riordan said. ``We
must ... improve the quality of life for all Angelenos, and that's
what this budget is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's proposed budget would resurface 245 miles of Los
Angeles streets, including 100 miles of ``major'' streets - broad
Van Nuys Boulevard is one example of a major street - and 145 miles
of smaller ``local'' streets.
</P>
<P>
   His plan also calls for workers to perform preventive
maintenance, known as ``slurry sealing,'' on 100 miles more.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, it would be the largest street resurfacing program
in the city's history, city officials say.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, officials and workers have found ways to shave
$4.4 million in costs in the Street Services Bureau, for example,
by recycling asphalt and using larger trucks that need to make
fewer trips with larger loads to haul asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's proposal, city leaders said, is a step in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget reflects that priority,'' said Councilman Michael
Feuer. ``We're almost double where we were just a couple of years
ago, but it's still not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer said fixing city streets is among residents' top
priorities, along with sidewalk repairs and tree trimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole package of basic day-to-day quality-of-life
services people expect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's budget plan also includes:
</P>
<P>
   -- Repairing 26 miles of city sidewalk, including sidewalks in
front of 2,800 homes citywide.
</P>
<P>
   -- Removing at least 5,100 tree stumps.
</P>
<P>
   -- Constructing 7,200 access ramps to bring high-priority areas
into compliance with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the boost in funds that the mayor is proposing,
city officials hope to lasso several million dollars from the
state's budget surplus to fix more streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking for the whole thing and will accept anything
because anything will help,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood leaders applauded efforts to fix more city streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need it desperately,'' said Charney Herst, a resident of
Canoga Park. ``What we have is big ruts and cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Herst said fixing streets won't just help her neighborhood's
drivers. It also will benefit walkers, bicyclists and pedestrians
pushing strollers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often stand on the street corner and meet and we say, `Look
at this mess.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gerardo Guzman, president of the Pacoima Coordinating Council,
agreed, saying, ``Some of the streets in Pacoima are just
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman pointed to specific intersections, including Louvre
Street and Bradley Avenue, that need to be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like your car's falling apart while you are driving
down that street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he hopes the new budget will pour dollars into
neighborhood streets in the city's poorer areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue of environmental justice,'' he said. ``This is
the best opportunity that we have, now that the economy is so good,
to put the money into areas like Louvre and Bradley.''

   KHANH HAU, Vietnam _ ``No,'' said Bui Thi Van, a frail village
woman of 80, ``I don't think anything has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   She cast her mind back through the history of the village _
through the U.S. war, the Japanese occupation, the French colonial
administration _ back through six generations to her illustrious
ancestor, Nguyen Huynh Duc, who, long before today's Communists,
fought in a war to unify Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she concluded, ``it's not different at all. We still
work in the fields. We still worship here. We have water and
electricity now, but actually nothing has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused to swing a mallet three times against a great brass
bell as a visitor lit a fistful of incense sticks at the altar of
Marshal Duc, who is now the village deity.
</P>
<P>
   Then she added, ``I don't go anywhere, so how can I see any
changes?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if she traveled only a short distance to the main
north-south highway, she would see the forward edge of advancing
development from Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, 30 miles to
the north, into the fertile farmlands of the Mekong delta.
</P>
<P>
   She would also spy several miles away a small red banner
reminding travelers that Sunday marks the 25th anniversary of the
end of the Vietnam War and the reunification of northern and
southern Vietnam under Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Khanh Hau, it takes only a short walk from the noisy
highway to enter the timeless world of rural Vietnam, where 80
percent of the nation's people live, hidden behind thick stands of
coconut and areca palms, banana trees and feathery bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of Vietnam, Khanh Hau has not escaped the ravages
of Vietnam's wars and the pressures of its politics and
modernization.
</P>
<P>
   In a narrow strip along the highway, new factories manufacture
textiles, ceramics, plastics and aluminum plate. Billboards
advertise tires, pesticides, face cream and family planning. The
nearby village of Ben Luc, famous for its pineapples, now uses its
fields for factories and imports pineapples from elsewhere to be
sold along the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   But Vietnamese villages are insular places, stubborn and
self-contained. They absorb the pressures of history, adapt to them
and, like Khanh Hau, go on very much as before.
</P>
<P>
   This is a difficult country to subdue or to manage. In an
often-repeated saying, the mandate of the emperor stops at the
village gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rural communities have always been the real areas of
negotiation,'' said Shaun K. Malarney, a Tokyo-based American
scholar of Vietnamese village life. The history of Vietnam is not
just the history of great national events, he said; it is thousands
of histories of individual villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you pass through the village gate you are in a way
entering a different history, a different sense of place,'' he
said. ``If we are going to write the history of Vietnam since 1975,
it's not just the liberation of Saigon or these types of things. It
is also the story of what has happened in communities like Khanh
Hau, and how they pursue their own needs and desires and
traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   As successive governments have recast history to suit their
politics, Duc _ a hero of the Tay Son rebellion of the late 18th
century _ has shifted in and out of official favor. But his cult
has persisted into what is now the 10th generation of his
descendants, and pilgrims still come here to pray at his shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Continuity and change are easy to assess in Khanh Hau because
this is one of the most thoroughly examined villages in Vietnam,
the subject, among others, of a classic study by the anthropologist
Gerald Cannon Hickey called ``Village in Vietnam'' (Yale, 1964).
</P>
<P>
   ``At high tide, the water rises and the stream presses in around
the houses lining the bank, giving the impression that Ap Cau is a
floating hamlet,'' he wrote, ``a green island in the midst of paddy
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Like the flood tides of the Mekong delta, history has washed
across the village _ and its scattered hamlets like Ap Cau _ but it
has remained a place that Duc would recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Khanh Hau, with its population of about 3,000, was
something of an island during the U.S. war _ the site in the early
1960s of a ``strategic hamlet'' in which the U.S. side relocated
the more remote villagers into a tightly defended cantonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a boy I didn't know anything about the war,'' said
Nguyen Huynh Khanh, 45, a farmer who is one of Van's nine children.
``This was a protected village and everything was quiet here.''
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, Hickey wrote, the farmers paused in their
fields to watch the bombing of a distant neighbor, the village of
Cu Chi, a stronghold of Communist resistance that has remained
famous for its network of tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   But not all in the family escaped the war; three of Khanh's
brothers fought on the South Vietnamese side. One was killed and
one emigrated to the United States in 1991, after serving for six
years in a re-education camp after the Communist victory.
</P>
<P>
   The family has little contact with its son in the United States,
Khanh said. ``It would cost us a whole rice crop to make one
telephone call to him.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The martial history of the village also tied it to the war, both
before and after 1975.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, a series of South Vietnamese and U.S. officers
and government officials stopped here to pay their respects to the
memory of Duc and to record their visits in a fat red guest book.
They included William Colby, at one time the top man for the CIA in
Vietnam and later its director. He took the occasion of his visit
in May 1969 to tout U.S. policies. Updating Vietnamese history, he
wrote, ``With gratitude for Marshal Duc's inspiration to better
pacification.''
</P>
<P>
   The guest book is mostly blank after 1975, reflecting the new
government's suspicions both of Khanh Hau's recent history and of
Duc's role in the long-ago Tay Son rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, things were a little difficult,'' Khanh said.
``They accused us of being in the noble class. They called us
collaborators with the French colonialists.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the land the family had held for centuries was
redistributed, and the brothers found themselves doing the hard
work that laborers had performed for them in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now things are pretty much back the way they were,'' Khanh
said. The government leaves them alone. The shrine is newly
refurbished. The crowds on Duc's feast day number in the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam's villages remain some of the poorest in the world. But
there has been some change. When Hickey studied Khanh Hau nearly 40
years ago, there were no motor vehicles here. There were just six
battery-powered radios, owned by the most wealthy residents.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Van's family has a motorbike and an electric clock that
announces the time in a recorded woman's voice. Some of Van's
grandchildren study in Ho Chi Minh City; one works there as an
accountant.
</P>
<P>
   One 10th-generation descendant of Duc, 3-year-old Nguyen Huynh
Thanh Tong, may be the bearer of a message about the future. On a
recent day, he wore a T-shirt with the words ``Born to be wild.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't judge the present by the standards of the past,''
Khanh said. ``In the past, in Marshal Duc's day, the children of
kings were kings. Now it is the people with talent who rise.''
</P>
<P>
   But until there is a revolution that is more far-reaching than
the Communist victory of 1975, even the wild and the talented will
remain rooted in their villages.
</P>
<P>
   In her long life, Van has seen her nation convulsed and
transformed, and yet, as she says, she has seen nothing change. All
day long, she paces through the newly whitewashed shrine, sweeping,
dusting, adjusting the flames of small oil lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away lies the imposing tomb of her ancestor, Duc, its
stone walls pitted by age, its pre-colonial Chinese lettering
faded. Other family tombs lie here and there around it, arranged
according to astrological dictates, covered by waxy white flowers
from the trees that shade them.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is a reassuring anchor for a people buffeted by
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go,'' said Van with a note of satisfaction, ``I'll be
buried here too.''

   Carter Running an Option on When He Will Retire
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League career of the Minnesota Vikings
wide receiver Cris Carter will be remembered as one of the greatest
of all time for many reasons. His grace as a player is almost
unparalleled, as is his work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   He is a seven-time Pro Bowler who last year, at the age of 34,
had 90 catches for 1,241 yards and 13 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   His personal story is of Hall of Fame caliber as well. A
one-time drug abuser, Carter is a brilliant example of how a person
can turn his life around. And Carter has not forgotten where he
came from, since he now dedicates many of his waking hours to
lecturing kids about the dangers of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   So it should be no surprise that Carter has recently hinted to
several teammates that he might retire after this season. It is
understandable; he has done just about everything a player can do
in football. So off he goes. Into the sunset. Into the Hall of
Fame. Catch you on the lecture-banquet circuit, right, Cris?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Carter's cryptic hints, it is still not definite, by any
stretch, that he will retire after this season. In fact, Vikings
Coach Dennis Green said the organization and Carter have an
understanding that Carter will retire after the 2002 season,
meaning he would play two more seasons instead of one.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Green insists Carter will remain in Minnesota for two
more years is because when the franchise recently renegotiated
Carter's contract to make it more salary cap friendly, both sides
decided Carter would retire in 2002. Green speaks to Carter almost
weekly, and in Green's mind, little has changed about Carter's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seem to be a lot of people who think this is Cris' last
year,'' Green said, ``but I don't think it is. He is going to play
two more years. He wants to play two more years. He restructured
his deal so he would retire then, not next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter causes much of the confusion about when he will retire.
He does not say he will retire after this season, but he does not
say he will not, either. ``I think in the back of my mind, I know
what I am going to do,'' Carter said. ``But all I'm concentrating
on is one season at a time. Is it going to be one more? Is it going
to be two more? Is it going to be three? I'm not going to say
publicly, but I do know.''
</P>
<P>
   So, is Carter headed to the rocking chair after this season, or
is he up for two years?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Carter does, it will affect the Vikings in a number of
ways.
</P>
<P>
   The team is currently in a state of flux. It will have a new
quarterback in Daunte Culpepper, who is in only his second season.
Though Culpepper's physical skill and football smarts are solid, he
is bound to endure some rough spots. All young quarterbacks do.
That is where Carter will be so valuable _ he can help guide
Culpepper, and calm the team when the rough spots hit.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's guidance will also be needed two years from now. It is
expected that after this season, wide receiver Randy Moss, perhaps
the most spectacular offensive player in the game right now, will
most likely become the highest paid player in the game. So far Moss
has been a good citizen, but what will happen when Moss' wallet
becomes heavier than Fort Knox?
</P>
<P>
   Money affects some players in strange ways. Will the big cash
ruin Moss or not change him at all? With Carter at Moss' side, he
could be a strong moral compass to the young player.
</P>
<P>
   This coming season will be the key to Carter's future. If
Minnesota wins a Super Bowl this season, he would most likely leave
the game. Seven Pro Bowls and a Super Bowl ring would make nice
going away presents.
</P>
<P>
   If the Vikings do not win a championship, whether or not Carter
departs in one year or two will depend on how the season goes. He
most likely will not stick around if it looks like the team is
going to rebuild _ salary cap or no salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Carter does leave, the NFL will lose a piece of its
soul. ``Cris is a first-ballot Hall of Famer,'' Green said, ``and
he is a first-class person.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders Redskins-Bound
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders will most likely be joining the Washington
Redskins _ just not when you think.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders wants to play a complete season with the Cincinnati
Reds, then hop a jet to the East Coast and play with the Redskins.
Dallas will probably release Sanders after June 1, and the Redskins
plan to pursue him. The team is comfortable that Sanders would not
be able to join them until at least the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is already stacked with talent on both sides of the
ball, and Sanders will only make them better. Yet the Redskins
should be careful; many scouts think Sanders, because of a
constantly ailing toe, on which he has had surgery, is not the same
player he has been over the years.
</P>
<P>
   What made Sanders so special was that even when he was beat on a
pass play, he had great recovery speed. Scouts believe he no longer
has that speed.
</P>
<P>
   But despite what some personnel believe, next season Sanders
should still give some defensive coordinators nightmares if he
catches on with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Off-the-Field Violence
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has continued to examine how to address the problem of
its players and off-field violence. One thing seems certain: There
are no changes planned in the league's violent-crime policy on the
immediate horizon, and there will be few new initiatives as well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the NFL will tweak several of its existing programs.
Also, the league will try to work on the image of players by
stressing the good things players do in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more tangible changes the league plans include an
extension of the rookie seminar, emphasizing the importance of
staying out of trouble. The NFL might also have more seminars for
veteran players during the season.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL believes it already has more than enough programs to
deal with the complex issue of off-field violence. The league also
feels strongly that it has enough punishment protocols and does not
need more.
</P>
<P>
   There will most likely be some owners and others who feel the
league needs to take stronger measures. Nevertheless, that will
probably not happen.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While lawyers and regulators in Washington
ponder the fate of Microsoft Corp., Troy Anthony stands in a
computer store here, struggling with the conflict the case inspires
in ordinary consumers. He says he feels strongly that Microsoft
should not be divided in a way that destroys the Windows standard
he already knows how to use.
</P>
<P>
   But what brought him and his laptop to the PC(AT)more store on a
busy Thursday afternoon? ``I've got a bug in Windows 98,'' he said
sheepishly. Anthony added that he had developed a not-so-technical
remedy for the times his operating system crashes. ``I know how to
reboot the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   For many consumers, the Microsoft operating system, used on 85
percent of personal computers, is the devil they know. And many say
they are not sure what the devil will look like if federal
regulators succeed in splitting Microsoft in two, as they proposed
on Friday, with one half an operating-system company and the other
half holding everything else, including word processing and
spreadsheet programs, e-mail software and the other Microsoft
applications.
</P>
<P>
   When the legal theory, public-relations spin and courtroom drama
die out, what is supposed to be left is an environment that offers
the American consumer better, more innovative, less expensive
products, thanks to heightened competition. But many consumers are
skeptical. According to a Gallup survey released on April 12, some
69 percent of Americans said they thought Microsoft should be left
alone, while 21 percent favored a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   This is consistent with Gallup's finding that 80 percent of
those polled said Microsoft had a positive impact on the computer
industry, while 20 percent said it had a negative impact.
</P>
<P>
   As the government was preparing to announce its proposals for
Microsoft, Tom Gibney, finance director for Impiric Chicago, a
promotional advertising firm, said he thought the ruling against
the software giant was too harsh, even if some of Microsoft's
tactics have been ``unwholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's products work very well for him, he said, adding
that while he had heard vague comments about other operating
systems, he was not inclined to try them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have enough knowledge about the programs,'' he
said. ``I'm just a corporate wonk going around getting set up with
Microsoft, and it works great for me. I use a PC, and they all run
Microsoft. It's ingrained; that's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven McAfee, 38, a physician at Massachusetts General
Hospital, is also contented with Microsoft's current structure. His
concern is that a breakup of the company would fracture the Windows
standard, which could hurt his patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense there will be a lot more glitches in the software,''
he said, if the company is broken up. That would be especially
troublesome because patient records may soon be on computers and
thus vulnerable to bugs. ``I would prefer not to go so backwards.
It's a hard thing to endure at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, even some who work with computers for a living, think
the outcome of the case will have little effect on them. Steve
Abbitt, 23, a computer system administrator at the Pacific Stock
Exchange in San Francisco, said he did not care about the trial and
was unconcerned about the possible breakup of Microsoft. He said
politics, not concern for the good of consumers, was driving the
legal wrangling. Abbitt worries that if there were more operating
systems available, companies might have to retrain workers, which
he said would be costly and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, ``I'm much more interested if a good rock concert comes
to town than in the Microsoft trial,'' said Abbitt, noting that he
was an avid Grateful Dead fan.
</P>
<P>
   If consumers are unsure what a divided Microsoft would mean,
they have plenty of company. Some of the best and the brightest in
the country, applying economic theory of the highest order, cannot
agree either.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the government's proposal say it may take time, but
that new competitors should emerge if Microsoft is broken up.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that the new applications business will have an
incentive to create versions of programs for makers of other
operating systems like Linux. In turn, those new operating systems
will be able to offer better products with a broader range of
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other companies making applications would find it
easier to compete against a Microsoft that is half its current
size. And at least in theory, more operating systems and
applications makers would mean more innovation, more competition,
more competitive pricing and, eventually, more store shelves full
of software made by entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more stable operating systems that boot up
immediately,'' said Steven C. Salop, professor of economics and law
at Georgetown University Law Center. ``Two or three years out,
consumers might be buying PCs with Linux and more choices of
network computers.''
</P>
<P>
   More competition would force Microsoft to lower its prices,
asserts Mark Cooper, research director for the Consumer Federation
of America. Citing well-known estimates, he said computer makers
pay Microsoft a fee of $45 to $60 for each PC they put the Windows
operating system on, but he figures that amount could easily fall
to $15 a machine if Microsoft faced more intense competition.
Cooper dismisses the dire prophecies that more operating systems
would mean chaos and confusion for consumers who are accustomed to
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want you to believe that you touch one hair on the head
of this company, we'll go back to 1982, when you have to be a
computer programmer'' to use a computer, he said. ``No one is going
back to 1982.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not 1982, but 1984, say economists on the other side of
the argument, alluding to what they see as inappropriate government
interference in the market. These economists argue that dividing
Microsoft would actually lead to higher prices and little new
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is anticonsumer,'' said Richard McKenzie, a management
professor at the University of California at Irvine and author of a
book about antitrust policy, ``Trust on Trial: How the Microsoft
Case is Reframing the Rules of Competition.'' ``The main reason is
that a breakup will lead to higher prices.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie argues that consumers benefit from having the
applications and operating system housed under one roof. The idea
is that engineers working on applications and operating systems
share ideas in hallways and cubicles, thus creating features they
might not think of if they worked in separate companies. This is
called the water-cooler theory.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the slightly more complex ``double
marginalization'' theory. Jerry Hausman, the McDonald Professor of
Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an
occasional consultant to Microsoft, said that according to this
theory, Microsoft can charge lower prices for both its applications
and its operating system when it operates both businesses, as it
does now. The ostensible reason is that if Microsoft lowers the
price of, say, word processing software, it stimulates demand both
for the software and for the operating systems that run it,
increasing revenue for both businesses.
</P>
<P>
   That will all change if Microsoft is broken up, Hausman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic theory says this leads to higher prices,'' he said,
referring to a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments fail to sway some Microsoft customers, though.
Akther Ahmed, 32, chief executive of an Internet startup called
Gomingle.com, said Microsoft had treated him arrogantly in business
dealings. He said that when he was negotiating to buy Web servers,
the powerful computers used to operate Web sites, Microsoft
representatives acted as if Ahmed had to take what they offered or
take his business elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ahmed did decide to go to another company, a
decision that meant spending $500,000 more for the computers _
double the Microsoft price. But Ahmed said that Microsoft needs to
be taught a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company gets too arrogant, its innovation goes down,''
he said. If Microsoft is broken up, he concluded, ``in the long
run, it'll be better for consumers.''

   Honesty May Prove Not To Be Best Policy For Raptors Coach
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO _ He recently signed a $6 million contract extension and
has the best player on his team firmly in his corner. But have
Butch Carter's controversial remarks and deeds of the past week
done irreparable damage to his coaching future _ damage enough for
the Toronto Raptors to consider relieving him of his duties after
the season?
</P>
<P>
   According to a team official who spoke on condition of
anonymity, the franchise will not take any such action after its
first appearance in the National Basketball Association playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But as the chaos continues, you wonder whether the organization
is growing genuinely concerned about the relationship between the
ultra-provocative coach and some of his emotionally wounded
players.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's candor probably crossed the line last week. He bemoaned
the lack of a vocal leader in his locker room and cryptically
added, ``The most important advantage the Knicks have over us is
their top eight guys are all under contract and are focused on
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   But about those thin-skinned Raptor veterans: Doug Christie, who
has asked to be traded from Toronto on several occasions, ripped
into his coach and tried to persuade General Manager Glen Grunwald
to muffle Carter. Dee Brown called Carter's comments ``a copout.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Vince Carter this: At a time when his ultrasensitive,
allegedly more mature teammates were nursing their bruised
feelings, he understood his coach's motives _ however
unconventional they seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just understand,'' Vince Carter said. ``I don't let too many
things bother me. I try to see the big picture of where they try to
come from when they say things.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Butch Carter's mentoring, he added: ``I learned a lot. He's
taught me a lot. When he comes to me and yells at me, I laugh at
him sometimes. He doesn't like that. I know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach has had an extremely controversial week _ one that
began with Carter's dropping a defamation suit against Marcus Camby
and ended with his team publicly lambasting him. The thinking is
that Carter may have destroyed his chances for another high-profile
NBA job if he loses his current position.
</P>
<P>
   After Lenny Wilkens resigned last week, Isiah Thomas was said to
be seriously leaning toward pursuing the Atlanta Hawks' job,
provided he appeases league officials by selling his ownership
stake in the Continental Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   From the Nets to the Washington Wizards, Mike Jarvis, the St.
John's coach, keeps being mentioned as the next college coach to
catapult to the NBA
</P>
<P>
   They are rumors at worst, solid speculation at best. But no job
would be considered more plum than Toronto's, especially if the
Vince Carter-Tracy McGrady nucleus remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   After all the effort Butch Carter has put into grooming the two
wunderkinds, it would be a shame if the coach's curt honesty and
wild motivational ploys ended up costing him the chance to see
their development through.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder about double standards, too.
</P>
<P>
   People like Pat Riley and Phil Jackson are celebrated for the
creative manipulation they employ to coax spoiled millionaires into
believing in something greater than themselves. When a relative
newcomer to the profession attempts to inspire his beleaguered team
in provocative fashion, he is seen as plunging off a mental cliff
into the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Carter's style and tactics may be out there and
off-kilter. But he is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers Pulls Off an Upset
</P>
<P>
   Doc Rivers may be holed up in a TNT studio for the playoffs, but
he managed to pull off an upset last week by nudging out Phil
Jackson for the coach of the year award.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of predominantly national beat writers voted for Rivers
based on his ability to guide a group of decent role players _
unanimously picked in the preseason to finish in the Atlantic
Division basement _ within a missed 3-pointer of a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's maiden season with the Lakers produced 67 victories in
a rugged Western Conference, but somehow it was not enough. The
final tally: Rivers, 60 votes; Jackson, 53. Both coaches said they
voted for Jerry Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers is a former TNT analyst, whose affable, regular-guy
demeanor has endeared him to many factions of the news media, some
of whose members have grown jaded and cynical over aloof athletes
and coaches who treat them more like obstacles than people.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers was asked if he believed his relationships with the news
media helped him in the voting. ``No, I doubt it,'' he said. ``Phil
Jackson has probably better relationships and knows more people
than I do. I think the bottom line is a lot of people underrated
our talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Among others, Milwaukee Coach George Karl lobbed a verbal
grenade the Magic's way recently. Karl singled out Orlando General
Manager John Gabriel for preparing to rid the team of several
players in the off-season in order to make sure the Magic has
enough salary-cap room to lure a big-name free agent, at the
expense of the players who worked their tails off for Rivers and
the Magic this past season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he calls that coaching,'' Rivers said. ``I basically
ignored it. I hope I never have to make comments about other
people's organizations to get what I want out of my team. Maybe
that's how George does things.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rest for the Weary
</P>
<P>
   NBA Commissioner David Stern was recently forthright about the
reasoning behind the league's drawn-out, first-round playoff
series. Good spacing between telecasts not only means more
generated hype between games, but it also means more advertising
revenue for the respective network partners.
</P>
<P>
   But when the weekend began, five of eight teams were on the cusp
of sweeping their opponents in three straight games. Drama was
often at a premium, nowhere more than in Los Angeles, where a
competitive series has yet to emerge. In two victories, the Lakers
treated the Sacramento Kings like a younger, smaller sibling with
no chance of beating its older brother.
</P>
<P>
   Utah, Miami, Portland, the Knicks and the Lakers all have
something in common: Their rosters are significantly older than
their respective opponents'.
</P>
<P>
   In giving veterans like Patrick Ewing, Karl Malone, John
Stockton and Scottie Pippen ample time to rest their bodies, the
league essentially nullified the athleticism of its new, young
stars _ players such as Vince Carter, Minnesota's Kevin Garnett and
Seattle's Shammond Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to bank on wearing the old guard down with three games in
five or six days _ a somewhat normal playoff format _ Carter and
Garnett may be on vacation by early next week, their next NBC
appearance coming in the Olympics in September.
</P>
<P>
   Slow Days in Washington
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's job could have been made much easier if the
Washington Wizards had aggressively pursued moving some of their
higher-salaried players last season. Instead, Jordan, the Wizards'
head of basketball operations, will most likely have to live with
the $10-million-a-year players Rod Strickland and Mitch Richmond
for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Western Conference team official who requested
anonymity, the Wizards were contemplating pursuing a trade for
Marcus Camby and another Knick for Strickland, a point guard the
Knicks coveted, last summer. Another part of their plan, the
official said, was then to draft Andre Miller, the stellar
Cleveland point guard who replaced Brevin Knight in the starting
lineup, and sign and trade Richmond to Miami for Jamal Mashburn.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's frontline would have included Juwan Howard, Camby
and Ben Wallace. The Wizards' backcourt would have been Mashburn
and Miller. A nice mix of veterans and youngsters, the building
blocks of a playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan could not be reached for comment last week. But a former
team official said the scenario was put forth at the time by a
prospective employee. He added, on condition of anonymity, ``It
sounds good, but none of it ever came close to happening.'' &QL;

   Impostors? No, Just the White Sox
</P>
<P>
   He was a minor league outfielder getting older and going
nowhere. The Yankees, who had acquired him only a year earlier from
San Francisco, needed a spot on their 40-man roster, offered him to
any interested party, found none, then put him on waivers. This was
in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We signed Bernie Williams back as a free agent and we were out
of roster spots,'' Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager,
said last Thursday. ``Chris was out of options so we designated him
for assignment. We had been shopping him all winter, but everybody
passed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago White Sox told the Yankees they planned to claim
26-year-old Chris Singleton, so instead of giving him away for
$20,000, the Yankees traded him to the White Sox for Rich Pratt, a
minor league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, released by the Yankees at the end of spring training,
pitched for the Bridgeport (Conn.) Bluefish in the independent
Atlantic League last season. Singleton hit 17 home runs and batted
.300, highest batting average among major league rookies, for the
White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not expect the player he is now,'' Cashman said. ``If
we did, we would not have designated him for assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   Singleton is one-third of an excellent young outfield that is an
integral segment of the team that had the best record in the
American League entering Saturday's games. The White Sox have
played so well that they have led the perennial AL Central champion
Cleveland Indians for nine consecutive days. The last time the
Indians were out of first place for that long was in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it should be that surprising to anyone who saw
the young players they had last year,'' Billy Beane, the Oakland
general manager, said of the White Sox's start, their best since
1973. ``They have a great talent base of young players.''
</P>
<P>
   Singleton is the center fielder, flanked by Magglio Ordonez in
right and Carlos Lee in left. Ordonez, 26, from Venezuela, and Lee,
23, from Panama, were signed as free agents and nurtured in the
White Sox's system. Singleton never played in that system, winning
a job with Chicago in spring training last year.
</P>
<P>
   That he was with the White Sox at all was a tribute to their
scouting staff. General Manager Ron Schueler said two scouts had
seen him in the minor leagues and thought he could be a reserve
outfielder for them. Moreover, he was a left-handed hitter, a
commodity the team needed.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton's status changed dramatically just before the end of
spring training. An injury to another outfielder, Brian Simmons,
opened a starting spot, and Singleton was ready to claim it, thanks
to intensive on-the-job training he received from Darrin Jackson, a
veteran outfielder with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darrin Jackson was like a father to him,'' Schueler said. ``He
talked to him about hitting, playing defense, the importance of
being a big leaguer. Chris grew up quick. D.J. did a good job with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez has also grown up, Schueler said. He is only thankful
that Ordonez has matured with the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We almost made a big mistake with him four years ago,'' the
general manager said. ``We left him off the roster because we had
some pitchers we wanted to protect. We heard three or four clubs
might be interested in him in the Rule 5 draft, but we were very
fortunate that no one took him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez drove in 117 runs and hit 30 home runs while batting
.301 in his second season last year. Singleton batted .300 and hit
17 home runs. Lee, who was a rookie like Singleton, finished with a
.293 average and 16 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday's game with the Detroit Tigers, with whom
the White Sox had a couple of costly brawls last weekend, Singleton
was hitting .310 with 20 runs batted in, Lee was .311 with 21 RBI
and Ordonez was .284 with 16 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The outfield, however, is not the only reason the White Sox are
in first place. An assortment of other players has also helped make
them the best-hitting team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas appears to have rediscovered his lusty stroke after
a couple of mediocre seasons. Paul Konerko, whom Schueler acquired
from Cincinnati about the same time he got Singleton from the
Yankees, is establishing himself as a solid, productive hitter.
Jose Valentin, obtained from Milwaukee in January, hit for the
cycle the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a carryover from the middle of spring
training,'' Schueler said. ``We struggled early and we worked on a
lot of things. All of a sudden we settled in. These guys started
swinging around the middle of March and they haven't stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the White Sox to stay with the Indians, but they
may hit well enough to become a wild-card contender. Will they have
enough pitching to attain that status?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say,'' Schueler said. ``Right now we're not
pitching up to our capabilities. Some of these kids are learning;
they're getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   White Sox fans remain skeptical. They remember how a few years
ago the team traded away veteran pitchers when the White Sox were
in the race. Even some executives of other teams wonder if Jerry
Reinsdorf, the managing owner, will spend money, if necessary, to
bolster the pitching staff later in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on how we look and how we're progressing at the
All-Star break, I'd do it,'' Schueler said about a possible pursuit
of veteran pitching. ``Jerry's behind me 100 percent. The money
will be there. I see no problem going out and getting somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox just have to give Schueler a reason to do it.
</P>

   Changing Their Colors
</P>
<P>
   With two games left in April, the St. Louis Cardinals had
already broken the major league home run record for the month by
swatting 52. That total not long ago would have come close to
representing a typical season for Cardinals' home runs.
</P>
<P>
   In an 11-season span from 1982 through 1992, the Cardinals did
not reach triple digits in home runs for any season. In 1986, they
hit only 58. Andy Van Slyke, with 13, was the only player in double
digits. That period for the Cardinals was the equivalent of the
dead-ball era before Babe Ruth. Now they are playing in the Mark
McGwire era.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds on McGwire
</P>
<P>
   Having Mark McGwire as a teammate has been a revelation to Jim
Edmonds. ``Walking around a mall with him is like being with the
president,'' the Cardinals' center fielder said. ``He needs
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds and McGwire used to play against each other in the
American League, Edmonds with Anaheim, McGwire with Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become a better hitter,'' Edmonds said. ``It's
unbelievable what he does, as big and as strong as he is. He stays
within himself and doesn't try to do too much. He was a free
swinger earlier in his career. He's more under control now, has
more concentration, more focus. It's fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Cardinals acquired McGwire in July 1997, he had planned
to become a free agent after that season. But he became enamored of
the city and the team and signed a new contract. Edmonds, whom the
Cardinals obtained near the end of spring training this year, was
asked if he has had a similar experience that would keep him from
becoming a free agent after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to see that from Day 1 in spring training,'' said
Edmonds, who has become an instant hit because of his hitting. ``We
had more people and more noise at spring training than there was at
Anaheim Stadium. In the city, everywhere you go it's a sea of red.
It's been great. I'm going to take a wait-and-see attitude. It's
not up to me if I want to stay here. It's up to them. We'll see how
it works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomer the Sage
</P>
<P>
   When David Wells pitched for the Yankees, people might have
found it difficult to view him as a role model for younger
pitchers. But Dave Stewart, Toronto's assistant general manager,
said Wells has taken on that kind of role with the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomer has been very big for our club,'' Stewart said. ``He's
been outstanding. He's assumed the role of helping these kids grow,
talking to them and giving them a better understanding of what they
need to be doing out there. He's also been a great example of what
they should be doing. He's thrown a couple games under 100 pitches.
He's been very supportive of the staff. He's being a leader and an
example to these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, himself a former pitcher and pitching coach, credited
the 36-year-old Wells with a new maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the big difference,'' Stewart said, ``is he's been
given the responsibility. I don't think he's ever been given that
responsibility before. I don't think anybody has trusted him with
it, but he's been given the responsibility and he's done a good job
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanishing Species
</P>
<P>
   In a season when balls fly out of and all around parks like sand
in a desert storm, the Los Angeles Dodgers played an astonishing
pair of games last week, losing 1-0 on consecutive days to the Mets
and the Atlanta Braves. Low-scoring games evidently are not
extinct. In fact, one general manager thinks they have a future in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the low-scoring games have brought more excitement
than I thought,'' Doug Melvin of Texas said. ``You think the next
run might be the winning run. Every hit, every play is critical. We
had a game in Cleveland where we were up, 1-0. Every time a guy got
on second base you started thinking about defensive strategy.
Everybody bears down more. You're on the edge of your seat. The
games with the Yankees, even though we lost them, they were
exciting games.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin referred to a pair of 5-4 extra-inning losses the Rangers
had to the Yankees in Texas. ``They're better than those softball
scores,'' he said, alluding to the 18-11 type of games that have
been prevalent this season. &QL;

IN NORTH CAROLINA, 2 TIGHT PRIMARY RACES FOR GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHEBORO, N.C. _ It was only 7:30 a.m. when a group of
Republican loyalists began gathering Friday at Bailey's Coffee and
News, but it was not too early for state Rep. Leo Daughtry to start
calling his opponent for governor, Richard Vinroot, a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Vinroot has been criticized by the National Rifle Association as
a gun-control advocate, Daughtry said. Vinroot is pro-choice,
Daughtry said. Vinroot proposed a tax increase while he was mayor
of Charlotte, Daughtry said. ``I think all those add up to being a
liberal,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Vinroot, of course, rejects Daughtry's characterization of his
record, and many observers of North Carolina politics consider it
laughable. He, in turn, has portrayed Daughtry as a big spender for
supporting appropriations bills that, as it happens, won nearly
universal bipartisan backing in the General Assembly. He has also
suggested that his opponent is soft on abortion because Daughtry
voted in 1997 for a bill to ban late-term abortions that allowed
exceptions when the mother's life was endangered or her health
``gravely imperiled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to position himself as something he's not,'' said
Vinroot, who has called for an absolute ban on late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   As is so often the case in Republican politics these days, the
race for this state's Republican nomination for governor has become
a charge toward the right, with candidates showing little restraint
_ and often little concern for the facts _ in painting each other
as closet liberals.
</P>
<P>
   The final days of campaigning before Tuesday's primaries
resemble the bitter battle in the Republican presidential primary
in South Carolina in March, when Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
questioned the conservative credentials of his opponent, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona. Bush's symbolic move to the right helped him win
the primary and, apparently, the nomination. But he is now
struggling to position himself back toward the center in time for
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties will hold primaries in North Carolina on Tuesday.
The winners will battle in November to succeed Gov. James B. Hunt
Jr., a popular Democrat who has served four terms, first from 1977
to 1985 and then from 1993 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show Vinroot, who was Charlotte's mayor from 1991
to 1995, with a small lead over Daughtry, a lawyer and businessman
from Smithfield who was once majority leader of the State House. A
third candidate, Chuck Neely, a lawyer from Raleigh and a former
state representative, is trailing. The leading vote-getter must win
40 percent to avoid a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, where party loyalty has become a means
of separating two candidates with similar stands on major issues,
polls show Attorney General Mike Easley with a narrow lead over Lt.
Gov. Dennis Wicker. Wicker, the son of a prominent state
legislator, seems to have the support of the state's Democratic
establishment, which could be significant in a low-turnout
election. But Easley, a former prosecutor who pursued drug
traffickers and corrupt Democratic politicians with equal relish,
has capitalized on his image as a maverick.
</P>
<P>
   Wicker and Easley have vowed to maintain the state's emphasis on
improving schools, a hallmark of Hunt's four terms. In contrast to
their Republican opponents, they both favor bringing a lottery to
North Carolina to generate revenue for education programs.
</P>
<P>
   They differ, however, on how the proceeds should be spent.
Wicker, still boyish at 47, would dedicate the money to college
scholarships and universal prekindergarten programs, as is done in
neighboring Georgia. Easley, 50, who grew up on a tobacco farm
outside Rocky Mount, would use the money to reduce class size in
the lower grades.
</P>
<P>
   Wicker originally opposed the lottery but said he was persuaded
to change positions after watching North Carolinians cross into
neighboring states to buy lottery tickets. ``People all over this
state are playing the lottery right now,'' he said while
campaigning at a Charlotte day care center. ``There's $100 million
a year going to Virginia. They go to Georgia and play it. And they
play it on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leading Republican candidates oppose the lottery,
setting up a clear choice for voters in the fall. ``It's teaching
children that there's some solution to their problems in a
12-million-to-1 shot,'' Vinroot, 59, said in an interview in his
Charlotte campaign headquarters. ``The ends don't justify the
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Daughtry, who is also 59, agreed that the lottery ``sends a
wrong message to our young people that you can get something for
nothing.'' And, he added, ``it's a tax on poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Vinroot's second race for governor, and it is by all
accounts more aggressive than his losing campaign against Robin
Hayes in the 1996 Republican primary. Vinroot, a former University
of North Carolina basketball bench-warmer, acknowledges that he let
Hayes define him that year, and he has spent much of this campaign
raising money for television attacks on his opponent. His chief
strategist this year is Carter Wrenn, who was the architect of
Republican Sen. Jesse Helms' toughest campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But in the primary, at least, Vinroot remains vulnerable with
conservatives because of his past associations with Planned
Parenthood. He and his wife made small contributions to the group
for several years, and Vinroot cut the ribbon on a new Planned
Parenthood center as mayor of Charlotte. He said he only later
learned that Planned Parenthood performed abortions, and would not
have supported the group if he had known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe everybody knew, but I didn't,'' he said. ``Wish I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Daughtry finds that explanation incredible. ``It was one of the
biggest abortion providers in North Carolina,'' he said.
``Everybody's convinced that he knew what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Christian Coalition began distributing hundreds
of thousands of voter guides asserting that Vinroot supports
abortion on demand in the first three months of pregnancy. Vinroot
said the group had grossly distorted his position. He said that he
supported abortions in the first trimester only in cases of rape,
incest or danger to the life of the mother, and that he would ban
all abortions after the first trimester.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, Wicker is trying to catch Easley by
planting doubts with party loyalists about Easley's devotion to
their cause. In advertising, campaign statements and interviews
last week, Wicker has noted that Easley rejected calls to drop out
of the 1990 campaign for the U.S. Senate after forcing a runoff
with the front-runner, Harvey Gantt. Gantt won, but then lost the
general election to Helms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about loyalty, it's about steadfastness,'' Wicker said in
an interview. ``You have to know that the Democratic nominee is
going to stand tall in tough times, and I don't know that he's done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley did not respond to a request for an interview.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He was there, in the cockpit, on the Sunday
afternoon in the mid-1970s when George W. Bush last took a plane
into the air, steered a wobbly and uncertain course over Midland,
Texas, nearly bungled the landing and seemed to realize that his
high-flying days were forever past.
</P>
<P>
   He was there, too, on the morning in the mid-1980s when Bush
woke up with a hangover and a pang of regret and decided never to
touch alcohol again.
</P>
<P>
   On the night before the Iowa caucuses in late January, he
distracted Bush with fine cigars and idle banter. And a week later,
as the first exit polls from New Hampshire were about to come in,
he and his wife were the only ones other than the Texas governor's
immediate family who sat with him in his hotel suite, helping him
relax.
</P>
<P>
   Donald L. Evans, it seems, has almost always been present at the
pivotal junctures in Bush's life, an important witness to the
evolution of both the man and the candidate and an integral part of
his political campaigns, especially the current one.
</P>
<P>
   But while Evans has attracted public notice over the last year
principally for his work as Bush's national finance chairman and
his hand in reaping a record-breaking sum of contributions, his
role is much broader, deeper and less tidily defined than that.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be equally important if Bush winds up in the White
House, a fact made even clearer late this week, when Evans was
appointed chairman of Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's obviously George's closest confidant other than
his wife,'' said Dr. Charles Younger, a physician in Midland,
Texas, who is a longtime friend of both men. ``He'll do whatever
George asks him to, whether it's go here or go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this week's appointment, there was speculation that Bush
would dispatch Evans to Washington, so he could represent and
safeguard the Bush campaign's interests at the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the governor's decision to send someone else only
validated the degree to which he depends on Evans, whom he wanted
to keep within quick and easy reach.
</P>
<P>
   The two men's friendship is significant not only for its length
and strength _ it began 25 years ago in Midland, where Bush had
once gone to elementary school with the girl who later became
Evans' wife _ but also for its crystalline window into salient
facets of Bush's personality and priorities, his likes and needs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush prizes the comfort of the familiar, and Evans is in some
ways a personification of that, a colleague with a background,
personal history and conversational dialect that resemble the
governor's own and helped them forge an almost instantaneous bond.
</P>
<P>
   They were both born in July 1946. They both have fathers who
fought in World War II. They both earned MBAs in the 1970s and
toted them to Midland to make a mark in the oil business. They are
both fiercely devout Methodists. They both favor the word ``buddy''
and lean on the phrase ``you're a good man'' to signal approval of
male acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   There are limits to Bush's appetite for the stiff ceremonies and
weighty colloquies of political life, and Evans, like many of the
governor's best friends, is an essentially nonpolitical person who
connects him to a time before all the talk shows and television
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can be a showboat, and Evans, like Bush's wife, Laura, is a
gentler, more subdued and more self-effacing companion who never
tugs too hard at the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is a source of unstinting loyalty, which is a
nonnegotiable demand of anyone in Bush's inner circle and a vestige
of the Texas governor's belief that his father was occasionally ill
served by aides with excessive ambitions and egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of his advisers are his friends and are loyal to him, and
he trusts them,'' Evans said in an interview in his office in
Midland, where he is chairman and chief executive of Tom Brown
Inc., an oil and gas company.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a little different with us,'' Evans said. ``It's
different when you have a long-term friendship that's stood the
test of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there are people in politics for all different
reasons,'' Bush said. ``In his case, his question is, `What can I
do to help George W. Bush?' Some people first say, `What can I do
to help my career and, oh, can I help it maybe by helping
somebody?' That's not Don Evans at all.''
</P>
<P>
   His assessment was borne out by interviews with Evans, whose
ability to turn a question about the counsel he has given Bush into
a reverent testimonial about the governor's talents is a feat to
behold.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that afternoon in New Hampshire and what he did to
cushion the blow of Bush's defeat by Sen.r John McCain of Arizona,
Evans said, ``There was this question out there _ I had been asked
a number of times _ how does he handle adversity?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one that can quickly let go of the loss,'' Evans added,
each word coming several seconds after the previous one and only
after pained consideration. ``He takes responsibility for it,
whatever the outcome is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me back up. He'll take responsibility for the defeat. The
victory, he's quick to show his appreciation to others and all they
did.''
</P>
<P>
   If Evans is actually giving the candidate concrete advice, he is
not about to divulge what it is or take credit for it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bush's other friends and advisers described Evans'
influence in terms not of how the candidate thinks or what he
advocates but of how he copes. Having Evans around clearly makes
Bush feel safe and calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush once said, about his old man's advisers, that if a
grenade came along, it was their job to jump on it,'' said a senior
campaign aide. ``The governor wouldn't have to say that to Don. Don
would already be lying on it.''
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain why, during the most intense phase of the
primaries _ when there were not too many fund-raising events on the
schedule and Evans could technically have stayed home in Midland _
he was on the road with Bush perhaps more than any other senior
adviser except Karen P. Hughes, the campaign's communications
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows that I don't particularly care for advice sometimes,
just conversation,'' Bush said. ``There's that mental down time
that candidates need _ not to be always on, always answering and
figuring out the next step. If he asks me a question, I can tell
him I don't want to answer it without hurting his feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Evans' devotion is requited. Exemplifying how generous the Texas
governor has been to his friends with appointments to honorary
positions on state boards, Evans sits on the most coveted one of
all: the University of Texas Board of Regents. Bush put him there
in 1995; two years later, the other regents selected Evans to be
their chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Evans' roots in Texas are deep. The second of three children, he
was born and reared in and around Houston, where his father worked
as a manager with Shell Oil Co.
</P>
<P>
   His main sport in high school was golf. At the University of
Texas in Austin, he joined a fraternity, was elected to an elite
service organization named the Texas Cowboys, made good grades and
earned an undergraduate degree in engineering. He returned to the
university several years later for his MBA, which he received in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   By that point he had married Susie Marinis, a college classmate
and a native of Midland, where the couple headed in 1975 and he
took a job with Tom Brown.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although he spent two months roughnecking on rigs to get a
glimpse of the business from the ground up, he was already on a
track to the upper rungs of the executive ladder. He said that he
had landed in the right place at the right time, joining a
fast-growing industry that was in desperate need of young talent
with the kind of financial savvy he had picked up in business
school.
</P>
<P>
   Evans' friends noted that his combination of a Texas drawl and
an innately suave, dignified demeanor made him a perfect bridge
between the oil fields of western Texas and the money wells of Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush also arrived in Midland in 1975, carrying a freshly minted
MBA from Harvard, and he immediately looked up Susie Evans, with
whom he had attended elementary school in Midland in the 1950s,
when his own father had looked to make his fortune in oil.
</P>
<P>
   Susie Evans welcomed Bush back with open arms and took pity on
his bachelor status. On his nightly visits to the Evanses, she got
his dirty clothes, while her husband got the company of a fellow
sports nut.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd watch TV and we'd eat and I'd do his laundry and he'd
be on his way,'' Evans said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Evans and Bush bonded over oil and weekend golf outings and
daily midafternoon runs. Bush relished being the faster of the two,
just as he reveled in being the ebullient and irreverent one.
</P>
<P>
   Evans was always a bit more ruminative and settled, a
temperament sealed by his earlier start on fatherhood _ he has
three children _ and the awesome responsibility he encountered.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, his second child, Jenny, was born with mental
retardation, the severity of which became clear only gradually.
Today, at 23, she is still unable to talk, although she can play
some sports and understand much of what is said to her.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Evans once remarked that she was the best thing that ever
happened to him. Asked recently to explain that, he bowed his head
for several seconds, and when he raised it, his eyes glistened with
tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating for someone to tell you that your daughter is
retarded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once you get through that,'' he added, ``it causes you to
really get a deeper understanding of why you're here, what you're
doing here. It gave me a chance to get reminded, in a big way, that
I'm here to serve others.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans ended up on the boards of various organizations that help
people like Jenny.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   His charitable work reflected the prominence and affluence he
had achieved in becoming president of Tom Brown in 1979, when he
was just 33. His place in the Texas business world also helped him
raise money for Bush's political campaigns, beginning with his
failed bid for Congress in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Evans tilled the financial soil again in 1994, when Bush ran for
governor; in 1998, when he ran for re-election; and in 1999, when
he announced his presidential bid. By last month, the tally for the
latest effort was more than $80 million, a record in presidential
politics.
</P>
<P>
   That owed something to luck, something to Republicans' hunger
for the White House and something to the campaign's ability to tap
the network of Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   But it also owed something to Evans' almost preternatural
graciousness, smoothness and air of quiet authority, a
confidence-winning persona that sometimes sets friends to wondering
how it is that Bush, and not Evans, wound up scaling the pinnacles
of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Evans has always been a steadying influence on Bush. He was
among the people who, in 1985, encouraged Bush to get into an adult
Bible study group, where according to a mutual friend Bush once
answered a question about the definition of a prophet by saying it
was the result of revenues exceeding expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   It was Evans who gave Bush a daily guide for reading the entire
Bible, in segments, over a year, something that the governor
subsequently did more than once.
</P>
<P>
   And it is Evans to whom Hughes and other senior advisers in the
Bush campaign frequently turn for the best, most accurate
prediction of how Bush will feel about events and issues in his
political life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're almost like brothers,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although Bush left Midland in 1988 to go to Washington _ and,
later Dallas and Austin _ there has never been any real distance
between him and Evans, whose sustained role in serving Bush's
aspirations has often required him to spend days on end away from
his family.
</P>
<P>
   He does not complain. He said he believed in Bush's goodness as
a person, fitness for leadership and worthiness as a friend. He
wants to do all he can to help his steadfast buddy achieve his most
ardent desires.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants to take care of him. Hughes recalled an early
encounter with Evans in 1994, when she signed on to Bush's campaign
for governor and was in the frequent business of haranguing him to
add yet another phone call or yet another interview to an already
crammed schedule.
</P>
<P>
   One day, she said, Evans simply took a look at his friend, read
the weariness in his features and told her: ``That's it. After
this, he's not going to do anymore. He's going to take a break.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody questioned him,'' Hughes said, including Bush. ``That's
exactly what we did.''

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR TO SUPPORT BAN ON RACIAL PROFILING 

</HEADLINE>
 - PROFILING-NYT c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  LOS ANGELES _ Gov. Gray Davis of California has agreed to support
legislation outlawing racial profiling by police officers, though
the bill no longer contains what critics say was a crucial
component for determining the extent of the problem.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The governor's decision follows a federal appeals court ruling
that ethnic appearance was not a relevant consideration in
assessing suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Davis vetoed legislation last year that would have required law
enforcement agencies to collect data to determine whether they
stopped minority drivers disproportionately, saying ``there is no
evidence that this practice is taking place statewide.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation now supported by Davis was written by state Sen.
Kevin Murray, whose two previous versions of the bill were passed
by both houses of the Legislature only to be vetoed by Davis.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to declaring racial profiling illegal, the bill
would require all officers to undergo expanded diversity training
and to provide their business card and a complaint hot-line number
to people who are stopped but not cited.
</P>
<P>
   Previous versions were opposed by the law enforcement lobby and
big-city police chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Murray said that he did not believe data
collection ``is a significant part of the solution anymore'' and
that the new bill provided an important complaint mechanism for
people who feel they have been wrongly singled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us some time to get here,'' he said, ``but I think it
will give us one of the most comprehensive racial profiling bills
in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the latest
version, saying that raced-based stops are already illegal and that
the proposal lacks any component that would help determine whether
minority drivers were stopped disproportionately.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles chapter of the ACLU is representing plaintiffs
in a suit against the Los Angeles Police Department over stops that
the group says were race-based.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally inadequate,'' said Ramona Ripston, the executive
director of the ACLU chapter in Los Angeles. ``This legislation
doesn't really change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office declined to respond to the criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled
this month that ethnicity was not a relevant criterion for police
stops.
</P>
<P>
   When Davis vetoed the data-collection bill last year, he ordered
the California Highway Patrol to collect the information and asked
local police departments to do so voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose Police Department, which had been collecting data
before the governor's request, has found that Hispanics and blacks
are pulled over in greater percentage than they are represented in
the population, though the department says the stops are in keeping
with racial breakdowns on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis.

STUDIES FIND RESEARCH ON WOMEN LACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Medical researchers who receive federal money often
flout a federal law that requires them to analyze the effects of
new drugs and treatments on women, three new studies have found.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that health care for women may suffer as a result
because researchers overlook important differences between the
sexes in clinical trials evaluating new methods of treating or
preventing disease.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions of the three reports are somewhat surprising
because the Clinton administration has repeatedly emphasized the
importance of women's health, and Congress has been prodding the
National Institutes of Health to pay more attention to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   One study is about to be issued by the General Accounting
Office, an investigative arm of Congress. The others, by an
academic physician and several scientists, will be published this
summer in The Journal of Women's Health, a peer-reviewed
publication focusing on diseases that pose particular risks to
women.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in the emerging field of ``gender-based biology''
have found that men and women sometimes report different symptoms
of the same disease, and that certain drugs are more effective in
one sex than the other, or produce more severe side effects in one
sex. Also, some diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid
arthritis afflict far more women than men.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists receiving federal money generally include women as
subjects in their clinical research, as the government requires.
But they often ignore the requirement that they analyze their data
to see if women and men respond differently to a given treatment,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of including women, officials said, is not to
satisfy quotas for proportional representation, but to acquire
scientific knowledge that can be generalized to the entire
population of the United States. That knowledge, they said, can
lead to major improvements in care.
</P>
<P>
   In the report to be issued next month, the General Accounting
Office found that while the National Institutes of Health ``has
made substantial progress in ensuring inclusion of women in
studies,'' it has not enforced the requirement for researchers to
examine whether women and men fare differently in such clinical
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it said, the NIH, the government's main sponsor of
biomedical research, has done a haphazard job of tracking data on
research that involves or affects women. As a result, it said, the
figures are not always accurate or consistent.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Federal policy on women's health research has evolved by fits
and starts. In 1986, the National Institutes of Health announced a
policy encouraging the inclusion of women in clinical research. In
1990, the General Accounting Office found little progress in
carrying out the policy, and the NIH established an office to
promote such research.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Congress passed a law stipulating that women must be
included in clinical trials in numbers ``sufficient to provide for
a valid analysis'' of any differences in the way women and men
respond to drugs, therapies and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of such a requirement, researchers had often
reported data from men as if they applied to both men and women.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Now, in its latest investigation, the General Accounting Office
has found that many clinical trials financed by the National
Institutes of Health ``were designed to include women, but not in
numbers high enough to allow analysis that would definitively
measure different outcomes for men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis E. Greenberger, executive director of the Society for
Women's Health Research, an advocacy group that worked with
Congress on the 1993 law, said the findings confirmed what she had
come to suspect. ``The GAO report substantiates our concern that
sex analysis is not routinely being done in research supported by
the NIH,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Ralbovsky, a spokesman for the National Institutes of
Health, said agency officials had no immediate comment on the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Delores L. Parron, a deputy assistant secretary of health and
human services who used to work at the NIH, said: ``Investigators
can demonstrate to us that they've included women in their studies,
but they don't carefully describe differences in outcomes for males
and females. It's frustrating. People are reporting their results
in a sloppy way, lumping together the numbers for men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate study, being published in The Journal of Women's
Health, found that very few researchers analyzed their data to
determine whether prescription drugs, surgical procedures and
preventive measures, like changes in diet or behavior, had
different effects on women and men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysis of outcomes by sex is sorely lacking,'' said the
article, by Dr. Regina M. Vidaver and colleagues at the Society for
Women's Health Research and George Washington University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vidaver, a molecular biologist, and her colleagues reviewed
research published from 1993 to 1998 in four of the nation's
leading medical journals, including The New England Journal of
Medicine and The Journal of the American Medical Association, to
see if researchers had analyzed the data by sex. Some scientists
said they had had difficulty recruiting women to participate, in
part because women had child care obligations more often than men.
</P>
<P>
   The third study, by Dr. Katherine D. Sherif of the MCP Hahnemann
School of Medicine in Philadelphia, found that a small proportion
of published research _ less than 15 percent _ did any analysis of
the differences in results for men and women.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Sherif said, doctors are sometimes slow to
recognize dangerous drug combinations. For example, she said, it
was mainly women who suffered life-threatening abnormalities in
heart rhythm when they took the antihistamine Seldane in
combination with erythromycin, a common antibiotic, or
ketoconazole, an anti-fungal agent.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office said the National Institutes of Health had
decided that people conducting certain types of research did not
need to report on the inclusion of women. For example, it said,
studies that involve only specimens of tissue or body fluids are
exempt.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists said the broad exemption might be
inappropriate, because it sometimes makes a difference whether
scientists are examining cells from a woman or a man.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Cohen, the editor of Nature Genetics, a monthly journal,
said: ``I can understand that exception. But it could lead to the
loss of useful information because the cells of men and women, in
any part of the body, have different genetic characteristics, and
they are exposed and respond to different hormones.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the cost of including women in a research project
is not a permissible reason to exclude them. The requirement does
not apply to the study of diseases that affect only men, like
prostate or testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Denise L. Faustman, co-editor of The Journal of Women's
Health, said: ``It's hard to know who's responsible for the failure
to do more sex analysis of clinical research. You can blame the
government for not enforcing the requirements. You can blame the
investigators. You can blame the journal editors and peer reviewers
who don't require such analysis prior to the publication of
research studies.''

ALBRIGHT'S SPOKESMAN ENDS SINGULAR TENURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ James P. Rubin, the departing State Department
spokesman, will do anything for Madeleine Albright. Except carry
her lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only place he drew the line,'' said a Rubin friend.
``A lot of guys in the office had no problems carrying her purse.''
</P>
<P>
   During nearly eight years at the side of the first woman to
serve as secretary of state, Rubin fulfilled a number of roles:
friend, adviser, protege, gossip buddy, fashion consultant and
self-described ``intellectual mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 40, he is leaving Washington behind to move to London
with another high-powered woman, his wife, Christiane Amanpour, the
CNN foreign correspondent, who gave birth to their son a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a farewell ceremony last week, Albright said that Rubin had
evolved into one of the most influential and best-known spokesmen
for American diplomacy from his first press briefing, when he

   Hundreds of briefings and not a few arrows later, Rubin leaves
with a reputation for being accessible and well informed, if
sometimes self-promoting. Even his mentor could not resist a dig.
``What can we possibly say about Jamie Rubin that he hasn't already
said about himself?'' Albright asked.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists have relied on him for both the intricacies of
policy _ he is a former Senate foreign affairs aide and arms
control expert _ and as a witness who could recount how decisions
were made. Some of those decisions he even played a hand in
himself, expanding the spokesman's customary role, at Albright's
prompting.
</P>
<P>
   She gave Rubin an office next to her own, on the prestigious
seventh floor, a flight up from the quarters of previous spokesmen.
(Richard Boucher, a former ambassador, will succeed Rubin with a
sixth-floor office.)
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Rubin took on a senior envoy's role last summer,
when he traveled to Kosovo to try to persuade the Albanian rebel
leader, Hashim Thaci, to disarm with NATO guarantees. Rubin said
the ensuing accord and the gratitude of Kosovo Albanians was among
his most ``emotionally satisfying experiences,'' though some have
criticized the agreement as deferring too much to a ruthless,
irregular army and giving it too much of a role in settling the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has been a staunch defender of administration policy in
Kosovo and blamed the American news media for doubting that the
United States' bombing campaign last year would dislodge Serbian
control of Kosovo, which it did. ``It seemed like we were really
alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the dual role of public voice and private counsel, Rubin
recast the spokesman's post in a relentless era of cable
television, 24-hour news cycles and, he says, an increasingly
impatient and adversarial American press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compression of the news cycle has put a greater premium on
highly critical reporting,'' Rubin said in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   News organizations these days report and analyze information so
quickly, and with such skepticism, that the State Department hews
to a defensive crouch, he said. ``That harms our ability to get our
policy across to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rubin plainly enjoyed the news media glare,
and with cameras rolling, rarely used four words when fourteen
would do.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's comfort in the public arena _ like Albright's own _
did not come easily. The pair grappled with searing scrutiny _ such
as when Albright learned of her Jewish heritage through press
accounts during her first week on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and the secretary's chief of staff, Elaine K. Shocas,
forged a tight circle, joining Albright at the movies on Sunday
afternoons. He dismissed as ``silly psychobabble'' the notion that
he filled the role of the son Albright never had. Albright's reply:
``Oy vey!''
</P>
<P>
   But, friends say, Rubin's proximity to powerful women has
groomed him well for marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked on him very hard to smooth out the rough edges,''
said Shocas, the chief of staff. ``Passing him off to Christiane
Amanpour is a great thing we've done.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ In the northeastern corner of North Korea,
the industrial port city of Chongjin now lies nearly idle, and
recent Western visitors there report that its hulking factories are
rusting, with two-thirds of them producing little or no smoke from
their stacks.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be surprising, since the port was a major
distribution point for goods from the now defunct Soviet bloc.
Nowadays, the visitors say, instead of toiling in factories,
workers pan for gold at huge riverbed sites using methods
reminiscent of the old American West.
</P>
<P>
   In the opposite corner of the country, near another port city,
Nampo, idled workers have also been put to another form of manual
labor _ breaking rocks. The ostensible purpose of this exercise is
to help build a major eight-lane highway that will link new and
planned industrial zones _ with almost state-of-the-art electronics
assembly plants _ to customers and investors in capitalist markets
around the world, particularly the country's archenemy, South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, experts have watched North Korea suffer through
one of the worst economic slides of recent history and wondered
when the country would finally collapse. In the last year or so,
though, as North Korea's still small modern sector has risen
impressively, the question seems to have shifted. Now people wonder
who will win the horse race between a dying Stalinist economy and a
sprouting new one that represents the country's first tentative
steps into global capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   In the most dramatic diplomatic development involving North
Korea in years, Pyongyang recently agreed to hold its first summit
meeting with South Korea, which is scheduled to take place in the
North Korean capital from June 12 to 14. If the talks go well they
could pave the way for an end to the state of war that has remained
in effect on the peninsula since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important to the isolated, economically devastated
North, improved relations with South Korea could open spigots of
trade, aid and finance that are desperately needed to stave off the
country's economic death.
</P>
<P>
   Already, North Korea is earning close to $1 billion a year in
tourism revenue paid by the South Korean conglomerate, Hyundai, to
operate tours to a scenic, mountainous enclave on the country's
southwestern coast. And with no chance of the North turning the
economy around with its own means, many analysts say the prospect
of far more investment _ even if a politically risky proposition _
has become irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   By last winter, the economic situation in North Korea had become
so bad that visitors reported there was no heating in many
government offices or in the hotels reserved for foreigners. Even
in the capital, residents had taken to raising rabbits and goats in
their homes to provide protein and because the skins and fur offer
protection against the bitter cold.
</P>
<P>
   But against this backdrop of severe hardship, frequent visitors
and other close observers of the country say that there are also
significant signs of change, and _ although the word is usually
used with caution _ recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country that is incredibly resilient,'' said one
U.S. government expert. ``Despite all our analysis that shows they
are only operating at a fraction of the output of even five years
ago, they are still eking out a living.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's predicament is in part a reflection of the
economic failures of a Stalinist system that prizes totalitarian
control to a degree that is extraordinary even by communist
standards. Badly compounding matters, the country has also suffered
extraordinary bad luck since its lifeline to Moscow disappeared
along with the Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, North Korea began to suffer sharp drops in grain
production. Two years later, its industrial output went into free
fall. In 1992, China, by then its only major ally, suspended free
oil shipments. And in 1995, with the economy already in steep
decline, the country suffered its worst floods of the century,
devastating crops and unleashing a famine.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders can only guess at the exact toll, but between 200,000
and 1 million people are estimated to have died of hunger. Some
American experts continue to sound pessimistic about arresting the
economic slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must consider that the North Korean economy could break
down completely, precipitating social chaos and threatening the
existence of the regime itself,'' said Gen. Thomas A. Schwartz,
commander of the 37,000 American troops stationed in South Korea,
in testimony before the Senate in March. ``We should anticipate a
flood of refuges, humanitarian needs, and the potential for chaos,
a military coup or the devastation of civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, North Korea has frightened its neighbors
and Washington by pursuing a ballistic missile program, which
included a surprise test launch over Japan's main island in August
1998. Treating its weapons industry as a lucrative export sector,
North Korea has marketed its missile technology to Pakistan and in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Washington has negotiated with Pyongyang,
obtaining a suspension of its missile tests in exchange for lifting
certain sanctions. The emphasis of much of the recent diplomacy has
been to get North Korea to continue to moderate its behavior in
order to gain access to international financial assistance and
outside investment.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's state budget was the equivalent of $9 billion last
year, compared to $15 billion five years earlier. According to Pyon
Jinil, editor-in-chief of Korea Report, a newsletter published in
Japan, the country already receives approximately $600 million in
foreign aid each year, or one-fifteenth of the budget, mostly in
the form of food and fuel assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The country's rough patchwork of old, clearly moribund heavy
industries and newer, higher-tech ones _ textile factories, and
modern assembly plants typically producing goods for companies in
China and South Korea _ is plainly visible to Westerners who have
recently toured the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation that prevails in the old Soviet-era rust-belt
towns like Chongjin, where only about 20 percent of the state-owned
factories are still functioning at anything approaching normal
levels, is by far more typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that is pretty representative of the country,'' said
Kenneth C. Quinones, a former State Department expert who has often
visited the country as director of the Northeast Asia project of
the aid group Mercy Corps International.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``I recently visited Nampo, an old industrial city, and at least
one-third of the time there is no municipal power at all,'' he
said. ``But not far from there, at Kangso, there is a lot of
high-tech construction under way by Hyundai and Samsung. Go a
little ways to the west, and you come to another Soviet factory
town in total disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just outside of the town you see hundreds of Korean workers
building an eight-lane highway to the capital,'' Quinones
continued. ``They are crushing rocks with their hands to make the
concrete.''
</P>
<P>
   As they watch projects like these come together, many analysts
say that what the North Koreans appear to be doing is building new
infrastructure with a view to drawing still more investment from
foreign companies, especially China and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their country's proximity, South Korean leaders are
more fearful than anyone of the prospect of a North Korean
collapse, and believe that the South, although 25 to 30 times
richer than the North, can ill afford a German-style reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Since his inaugural speech three years ago, South Korea's
president, Kim Dae-jung, has repeatedly declared his willingness to
assist the North. Kim's offers were made more explicit than ever in
early March when he traveled to Berlin and pledged not just to
encourage private investment in North Korea, but to help pay for
the reconstruction of roads, dams and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders can only guess what the North Korean leadership's
ultimate intentions are, beyond immediate survival _ whether they
view the newer industries as short-term palliatives or some new
economic vocation altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Beijing, which is North Korea's one remaining ally,
has gently urged Pyongyang to undertake the kind of
capitalist-style reforms that have turned China into one of the
world's fastest-growing economies. And for years, Kim Il Sung,
North Korea's deceased founder, and more recently his son and
successor, Kim Jong Il, have politely but steadfastly declined.
</P>
<P>
   But in Seoul, Pyongyang's acceptance of a summit meeting is seen
by many as a logical next step in a progression of extremely
cautious but steady efforts to open the North Korean economy to
foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   The trick for Pyongyang is to achieve this gradual economic
opening without losing control over the country, the observers say.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is seen by the North as the most promising source of
new capital, but because their cultures and history are in fact
one, also the most potentially subversive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are feeling the quills of the porcupine,'' said Do
Yong-seung, a North Korea expert from the Samsung Economic Research
Institute. ``They need South Korean capital badly, but they are
acutely fearful of its dangers.''

BREAKUP CASE IS BUILT ON NOTION OF POTENTIAL RIVAL FOR WINDOWS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The overriding policy goal of a remedy in the Microsoft
antitrust case, the government has said repeatedly, is to make the
world safe for future innovation. The door to fair competition must
be left open, the government insisted, so that the Microsoft Corp.
cannot thwart its next head-on challenger with illegal tactics as
it did the Netscape Communications Corp., the pioneer in Internet
browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   In their papers supporting the government's proposal to split
Microsoft into two companies, three economists have identified the
challenger that could be the ``next Netscape'': Microsoft's own
Office suite of software, like Word for word processing and Excel
for spreadsheet calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The government plan, no doubt, will strike the executive team at
Microsoft as a ``Pogo'' policy for competition, recalling the
observation of Walt Kelly's cartoon possum: ``We have met the enemy
and he is us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the economists intend no humor in their prediction that the
Office business, once placed in a separate company from Microsoft's
industry standard Windows operating system, will be a powerful
force for reviving competition in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   That idea is the linchpin argument in trying to convince a U.S.
District Court in Washington that splitting up Microsoft is a risk
worth taking, a step that would serve to increase competition,
accelerate the pace of innovation in America's high-technology
economy and benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And the prediction is being made by three leaders of the
emerging ``new mainstream'' in economics: Paul M. Romer of Stanford
University, Carl Shapiro of the University of California at
Berkeley and Rebecca M. Henderson of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. They are economists in their late 30s and 40s who focus
on the effects that innovation and new technology have on economic
growth, industrial organization and corporate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual debate over the government's remedy will
revolve around the innovation arguments presented by the
government's economic advisers. The court's decision, Romer wrote,
``will profoundly affect the information industry, the most
technologically dynamic sector in our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Microsoft would agree entirely with that statement,
but it argues that the government proposal is a dangerous gamble
with history, given the fast-changing conditions in high-technology
markets whose direction even entrepreneurs, let alone courts,
cannot predict.
</P>
<P>
   But Romer and his colleagues say the remedy is needed precisely
to protect and accelerate the innovation process. ``By encouraging
conditions that encourage increased competition in the operating
system market,'' Romer wrote, ``this remedy will increase the rate
of innovation in the software industry and thereby increase the
rate of growth for the economy as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The lasting stream of benefits that can be expected
to follow from this remedy will substantially outweigh any
temporary costs that it may involve.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways, the economists say, that a stand-alone
Office business could bring new competition to the software
industry. The first is that Office, like Netscape's Navigator
browser, has the potential to become a software ``platform''
capable of competing with Windows. Netscape posed a frightening
challenge to Microsoft, trial evidence showed: As a layer of
software that sat on top of the Microsoft operating system, it
could replace Windows as the technology that controls the look and
feel of computing.
</P>
<P>
   And for software developers, the Netscape browser threatened to
replace Windows in providing the key software hooks _ known as
application programming interfaces, or APIs _ that programmers
write if their electronic commerce applications, e-mail and games
are to run smoothly on personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal memo in 1995, ``The Internet Tidal Wave,'' Bill
Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, warned that Netscape could
``commoditize'' the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup, Henderson wrote, will ``have the effect of putting
important middleware into the hands of a firm that has no incentive
to protect Windows.'' She added that both Office and the Internet
Explorer browser, which would be placed in the Office company under
the government proposal, are ``popular applications that expose
APIs and are widely distributed.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson wrote, ``Office is, like Navigator, an application in
wide demand for its own sake that rivals Windows in its level of
penetration.'' Accordingly, she stated that an independent company
controlling Office ``might threaten Windows much as Netscape
threatened Windows in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office company, Romer wrote, could foster competition and
innovation in the operating system market in a number of ways. It
could, for example, develop its own operating system. Most likely,
this would be an operating system tailored to the Office
applications for computing in emerging markets, like on handheld
machines or so-called Web applications.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Word or Excel might reside on a central computer,
with customers tapping into it over high-speed networks using an
Internet appliance instead of a personal computer running the
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The other way for a stand-alone Office company to encourage
competition would be to support operating systems that compete with
Windows, like Linux, an increasingly popular version of the Unix
operating system. An independent Office business would have a
strong incentive to make sure Office programs run on Linux, the
economists say, because they would no longer be trying to help
Windows maintain its dominance.

   RUSSIA-UKRAINE-$ADV30 _ The Ukraine _ What does this former
Soviet republic think about new Russian President Vladimir Putin?
His first trip ``abroad'' is supposed to be either to Belarus or to
Ukraine, two countries that have extremely different views toward
their old Soviet masters. The Ukraine in the last nine years has
tried to break free from dependence on Moscow _ and not very well,
however, because of its basketcase economy _ while Belarus has
towed the Soviet line. But one of the ways Ukraine has given Moscow
the finger is flirting with NATO, which Moscow didn't take very
kindly too. A bit too close to the Russian border for its comfort.

   MEXICO-ELECTION-$ADV30 _ MEXICO CITY _ Mexico heads into
uncharted territory with the most competitive presidential election
ever held in this country. Challenger Vicente Fox is closer than
any opposition politician has ever been to defeating the candidate
of the PRI, which has controlled the presidency for 71 years. By
most accounts, Fox won a debate this week, catapulting him even
further toward a possible victory on July 2. But analysts say don't
underestimate the PRI, which has a formidable political machine and
is often accused of benefitting from every tool at its disposal _
including sympathetic media and the government itself _ to win
elections. On Friday Mexico's independent Federal Elections
Institute, an agency charged with trying to ensure clean elections,
releases a report showing, among other things, that television news
coverage this month has tilted dramatically toward favoring the
ruling party's candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa. (Ferriss).

Monticello, Jefferson's plantation, because he refused to tell
visitors that the third president probably fathered some of
Hemings' children. Despite that recent conclusion by Monticello's
caretaker, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, Wallenborn
represents an increasingly vocal backlash to DNA evidence and
Hemings' ancestors' oral history that the widower Jefferson and
Hemings were lovers. A curtain riser pegged to the Jefferson
family's reunion in Charlottesville May 6-7, during which
Wallenborn's group plan to unveil a foundation aiming to debunk
what they consider ``politically correct'' revisionist history.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The eight-member delegation from the U.N.
Security Council, which came to Kosovo to give a stern message to
all sides to stop the violence and to urge on the U.N. mission,
wound up its visit on Saturday somewhat muted by the complexities
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some clear differences within the delegation on the
performance of the peacekeeping mission and the U.N. civilian
administration in Kosovo, members said they were pleasantly
surprised by the progress made in bringing the ethnic communities
together after the war. The delegation included the U.N.
ambassadors from China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual visit by the ambassadors came at the invitation of
the director of the U.N. mission in Kosovo, Dr. Bernard Kouchner,
who is seeking more support and personnel for his operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invited them so they could discover the reality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   China and Russia in particular have criticized the operation for
its failure to protect Serbs and other minorities from revenge
attacks by returning Kosovo Albanian refugees, and for
peacekeepers' failure to carry out their full mandate.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers came in last year after the 78-day NATO bombing
campaign forced President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to
withdraw the troops sent into Kosovo, where a separatist movement
was seeking independence for the largely Albanian province of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the Security Council visit, the ambassadors from
China and Russia sent a clear message of their countries'
opposition to the NATO bombing, when they traveled to Kosovo by way
of Belgrade, in a symbolic recognition of Yugoslavia's sovereignty
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The two ambassadors were guests of the Yugoslav government and
met with Milosevic and Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic, both
of whom have been indicted as war criminals by the war crimes
tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just traveling to Pristina through Belgrade in a
national capacity,'' the Russian ambassador, Sergei Lavrov, said
when he arrived in Kosovo. ``I did not go there as part of the
delegation.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Security Council, Robert Fowler of Canada,
nevertheless protested their action. Kouchner said it had sent the
wrong message to people in Kosovo, where memories of the war are
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   He also did not hide his disappointment that the ambassadors
from three of the five permanent members of the Security Council _
the United States, Britain and his own native France _ turned down
the invitation to Kosovo in favor of a trip to Congo. His request
that the Security Council also send someone to look specifically at
the issue of missing persons _ a source of continued tension and
weekly demonstrations in Kosovo _ also was ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Lavrov criticized what he said was a failure to meet the
requirements of U.N. Resolution 1244, which governs the mission's
operation in Kosovo. He called for stronger contacts with Belgrade
and greater recognition of Yugoslavia's sovereignty over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the chairman of the delegation, Anwarul Karim Chowdhury of
Bangladesh, said that the delegation had been favorably impressed
by the U.N. mission and would commend the work of Kouchner and his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implementation of 1244 is seen by each of us from our own
point of view,'' Chowdhury said. He added that despite constraints
that hampered full implementation, the ``effort is being made in
full earnestness.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation was given a tour of the province that took in the
law enforcement school that is training Serbs and Albanians to be
local police, and visited the divided city of Mitrovica and a
cemetery where the war crimes tribunal is exhuming 140 bodies
killed by Serbian forces last year. The delegates also met with
leaders of the various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner seems to have won their support for a U.N. special
envoy to be appointed to take charge of missing persons and
detainees.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 9,000 people died in two years of war in Kosovo,
but there are at least 3,000 people still missing. More than 1,000
Albanians remain in Serbian prisons, many of them civilians who
were arrested during the mass expulsions of Albanians from Kosovo
last year by Yugoslav forces. An estimated 500 Serbs and members of
other ethnic minority groups also are missing, most of them
abducted after NATO forces arrived in Kosovo last June.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. resolution that ended the war did not include a clause
on missing or detainees, but Chowdhury said there was a need for a
high-level figure to be appointed to deal specifically with that
issue.

CLINTON TO CALL FOR TOUGHER PRIVACY RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 By STEPHEN LABATON  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is preparing legislation
to protect the financial privacy of consumers by limiting how
banks, insurers and other companies share sensitive consumer
information like personal spending habits, medical files and
insurance records.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said President Clinton would describe
the plan on Sunday at a commencement address at Eastern Michigan
University in Ypsilanti and that it was strongly endorsed by Vice
President Al Gore. But the package has already been denounced by
the financial services industry, which has chafed over less
restrictive privacy proposed regulations authorized by a banking
law passed last year, and by leading Republicans in Congress who
stripped some provisions similar to the new plan from last year's
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the new privacy legislation say it will cost
companies too much and will discourage the consolidation of banks,
insurers and securities firms, which the law passed last year was
intended to promote through deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposal would prohibit affiliates of large
financial conglomerates, say an insurance company and a bank, from
sharing information like medical records when a customer applies
for a loan without the consent of the customer. It would also
restrict the ability of banks from divulging the spending habits of
their customers that may be gleaned from checking accounts, or
credit or debit cards. It would give consumers a new right to
review their credit and financial information and correct errors.
And it would force companies to provide consumers with special new
privacy notices upon request to enable them to shop for the most
protective institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To further the Clinton-Gore commitment to protecting consumer
privacy, the president is taking strong steps to enhance financial
privacy protections,'' a senior administration official said. ``The
president believes that firms should not be able to share
especially sensitive medical information, or information on
personal spending habits unless the consumer affirmatively
consents.''
</P>
<P>
   While the plan's prospects for passage by Congress this year are
dim, it appears certain to have deep resonance in the presidential
campaign, particularly as public opinion polls show the issue to be
of growing importance to voters and consumers who are increasingly
relying on both the Internet and on large financial conglomerates
to do banking, buy consumer goods and trade stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and other leading Democrats have allied themselves with the
plan. Gov. George W. Bush's aides said he had not articulated a
position, although many senior Republicans in Congress and
supporters of Bush have been equally vociferous against taking any
further steps to increase the privacy protections of consumers
because they say they are too burdensome for the financial services
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear that this a political act and the president is
playing to the traditional base of the party,'' said Kenneth
Guenther, a lobbyist for the Independent Community Bankers
Association, which represents many of the smaller banks and savings
associations and opposes the new measure. ``This is going to be a
humongous issue, particularly since there is nothing in the law
that right now prevents companies such as the Travelers, a unit of
Citigroup, from sharing medical records with Citibank. But the
issue is not going to be resolved now, not with with this Congress,
which at this late date is not going to touch this with a
10-foot-pole.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial privacy plan is the latest in a series of efforts
by the Clinton administration to strengthen the privacy rights of
consumers and medical patients. Last October, Clinton announced
proposed regulations to protect the privacy of billions of medical
records. And two months ago, Clinton issued an order prohibiting
federal agencies from using genetic information in any decision to
hire, promote or dismiss workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two weeks, federal officials are preparing to
complete new banking regulations that will require companies to
inform customers about how they handle records and whether they
disclose them to third parties. Those regulations, which were
required as part of the banking legislation signed last year, have
been heavily criticized by the banking industry for adding millions
of dollars in new paperwork and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton signed the banking legislation last fall, he
praised the measure for containing some provisions that protect the
privacy interests of consumers but vowed to go significantly
further. He repeated the pledge during his State of the Union
Address earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists and aides to Republican lawmakers gave the measure no
chance of passage this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will raise a lot of debating points, but as a political
matter, it's dead on arrival,'' said Edward Yingling, lobbyist for
the American Bankers Association. Yingling is part of a group of
lobbyists representing Wall Street, the insurance industry, bankers
and savings associations who are united against any significant
privacy initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Christi Harlan, a spokeswoman for Sen. Phil Gramm, the chairman
of the banking committee who co-sponsored the banking legislation
last year, said that the Texas Republican remained strongly
committed against any new and costly impositions on financial
services companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``His position is that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley legislation was
the most sweeping bill ever on the subject and we haven't even seen
the final regulations yet in this area,'' Harlan said. ``He's been
unbending in this.''

SOUTH ASIA CALLED MAJOR TERROR HUB IN A SURVEY BY U.S.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The State Department has for the first time identified South
Asia as a major hub of international terrorism, accusing Pakistan,
a traditional U.S. ally, and especially Afghanistan of providing
safe haven and support to international terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest annual report describing the administration's
efforts to combat terrorism, the agency also concludes that while
Americans were once threatened primarily by terrorism sponsored by
states, today they face greater threats from ``loose networks'' of
groups and individuals motivated more by religion or ideology than
politics and financed increasingly by drug trafficking, crime and
illegal trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a network supported the failed attempt to smuggle
explosives material and detonating devices into Seattle in
December,'' the report states, referring to the arrest of Ahmed
Ressam, an Algerian, and several others in connection with the
alleged millennium bombing plot foiled by U.S. authorities last
December.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment is decidedly more upbeat than in years past about
some other regions, including the Middle East, and notes that while
terrorist attacks worldwide increased, the number of casualties
declined, with only five Americans killed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 107-page report, a copy of which was provided to The New
York Times in advance of its publication on Monday, lists as state
sponsors the same seven countries that Washington has accused of
harboring and aiding terrorists since 1993: Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   But it says that Afghanistan also poses a ``major terrorist
threat'' by, among other things, continuing to shelter the Saudi
exile Osama bin Laden, who is wanted in the 1998 bombings of two
U.S. Embassies in Africa, as well as other Afghan-trained Islamic
militants sought by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, too, the report asserts, is sending ``mixed messages''
on terrorism by harboring and aiding known terrorists, many
fighting to wrest control of the disputed Himalayan territory of
Kashmir from neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the administration stopped short of adding either Pakistan
or Afghanistan to its list of state sponsors, against which a
series of tough sanctions automatically apply.
</P>
<P>
   Michael A. Sheehan, the State Department's coordinator for
counterterrorism, said that Afghanistan was not added to the list
because Washington did not recognize its government, which is led
by a fundamentalist Islamic group called the Taliban. Pakistan was
not added because although its record badly needs improvement, he
said, ``it is a friendly state that is trying to tackle the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Both countries are already under some sanctions stemming from
reported terrorist and other activities, but their designation as
state sponsors would further isolate them politically and
effectively cut off aid, loans and credit from Washington and
international lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States has no diplomatic relations with
Afghanistan, President Clinton met briefly with Pakistan's military
leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, when he visited South Asia in March
and discussed terrorism and the Kashmir issue, as well as
Pakistan's development of nuclear weapons and when the general
would return the country to a democratically elected government.
Little progress was reported on any of the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Informed of the State Department report, Zamir Akram, the deputy
chief of mission at Pakistan's embassy in Washington, vigorously
denied that his country was supporting or tolerating terrorism.
Washington, he asserted, had refused to present evidence to support
such charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have evidence, they should share it with us,'' Akram
said. ``We are more of a target and victim of terrorism than the
United States has even been. We need to jointly fight against
terrorism. Charges like this simply get our backs up.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Taliban in New York also said that U.S.
officials had not presented any significant evidence of
Afghanistan's involvement in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Outside South Asia, the report notes several significant
improvements in security in the Middle East, while reiterating that
the region remains a major source of concern. It chides Iran and
Syria for supporting regional terrorist groups like Hamas,
Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which seek to destroy the
U.S.-supported Middle East peace effort. And, the report says,
Lebanon's ``lack of effective government control'' permits
terrorist groups to operate within its borders ``with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's report is strikingly different in substance and tone
from previous ones in its candid discussion of problem areas and of
countries and regions in which significant progress is being made.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the report suggests that North Korea, which has
agreed to a summit meeting with its archenemy, South Korea, could
be removed from the terrorism sponsorship list given its recent
``positive statements condemning terrorism in all its forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the report suggests that while Cuba, Syria and some
other states have reduced their direct sponsorship of terrorism,
Cuba remains on the list because it continues to harbor known
terrorists and terrorist groups. Syria could be removed from the
list if a Middle East peace agreement is concluded, ``which would
necessarily address terrorism issues,'' the report states.

<P>
   Sheehan attributed the progress partly to the administration's
determination to combat terrorism by limiting the number of places,
or, in his parlance, ``swamps,'' where terrorists can seek refuge
because government control is weak or governments themselves are
sympathetic. ``We seek to drain these swamps,'' he says in the
report's introduction.
</P>
<P>
   The report also describes changing trends in terrorism, which it
says is increasingly ``religiously or ideologically motivated,'' as
opposed to the ``politically motivated'' terrorism of the past. And
it talks of a shift from truck and car bombs to groups now seeking
biological, nuclear, chemical and other ``weapons of mass
destruction,'' as well as practicing ``cyberterrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Another shift is geographic. The locus of terrorism is moving
east ``from the Middle East to South Asia, more specifically
Afghanistan,'' the report states, as Middle Eastern governments
strengthen their commitment to fighting terrorism and improve
international cooperation in intelligence and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, for the first time in years, the report notes, there
were no terrorist-related attacks, largely because of ``successful
counterterrorism efforts by the Egyptian government'' and a
cease-fire by the country's largest terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   In Algeria, too, where an estimated 80,000 people have died in a
decade of strife, killings have slowed because of ``aggressive''
operations against the Armed Islamic Group and cease-fires that
have resulted from talks between the government and other Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
   While Palestinians and Israeli Arabs opposed to the peace
efforts mounted ``small-scale terrorist attacks'' in Israel, the
West Bank and Gaza last year, growing cooperation between Israel
and the Palestine Authority helped prevent several bombings.
</P>
<P>
   There were also no major international terrorist attacks in
Jordan, a fact that the report attributes to the country's
crackdown on Hamas in December and the arrest of Islamic militants
who were planning attacks against U.S. and Israeli tourists during
millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the evidence ``suggests'' that those arrested
were associated with Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden's group. Khalil
al-Deek, a dual U.S.-Jordanian citizen of Palestinian origin
arrested in Pakistan, is also reported to have an indirect link to
bin Laden's group in Afghanistan, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Had either bombing plot in Seattle or in Jordan succeeded,
Sheehan said in an interview, ``we could have had a very different
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that while the number of international
terrorist attacks increased to 392 in 1999 from 274 in 1998, the
number of deaths and casualties because of such attacks declined
sharply _ to 233 killed and 706 wounded in 1999 from 741 killed and
5,952 wounded the year before. The 1998 statistics reflect the high
toll of the bombing of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa, in which
more than 200 people died and more than 2,000 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Last year five Americans were killed in terrorist attacks, the
report says, three by the guerrillas in Colombia and two in Uganda
by Hutu rebels from Rwanda. State Department officials classified
the deaths as terrorism since the five were killed ``because they
were Americans,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan said that the data and recent experience suggested that
progress in the fight against terrorism, for which the State
Department has requested $40 million in this fiscal year's budget,
depended on the decline in state sponsorship, intelligence
cooperation, good law enforcement, and in the context of peace
talks, ``political dialogue'' between governments and opposition
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive experiences of Spain, Turkey and Algeria this
year all suggest that tough counterterrorism measures plus
political dialogue with nonterrorist opposition forces seems to be
the model,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within Europe, the report singles out Greece as ``one of the
weakest links'' in the fight against terrorism. It blames the
``absence of strong public government leadership and initiatives to
improve police capabilities and morale'' for the 20 acts of
violence against Americans last year, a rate second only to that of
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The report identifies 28 groups as ``foreign terrorist
organizations,'' designations unchanged since they were issued last
October.
</P>
<P>
   But the report reserves its harshest criticism for Afghanistan,
where sanctions imposed by the United Nations last fall have not
stopped the Taliban government from harboring people like bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The report is also severely critical of Pakistan, a traditional
U.S. ally, saying that while it has arrested and extradited several
terrorists it has refused to end support for groups that train
terrorists in neighboring Afghanistan and in Pakistan itself and
has declined to close ``certain Pakistani religious schools that
serve as conduits for terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also ``credible reports,'' the report says, that
Pakistan continues to support militant groups like the Harakat
ul-Mujahedin, which had one of its leaders freed from an Indian
prison in exchange for hostages taken in the hijacking of an Air
India plane last year.

 &HT;    Former bodyguard banged heads for rock 'n' roll bad boys
 &HT;    By Lori Cumpston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Vic Robinson sat in the hotel room and
calmly waited as a deranged woman armed with a .38-caliber pistol
slipped past the doorman and made her way into the lobby of a
Seattle hotel to kill Mick Jagger. The woman claimed the Rolling
Stones lead singer was the father of her child. She wanted him
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation was quite tense,'' remembers Robinson, 46, a
Grand Junction music promoter who was Jagger's personal bodyguard
during the 1981 Tattoo You tour. ``The threat came through the
operator at the hotel. If she hadn't warned us, anything could have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI set up a sting with plain-clothes detectives who were
briefed on the situation and given a description of the woman. She
was arrested in the hotel's lobby.
</P>
<P>
   It was later revealed that a hotel clerk, who was a friend of
the woman's, tipped her off as to what room Jagger was staying in.
</P>
<P>
   Beating people down, fistfights with frenzied fans, punching
paparazzi. Welcome to a day in the life of a bodyguard _ hired
muscle to protect the rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a 10-year veteran of the bodyguard wars, was hired to
protect Freddie Mercury of Queen and Dee Snider, lead singer for
Twisted Sister, in addition to Jagger. He's also toured with Iron
Maiden, Motley Crue and Billy Squire.
</P>
<P>
   He wears his battle scars proudly. Each representing a place in
time where he sacrificed his own skin to save a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get so frenzied about these artists, and when they see
them, they come running with anything they've got in their hands,''
says Robinson. ``I got stabbed with a knife, I've been stabbed with
a fork, I got stabbed in the back with a pencil ... it can be
situations where people aren't doing it on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Robinson recount how he got swept into a glamour-filled
world overflowing with sex, drugs, rock 'n roll and gargantuan
amounts of greenbacks, you would think he was lying. After all,
this kind of life doesn't just happen to anybody.
</P>
<P>
   It happened to Robinson, a street kid from Chicago, whose
working class father dabbled in retail while his mother worked for
an offshoot company of General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Their life was far from glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   For a while he owned a fitness center in Michigan, but the
former competitive bodybuilder packed up and moved to Boulder at
the urging of a friend. He didn't have much to lose since he was
going through a divorce and would have moved just about anywhere to
start over.
</P>
<P>
   He was soon hired to work security by multi-millionaire
restaurateur Dick Horton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kind of guy that used to have lunch with Anwar
Sadat,'' says Robinson, referring to the Egyptian president.
</P>
<P>
   He also moonlighted at the Dark Horse bar, a rough and tumble
biker bar notorious for ``fights that would last a half hour at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came word that the best rock 'n' roll band on the planet
was coming to Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's life would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1981. The Rolling Stones were on the U.S. leg of
their world tour to promote ``Tattoo You'' featuring the hit single
``Start Me Up.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene was surreal as 70,000 drunk, stoned and crazed fans
charged the turnstiles at Folsom Field on the University of
Colorado campus.
</P>
<P>
   The Stones, with band members Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood,
Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman and frontman Mick Jagger, were getting
ready to go on. At the last minute, Robinson was moved from his
outer perimeter security post and told to report to the barricade
at center stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `What the hell, man? They're trying to kill me,'''
recalls Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he know, his loyalty to a band he barely knew was
being tested.
</P>
<P>
   How far would he go to protect the Rolling Stones band members
and one man in particular, the English rocker known for his
trademark lips and midnight trysts, lead singer Mick Jagger?
</P>
<P>
   Jagger's former bodyguard was jailed two days prior to the
Boulder gig after stealing $10,000 from Jagger and jewelry from
Jagger's then-girlfriend, Jerry Hall, to support his alleged heroin
habit.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was blitzed with probing questions during the two-day
concert run. Then he got a 4 a.m. phone call summoning him to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a joke,'' says Robinson. ``I got the
impression that he wanted me to fill out an application for a job.
I figured there were going to be 300 guys who show up and I'm
out.''
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Los Angeles, Robinson was met at the airport
by a man holding up a white card with his name on it. He was
whisked away in a stretch limo and driven to the swanky five-star
Westwood hotel with explicit instructions to talk to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The band was waiting for him in the 48-room penthouse suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door was opened by the man himself, Mick Jagger,'' recalls
Robinson. ``He puts the phone down and he's toking on this joint
and he says, `Want some?' I go, `No,''' says Robinson, imitating
the nervous high-pitched voice he used that day. ``Then he looks
right at me and says, `Have you ever been to jail?' There is nobody
but me and him in this room and he's looking me right in the face
... I'm thinking what should I say? I'm just going to tell him the
truth. I go, `Yeah.' He leans over and he says, `I'm glad you told
me the truth because I already knew the answer.' They did a
complete FBI check on me and that's why all those questions were
being asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who admits to being arrested for typical teen-age
stuff while growing up in Chicago's Westside, was led to another
suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is standing there and he's got a handcuff on one arm
and there are thousands and thousands of dollars on this table ...
stacks of money,'' says Robinson. ``He gives me this envelope and
there is $5,000 bucks in there in hundred dollar bills. He says,
`This is for Mick, if he needs anything, you'll have the money.' He
gives me another envelope with $1,000 in it and says, `This is for
you.' I don't know where this money came from and I don't know who
these people are.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional strain of an adventure gone awry was starting to
take its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was beginning to wonder if he would ever see his
Boulder apartment again, let alone his girlfriend, whom he left in
tears as he boarded a plane in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a one-way ticket ... I didn't even check,'' says
Robinson. ``I was sure I had a round-trip ticket because I knew I
was coming home the next day. I take the key and open the door to
my suite and there were roses on the television and a big ol' box
of candy on the bed and I burst into tears like a 5-year-old kid. I
couldn't hold it in anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone in Robinson's suite rang and it was Mick. He told
him to be ready to go by 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no school or training,'' says Robinson, who worked in
intelligence and in the military police in the Marine Corps. ``It
happened,'' he says snapping his fingers, ``like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business was getting the limo driver
downstairs underneath the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to Mick's room and he says, `Are you ready?' and I says,
`I'm ready' and he says, `We have money?'
</P>
<P>
   `I got money. I got more money than I ever had,''' Robinson
recalls, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The limo driver pulls up in front of the famed Roxy nightclub in
Los Angeles, a favorite hangout of Jagger's when he was in town.
</P>
<P>
   On that night, Jagger partied with Jack Nicholson and John
Belushi.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the hardest things to learn in the beginning
was how he wanted you to be,'' says Robinson. ``After the first
night, you knew exactly how you had to be and that was hard all the
time because it was a dangerous job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me, `Oh, you mean you worked locally for
them when they came to town?' No. I slept in the same rooms with
them, I pulled his girlfriends off of chandeliers, pulled him out
of nightclubs and had to throw tablecloths around him. There is a
whole lot of stuff involved in the job and it's all yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson likens concert gigs to football games. He and Jagger
had a routine they faithfully followed each time the swivel-hipped
singer took the stage. First they would stretch. Then they would
meditate. Then each would retreat into his respective zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My zone was getting myself prepared to protect him. You
couldn't do it drunk, you couldn't do it drugged out because if
something happened to him, what to you think is going to happen to
you?''
</P>
<P>
   The tour came on the fringes of an election year, which meant a
flurry of public appearances for Jagger and the band, including
dining with Sen. Ted Kennedy at the White House and appearing in a
commercial for then-San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who was
drumming up support to restore the historic trolley cars.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson recalls a frightening experience following an
appearance at Candlestick Park. Jagger and Peter Wolf, lead singer
for the J. Geils Band, were eating dinner at Ernie's, an upscale
restaurant not far from the stadium district. Someone from the
restaurant called up a local disc jockey who announced on the radio
that Jagger was at the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a mob scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them were drunk, they were wild ... beating on the
restaurant windows, people in the restaurant were starting to freak
out,'' says Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only options are, and I don't like doing this kind of
stuff, is start knocking people down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you got a hundred people between you and the car, all it
takes is one to get their hands on him or me and screw us up. We
had a system. Whenever I was going out the door first, he held on
to my belt. I had a special belt and I would always feel him, so if
you were in front of me when I was trying to get him out of a
place, you were history.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagger and Wolf were ushered out a side door in the kitchen to a
limo waiting in a narrow alley. The pair emerged shaken, but
unscathed. The limo wasn't so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The most elaborate ruse Robinson ever used to disguise Jagger
was gluing a fake beard to his face and outfitting him in a fur
coat three times his size to get him into the Comedy Store to see
comedian Richard Pryor, who was making his first appearance
following a devastating accident that left him severely burned.
</P>
<P>
   What the fans didn't see behind closed doors was the ugly side
of show business. A side that was rife with drugs, free-flowing
booze, wild women and wham bam thank you ma'am sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that business, you're around lots of money, you're around
lots of drugs, you're around lots of everything,'' says Robinson.
``Lots of secrets ... wives secrets, girlfriends secrets, whatever
kind of secrets ... it's all there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in Washington, D.C., staying at the Dolly Madison
Hotel and there was a guy who sent his wife to sleep with Bill
Wyman because that was her birthday present. It was freaky. I've
been around governors in a room smoking dope. They never had to
worry about it. It's like a code, there are certain things you
don't say or ever repeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the constant feuds between Richards and Jagger
over which direction the band should go.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson remembers one rehearsal at the Oakland Coliseum where
Richards kept nearly 100 crew people waiting for 12 hours while he
slept off a three-night party binge.
</P>
<P>
   The five-month tour, which took Robinson to Brazil, Australia,
England, Japan and Sweden, came to an end in February of 1982.
Robinson and Jagger parted ways. They haven't kept in touch.
</P>
<P>
   The Stones have moved on, still wildly successful, considering
prime seats to their latest No Security Tour cost upward of a down
payment on a new car.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura, a former Stones
bodyguard in 1978 and 1981, even proclaimed Feb. 15, 1999, as
Rolling Stones Day. The proclamation cites the band's longevity,
including the fact that guitarist Richards is still alive at 55 and
that the band has always employed the best ``body'' guards.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has moved on, too. His days on the road now consist of
meeting with potential sponsors as an event promoter for Just For
Fun Promotions, which he runs from a spare bedroom in his northeast
Grand Junction home.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the makeshift office are filled with framed
memories.
</P>
<P>
   His personal favorite is one of himself sandwiched between an
army of Samoan security guards he hired to carry a coffin with
Twisted Sister lead singer Dee Snider inside to escape the throng
of fans who showed up for an appearance at an Australian nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Absent are photos of Freddie Mercury who died on Nov. 24, 1991,
one day after he announced to the world that he had AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock,'' says Robinson. ``There aren't too many
people who could sing like Freddie Mercury.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has no regrets when asked about why he left a life of
luxury. He just says it was time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to hate everybody,'' says Robinson. ``If you didn't,
you or somebody with you would get hurt. The person that I am right
now is different than that other person because it took me a couple
of years of therapy to be able to talk about things. It was harder
than hell to come off the road and back to a normal life.''

CAMBODIA AGREES TO TRIBUNAL SETUP FOR KHMER ROUGE TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said
Saturday that Cambodia and the United Nations had reached a
compromise that would allow the creation of an international court
to try former leaders of the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Kerry said that
Prime Minister Hun Sen had embraced a U.N. formula that would allow
foreign judges to make independent indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen has resisted previous proposals that would reduce his
ability to keep personal control of the process. The United Nations
has insisted that Cambodia is not equipped politically or
technically to manage complex trials for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who left Phnom Penh Saturday after meeting with Hun Sen
to mediate on the issue, said both sides had agreed to ``exert best
efforts to complete all the tasks necessary to be able to have a
formal agreement by June 15.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts reacted to his announcement with caution.
``Let's keep cool because there are still many things that can
happen between now and June 15,'' said a Western diplomat who has
watched Hun Sen seem to agree several times in recent months, then
back off citing new complications.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen months have passed since the last surrender of a former
leader of the Khmer Rouge, whose brutal regime was responsible for
the deaths of more than a million people when they ruled Cambodia,
from 1975 to 1979. All but two prominent Khmer Rouge figures remain
free, some as the result of personal deals with the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said there were ``no obstacles'' left to the signing of an
agreement in June on a formula for a tribunal. He said the time
frame is a concession by the United Nationsthat will allow
Cambodia's National Assembly to meet first to approve a law on the
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   In what he described as a new and untested model, Kerry said
that co-prosecutors _ one foreign, one Cambodian _ would issue
indictments, but that the foreign prosecutor would dominate the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The model involves a compromise proposed by the United States
that would allow a foreign prosecutor to issue an indictment
independent of his Cambodian colleague, subject to the veto of both
foreign and Cambodian judges.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations had tentatively agreed to an American
proposal that would allow Cambodia to hold the majority on a panel
of judges. But there is concern that Cambodia could then block any
politically sensitive indictments.

 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ James P. Rubin, the departing State Department
spokesman, will do anything for Madeleine Albright. Except carry
her lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only place he drew the line,'' said a Rubin friend.
``A lot of guys in the office had no problems carrying her purse.''
</P>
<P>
   During nearly eight years at the side of the first woman to
serve as secretary of state, Rubin fulfilled a number of roles:
friend, adviser, protege, gossip buddy, fashion consultant and
self-described ``intellectual mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 40, he is leaving Washington behind to move to London
with another high-powered woman, his wife, Christiane Amanpour, the
CNN foreign correspondent, who gave birth to their son a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a farewell ceremony last week, Albright said that Rubin had
evolved into one of the most influential and best-known spokesmen
for American diplomacy from his first press briefing, when he
resembled ``a deer on the first day of hunting season.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of briefings and not a few arrows later, Rubin leaves
with a reputation for being accessible and well informed, if
sometimes self-promoting. Even his mentor could not resist a dig.
``What can we possibly say about Jamie Rubin that he hasn't already
said about himself?'' Albright asked.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists have relied on him for both the intricacies of
policy _ he is a former Senate foreign affairs aide and arms
control expert _ and as a witness who could recount how decisions
were made. Some of those decisions he even played a hand in
himself, expanding the spokesman's customary role, at Albright's
prompting.
</P>
<P>
   She gave Rubin an office next to her own, on the prestigious
seventh floor, a flight up from the quarters of previous spokesmen.
(Richard Boucher, a former ambassador, will succeed Rubin with a
sixth-floor office.)
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Rubin took on a senior envoy's role last summer,
when he traveled to Kosovo to try to persuade the Albanian rebel
leader, Hashim Thaci, to disarm with NATO guarantees. Rubin said
the ensuing accord and the gratitude of Kosovo Albanians was among
his most ``emotionally satisfying experiences,'' though some have
criticized the agreement as deferring too much to a ruthless,
irregular army and giving it too much of a role in settling the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has been a staunch defender of administration policy in
Kosovo and blamed the American news media for doubting that the
United States' bombing campaign last year would dislodge Serbian
control of Kosovo, which it did. ``It seemed like we were really
alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the dual role of public voice and private counsel, Rubin
recast the spokesman's post in a relentless era of cable
television, 24-hour news cycles and, he says, an increasingly
impatient and adversarial American press.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compression of the news cycle has put a greater premium on
highly critical reporting,'' Rubin said in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   News organizations these days report and analyze information so
quickly, and with such skepticism, that the State Department hews
to a defensive crouch, he said. ``That harms our ability to get our
policy across to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rubin plainly enjoyed the news media glare,
and with cameras rolling, rarely used four words when fourteen
would do.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's comfort in the public arena _ like Albright's own _
did not come easily. The pair grappled with searing scrutiny _ such
as when Albright learned of her Jewish heritage through press
accounts during her first week on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and the secretary's chief of staff, Elaine K. Shocas,
forged a tight circle, joining Albright at the movies on Sunday
afternoons. He dismissed as ``silly psychobabble'' the notion that
he filled the role of the son Albright never had. Albright's reply:
``Oy vey!''
</P>
<P>
   But, friends say, Rubin's proximity to powerful women has
groomed him well for marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked on him very hard to smooth out the rough edges,''
said Shocas, the chief of staff. ``Passing him off to Christiane
Amanpour is a great thing we've done.''

MOZAMBIQUE CONFRONTS HUGE FLOOD LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS

<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ The angry waters have receded in
Mozambique but thousands of people remain homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The floods swept away schools and clinics, crops and cattle. And
nearly two months after the torrential rains ravaged the country,
the painful work of rebuilding is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In the first extensive assessments of the damage to roads,
schools, hospitals and lives, the United Nations, the World Bank
and government officials have determined that Mozambique must raise
about $427 million to pay for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   In February, heavy rains and floods battered Mozambique near the
foot of the continent. And for weeks, television viewers around the
world watched as soldiers in helicopters from South Africa and
other countries rescued thousands of people stranded in trees, on
rooftops, atop spits of land encircled by swirling water.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the reports included lengthy catalogs of
destruction and despair, there were startling glimmers of hope.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll, which was expected to be in the thousands, is
now believed to be around 700. And even though inflation is soaring
and economic growth has slowed, officials say that if the
government can raise the money for reconstruction, the economy may
still grow at a healthy rate of 6 percent to 8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The task ahead is staggering. Despite the government's
impressive record of fiscal austerity, Mozambique remains one of
the poorest countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, President Joaquim Chissano will present his
reconstruction plan to international donors in Rome, where he hopes
to raise enough money to keep his country safely on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all there when the floods were on, and then the
cameras left with the last helicopter,'' said Mark Malloch Brown,
the administrator of the U.N. Development Program, the co-host of
the donor conference with Chissano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, actually, is the tough moment for a country like
Mozambique,'' Brown said ``It is the ultimate poster child of good
economic management. And the test is whether or not we can stick
with it in the long nontelegenic time of reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, about 4.5 million people _ or 27 percent of the
country's population _ were touched by the disaster, according to
Mozambique's disaster assessment. About 540,000 people were
displaced. And nearly 800,000 remain in need of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary estimates indicated that about 10 percent of the
country's cultivated lands have been destroyed. More than 20,000
head of cattle have disappeared. The floods damaged roads and
highways, telephone lines and farms.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 schools were damaged. The national highway, which
linked the capital, Maputo, to the rest of the country, is
impassable in certain sections. And the government now estimates
that more than a million people no longer have access to permanent
health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction will focus on rebuilding infrastructure,
housing and utilities, and building a flood preparedness system.
But it also seeks to restore the lost livelihoods of thousands of
farmers by distributing free seeds, hoes and medical kits for
livestock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate effect on human life was less than people
feared,'' said Brown, referring to the initial death estimates.
``But without quick rehabilitation of the agricultural sector,
there's a real risk of dramatic increases in joblessness and
poverty.''

GORE AND BUSH DIFFER SHARPLY ON HOW TO USE SURPLUS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is the first presidential election in memory
in which the candidates have a budget surplus to discuss, not a
deficit, and their sharply contradictory approaches on how to use
it are perhaps the biggest differences between Vice President Al
Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has built his campaign around a five-year, $483 billion tax
cut that would send most of the surplus back directly to taxpayers.
Gore calls that risky, because the surplus so far exists largely in
the minds of economists, who once could foresee only deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's risky is overtaxing people and leaving unspent money in
Washington,'' where politicians will waste it, Bush said last week
in Arkansas. If the government collects more money than it needs to
spend, he argues, then taxes are too high.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposals, derided by the Bush campaign as calling for
excessive spending, are harder to follow in detail, though plainly
they amount to a continuation of President Clinton's approach. Some
proposals for new programs that Gore favors, like a $115 billion
education trust fund, are part of Clinton's most recent budget
proposal but have not been approved by Congress. The Gore camp does
not count them as new spending.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would cut taxes only $250 billion over 10 years, and his
biggest spending proposal is for a $200 billion prescription drug
benefit for Medicare. He says the prudent thing to do is to devote
large sums to reducing the national debt, which should help keep
interest rates down, and to shoring up Social Security and
Medicare. An unspent surplus automatically reduces the debt.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute
and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, observed,
``In historical perspective, you would have to conclude that both
candidates are fiscally prudent because both are attempting to
reserve the surpluses in the Social Security system for debt
reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another index of shared prudence. Bush's tax cuts do
not approach the level urged by Ronald Reagan in 1980. Gore's
Medicare drug plan is nowhere near as costly as the national health
insurance plan Bill Clinton promised in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Side-by-side comparisons are virtually meaningless. The
candidates assume surpluses of very different sizes, and Gore's
proposals cover the years 2001 to 2010 while Bush's cover 2002 to
2006.
</P>
<P>
   These are, moreover, campaign promises, not blood oaths.
Candidates change their minds after election, like Clinton on
middle-class tax cuts, or when circumstances change, as when a
freshly inaugurated Jimmy Carter had to confront rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But each approach can be judged for internal consistency _ and,
with less certainty, for the plausibility of the assumptions on
which it is based.
</P>
<P>
   On those scores, Reischauer says both candidates ``are skating
right along the edge of the ice,'' by proposing to ``absorb all of
the projected on-budget surplus'' in tax cuts and new spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's surplus is bigger, $586 billion in five years. Gore
relies on estimates by the White House Office of Management and
Budget, which expects the surplus to be $164 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is not created by the old-fashioned ``rosy
scenario'' of the '70s and '80s, when government made wildly
optimistic guesses about growth rates. Lawrence B. Lindsey, Bush's
chief economic adviser, notes that among other forecasts, Wall
Street's Blue Chip forecast calls for 3.2 percent annual growth,
while the Bush campaign predicts 2.7 percent. ``We actually are
quite cautious on the growth side,'' he said. (The White House
budget office and Gore predict 2.6 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the difference arises because Bush makes a much lower
estimate of what Congress will spend than do the Office of
Management and Budget and Gore. The agency estimate basically
assumes that spending will grow at about the rate of inflation, and
the Congressional Budget Office's latest study ducked the issue, by
offering three guesses. Lindsey said, ``Congress is capable of
spending that much money,'' but under pressure from a new President
Bush, he thinks it would not.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but restraint from the Congress that thinks of the
constitutionally required decennial census as a spending emergency,
is pretty optimistic. Reischauer calls the Gore assumptions ``a
good deal more plausible,'' but even so, he says, Congress might
spend even more.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp says the Bush accounting overlooks that his tax
cuts and spending increases mean the national debt will not be cut
as much as the Congressional Budget Office had assumed, and that
interest payments on the national debt will cost another $56
billion. But $483 billion for tax cuts, plus promises of $46
billion for health care, $13 billion for education and $25 billion
for defense add up to $567 billion; so only $19 billion of surplus
would be left to pay $56 billion in added debt interest.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey replies that the issue is, ``Have we left ourselves
enough room? I think we have.'' He says Bush will soon speak on
``government reform'' and lay out enough spending cuts to make
things balance.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp also contends that Bush's tax cuts would balloon
in later years. Gore charged on Monday that even if the economy
grew fast enough to afford them through 2006, the last year the
Bush campaign's documents discuss, there is no hope that it could
pay for the $2.1 trillion they would cost through 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey says his estimate of the cost of the tax cut through
2010 is $1.3 trillion, and that it is affordable because
``surpluses grow quite quickly after 2006.''
</P>
<P>
   But out-year surpluses are the ``most speculative,'' said Robert
Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan
group of deficit hawks. That is a problem for the Gore campaign,
too. Three-fifths of the $746 billion, 10-year surplus it wants to
use would arrive in the last three years of its plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's $250 billion net tax cut is vague. Its details have not
been spelled out, but it will include some, if not all, of the cuts
proposed by Clinton in February. Some of the $146 billion Gore has
proposed for expanding health insurance for the poor comes in the
form of a tax credit, and so is also part of that $250 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The overlaps and vagueness of the Gore proposals invite
skepticism. For several weeks Gore's Web site produced nothing at
all when surfers clicked on ``Keeping the Budget Balanced.'' A
murky pie chart appeared on Tuesday, listing: $432 billion for
``Medicare Solvency and Prescription Drug Benefit,'' $380 billion
for ``Health care coverage and tax relief'' (with three asterisks
indicating ``includes other investments''), and $64 billion for
``debt service.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said: ``It
appears that the vice president is doing his best to hide how much
money he wants to spend. Is it any wonder that sometimes people
question whether the vice president has a credibility problem?'' He
said he believed that if Gore is elected ``his first inclination
will be to spend more taxpayer money, particularly if that is what
organized labor wants.''
</P>
<P>
   But each side believes in the surplus. ``Nobody's lying. They
just have different assumptions,'' Bixby said. But those
assumptions ``of huge surpluses as far as the eye can see,'' should
be treated very skeptically.

ISLAND TALKS GET NEW PUSH FROM RUSSIA AND JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ In their first meeting as the new
leaders of Russia and Japan, President Vladimir Putin and Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori pledged on Saturday to meet often, to call
each other by their nicknames and to try to conclude a long-sought
peace treaty by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Such a treaty would formally end decades of antagonism between
the countries over a group of islands seized by Russia at the end
of World War II. In making this pledge, both leaders were
reaffirming the commitment of their predecessors to reach this
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Russia and Japan have exchanged
proposals and counterproposals over one of the most nettlesome
territorial disputes left over from the war. Japan calls the
islands its Northern Territories, and Russia claims them as part of
the Kurile Islands chain.
</P>
<P>
   Russia forcefully reasserted its sovereignty over the islands on
April 21 by firing on, boarding and seizing a Japanese fishing boat
near there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We attach great significance to concluding a peace treaty by
the end of the year,'' Mori said at a joint news conference in the
Winter Palace of the Romanov czars, which now houses the Hermitage
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Putin said he had accepted an invitation to go to
Tokyo this summer for a visit that both sides hope will yield a
compromise on the islands.
</P>
<P>
   For Russia, concluding the treaty would likely pave the way for
greater economic assistance from Japan, which has lent Russia $1
billion over the last three years. For Japan, ending the dispute
would remove a major domestic issue and a brake on overall
relations with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Mori spent a full day together, beginning with formal
exchanges in the Mikhailovsky Palace, which houses the Russian
Museum, then moving to the nearby Winter Palace. After lunch and a
performance of chamber music, Putin and Mori emerged to say that
they had already established such a close personal relationship
that they agreed to call each Yoshi and Volodya, the familiar forms
for their names.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also discussed preparations for the meeting in
Okinawa in July of the world's major industrial powers, and
Russia's view of nuclear disarmament issues.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost preordained that the Russian and Japanese leaders
would make no breakthrough on the sensitive issue of the islands
during their first meeting, especially with Mori's Liberal
Democratic Party facing parliamentary elections in June. Any
compromise on Japan's sovereignty over the islands could raise a
political storm for Mori, who made Moscow the first stop of his
inaugural tour of major Western capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, who became prime minister this month after Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi had a stroke and fell into a coma, also will visit
Italy, Germany, France, Great Britain, Canada and the United
States, where he will meet President Clinton on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, negotiations are expected on how to
structure a compromise on the Kurile Islands.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, President Boris Yeltsin
of Russia consistently balked in the face of Japanese demands to
return the islands as a precondition for any significant
development in economic and trade relations. But since 1997, Japan
has reversed policy, and under former Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, it expanded trade and economic assistance to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's most recent approach was to suggest a treaty of peace,
friendship and cooperation without resolving the islands issue.
Japan, however, had held to its demand to restore Japanese
sovereignty and delineate new borders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Hashimoto-Yeltsin relationship became so effective
that the former Japanese leader turned up in Moscow last week to
see Yeltsin, now in retirement, and to determine how deeply
Yeltsin's successor was committed to resolving the territorial
issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin response was to state to a visiting Japan-Russia
friendship federation that Putin ``has inherited responsibility for
the conclusion of a Russo-Japanese peace treaty from Boris
Yeltsin.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR OLYMPIC SOCCER, LET THE MACHINATIONS BEGIN
</HEADLINE>
  By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. _ For all the payoffs and ticket-hoarding scandals
involving the adults who run the Olympic movement, the Games still
retain some vestige of honor _ largely stemming from the enthusiasm
of the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The aura of the Games was palpable as the Americans ran onto the
field wielding American flags after their 4-0 nearly textbook romp
over Guatemala on Friday night qualified them for September's
soccer tournament in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that the Olympic Games are the most visible sports
event in which athletes actually make sacrifices, as opposed to
professional athletes who reap millions for their endeavors.
Sacrifice is surely the case for the kayakers and archers who
emerge from the ozone every four years, but there is also a risk
involved for these young soccer professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Cup is the greatest event in soccer, but I knew
about the Olympics before the World Cup,'' said John O'Brien, the
U.S. midfielder, now a serious pro in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien can remember the 1984 Summer Games, when he and his
sister Ann would watch television and then run outside to re-enact
the track-and-field events.
</P>
<P>
   ``She won because she's older,'' said O'Brien, now 22, noting
that she went on to play soccer at Yale, so his winning the family
silver medal was hardly a disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   This year, O'Brien and most of his teammates _ all infused with
the Olympic dream, even with its inherent conflicts with their
careers _ have qualified for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the 18 Yanks are members of a pro club, either in
the United States or Europe. Going to the Games will involve taking
a sanctioned leave of absence, with no assurances that everything
will be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a negative side,'' O'Brien conceded. ``This is a
cutthroat business. You could come back and find somebody else
playing your role, but the Olympics are a childhood dream.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien has as much to lose as anybody, having forgone college
to join the soccer factory at Ajax Amsterdam, one of the great
teams of Europe. He is now a regular, but that is always a fluid
status in sports.
</P>
<P>
   By soccer law, the clubs are supposed to release their players
to the national teams for major international competition like the
World Cup, the Olympics and so on. But coaches, being coaches,
manage to lay not-so-subtle threats and guilt trips on their
players. Like: why would you want to play in the Olympics when you
could help us win the league championship?
</P>
<P>
   ``The country takes precedence over the club, and that's the way
it should be,'' said Chris Albright, the U.S. forward who plays for
DC United, which has quickly become the New York Yankees of Major
League Soccer. Albright played what might have been the most
creative game of his pro career Friday night, but he and his
teammate could be affected, one way or another, by the Olympic
wild-card intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Because the world soccer body, known as FIFA, does not want the
Olympics to match the level of skill and excitement of the
quadrennial World Cup, the Olympic tournament is geared for players
under 23. There is a gimmick, however: each qualifying nation is
now allowed to pick three players of any age.
</P>
<P>
   The United States squad could add three MLS stalwarts and get
little grousing from U.S. coaches. Or, they could dip into the
growing list of Americans who have gone to Europe to gain money and
competition in equally high ratio.
</P>
<P>
   The gnashing of teeth would be heard across the Atlantic if
America tried to recruit Eddie Lewis, now playing for Fulham of
London, or one of their grizzled goalkeepers, Brad Friedel, now
with Liverpool, or Kasey Keller, now with Rayo Vallecano of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd scream, but we'd get the players,'' said Robert
Contiguglia, the president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, who said
he does not believe the United States needs to bring in a
goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you look at it, three U.S. players who celebrated Friday
night may never get to Sydney. One U.S. player with a slight case
of paranoia is Landon Donovan, the absurdly mature 17-year-old who
scored two goals in his first start in three qualifying games here.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, one of the youngest Americans ever recruited overseas,
is now learning his craft in the classic European guild-like system
of the reserve squad of Bayer Leverkusen in Germany. There is a
history of national coaches deciding that goal-scoring wunderkinds
are too young for the big event; Argentina cut the teen-aged Diego
Armando Maradona and won the 1978 World Cup without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always pressure,'' Donovan said Friday. ``I'm happy to
be part of this, and I would hope to stay part of it, but you can
never tell.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a refreshing position for U.S. soccer, to have such talent
stored away in Europe. The United States reached a high level
Friday, scoring three times within 22 minutes to totally avoid the
specter of being humiliated by a smaller Latin-American country on
home soil.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks were able to show their stuff, including a set play
for the third goal, when Ben Olsen of DC United flicked a soft free
kick to Josh Wolff of the Chicago Fire, who nudged the ball toward
the goal mouth. Albright drew several defenders but let the ball go
through his legs (``dummied it,'' in soccer parlance) and Donovan,
all alone, tapped it into the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have missed if I tried,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks play Honduras Sunday in the championship game between
two teams that have already qualified for Sydney. The jockeying to
upgrade the U.S. squad is just beginning.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The State Department has for the first time identified South
Asia as a major hub of international terrorism, accusing Pakistan,
a traditional U.S. ally, and especially Afghanistan of providing
safe haven and support to international terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest annual report describing the administration's
efforts to combat terrorism, the agency also concludes that while
Americans were once threatened primarily by terrorism sponsored by
states, today they face greater threats from ``loose networks'' of
groups and individuals motivated more by religion or ideology than
politics and financed increasingly by drug trafficking, crime and
illegal trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a network supported the failed attempt to smuggle
explosives material and detonating devices into Seattle in
December,'' the report states, referring to the arrest of Ahmed
Ressam, an Algerian, and several others in connection with the
alleged millennium bombing plot foiled by U.S. authorities last
December.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment is decidedly more upbeat than in years past about
some other regions, including the Middle East, and notes that while
terrorist attacks worldwide increased, the number of casualties
declined, with only five Americans killed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 107-page report, a copy of which was provided to The New
York Times in advance of its publication on Monday, lists as state
sponsors the same seven countries that Washington has accused of
harboring and aiding terrorists since 1993: Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   But it says that Afghanistan also poses a ``major terrorist
threat'' by, among other things, continuing to shelter the Saudi
exile Osama bin Laden, who is wanted in the 1998 bombings of two
U.S. Embassies in Africa, as well as other Afghan-trained Islamic
militants sought by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, too, the report asserts, is sending ``mixed messages''
on terrorism by harboring and aiding known terrorists, many
fighting to wrest control of the disputed Himalayan territory of
Kashmir from neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the administration stopped short of adding either Pakistan
or Afghanistan to its list of state sponsors, against which a
series of tough sanctions automatically apply.
</P>
<P>
   Michael A. Sheehan, the State Department's coordinator for
counterterrorism, said that Afghanistan was not added to the list
because Washington did not recognize its government, which is led
by a fundamentalist Islamic group called the Taliban. Pakistan was
not added because although its record badly needs improvement, he
said, ``it is a friendly state that is trying to tackle the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Both countries are already under some sanctions stemming from
reported terrorist and other activities, but their designation as
state sponsors would further isolate them politically and
effectively cut off aid, loans and credit from Washington and
international lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States has no diplomatic relations with
Afghanistan, President Clinton met briefly with Pakistan's military
leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, when he visited South Asia in March
and discussed terrorism and the Kashmir issue, as well as
Pakistan's development of nuclear weapons and when the general
would return the country to a democratically elected government.
Little progress was reported on any of the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Informed of the State Department report, Zamir Akram, the deputy
chief of mission at Pakistan's embassy in Washington, vigorously
denied that his country was supporting or tolerating terrorism.
Washington, he asserted, had refused to present evidence to support
such charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have evidence, they should share it with us,'' Akram
said. ``We are more of a target and victim of terrorism than the
United States has even been. We need to jointly fight against
terrorism. Charges like this simply get our backs up.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Taliban in New York also said that U.S.
officials had not presented any significant evidence of
Afghanistan's involvement in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Outside South Asia, the report notes several significant
improvements in security in the Middle East, while reiterating that
the region remains a major source of concern. It chides Iran and
Syria for supporting regional terrorist groups like Hamas,
Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which seek to destroy the
U.S.-supported Middle East peace effort. And, the report says,
Lebanon's ``lack of effective government control'' permits
terrorist groups to operate within its borders ``with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's report is strikingly different in substance and tone
from previous ones in its candid discussion of problem areas and of
countries and regions in which significant progress is being made.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the report suggests that North Korea, which has
agreed to a summit meeting with its archenemy, South Korea, could
be removed from the terrorism sponsorship list given its recent
``positive statements condemning terrorism in all its forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the report suggests that while Cuba, Syria and some
other states have reduced their direct sponsorship of terrorism,
Cuba remains on the list because it continues to harbor known
terrorists and terrorist groups. Syria could be removed from the
list if a Middle East peace agreement is concluded, ``which would
necessarily address terrorism issues,'' the report states.

 UNDATED: report states.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sheehan attributed the progress partly to the administration's
determination to combat terrorism by limiting the number of places,
or, in his parlance, ``swamps,'' where terrorists can seek refuge
because government control is weak or governments themselves are
sympathetic. ``We seek to drain these swamps,'' he says in the
report's introduction.
</P>
<P>
   The report also describes changing trends in terrorism, which it
says is increasingly ``religiously or ideologically motivated,'' as
opposed to the ``politically motivated'' terrorism of the past. And
it talks of a shift from truck and car bombs to groups now seeking
biological, nuclear, chemical and other ``weapons of mass
destruction,'' as well as practicing ``cyberterrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Another shift is geographic. The locus of terrorism is moving
east ``from the Middle East to South Asia, more specifically
Afghanistan,'' the report states, as Middle Eastern governments
strengthen their commitment to fighting terrorism and improve
international cooperation in intelligence and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, for the first time in years, the report notes, there
were no terrorist-related attacks, largely because of ``successful
counterterrorism efforts by the Egyptian government'' and a
cease-fire by the country's largest terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   In Algeria, too, where an estimated 80,000 people have died in a
decade of strife, killings have slowed because of ``aggressive''
operations against the Armed Islamic Group and cease-fires that
have resulted from talks between the government and other Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
   While Palestinians and Israeli Arabs opposed to the peace
efforts mounted ``small-scale terrorist attacks'' in Israel, the
West Bank and Gaza last year, growing cooperation between Israel
and the Palestine Authority helped prevent several bombings.
</P>
<P>
   There were also no major international terrorist attacks in
Jordan, a fact that the report attributes to the country's
crackdown on Hamas in December and the arrest of Islamic militants
who were planning attacks against U.S. and Israeli tourists during
millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the evidence ``suggests'' that those arrested
were associated with Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden's group. Khalil
al-Deek, a dual U.S.-Jordanian citizen of Palestinian origin
arrested in Pakistan, is also reported to have an indirect link to
bin Laden's group in Afghanistan, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Had either bombing plot in Seattle or in Jordan succeeded,
Sheehan said in an interview, ``we could have had a very different
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that while the number of international
terrorist attacks increased to 392 in 1999 from 274 in 1998, the
number of deaths and casualties because of such attacks declined
sharply _ to 233 killed and 706 wounded in 1999 from 741 killed and
5,952 wounded the year before. The 1998 statistics reflect the high
toll of the bombing of two U.S. Embassies in East Africa, in which
263 people died and more than 2,000 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Last year five Americans were killed in terrorist attacks, the
report says, three by the guerrillas in Colombia and two in Uganda
by Hutu rebels from Rwanda. State Department officials classified
the deaths as terrorism since the five were killed ``because they
were Americans,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan said that the data and recent experience suggested that
progress in the fight against terrorism, for which the State
Department has requested $40 million in this fiscal year's budget,
depended on the decline in state sponsorship, intelligence
cooperation, good law enforcement, and in the context of peace
talks, ``political dialogue'' between governments and opposition
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive experiences of Spain, Turkey and Algeria this
year all suggest that tough counterterrorism measures plus
political dialogue with nonterrorist opposition forces seems to be
the model,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within Europe, the report singles out Greece as ``one of the
weakest links'' in the fight against terrorism. It blames the
``absence of strong public government leadership and initiatives to
improve police capabilities and morale'' for the 20 acts of
violence against Americans last year, a rate second only to that of
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The report identifies 28 groups as ``foreign terrorist
organizations,'' designations unchanged since they were issued last
October.
</P>
<P>
   But the report reserves its harshest criticism for Afghanistan,
where sanctions imposed by the United Nations last fall have not
stopped the Taliban government from harboring people like bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The report is also severely critical of Pakistan, a traditional
U.S. ally, saying that while it has arrested and extradited several
terrorists it has refused to end support for groups that train
terrorists in neighboring Afghanistan and in Pakistan itself and
has declined to close ``certain Pakistani religious schools that
serve as conduits for terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also ``credible reports,'' the report says, that
Pakistan continues to support militant groups like the Harakat
ul-Mujahedin, which had one of its leaders freed from an Indian
prison in exchange for hostages taken in the hijacking of an Air
India plane last year.

HUMAN RIGHTS PANEL FAULTS RUSSIA, BUT NOT CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ After six weeks of review, debate and bargaining at the
annual session of the main U.N. human rights forum, which ended on
Friday, China emerged free of condemnation while Russia and others
were chastised.
</P>
<P>
   After it sidestepped bringing China to account for repression of
political and spiritual dissenters, the U.N. Human Rights
Commission voted to castigate Russia for its actions in Chechnya,
the breakaway republic in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time, diplomats said, that the 53-country
commission had taken such strong action against one of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The resolution was
introduced by the European Union. The permanent council members are
Russia, the United States, France, Britain and China.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's actions during its earlier campaign in Chechnya were
criticized by the commission in 1995 and 1996, but only after a
text was agreed upon with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   This year negotiations broke down, and commission members voted
25-7, with 19 abstentions, to condemn ``disproportionate and
indiscriminate use of Russian military force, including attacks
against civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   In lobbying European delegates for the vote against Russia,
human rights groups had contended that after Europe moved last year
against abuses in Yugoslavia with the NATO bombing campaign, it
should not be any less concerned over alleged abuses in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Only Cuba, China, India, the Republic of Congo, Madagascar and
Sri Lanka voted with Russia against the call for an investigation
into alleged mass killings and other atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our firm view that this commission should not remain
silent,'' said Portugal's envoy, Alvaro Mendonca e Moura.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's rights practices also were condemned, for the second year
in a row, in a resolution that cited the government for suppression
of political opposition and detention of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was proposed by the Czech Republic and Poland and
co-sponsored by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Among other countries censured were Yugoslavia, accused of
repression of the news media and political foes; Myanmar, the
former Burma, accused of using forced labor; Iran, accused of
torture and discrimination against minorities and because of the
suspicious deaths of political activists; and Iraq, accused of
widespread repression and systematic torture and summary and
arbitrary executions.
</P>
<P>
   China avoided, as it has every year since 1990, a full-scale
debate on its policies toward dissenters and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   France, Belgium and other countries blocked the 15-member
European Union from taking a unified stand against China, or from
publicly backing the U.S.-sponsored resolution. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright appeared in Geneva to urge delegates to review
Chinese human rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   China has thrown political and commercial weight behind its
campaign to escape scrutiny, envoys and human rights lobbyists say,
making it difficult, especially for smaller countries, to vote for
any anti-China resolution for fear of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The body's disapproval carries no penalties. The United States,
for example, while not named, was one of the targets of a European
Union resolution against the death penalty. Last year's nearly
identical vote did not convince any of the countries that allow
capital punishment, including the United States, to halt the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are openly defiant. Cuba, for example, reacted
furiously to its reproach, marshaling 100,000 people to demonstrate
against the vote, canceling a planned visit to Cuba by European
officials to discuss human rights and trade and accusing the Czech
Republic, a former ally, of being a ``traitor, lackey and puppet.''

 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is the first presidential election in memory
in which the candidates have a budget surplus to discuss, not a
deficit, and their sharply contradictory approaches on how to use
it are perhaps the biggest differences between Vice President Al
Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has built his campaign around a five-year, $483 billion tax
cut that would send most of the surplus back directly to taxpayers.
Gore calls that risky, because the surplus so far exists largely in
the minds of economists, who once could foresee only deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's risky is overtaxing people and leaving unspent money in
Washington,'' where politicians will waste it, Bush said last week
in Arkansas. If the government collects more money than it needs to
spend, he argues, then taxes are too high.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposals, derided by the Bush campaign as calling for
excessive spending, are harder to follow in detail, though plainly
they amount to a continuation of President Clinton's approach. Some
proposals for new programs that Gore favors, like a $115 billion
education trust fund, are part of Clinton's most recent budget
proposal but have not been approved by Congress. The Gore camp does
not count them as new spending.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would cut taxes only $250 billion over 10 years, and his
biggest spending proposal is for a $200 billion prescription drug
benefit for Medicare. He says the prudent thing to do is to devote
large sums to reducing the national debt, which should help keep
interest rates down, and to shoring up Social Security and
Medicare. An unspent surplus automatically reduces the debt.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute
and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, observed,
``In historical perspective, you would have to conclude that both
candidates are fiscally prudent because both are attempting to
reserve the surpluses in the Social Security system for debt
reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another index of shared prudence. Bush's tax cuts do
not approach the level urged by Ronald Reagan in 1980. Gore's
Medicare drug plan is nowhere near as costly as the national health
insurance plan Bill Clinton promised in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Side-by-side comparisons are virtually meaningless. The
candidates assume surpluses of very different sizes, and Gore's
proposals cover the years 2001 to 2010 while Bush's cover 2002 to
2006.
</P>
<P>
   These are, moreover, campaign promises, not blood oaths.
Candidates change their minds after election, like Clinton on
middle-class tax cuts, or when circumstances change, as when a
freshly inaugurated Jimmy Carter had to confront rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But each approach can be judged for internal consistency _ and,
with less certainty, for the plausibility of the assumptions on
which it is based.
</P>
<P>
   On those scores, Reischauer says both candidates ``are skating
right along the edge of the ice,'' by proposing to ``absorb all of
the projected on-budget surplus'' in tax cuts and new spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's surplus is bigger, $586 billion in five years. Gore
relies on estimates by the White House Office of Management and
Budget, which expects the surplus to be $164 billion over the same
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is not created by the old-fashioned ``rosy
scenario'' of the '70s and '80s, when government made wildly
optimistic guesses about growth rates. Lawrence B. Lindsey, Bush's
chief economic adviser, notes that among other forecasts, Wall
Street's Blue Chip forecast calls for 3.2 percent annual growth,
while the Bush campaign predicts 2.7 percent. ``We actually are
quite cautious on the growth side,'' he said. (The White House
budget office and Gore predict 2.6 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the difference arises because Bush makes a much lower
estimate of what Congress will spend than do the Office of
Management and Budget and Gore. The agency estimate basically
assumes that spending will grow at about the rate of inflation, and
the Congressional Budget Office's latest study ducked the issue, by
offering three guesses. Lindsey said, ``Congress is capable of
spending that much money,'' but under pressure from a new President
Bush, he thinks it would not.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but restraint from the Congress that thinks of the
constitutionally required decennial census as a spending emergency,
is pretty optimistic. Reischauer calls the Gore assumptions ``a
good deal more plausible,'' but even so, he says, Congress might
spend even more.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp says the Bush accounting overlooks that his tax
cuts and spending increases mean the national debt will not be cut
as much as the Congressional Budget Office had assumed, and that
interest payments on the national debt will cost another $56
billion. But $483 billion for tax cuts, plus promises of $46
billion for health care, $13 billion for education and $25 billion
for defense add up to $567 billion; so only $19 billion of surplus
would be left to pay $56 billion in added debt interest.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey replies that the issue is, ``Have we left ourselves
enough room? I think we have.'' He says Bush will soon speak on
``government reform'' and lay out enough spending cuts to make
things balance.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp also contends that Bush's tax cuts would balloon
in later years. Gore charged on Monday that even if the economy
grew fast enough to afford them through 2006, the last year the
Bush campaign's documents discuss, there is no hope that it could
pay for the $2.1 trillion they would cost through 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey says his estimate of the cost of the tax cut through
2010 is $1.3 trillion, and that it is affordable because
``surpluses grow quite quickly after 2006.''
</P>
<P>
   But out-year surpluses are the ``most speculative,'' said Robert
Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan
group of deficit hawks. That is a problem for the Gore campaign,
too. Three-fifths of the $746 billion, 10-year surplus it wants to
use would arrive in the last three years of its plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's $250 billion net tax cut is vague. Its details have not
been spelled out, but it will include some, if not all, of the cuts
proposed by Clinton in February. Some of the $146 billion Gore has
proposed for expanding health insurance for the poor comes in the
form of a tax credit, and so is also part of that $250 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The overlaps and vagueness of the Gore proposals invite
skepticism. For several weeks Gore's Web site produced nothing at
all when surfers clicked on ``Keeping the Budget Balanced.'' A
murky pie chart appeared on Tuesday, listing: $432 billion for
``Medicare Solvency and Prescription Drug Benefit,'' $380 billion
for ``Health care coverage and tax relief'' (with three asterisks
indicating ``includes other investments''), and $64 billion for
``debt service.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said: ``It
appears that the vice president is doing his best to hide how much
money he wants to spend. Is it any wonder that sometimes people
question whether the vice president has a credibility problem?'' He
said he believed that if Gore is elected ``his first inclination
will be to spend more taxpayer money, particularly if that is what
organized labor wants.''
</P>
<P>
   But each side believes in the surplus. ``Nobody's lying. They
just have different assumptions,'' Bixby said. But those
assumptions ``of huge surpluses as far as the eye can see,'' should
be treated very skeptically.

 &HT;    For all who lived through war, Vietnam memories ring clear
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Luke Dollar hopes he won't see it, but he'll have to
leave his TV off and his newspaper in the driveway to miss it.
</P>
<P>
   The famous photograph, showing GIs frantically evacuating troops
and refugees from the top of a building as Saigon fell 25 years ago
today, still haunts the 52-year-old Vietnam veteran. It makes him
angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a Vietnam vet alive that doesn't feel
terrible watching the way we left Saigon,'' says Dollar, an
insurance executive. ``It just makes me sick to my stomach, like
all my friends just died in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   For those younger than 35, the Vietnam War may seem as distant
in history as Lee's surrender at Appomattox. But for the generation
that fought in Vietnam _ or avoided fighting, or campaigned to stop
the war _ today's anniversary of the war's end is sure to evoke
emotions from pride to shame to sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar never considered avoiding the draft. He spent his year in
Vietnam walking point as a scout dog handler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw plenty of action, and it's a horrible experience,'' he
says. ``I try not to think about it much. But sometimes you do. You
see things, like that picture, and you just do.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nail, a 54-year-old executive-recruiter, was reared to be
patriotic, but he blanched when his draft notice arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 1968, and I'd just graduated and I realized, `Idiot me
hadn't joined the reserves,''' Nail says.
</P>
<P>
   Nail still wonders what happened to some of the men he met in
Vietnam. Many knew each other only by nicknames, making it almost
impossible to find out who survived and who's listed among the
58,199 dead on the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When vets do get together, even those who've never met, there's
still a bond. ``Vietnam vets have an automatic reaction to each
other,'' Nail says. ``You can look at them and know. You can talk
and understand what others can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Pardue, 54, agrees. Most of his best friends are Vietnam
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Pardue, who owns an Atlanta real-estate firm, got ``the note
from hell'' _ his draft notice _ when he took a quarter off from
college to earn tuition fees. He was accepted to officer's school
and arrived ``in country'' in July 1967 as a lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later he was severely wounded, and within weeks was
shipped home ``with a bullet in my left lung for life.'' He earned
a college degree and is now active in the Atlanta Vietnam Veterans
Business Association, a group that, among other things, tries to
erase the image of Vietnam veterans as anti-social losers. In fact,
most vets came back and became successful, both in business and
life, Pardue says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This 25th anniversary is possibly a benchmark for healing,''
says Pardue, who still remembers when returning vets were scorned.
``It was very sad, depressing and disappointing for sure. But I
think that's changing. I think the sacrifices we made carries a
little more respect and admiration than it did 25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Torrence, a 53-year-old mortgage firm executive was drafted
in 1966 and spent more than 20 years in the Army, retiring 12 years
ago as a lieutenant colonel. He says the broad public support for
the Persian Gulf War in 1991 caused many Americans to rethink old
views about Vietnam veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Torrence is a member of a military helicopter pilot's
association. One day, he was wearing an association T-shirt when a
boy walked up to him and said, ``Are you a Vietnam veteran?''
Torrence said yes. ``This kid said, 'Thank you for what you did.'
He was about 14, and it choked me up. It kind of renews your faith
in the youth of our country.
</P>
<P>
   For Cathy Campbell, the anniversary is a different kind of
benchmark. Her fighter-pilot father, William Campbell, was shot
down over Laos in 1969 and is still listed as missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is getting some good publicity for a change, and it
feels good,'' Campbell says. ``It's almost a validation of what
happened. People are starting to think and talk about it more now,
and all these years the pain has been underground.''
</P>
<P>
   Most young men of the Vietnam era found a way not to go, either
by attending college for a deferment or by getting into state
militias or reserve outfits that almost guaranteed they'd stay home
_ or simply by being fortunate enough to get a high number in the
draft lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding service, though, is now haunting many of those men,
says Russ Christensen, 56, a humanities professor at Hamline
University in Minnesota who has studied the phenomenon _ and who
concedes he finagled his way out of combat himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lack of community among men my age,'' Christensen
says. ``I have a hard time even talking to Vietnam veterans. And I
don't go to Vietnam movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Baskir, co-author with William Straus of the book,
``Chance and Circumstance: The Draft, the War and the Vietnam
Generation,'' says ``every male who came of age during that time is
a veteran of Vietnam'' _ whether they served or not.
</P>
<P>
   Many who avoided service still feel ``very guilty about their
ability to avoid the worst consequences of the Vietnam War.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, many young men who were raised on John Wayne war
movies and reared by World War II vets chose to serve in Vietnam
because it's what they thought their fathers expected them to do,
Baskir says. Vietnam's shadow encompasses more than just the vets,
their loved ones and the avoiders. Even people who had no direct
connection still feel the war.
</P>
<P>
   For Peggy Barlett, an anthropology professor at Emory
University, the war still evokes bitter memories of a war fought
for suspect purposes. After she saw the movie ``Platoon'' more than
a decade ago, Barlett ``felt deep shame that I hadn't worked harder
to stop the war,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It there's a universal theme in the remembrances _ of vets,
their families, the men who didn't serve and people who wished
they'd been able to do more to stop the war _ it's one of horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the news about this anniversary is good,'' says Dollar,
one of the vets, ``because to me, it's like the Holocaust: I don't
think you should ever forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all kids should have to serve their country for a
couple of years,'' Nail says, ``but I don't want my boys to ever go
into combat, or anyone else's kids. There's got to be a better
way.''

 &HT;    For all who lived through war, Vietnam memories ring clear
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Luke Dollar hopes he won't see it, but he'll have to
leave his TV off and his newspaper in the driveway to miss it.
</P>
<P>
   The famous photograph, showing GIs frantically evacuating troops
and refugees from the top of a building as Saigon fell 25 years ago
today, still haunts the 52-year-old Vietnam veteran. It makes him
angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a Vietnam vet alive that doesn't feel
terrible watching the way we left Saigon,'' says Dollar, an
insurance executive. ``It just makes me sick to my stomach, like
all my friends just died in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   For those younger than 35, the Vietnam War may seem as distant
in history as Lee's surrender at Appomattox. But for the generation
that fought in Vietnam _ or avoided fighting, or campaigned to stop
the war _ today's anniversary of the war's end is sure to evoke
emotions from pride to shame to sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar never considered avoiding the draft. He spent his year in
Vietnam walking point as a scout dog handler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw plenty of action, and it's a horrible experience,'' he
says. ``I try not to think about it much. But sometimes you do. You
see things, like that picture, and you just do.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nail, a 54-year-old executive-recruiter, was reared to be
patriotic, but he blanched when his draft notice arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 1968, and I'd just graduated and I realized, `Idiot me
hadn't joined the reserves,''' Nail says.
</P>
<P>
   Nail still wonders what happened to some of the men he met in
Vietnam. Many knew each other only by nicknames, making it almost
impossible to find out who survived and who's listed among the
58,199 dead on the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When vets do get together, even those who've never met, there's
still a bond. ``Vietnam vets have an automatic reaction to each
other,'' Nail says. ``You can look at them and know. You can talk
and understand what others can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Pardue, 54, agrees. Most of his best friends are Vietnam
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Pardue, who owns an Atlanta real-estate firm, got ``the note
from hell'' _ his draft notice _ when he took a quarter off from
college to earn tuition fees. He was accepted to officer's school
and arrived ``in country'' in July 1967 as a lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later he was severely wounded, and within weeks was
shipped home ``with a bullet in my left lung for life.'' He earned
a college degree and is now active in the Atlanta Vietnam Veterans
Business Association, a group that, among other things, tries to
erase the image of Vietnam veterans as anti-social losers. In fact,
most vets came back and became successful, both in business and
life, Pardue says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This 25th anniversary is possibly a benchmark for healing,''
says Pardue, who still remembers when returning vets were scorned.
``It was very sad, depressing and disappointing for sure. But I
think that's changing. I think the sacrifices we made carries a
little more respect and admiration than it did 25 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Torrence, a 53-year-old mortgage firm executive was drafted
in 1966 and spent more than 20 years in the Army, retiring 12 years
ago as a lieutenant colonel. He says the broad public support for
the Persian Gulf War in 1991 caused many Americans to rethink old
views about Vietnam veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Torrence is a member of a military helicopter pilot's
association. One day, he was wearing an association T-shirt when a
boy walked up to him and said, ``Are you a Vietnam veteran?''
Torrence said yes. ``This kid said, 'Thank you for what you did.'
He was about 14, and it choked me up. It kind of renews your faith
in the youth of our country.
</P>
<P>
   For Cathy Campbell, the anniversary is a different kind of
benchmark. Her fighter-pilot father, William Campbell, was shot
down over Laos in 1969 and is still listed as missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is getting some good publicity for a change, and it
feels good,'' Campbell says. ``It's almost a validation of what
happened. People are starting to think and talk about it more now,
and all these years the pain has been underground.''
</P>
<P>
   Most young men of the Vietnam era found a way not to go, either
by attending college for a deferment or by getting into state
militias or reserve outfits that almost guaranteed they'd stay home
_ or simply by being fortunate enough to get a high number in the
draft lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding service, though, is now haunting many of those men,
says Russ Christensen, 56, a humanities professor at Hamline
University in Minnesota who has studied the phenomenon _ and who
concedes he finagled his way out of combat himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lack of community among men my age,'' Christensen
says. ``I have a hard time even talking to Vietnam veterans. And I
don't go to Vietnam movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Baskir, co-author with William Straus of the book,
``Chance and Circumstance: The Draft, the War and the Vietnam
Generation,'' says ``every male who came of age during that time is
a veteran of Vietnam'' _ whether they served or not.
</P>
<P>
   Many who avoided service still feel ``very guilty about their
ability to avoid the worst consequences of the Vietnam War.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, many young men who were raised on John Wayne war
movies and reared by World War II vets chose to serve in Vietnam
because it's what they thought their fathers expected them to do,
Baskir says. Vietnam's shadow encompasses more than just the vets,
their loved ones and the avoiders. Even people who had no direct
connection still feel the war.
</P>
<P>
   For Peggy Barlett, an anthropology professor at Emory
University, the war still evokes bitter memories of a war fought
for suspect purposes. After she saw the movie ``Platoon'' more than
a decade ago, Barlett ``felt deep shame that I hadn't worked harder
to stop the war,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It there's a universal theme in the remembrances _ of vets,
their families, the men who didn't serve and people who wished
they'd been able to do more to stop the war _ it's one of horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the news about this anniversary is good,'' says Dollar,
one of the vets, ``because to me, it's like the Holocaust: I don't
think you should ever forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all kids should have to serve their country for a
couple of years,'' Nail says, ``but I don't want my boys to ever go
into combat, or anyone else's kids. There's got to be a better
way.''

ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS SEEK TO BRIDGE DIFFERENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ Israelis and Palestinians on Sunday begin their final
push to agree on an outline for a final peace pact by a May 13
deadline. But the two sides appear far apart on every issue,
ranging from the status of Jerusalem to whose turn it is to show
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said they were ready to make the necessary
compromises to get an agreement with the Palestinians on the
contours of a final treaty, but they warned that this would require
movement from the Palestinians as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're coming to the negotiations with the view that these are
very important talks, with a historical burden after 100 years of
conflict, and we think that now is the time to reach a
comprehensive agreement,'' said Gadi Baltiansky, spokesman for
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to show flexibility and willingness, but without
them showing flexibility it will be impossible to reach an
agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Barak's cabinet have recently suggested giving
the Palestinians 70 to 80 percent of the West Bank, a sharp
increase from previous proposals but still short of Palestinian
demands for return of all the lands Israel occupied in the 1967
Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat, who will meet Sunday
with his Israeli counterpart, Oded Eran, in the Israeli resort town
of Eilat on the Red Sea, said the Palestinians had already
compromised enough.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Palestinians have shown both flexibility and a
commitment to peace by proposing to establish their independent
state in the West Bank and Gaza _ rather than demanding the return
of historic Palestine _ and now it is Israel's turn to prove its
sincerity by showing flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us just 22 percent of what was Palestine. It's a
sign that we have accepted living in peace with Israel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that Israel will look at the bigger picture of a
historic conciliation, at the chance for a comprehensive peace,
rather than trying to snatch pieces here and there,'' Erakat said.
</P>
<P>
   This round of talks, which is expected to continue for about 10
days, is the culmination of months of inconclusive talks both here
and in Washington, including two separate meetings President Bill
Clinton held this month with Barak and later with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   US Middle East envoy Dennis Ross will also attend the talks in
Eilat beginning Tuesday or Wednesday, after meeting with Barak and
Arafat, although he was not expected to be arriving with any
specific proposal to push talks forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sides right now have to seriously engage with each other
to find a way to succeed,'' said a US official.
</P>
<P>
   The framework agreement, which is supposed to lay out general,
joint proposals on the details of a final peace treaty in time to
meet the new Sept. 13 deadline for a treaty, is itself already
months behind after talks stalled earlier this year over a
scheduled transfer of West Bank land to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a new sense of urgency, partly because of US
presidential elections. Both sides believe that the best way to
ensure US support for a peace deal _ economic and political _ is to
conclude it while Bill Clinton is still president.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a sense that negotiating time is running under the
1993 Oslo peace accords, according to which the Palestinians
received limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank and Gaza. The
final peace deal was supposed to be concluded last year. It is
unclear how long the two sides can keep extending the Oslo accords
without running into domestic difficulties from hard-liners on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in negotiating a comprehensive peace treaty is due to
disagreement on those issues that are not just the most
controversial, but also the most basic. These include the borders
of a Palestinian state, the future of Palestinian refugees, the
fate of Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank and Gaza land
and the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Arafat has demanded that the refugees, numbering
some 3 million if their descendants are included, be offered the
right of return to what is now Israel, something Israel dismisses,
except for perhaps token family reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat also wants his capital in east Jerusalem, which Israel
occupied in the 1967 Middle East war and says it will never
relinquish. Jewish settlements are another problem, with Israel
saying it wants to keep the majority in ``settlement blocs''
despite Palestinian insistence that they get back all the land
Israel occupied in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   One more sticking point is that both Arafat and Barak must be
sensitive to the demands of their constituents, which means they
both may have even less room to maneuver than they may want.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's broad but shaky coalition includes the National
Religious Party, whose support base comes from the some 160,000
Jewish settlers who live in the West Bank and Gaza. Most of the
settlers oppose giving up any more land to Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has to deal not just with the Palestinians, but with the
whole Arab world, which also does not recognize Israeli rule over
east Jerusalem and its Islamic holy sites. Arafat also must tread
carefully when it comes to the refugee issue or risk their
opposition, a political analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Palestinian side can give up on the refugee
issue, or settlements or Jerusalem, so I think it's going to be
difficult to reach a real agreement,'' said Palestinian political
analyst Ghassan Khatib.
</P>
<P>
   But over this weekend Israeli officials insisted that the two
sides could manage a deal, although nobody wanted to give specifics
on how this could be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the gaps are bridgeable and I believe that both the
Israelis and the Palestinians are now aware of the fact that you
can't fulfill 100 percent of your dreams, but there is one dream
you can reach and that is the dream of peace,'' said Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh.

 &HT;    Photos prompt stories of war
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If ever a picture told a story, it's the picture Larry
Burrows took of a muddy medevac zone during a 1966 firefight in
Vietnam. One of the best-known images of the war, the bleak tableau
is prominently displayed in the ``Requiem'' exhibit of Vietnam
photojournalism at the Atlanta History Center. It shows two wounded
Marines, one sprawled in the dirt, both legs bandaged, his blank
face splattered with red muck. The other soldier, his head swaddled
in a bloody cloth, appears to be stumbling toward his buddy with
arms outstretched. As it turns out, there's much more to the story.
</P>
<P>
   The man with the head wound is Jeremiah Purdie, a gunnery
sergeant now retired and living in Fayetteville, N.C. When Burrows
snapped the picture, an artillery round had just driven shrapnel
into Purdie's leg and into the flesh behind his left ear. He wasn't
reaching out for anyone; he was being led to a chopper, stunned at
what he had witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The artillery explosion killed my commanding officer and tore
our radio man half in two,'' he remembers. ``I had just moved to
the right, or I would have been dead, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatal round came from U.S. guns; according to the Marine
Corps history of the battle, the Americans were killed by friendly
fire.
</P>
<P>
   It was early October, and the Marine 3rd Division was opposing a
major infiltration of North Vietnamese regulars near the
demilitarized zone that separated the Communist north from the
south. Burrows, a Life magazine photographer who had been covering
Vietnam for years, followed the Americans as they assaulted a
jungle stronghold designated Hill 484. He shot 36 rolls of film and
sent them to the States without the detailed information he usually
supplied for captions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fighting was too intense,'' says his son, Russell Burrows,
a book publisher in New York. ``In his telex, he said it was
dangerous to be waving a white note pad.''
</P>
<P>
   Life dispatched a correspondent from Saigon to identify the
soldiers. He found Purdie, but he didn't get a name for the Marine
on the ground _ perhaps because the magazine didn't plan to run his
picture. The 10-page photo essay that Life published about the
fighting included only a vertical shot of Purdie.
</P>
<P>
   Burrows evidently preferred the frame with both Marines. In
1971, after the photographer died in a helicopter crash over Laos,
his editors found the image in a slide carousel he had used during
talks he gave on the war. Life ran it for the first time in a
tribute to Burrows; it has become the most published photograph of
his distinguished career.
</P>
<P>
   Purdie has gotten used to seeing his bleeding self.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flipped on the TV the other day, and there I was,'' he says.
The picture was on the screen because Time Warner had just
announced that the latest incarnation of Life would cease
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Now 69, Purdie has been out of the Corps for more than 30 years.
But he can still fit into his uniform to speak to schoolchildren.
The son of a poor family in Newport News, Va., he enlisted in 1948
because he thought the Marines had the sharpest-looking uniforms.
He saw combat in Korea and was nearing the end of a 20-year hitch
when the war in Vietnam started escalating.
</P>
<P>
   Purdie was wounded three times in six months. The photograph
captures his last moments in the country; moments later, he was
taken by helicopter to a hospital ship and never returned to
Southeast Asia. Doctors removed the shrapnel from his leg but left
the piece behind his ear, saying it would work its way out. It was
extracted in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carried that piece of metal around in my head for 26
years,'' Purdie says, with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Today he displays it over his fireplace, an evil, jagged
keepsake mounted to a framed print of the photo.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Burrows and his wife, Barbara Baker-Burrows, a former
photo editor at Life, located Purdie years ago and have stayed in
touch. They've always wondered who the other soldier was; Purdie
didn't know and neither have the veterans at the Marine reunions
they've attended. The couple would love to identify him for a book
of Burrows' Vietnam photos they plan to publish next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard from people over the years claiming to be him, but
nothing has ever come of it,'' Russell Burrows says.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more intriguing claims came from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   For years, an Atlanta family has believed that the Marine in the
mud was their son, Gene Webb, a former high school football lineman
who was drafted and shipped out to Vietnam in September 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's family saw the photo years after he came home and decided
it had to be him. They have the same eyes, the same profile, the
same chunky build. They even have leg wounds in the same places.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities are so striking that when Webb went to see the
current photo exhibit ``Requiem'' at the Atlanta History Center,
several museum-goers asked whether he wasn't the grunt on the wall.
One man, wearing a Virginia Military Institute sweatshirt, looked
back and forth between the blown-up, back-lit image of the young,
mud-caked soldier and the plump, gray-bearded veteran standing
before him with a walking cane. He finally asked, ``How many men
did you lose in that fight?''
</P>
<P>
   Webb couldn't answer him. Now 53 and working in a lithography
shop, he has never known whether he was the soldier in the photo.
He doesn't like to talk about Vietnam. He still takes prescription
medication to quell bad dreams and has managed to forget whole
stretches of his time in the combat zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember exactly how I got wounded,'' he says. ``I
just remember waking up in a hospital with a Purple Heart pinned to
my pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb was curious about the photo _ if only for his family's sake
_ so he phoned Purdie and they compared notes. The two veterans
have much in common: Both suffered shrapnel wounds, both have
Purple Hearts, both have developed ailments they blame on Agent
Orange, the herbicide U.S. aircraft dumped on the jungles where
they were fighting.
</P>
<P>
   But Purdie quickly concluded that Webb couldn't have been the
man. The gunnery sergeant was in a position to know which units
were fighting on Hill 484, and he couldn't recall Webb's having
been there. In all likelihood, it wasn't. Marine Corps records
confirm that Pvt. Harold Eugene Webb was assigned to the 1st
division, 5th regiment, 1st battalion, which was deployed 100 miles
away near Danang. He saw his share of action in Vietnam, but there
wasn't a legendary photographer around to document it.
</P>
<P>
   Webb took the news philosophically. ``I figured it couldn't be
me,'' he says. ``My mother always told me to wear clean underwear
in case I got hurt. The man in that picture is definitely not
wearing clean underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time families have mistakenly seen loved
ones in the fading images of Vietnam. Two years ago, The Washington
Post published a lengthy article about an Atlanta area man's
pilgrimage to Vietnam to visit the spot where his older brother was
killed in 1967. The story was based in large part on a picture that
the photographer and the younger brother erroneously identified as
his slain sibling. It turned out to be a Rhode Island man who was
surprised to see his picture in the newspaper so many years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of thing happens pretty often,'' says Bill James, a
Dallas veteran who is the unofficial historian of the First Marine
Division Association.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it happened to James. During the Tet Offensive of 1968,
he took part in the bloody fighting for the city of Hue. A
much-published photo of that battle shows a wounded Marine getting
an IV line as he's evacuated on a tank. ``You can barely see his
face,'' James says, ``but my family thought it was me. It wasn't.
They just wanted to believe it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, in the cloudy window of war, people see what they
need to see.

his distinguished career.
</P>
<P>
   Purdie has gotten used to seeing his bleeding self.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flipped on the TV the other day, and there I was,'' he says.
The picture was on the screen because Time Warner had just
announced that the latest incarnation of Life would cease
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Now 69, Purdie has been out of the Corps for more than 30 years.
But he can still fit into his uniform to speak to schoolchildren.
The son of a poor family in Newport News, Va., he enlisted in 1948
because he thought the Marines had the sharpest-looking uniforms.
He saw combat in Korea and was nearing the end of a 20-year hitch
when the war in Vietnam started escalating.
</P>
<P>
   Purdie was wounded three times in six months. The photograph
captures his last moments in the country; moments later, he was
taken by helicopter to a hospital ship and never returned to
Southeast Asia. Doctors removed the shrapnel from his leg but left
the piece behind his ear, saying it would work its way out. It was
extracted in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carried that piece of metal around in my head for 26
years,'' Purdie says, with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Today he displays it over his fireplace, an evil, jagged
keepsake mounted to a framed print of the photo.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Burrows and his wife, Barbara Baker-Burrows, a former
photo editor at Life, located Purdie years ago and have stayed in
touch. They've always wondered who the other soldier was; Purdie
didn't know and neither have the veterans at the Marine reunions
they've attended. The couple would love to identify him for a book
of Burrows' Vietnam photos they plan to publish next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard from people over the years claiming to be him, but
nothing has ever come of it,'' Russell Burrows says.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more intriguing claims came from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   For years, an Atlanta family has believed that the Marine in the
mud was their son, Gene Webb, a former high school football lineman
who was drafted and shipped out to Vietnam in September 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's family saw the photo years after he came home and decided
it had to be him. They have the same eyes, the same profile, the
same chunky build. They even have leg wounds in the same places.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities are so striking that when Webb went to see the
current photo exhibit ``Requiem'' at the Atlanta History Center,
several museum-goers asked whether he wasn't the grunt on the wall.
One man, wearing a Virginia Military Institute sweatshirt, looked
back and forth between the blown-up, back-lit image of the young,
mud-caked soldier and the plump, gray-bearded veteran standing
before him with a walking cane. He finally asked, ``How many men
did you lose in that fight?''
</P>
<P>
   Webb couldn't answer him. Now 53 and working in a lithography
shop, he has never known whether he was the soldier in the photo.
He doesn't like to talk about Vietnam. He still takes prescription
medication to quell bad dreams and has managed to forget whole
stretches of his time in the combat zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember exactly how I got wounded,'' he says. ``I
just remember waking up in a hospital with a Purple Heart pinned to
my pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb was curious about the photo _ if only for his family's sake
_ so he phoned Purdie and they compared notes. The two veterans
have much in common: Both suffered shrapnel wounds, both have
Purple Hearts, both have developed ailments they blame on Agent
Orange, the herbicide U.S. aircraft dumped on the jungles where
they were fighting.
</P>
<P>
   But Purdie quickly concluded that Webb couldn't have been the
man. The gunnery sergeant was in a position to know which units
were fighting on Hill 484, and he couldn't recall Webb's having
been there. In all likelihood, it wasn't. Marine Corps records
confirm that Pvt. Harold Eugene Webb was assigned to the 1st
division, 5th regiment, 1st battalion, which was deployed 100 miles
away near Danang. He saw his share of action in Vietnam, but there
wasn't a legendary photographer around to document it.
</P>
<P>
   Webb took the news philosophically. ``I figured it couldn't be
me,'' he says. ``My mother always told me to wear clean underwear
in case I got hurt. The man in that picture is definitely not
wearing clean underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time families have mistakenly seen loved
ones in the fading images of Vietnam. Two years ago, The Washington
Post published a lengthy article about an Atlanta area man's
pilgrimage to Vietnam to visit the spot where his older brother was
killed in 1967. The story was based in large part on a picture that
the photographer and the younger brother erroneously identified as
his slain sibling. It turned out to be a Rhode Island man who was
surprised to see his picture in the newspaper so many years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of thing happens pretty often,'' says Bill James, a
Dallas veteran who is the unofficial historian of the First Marine
Division Association.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it happened to James. During the Tet Offensive of 1968,
he took part in the bloody fighting for the city of Hue. A
much-published photo of that battle shows a wounded Marine getting
an IV line as he's evacuated on a tank. ``You can barely see his
face,'' James says, ``but my family thought it was me. It wasn't.
They just wanted to believe it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, in the cloudy window of war, people see what they
need to see.

CAMBY EXPECTS AN EARFUL FROM THE FANS IN TORONTO
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a draft-day whirlwind, Marcus Camby was picked up and plopped
down in a strange land where a queen and a loon decorated the money
and goons were celebrated on ice.
</P>
<P>
   It was just across the border, but, at first, Canada was, for
Camby, well ... difficult. Nothing personal. The city of Toronto
seemed culturally hip, and the people were about as cool and
likable as ice cream. But no ESPN? The Toronto Raptors rookie would
flip to one channel, and he'd find a hockey game. He'd flip to
another, and he'd see hockey highlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``On TV, they'd even show minor league hockey and junior league
hockey,'' Camby said after the New York Knicks' practice on Friday.
``When I got up there, it was the NBA's second year of existence. A
game was almost like a tennis match. It was all quiet. And if
someone scored, then they'd cheer.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 1996. After four years of cramming on the difference
between a hand-check and a cross-check, the fans who pack the Air
Canada Center don't need cue cards anymore.
</P>
<P>
   They know when to cheer a great play. And, as Camby has learned,
they know when to heckle their enemies. In his first trip back to
Toronto just over a year ago _ months removed from the June 1998
trade that sent Charles Oakley from the Knicks to the basketball
outpost and allowed Camby, a Connecticut native, to click his heels
and go home _ he received a rude welcome from Raptors fans.
</P>
<P>
   As his name was announced, as the energetic Camby bounded onto
the floor as a Knick, the sound of a crying baby was played over
the arena's public address system. It was clear. The Toronto fans
had come to embrace the Tonka-tough Oakley and had turned on the
finesse game of Camby, their fragile former star.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Camby is braced for whatever happens Sunday. In the
aftermath of his critique of Toronto coach Butch Carter, and in the
swirl of excitement the Raptors fans are sure to feel Sunday for
Game 3 of this best-of-5 first-round series, a hostile reaction
toward Camby is bound to surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter,'' Camby said. ``If we can pull this one out
on Sunday, I'll show you some reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks take Game 3, they will eliminate the Raptors and
move on to the next round against either the Miami Heat or the
Detroit Pistons. If Latrell Sprewell can hold his own against Vince
Carter once more in a Knicks victory, the moment will give Camby
the satisfaction of closing out his former team on its home court.
</P>
<P>
   He's ready. As tipoff closes in, Camby won't need the caffeine
hit he gets from his customary two cups of pre-game coffee. He
won't need rap music, pep talks or prodding. As it has been
throughout the series, Camby's body will probably give off a
100-watt glow from his own energy.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Camby has to be careful. This is how he has found
trouble in this series. In Game 1, Camby was so charged, his groove
blew a fuse. He was so convinced that Butch Carter had put special
emphasis on stopping him, he tried too hard, picked up three quick
fouls and finished with only five rebounds and four points.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, Camby was back to popping out of the paint for 13
rebounds, but opted for rushed tap-ins over emphatic dunks and
skittish layups instead of an aggressive putback. By the end of
Wednesday night, Camby was a forgettable 4 for 14 from the field,
scoring nine points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brendan called me on the day off,'' Camby said, referring to
the Knicks assistant coach Brendan Malone. ``He was going over game
tape with me on the phone. He stays on me all the time. He just
told me to concentrate and slow down. I think I was so energetic in
Game 2, I rushed shots and didn't finish strong going to the
basket.''
</P>
<P>
   He was too up, too emotional. Was this a reaction to Butch
Carter? Was it the fever of the playoffs? ``Probably a combination
of both,'' Camby said. ``I have to stay in control.''
</P>
<P>
   He maintained that balance in the playoffs last year. Camby used
his adrenaline to elevate his game, particularly against Atlanta
and Indiana. He picked his spots, slithered through the cracks in
the defense like smoke and devastated the spirits of the Hawks and
the Pacers. Just when the defense forced a Knick to miss a shot,
just when the opposing fans started to rise in the stands, Camby
would snuff out their excitement by levitating over the paint for a
dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very emotional,'' Malone said. ``His game is speed and
quickness. And sometimes you have to harness that speed and
quickness. You don't want to rob him of his emotion. Last year, in
Indiana and Atlanta, that energy from the second unit helped us.
You don't put a stop on a mustang. You let those guys run. You let
him run, but he has to run with some intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Marcus, he's very bright. I think he'll play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby was smart enough to find his niche in New York. It wasn't
easy at first. Finding himself compared to a folk hero like Oakley
was just the start of his dysfunctional beginning as a Knick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely unfair,'' Camby said. ``Last year, I mean,
replacing Oak, he's irreplaceable. You can't replace a guy like
that because he brings so much to the table. People expected me to
be him. I can only be me, and that's all I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate between pro-Camby and pro-Oakley factions raged until
the playoff last year. That's when coach Jeff Van Gundy was forced
to trust Camby because of injuries. That's when Camby developed his
identity as a Knick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the debate is there now,'' Camby said. ``Oak has
gone to Toronto and been the veteran they needed. And people have
gotten to know what I can bring to the team here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, they still remember him, too. In the franchise's
short history, there are few villains. Camby is among the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they do, fine,'' Camby said. ``The satisfaction I'll
get out of it is when we close this thing out. Then I'll be
happy.''

GAYS AND LESBIANS TO FLEX POLITICAL MUSCLE IN WASHINGTON MARCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Throngs of gays and lesbians and their supporters
will march on Washington on Sunday to demand public legitimacy and
to mobilize as a voting bloc this November.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Millennium March'' is the fourth national gay march since
one in 1979, which was attended by 25,000 people and marked the
coming out of the gay rights movement on the political stage. It is
also the first to be held in an election year. The last march, held
in 1993 shortly after President Clinton took office, brought
300,000 to the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every kind of group is represented _ from the leather
community to the parents,'' said Dianne Hardy-Garcia, 34, the head
of the Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of Texas and an organizer of the
march.
</P>
<P>
   One primary goal of the march, Hardy-Garcia said, is to turn out
the largest gay vote in American history ``and prove that we are 5
percent of the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the political ramifications of the march, Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore are expected to deliver videotaped remarks
of support to the crowd during the six hours of speeches and
entertainment on the Mall. Included in the dozens of scheduled
speakers are Democratic Reps. Barney Frank of Massachusetts and
Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, both gay; Mayor Anthony A. Williams of
Washington, and Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The families of Matthew Shepard, a gay student from Wyoming who
was beaten to death by two men in 1998, and of James Byrd Jr., a
black man dragged to death behind a truck by three whites in
Jasper, Texas, that same year, will attend the march to lobby for
laws against hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Although tens of thousands are expected at the march on Sunday,
one of the first events of the weekend, a protest Saturday of the
military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, drew only a handful of
demonstrators to the Pentagon, including some who said they were on
active duty or former military personnel and their partners.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Kunst, president of Oral Majority, one of the groups
involved in the march, attributed the turnout to poor planning by
organizers, who he said placed the protest well down the official
list of march activities.
</P>
<P>
   Other gay groups have criticized the march, including a number
of groups who are boycotting it, saying that its organizers have
commercialized the event, have been exclusive in its planning and
have failed to adequately turn the spotlight on AIDS and other
pressing issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``National marches can be a very powerful tool to raise
issues,'' said Bill Dobbs, who has organized the Ad Hoc Committee
for an Open Process. ``Unfortunately, the purpose and timing of
this one are fuzzy. This has become a marketing event in search of
a political purpose. This is supposed to be a civil rights
struggle, not a corporate marketing event.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Dobbs said his group was protesting the visible
sponsorship of the march by corporations like United Airlines,
Showtime Network and PlanetOut.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy-Garcia countered, saying, ``We have obligations to our
community to be financially responsible and to find ways to fund
these important events.'' She said the march cost ``less than $2
million'' to organize.
</P>
<P>
   One focus of this march will be to underscore the family values
of gays and lesbians, organizers said. A number of speakers will
call for legislation to help gay and lesbian couples legalize their
unions and adopt and provide foster homes for children. A scheduled
rally for gays ages 15 to 24 was to emphasize the need to help them
avoid substance abuse and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the march organizers held a $250 to $500 black
tie dinner honoring the entertainer Elton John, the comedian Ellen
DeGeneres and her partner, the actress Anne Heche. The dinner
included a tribute to Jerry Herman, the composer of the musicals
Hello Dolly, Mame and La Cage aux Folles, who has been diagnosed as
HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   Other planned events Saturday included a demonstration and
ceremony celebrating same-sex marriages called ``The Wedding,''
with a $25 entry fee for those who wanted a certificate. The Rev.
Troy Perry of Los Angeles, the founder of a Christian Church called
the Metropolitan Community Church, with branches throughout the
country, was to preside.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN will present six hours of live coverage of the march on
Sunday. The march will also be shown on a global Webcast. ``I'm
hoping that maybe somebody in Pakistan who's gay will be watching
and say, `Wow, I'm not alone in the world,'' Hardy-Garcia said.

KILLING GRABS AUTHOR'S ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK ZALOUDEK   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Best-selling author Ann Rule, who has built a
reputation writing about twisted, real-life murders, finds Sheila
Bellush's death too intriguing to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 contract murder of the mother of quadruplets, who was
living in hiding in Sarasota in fear of her ex-husband in Texas,
will be the subject of Rule's 19th book.
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster expects to publish the hardcover version of the
book, tentatively titled ``Every Breath You Take,'' next year. A
paperback edition will be out in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Rule says there are several aspects of the murder, including
charges that Allen Blackthorne, Bellush's millionaire ex-husband,
planned it, that incline her to write about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get a tremendously successful suspect who seems
like they would be the last person in the world to be charged with
murder, that really gets my attention,'' she said. ``People who
have everything, why would they risk throwing it all away, if
indeed he's guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of letters and e-mails from Rule's fans
suggesting that she take a closer look into the troubling murder
also helped to sway her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my readers have picked the topics of my past six
books,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Seattle author has written about other well-known
crimes and criminals, including serial killer Ted Bundy in ``The
Stranger Beside Me.'' Her current best seller is about prominent
Delaware lawyer Thomas Capano, who killed the governor's secretary
and dumped her body at sea after she tried to end their
relationship in 1996. Capano is on Delaware's death row. The book
is called ``... And Never Let Her Go: Thomas Capano, the Deadly
Seducer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rule plans to sit through the back-to-back trials this summer of
Blackthorne and Jose Luis Del Toro Jr., who is accused of being the
hit man.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne faces federal charges in Texas of committing
domestic violence across state lines and conspiring to commit
murder. His June trial will be in San Antonio. Del Toro's murder
trial is expected to be held in Sarasota in July.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Alex Rocha and Samuel Gonzales, two other San Antonio men
with ties to Blackthorne, are serving time for their involvement in
the death of the 35-year-old mother of six. They may testify at
both trials.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush was found in her Gulf Gate home shot and stabbed on Nov.
7, 1997. Her 2-year-old quadruplets were nearby, toddling through
the blood unharmed and wearing life jackets.

IF NOTHING ELSE, TYSON IS STILL A DRAW
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The heavyweight division has customarily been boxing's royalty
for obvious reasons, and traditionally provided the marquee fights
and the sport's most dominant personalities. But it is a division
in flux, with an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   The world's best-known heavyweight, Mike Tyson, is still
searching for a site for his fight with Lou Savarese, which should
not be as hard as it seems to have been. It appears the fight will
be in Italy or Scotland June 24. It is fitting somehow, given the
many questions surrounding Tyson's desire and commitment to boxing
these days, that settling on a date and place for the fight has
been so vexing.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson still has the gate appeal, though, if little else. The
Savarese fight was originally scheduled for May 20 and then for
June 3 in Milan. Promoters of the fight in Milan said they had
received twice as many ticket requests as they could fill for the
21,000-seat arena.
</P>
<P>
   It is this appeal that has others lining up to fight Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox Lewis, who fought Michael Grant for the undisputed world
heavyweight championship Saturday night at Madison Square Garden,
wants to fight Tyson, but Tyson's camp has not eagerly pursued that
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to fight Mike Tyson but he's a movie star now,''
Lewis said recently. ``He hasn't been taking it too seriously. What
can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Another heavyweight who was looking to Tyson for a big payday
was Shannon Briggs. But Briggs lost a tuneup fight with Sedreck
Fields Thursday night in New York and probably ruined his shot at
Tyson. Briggs, who looked sluggish, lost an eight-round majority
decision to Fields, whose professional record is 10-9. Briggs
(32-3-1) took the fight just to stay busy, waiting for the
potential Tyson date.
</P>
<P>
   David Tua, the IBF's No. 1 contender, is upset that he was not
fighting Lewis on Saturday night instead of Grant. But other than
among boxing's most fervent followers, Tua is not well known and
his protests alone will not get him the title shot he seeks.
</P>
<P>
   Also muddling the picture is John Ruiz, who is ranked as the No.
1 heavyweight contender by the WBC and the WBA.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Wladimir Klitschko of Ukraine. The heavyweight
gold medalist from the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta is trying to
raise his profile. He was to make his U.S. debut on the undercard
of Saturday night's event at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti Wants De La Hoya  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Gatti appears eager to move up in weight from junior
welterweight to welterweight and was scheduled to fight at 148
pounds Saturday night against Eric Jakubowski of Chicago. But
Gatti, who said his customary nonfighting weight is nearly 170
pounds, does not want to fight at much more than the 147-pound
welterweight range.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go up to 160 pounds, then I'm fighting guys coming down
from 180 pounds,'' Gatti said. ``That's the way it works. It's not
hard for me to make the 147-pound weight. But I don't want to fight
guys who are naturally a lot bigger than me.''
</P>
<P>
   He would like to fight Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be a good fight because people know I would come after
him,'' Gatti said. ``I know people are talking about that fight,
but I can't concern myself with it. If it comes along, I'll take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has a June 17 fight with Shane Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   The Pupil and the Teacher
</P>
<P>
   The featherweight Junior Jones credits his trainer Teddy Atlas
with instilling in him a new passion for boxing. ``Teddy put more
spark in the game for me,'' said Jones, who was to challenge the
IBF featherweight champion Paul Ingle on the Lewis-Grant undercard
Saturday night. ``I had started to think of boxing as my hobby. But
it's my job and you have to treat it like that every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Teddy, every day in the gym he keeps you focused. And he
teaches you how to be a professional boxer, not just somebody who
fights.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones in many ways is still trying to rebound from his
surprising 1998 loss to Erik Morales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morales just caught me at the right time,'' Jones said. ``I
took the fight too lightly. That's my fault''

REPORT CITES FLAWS IN U.S. NUCLEAR COMPLEX 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1996, a truck carrying nuclear warheads skidded off an icy
road in Nebraska and crashed.
</P>
<P>
   For half a day, no one in government, including the president
and his cabinet, knew the degree of danger, or if any nuclear
material had escaped into the environment, because radiation
monitors on the government's fleet of weapon trucks had been
removed after complaints from drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers had said the monitors showed that they were facing
potential health risks from their cargoes.
</P>
<P>
   These accusations have been made by Robert Alvarez, who from
1993 to 1999 was a policy adviser in the Department of Energy,
which runs the nation's nuclear complex. Before that, as a Senate
aide, he specialized in helping oversee the department.
</P>
<P>
   In an article for a journal, Alvarez calls problems with the
atomic fleet ``emblematic of the department's inept and often
arrogant management culture.'' The mindset has become so backward,
he says, that the complex is now basically a ticking time bomb
waiting to go off in a serious accident or an inadvertent nuclear
blast.
</P>
<P>
   His 12-page analysis appears in the May/June issue of The
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which was posted over the
weekend on the group's Web site, www.thebulletin.org.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Energy Department officials said that although
the department's handling of weapons had problems, Alvarez was
blowing them out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   In his article, Alvarez said the uncertainty in the Nebraska
incident cleared up after a federal crisis team arrived and found
no danger. But the underlying woes persisted.
</P>
<P>
   Energy officials and outside experts agree that the department
has serious problems, with roots in the vast responsibilities and
liabilities incurred during the Cold War in making 70,000 nuclear
arms. The challenges now lie in old age and downsizing. The
department owns more than 20,700 facilities and buildings,
including 89 nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major elements of Energy's complex are closing down,'' Alvarez
said in the article, ``leaving a huge unfunded and dangerous
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The department's nuclear site at Oak Ridge, Tenn., he says,
stores 189 tons of highly enriched uranium _ enough for 9,450 bombs
the size of the one that destroyed Hiroshima. Yet some of the
atomic fuel sits in ``decades-old wooden buildings vulnerable to
fire,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Ridge and six other sites, Alvarez said, are at risk of
accidents the industry calls criticality, which occur when atomic
fuel undergoes a chain reaction and emits a bluish flash. In Japan
last year, such an accident exposed dozens of workers to radiation,
three of them to huge doses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energy Department schedules to correct unsafe nuclear material
storage and processing at Oak Ridge and elsewhere continue to
slip,'' Alvarez wrote, in part because repair costs are higher than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   He said the department's Pantex Plant, in Amarillo, Texas, is a
time bomb. Mostly by hand, workers there are disassembling nuclear
weapons at a rate of hundreds a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Pantex workers have used the wrong tools and procedures,
Alvarez wrote, even as officials have bent rules and censored
safety reports. He quoted Frank Rowsome, a senior safety official
in the Energy Department, as saying in an internal department
report, ``There have been `a flock' of near misses.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said Rowsome had called for Pantex to be shut down until
its safety problems had been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Though a former government insider, Alvarez is seen by some
federal and industry experts as having an ax to grind. He was
considered something of an anti-nuclear crusader during his tenure
at the Energy Department, and was fired in December after his
daughter reported him and his wife to the police for growing
marijuana. His wife told the court that she used the marijuana to
treat a medical condition that produced migraines and muscle pain.
</P>
<P>
   Since the accident in Japan, Energy Department officials said,
special teams have been assessing criticality safety and found room
for improvement but no serious dangers. At Pantex, they said, the
teams have not found safety problems sufficient to warrant shutting
down the disassembly plant.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Alvarez's overall accusations, Ellen Livingston, the
department's senior adviser for environmental affairs, said,
``We've gone to great lengths to develop safety and training
programs to limit the hazards because we recognize the handling of
nuclear materials is a risky business.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, who is now a consultant to anti-nuclear groups, said
the department was wrong in playing down his charges but right in
calling him an antagonist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I was their golden boy and they booted me out
and now it's sour grapes,'' he said in an interview. ``They used me
as an internal critic. If I've got an ax, it's one I've been
grinding for 25 years.''

 &HT;    Sparks may fly at forum over recognizing president's possible
black kin
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ What some believe Thomas Jefferson did
with slave Sally Hemings is threatening to turn from a historical
debate to a racially charged brawl between white defenders of
Jefferson and his disputed black kin.
</P>
<P>
   A gathering of both sides May 6 and 7 in Charlottesville, Va.,
might signal how the feud will shake out over the next year, as
pressure mounts on Jefferson's recognized ancestors to embrace
evidence that the nation's third president had children by Hemings.
In question is how Hemings' relatives, or anybody else, must prove
that they're descended from Jefferson. If they can, they're
entitled to membership in the Monticello Association, a private
group that owns and maintains the iron-fenced Monticello cemetery
where Jefferson and his white kin are buried.
</P>
<P>
   That burial privilege would be extended to Hemings' descendants
if they became members. Prospective members must prove ``some sort
of genealogical trail back to a known descendant,'' association
President James Truscott, 69, said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 3 1/2 months since the Thomas Jefferson Memorial
Foundation weighed in on the side of the Hemings descendants,
outraged Jefferson defenders have swung into action. Planning their
public debut during next weekend's Jefferson family reunion, the
white defenders are intent on debunking what they consider a
historically suspect, politically correct rewriting of Jefferson's
relations with Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting together a group to articulate another possible
scenario: Maybe he did not do it,'' said John Works, 45, a
Jefferson descendant and former association president.
</P>
<P>
   From Bucharest, Romania, where he runs an oil company, Works has
spent long hours helping organize the Thomas Jefferson Truth
Foundation. One of his allies, amateur historian Herbert Barger of
Fort Washington, Md., is assembling a ``blue ribbon committee'' of
historians, scientists and ``just plain patriotic citizens'' to
compile historical evidence that rebuts the Thomas Jefferson
Memorial Foundation's conclusion in January.
</P>
<P>
   After months of examination by a research committee of
historians and Jefferson scholars, the memorial foundation said he
was ``most likely'' the father of Hemings' six children born at
Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   Hemings' offspring consider themselves defenders of Jefferson,
too. The ruling was a gratifying victory from the memorial
foundation, a private organization which has owned Monticello since
1923 and serves as caretaker of Jefferson's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   For the other side, the ruling was convincing evidence that the
memorial foundation is sacrificing its historical objectivity to
avoid offending African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a very big movement, in my sense, that the politically
correct group now controls Monticello,'' said retired
Charlottesville doctor Ken Wallenborn.
</P>
<P>
   An amateur Jefferson historian, Wallenborn, 70, resigned in
March from the memorial foundation's Jefferson-Hemings research
committee. Wallenborn said, the DNA test linking a living male
descendant of Eston Hemings to the Jefferson male line ``raises the
likelihood that it was Thomas'' who fathered Eston. ``But that is
not good enough,'' Works said. ``You have to prove that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's white defenders say Monticello's Getting Word oral
history project, consisting of interviews with more than 90
descendants of Monticello slaves, marked the memorial foundation's
departure from historical accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite target of the white defenders is Dianne Swann-Wright,
Monticello's director of special programs and historian for the
Getting Word project. She was hired in 1993, as the foundation's
first senior-level African-American staff member.
</P>
<P>
   Swann-Wright, 49, said some people will never be swayed,
regardless of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to understand that Thomas Jefferson had a
relationship with an enslaved African-American woman is beyond
their belief,'' she said. The foundation embraced 1998 DNA evidence
linking a living male descendant of Hemings' youngest son, Eston,
to the Jefferson male line. It also relied upon the Hemings' oral
history that linked Jefferson and Hemings. Then in 1998 pathologist
Eugene Foster published a scientific article based on DNA tests on
living male descendants of Eston Hemings. It found that one of the
descendants bore the same Y-chromosome as the male line in the
Jefferson family. The memorial foundation embraced that DNA test in
concluding that Jefferson probably fathered Eston, if not all of
Hemings' children. But Jefferson's white defenders say the memorial
foundation could have just as easily embraced another possibility
raised by the DNA test: that one of Jefferson's seven male
relatives fathered Eston. Some of Hemings' descendants are growing
impatient. ``The evidence that Thomas Jefferson did have offspring
with Sally Hemings is about as strong as it is going to get,'' said
Lance Balthazar, 64, a Marietta, Ga., businessman.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hemings' most outspoken descendants, Shay Banks-Young, of
Columbus, Ohio, suggests a DNA test on the remains of Jefferson.
Banks-Young, 55, said she is tired of Jefferson's ancestors
insisting that Hemings' kin be subjected to genetic testing. Most
recently, she and several other descendants of Hemings' son Madison
refused Herbert Barger's request to exhume the remains of William
Hemings, Madison's son.
</P>
<P>
   Barger said he believes a DNA test would bolster his belief that
Madison Hemings was not related to Thomas Jefferson. Barger added
he thinks Hemings' kin fear what a DNA test would find.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to dig up my family and do DNA,'' Banks-Young
said, ``then they should dig up Thomas Jefferson and do DNA on
him.'' From a genetic standpoint, pathologist Foster said, ``There
would be a logic to digging up both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   If their bones had not deteriorated and were reliable for DNA
testing, they could possibly provide evidence that Jefferson was
William Hemings' grandfather. Or, testing could prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very, very reliable, so reliable that most people
would have to accept it,'' Foster said. ``But the chances of it
happening are slight.''
</P>
<P>
   What's also unlikely is an amicable outcome at the upcoming
Jefferson family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time, the Monticello Association
invited Hemings' relatives to attend the reunion. The association's
president, James Truscott, extended the same invitation last month,
and he expects about two dozen of Hemings' descendents to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about 80 of Jefferson's relatives are expected for
what typically has been a low-key private affair spread across the
lawn of Jefferson's Monticello plantation.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed last year, after some Jefferson ancestors tried
unsuccessfully to exclude the Hemings family from the association's
business meeting. The rancorous gathering spilled from the
Jefferson Ballroom in the downtown Charlottesville Omni into the
media-packed lobby. The bickering among would-be relatives reached
a national audience.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson descendent John Works, the Romanian businessman, said
he'll try again Sunday to exclude the Hemings' family from the
business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can imagine what the TV cameras are going to see if they
throw a bunch of black people out of that meeting,'' said
Truscott's nephew, Lucian Truscott IV, a Los Angeles screen writer
and novelist. ''I think some of them are prepared to look like
redneck idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   A descendent of Jefferson, Truscott, 53, was the first to invite
Hemings' relatives to last year's reunion. Preferably in front of
the media, he's repeatedly accused his relatives of racism in
blocking the admission of the Hemings into the association.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to subject his family to a repeat of last year's
''unpleasant occurrences,'' Robert Golden, president of the Thomas
Woodson Family Association, decided last week he would not attend
the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   DNA tests of some of Woodson's living male ancestors failed to
link the Monticello slave to Jefferson. Golden, 70, of Pittsburgh,
said he believes his family's oral history is ample proof of
kinship to Jefferson. He added that some of Woodson's ancestors
would like to be buried in the Monticello cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Banks-Young, the Hemings descendent, said she believes the
burial rights present the biggest obstacle to her family's
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''For them, to think that people related to the slaves on the
plantation would be buried with them, that would be devastating,''
she said. ''It would taint the reputation of the great man.''

NEWEST GAME IS BUYING AND SELLING TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Get out the tote board: another New York area team
has been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the New York Islanders have been bought three times
_ once, briefly, by a now-convicted felon _ the latest by Charles
Wang and Sanjay Kumar last Wednesday for $187.5 million. The New
Jersey Nets have been sold twice, the New Jersey Devils and the New
York Jets once.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees, once chased by Cablevision, turned into
the hunter last year and merged with the Nets, then snapped up the
Devils last month.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision may still be wooing the New York Mets, who may be
waiting for a dot.com gazillionaire to pay a half-billion to turn
them into software.
</P>
<P>
   With the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers secure under
the Cablevision umbrella, only the New York Giants have eluded the
local auction block.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, when Bob Tisch paid the Mara family $75 million for
50 percent of the Giants, nine NFL teams have been sold, including
the Jets last January. Four expansion teams were added in those
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Jets went for $635 million, the Giants would be worth
$750 million or $800 million,'' Tisch said. Despite the overheated
appetite for teams, he said he had not received offers for his half
of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' he said. ``They know I'm not selling. I don't know if
I should feel bad or not, but everybody knows we're in it for the
long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of selling is going on nationally. Since 1998, 26 major
league teams have changed hands in whole or have sold large
minority stakes. Last week, Stan Kroenke, who owns 40 percent of
the St. Louis Rams, agreed to pay $450 million for the Denver
Nuggets, the Colorado Avalanche and the Pepsi Center in Denver,
beating out a group that included John McMullen, the departing
owner of the Devils, who was part of groups that tried to buy the
Jets and the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the year, the Vancouver Grizzlies have sold
for $165 million, the Dallas Mavericks for $280 million and the
Kansas City Royals for $96 million (less than one-third of the $322
million paid last year for the Cleveland Indians).
</P>
<P>
   The national trend has created a Wal-Mart sports bloc _ the blue
light special owners. Bill and Nancy Laurie, a daughter of Bud
Walton, who founded Wal-Mart with his brother, Sam, bought the St.
Louis Blues last year for $100 million ($10 million for the team
and $90 million for the debt on the Kiel Center). Kroenke's wife,
Ann, is Bud Walton's other daughter. And David Glass, a retired
chief executive officer of Wal-Mart, is the new Royals owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skyrocketing asset values of teams make them attractive to
sell, even with operating losses,'' said Marc Ganis, president of
Sportscorp Ltd., a Chicago consulting firm. ``Teams are also
selling when their owners die. But there is also a new breed of
owner, the technology entrepreneurs, willing to buy teams. So you
have a Mark Cuban spending a huge amount of money for the
Mavericks. It may be worth a lot in the future, but not now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban is a billionaire through his Broadcast.com Internet
company. Ted Leonsis used his AOL wealth to buy the Washington
Capitals and a minority interest in the Wizards, and Paul Allen
spent a bit of his Microsoft billions for the Seattle Seahawks and
the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Wang and Kumar built their technoriches through software at
Computer Associates International, and used it to keep the
Islanders on the sports world's most-sold list.
</P>
<P>
   From John Pickett, the team went to John Spano, who loved hockey
but loved a scam more and sits in prison for defrauding banks to
lend him the money to buy the team. Pickett took the team back, got
$25 million more from a group led by Howard Milstein, which said it
has lost $40 million over 28 months before Wang and Kumar developed
a sudden hunger for hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Wang really wanted the Nets, then tried to join Robert Wood
Johnson IV's bid to buy the Jets, but backed away last year when he
found that he would get no control for his investment.
</P>
<P>
   So Wang and Kumar overpaid to get the one New York team left _
and because Milstein wouldn't cut his price.
</P>
<P>
   The Pickett-to-Spano-to-Pickett-to-Milstein-to-Wang daisy chain
showed that a team could lose games and cash in mass quantities,
become a political hot potato but maintain its sale value. What a
country!
</P>
<P>
   Wang and Kumar deflected questions about a new lease, a new
arena or future cash losses by saying they weren't buying the team
as a financial investment or even because they love hockey, which
they don't. Their mentor was Alfonse D'Amato, New York's renowned
former ``Senator Pothole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we stopped looking at it as a business, it was easy
then,'' said Wang, whose Computer Associates stock is worth $1.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's view expands on the prevailing wisdom that a mogul can
earn better financial returns from Treasury bills or Beanie babies
than with a sports team.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't watch T-bills play,'' Alfred Lerner said when he
agreed to pay $530 million in 1998 for the renascent Cleveland
Browns.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' demise as a competitive team in the past decade
pegged them as an almost irretrievable charity case. Wang and Kumar
hope to deploy the team in the service of their charitable goals.
</P>
<P>
   That's admirable and works for the best community-minded teams,
like the Jacksonville Jaguars. But NFL economics are far healthier
than the NHL's. It will be instructive to see how long Wang and
Kumar view the Islanders as a noneconomic endeavor if their player
investments do not yield victories and a new arena remains an
unfulfilled dream.

NEWS ANALYSIS: BREAKUP CASE IS BUILT ON NOTION OF POTENTIAL RIVAL
FOR WINDOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)   (ADDS ``News Analysis'' to headline)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The overriding policy goal of a remedy in the Microsoft
antitrust case, the government has said repeatedly, is to make the
world safe for future innovation. The door to fair competition must
be left open, the government insisted, so that the Microsoft Corp.
cannot thwart its next head-on challenger with illegal tactics as
it did the Netscape Communications Corp., the pioneer in Internet
browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   In their papers supporting the government's proposal to split
Microsoft into two companies, three economists have identified the
challenger that could be the ``next Netscape'': Microsoft's own
Office suite of software, like Word for word processing and Excel
for spreadsheet calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The government plan, no doubt, will strike the executive team at
Microsoft as a ``Pogo'' policy for competition, recalling the
observation of Walt Kelly's cartoon possum: ``We have met the enemy
and he is us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the economists intend no humor in their prediction that the
Office business, once placed in a separate company from Microsoft's
industry standard Windows operating system, will be a powerful
force for reviving competition in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   That idea is the linchpin argument in trying to convince a U.S.
District Court in Washington that splitting up Microsoft is a risk
worth taking, a step that would serve to increase competition,
accelerate the pace of innovation in America's high-technology
economy and benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And the prediction is being made by three leaders of the
emerging ``new mainstream'' in economics: Paul M. Romer of Stanford
University, Carl Shapiro of the University of California at
Berkeley and Rebecca M. Henderson of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. They are economists in their late 30s and 40s who focus
on the effects that innovation and new technology have on economic
growth, industrial organization and corporate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual debate over the government's remedy will
revolve around the innovation arguments presented by the
government's economic advisers. The court's decision, Romer wrote,
``will profoundly affect the information industry, the most
technologically dynamic sector in our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Microsoft would agree entirely with that statement,
but it argues that the government proposal is a dangerous gamble
with history, given the fast-changing conditions in high-technology
markets whose direction even entrepreneurs, let alone courts,
cannot predict.
</P>
<P>
   But Romer and his colleagues say the remedy is needed precisely
to protect and accelerate the innovation process. ``By encouraging
conditions that encourage increased competition in the operating
system market,'' Romer wrote, ``this remedy will increase the rate
of innovation in the software industry and thereby increase the
rate of growth for the economy as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The lasting stream of benefits that can be expected
to follow from this remedy will substantially outweigh any
temporary costs that it may involve.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways, the economists say, that a stand-alone
Office business could bring new competition to the software
industry. The first is that Office, like Netscape's Navigator
browser, has the potential to become a software ``platform''
capable of competing with Windows. Netscape posed a frightening
challenge to Microsoft, trial evidence showed: As a layer of
software that sat on top of the Microsoft operating system, it
could replace Windows as the technology that controls the look and
feel of computing.
</P>
<P>
   And for software developers, the Netscape browser threatened to
replace Windows in providing the key software hooks _ known as
application programming interfaces, or APIs _ that programmers
write if their electronic commerce applications, e-mail and games
are to run smoothly on personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal memo in 1995, ``The Internet Tidal Wave,'' Bill
Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, warned that Netscape could
``commoditize'' the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup, Henderson wrote, will ``have the effect of putting
important middleware into the hands of a firm that has no incentive
to protect Windows.'' She added that both Office and the Internet
Explorer browser, which would be placed in the Office company under
the government proposal, are ``popular applications that expose
APIs and are widely distributed.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson wrote, ``Office is, like Navigator, an application in
wide demand for its own sake that rivals Windows in its level of
penetration.'' Accordingly, she stated that an independent company
controlling Office ``might threaten Windows much as Netscape
threatened Windows in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office company, Romer wrote, could foster competition and
innovation in the operating system market in a number of ways. It
could, for example, develop its own operating system. Most likely,
this would be an operating system tailored to the Office
applications for computing in emerging markets, like on handheld
machines or so-called Web applications.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Word or Excel might reside on a central computer,
with customers tapping into it over high-speed networks using an
Internet appliance instead of a personal computer running the
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The other way for a stand-alone Office company to encourage
competition would be to support operating systems that compete with
Windows, like Linux, an increasingly popular version of the Unix
operating system. An independent Office business would have a
strong incentive to make sure Office programs run on Linux, the
economists say, because they would no longer be trying to help
Windows maintain its dominance.

 &HT;    Outsiders vie for Giuliani-Clinton 'ringside' seat
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lawrence Garrett pulls no punches in discussing his
political donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic product is billboards,'' said Garrett, whose Duluth,
Ga. -based Formetco Inc. does business all over the country. ``So I
try to give to people who are good to us, who don't try to put us
out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   People like New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether Giuliani is friendly towards billboards
or not,'' Garrett admitted.
</P>
<P>
   What Garrett does know is that Giuliani is running against first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for the open U.S. Senate seat from New
York. That was pretty much enough to convince Garrett to donate
$500 to Giuliani's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure that the wife of a current president running
for office is really appropriate,'' said Garrett, adding that he
thinks the Republican Giuliani has done ``great things'' in New
York. ``Also, she and I disagree in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tip O'Neil declared ``all politics is local,'' he clearly
hadn't anticipated anything like the 2000 New York Senate race.
Giuliani's announcement Thursday that he has prostate cancer and
hopes to continue his campaign was just the latest bombshell in a
marquee matchup that has already shattered tradition (no other
sitting first lady has ever run for office), as well as records for
overheated media coverage. Now it's also attracting unprecedented
amounts of money, with huge chunks coming from out-of-state donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question it will turn out to be the most expensive
Senate race in history,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director
of the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics. ``People in
every corner of the country are paying attention and paying money
to get a ringside seat.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent figures available, Giuliani has
raised $19.1 million _ nearly 44 percent of it from outside New
York. Of the $12 million Clinton's taken in, a whopping 56 percent
has come from outside New York.
</P>
<P>
   From Georgians, Giuliani received 74 donations totaling $42,350
(the Federal Election Commission requires candidates to report all
donations of $200 or more). Clinton's 37 donations totaled $23,440.
In both cases, Georgia ranks 19th among all states in
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the local Giuliani donors are retired Coca-Cola president
Donald R. Keough and his wife, each of whom contributed $2,000, as
did Home Depot chairman and co-founder Bernard Marcus and his wife.
Clinton's Georgia donors include onetime Spelman College president
and current Emory professor Johnnetta Cole ($250), ex-CNN
Productions president Pat Mitchell, who recently became president
and CEO of PBS ($1,000), and former Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games chief operating officer A.D. Frazier Jr. ($1,000).
</P>
<P>
   Frazier now is president of the management firm Invesco Inc.
According to FEC records, 15 donors who listed Invesco under
``occupation'' contributed a total of $8,600 to Clinton on the same
day last November. Another Invesco employee, Luis Aguilar, said he
agreed to raise money in Georgia for Clinton when he accompanied
friends to a fund-raiser in New York and was ``impressed'' by a
speech the first lady gave.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not an Invesco, corporate, reason for doing it,'' said
Aguilar, who gave $670 to Clinton last September. ``There are
people I went to, and where do I know them? Where I work.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one state seems to have resisted the temptation to grab
that ``ringside seat.'' Giuliani has received contributions from
every state except North Dakota. Among Clinton's donations from 45
states, a single $500 one came from North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some state out there has to have some common sense, and as
usual, it's North Dakota,'' Drew Wrigley, executive director of the
North Dakota Republican Party, said only half-jokingly. ``People
here are just not swept off their feet by the passions of a far-off
Senate race, just because the national news tells us every night we
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate campaigns that attract massive amounts of ``outside''
dollars are not unheard of. Sometimes it's a lack of in-state
resources, and sometimes it's a matter of national reputation. For
instance, some 71 percent of contributions to Democrat Edward M.
Kennedy's 2000 re-election campaign have come from outside
Massachusetts. But this is something else again, if only because of
Southerners' usual penchant for pretending New York doesn't exist.
No one here can vote in next November's election up there. Nor
would Senator Clinton or Senator Giuliani be bringing home any pork
to the Peach State.
</P>
<P>
   So why are so many Georgians opening their wallets?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' said Michael Erlanger, 85, of Athens, ``you have
to put your money where your mouth is.''
</P>
<P>
   Erlanger's money _ $1000 of it _ went to Clinton because he
thinks she's ``an intelligent woman who believes in a great many
things I do,'' including helping the poor and children.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also this.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's both a positive and a negative to that,'' Erlanger
said of his contribution. ``I'm very pro-Hillary and very
anti-Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Georgians donating to the New York Senate race seem
to be at least as interested in slowing one candidate's career as
in advancing another's. Fred Alias, a hotel developer who lives on
Sea Island, gave $1,000 to Giuliani because he's done ``an
incredible job of cleaning up in New York'' and because he's
running against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Clintons have done more to diminish the morality
of the United States than any one couple that I've known in my
lifetime,'' said Alias, who thinks President Clinton would have
some influence on the first lady as a senator. ``I would not be
making a donation to him if Hillary Clinton were not running
against him.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Hillary Clinton _ and perhaps only Hillary
Clinton _ could have inspired Georgia resident Ellen Milholland to
contribute $250 to a Democratic Senate candidate running in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were between Moynihan and Giuliani, no, we probably
would not give money to Moynihan,'' said Milholland, 45, referring
to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), whose decision to retire
led us to Giuliani vs. Clinton. ``It's Hillary Clinton we're giving
to. We've met Hillary Clinton, my son has met Hillary Clinton and
we think highly of her and her policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Milholland, a stay-at-home mother of two and former Democratic
state senate candidate, thinks Clinton would do better in the U.S.
Senate than Giuliani by virtue of her personality, intelligence and
understanding of Washington after nearly eight years in the White
House. And she disagrees with those who say the actions of a
senator from another state would have little impact on Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   So does Marla Chaliff. And that's a key reason why the
commercial real estate broker and mother of three contributed $950
to Giuliani's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's elected, she will immediately be perceived as a
national leader, as opposed to any other freshman senator,'' said
Chaliff, 43. ``The thought of what she could do with that power is
what's so frightening to people like me who are opposed to her
policies and the thought of how that could possibly catapult her
into national office.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but the Center for Responsive Politics' Makinson has a
slightly different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great one,'' Makinson said of the Giuliani-Clinton
face-off. ``And everybody in the country has a little piece of it.
Except North Dakota.''

 &HT;    Another Coppola becomes filmmaker
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sofia Coppola knows about youthful obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   She was the ripe old age of 22 when a friend handed her a copy
of ``The Virgin Suicides,'' Jeffrey Eugenides' bold, mythic book
about five troubled teen daughters in Michigan and the suburban
neighborhood boys who, even after growing into adulthood, remain
obsessed with those beautiful girls and their brief, tragic lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the book on a trip,'' Coppola says. ``It's funny
because I remember being so engrossed in it. I just loved it. I
thought the writer was just so funny and sensitive and achieved a
deft mixture of the tragedy and the humor in it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola, 28, the daughter of Oscar-winning filmmaker Francis
Ford Coppola (``The Godfather'' films, ``Apocalypse Now'') and
recent wife to Oscar nominee Spike Jonze (``Being John
Malkovich''), simply could not get the book out of her head.
</P>
<P>
   So she did what many would consider a really dumb thing. Even
though the film option for ``Virgin Suicides'' was owned by the
independent company Muse Productions and a filmmaker had been hired
to direct his own adaptation, she started writing her own
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Persistence and, frankly, her pedigree paid off. Eventually,
Muse passed on its first filmmaker and asked Coppola to direct her
own script. ``The Virgin Suicides,'' starring Kirsten Dunst, James
Woods and Kathleen Turner, opens nationwide Friday. It's Coppola's
first feature-length film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virgin Suicides'' is a dreamlike movie about the intense
passion of youth, fantasies, lust and obsession and
ice-cream-colored remembrances. And it's earning critical raves. In
his review, Matt Wolf of The Associated Press said, ``It's a movie
about loss in which a major film talent is found.'' The New York
Times has dubbed her ``an assured and imaginative filmmaker in her
own right.''
</P>
<P>
   They are words Coppola isn't used to in the press. A
photographer, clothes designer, model and one-time co-host of
Comedy Central's ``High Octane,'' she was savaged by critics when
she, at her father's request, tried acting and co-starred as Al
Pacino's daughter in ``The Godfather Part III.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics were harsh,'' Coppola says. ``But it's a business;
it just happens to be a big business. I don't have a resentment
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   She sometimes speaks in an innocent manner that belies her age.
She'll use a word _ like ``universality'' _ and then in the same
breath wonder aloud, ``that is a word, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola recently talked by phone from Los Angeles about ``Virgin
Suicides.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Granted the story is fictional, but the film is a memory of
tragic events and five deaths _ as seen through one teen boy who's
grown up. For you, how much of what the film relates is real and
how much is perception?
</P>
<P>
   A: I definitely thought it was important that it was a memory so
that it's not realistic. It's about how you remember things. The
girls are more lovely. Even with the death of Cecilia (the first
teen to take her own life) it's described as sort of a circus act.
In life, you only remember parts of things. It's idealized and
surreal. But surreal doesn't mean it has to be weird.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When first reading the book, did you picture particular
actors, like Kathleen Turner as the overbearing mom?
</P>
<P>
   A: I didn't picture any actors when I was reading it. I guess I
wasn't thinking about it as a movie. Later, the casting people put
lists together. Her name came up, and I thought it was a great
idea. I think that character needed a great actress. She needed
depth, to have this power and be sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some people will likely have trouble with the film because
there are no definitive answers as to why things happen.
</P>
<P>
   A: When it was in script form there was concern about that. It's
not that common to have a mystery without an ending. But that's one
of the things I liked about the book. In life there aren't good
explanations for many things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the toughest part of making the movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: You know, at the time it was really hard. But afterward you
sort of forget the hard parts. People say that about having kids.
It was hard working on such an intense schedule. We shot it in 29
days. I do remember shooting the scenes in the car as being
difficult. You see that in movies all the time. But that was one of
the hardest things for me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did your father say to you after he saw the film?
</P>
<P>
   A: What I remember the most is when he read my script and said
it was really good. I didn't think the subject matter was
interesting to him, but he thought the script was personal. He
thought it reinforced the universality ... of the themes in the
story. Even if you grew up somewhere completely different, the idea
of boys and girls and loss came through.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read where you used to make home videos as a kid. What
were those about?
</P>
<P>
   A: My friends and brothers and I made videos, usually horror
films. We'd just make up silly things. They weren't very
intellectual. I also got to where I'd do video reports for school
instead of written reports. I recall doing George Washington in
clay as Mr. Bill.

NEWS ANALYSIS: BREAKUP CASE IS BUILT ON NOTION OF POTENTIAL RIVAL
FOR WINDOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)   (ADDS ``News Analysis'' to headline)  
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The overriding policy goal of a remedy in the Microsoft
antitrust case, the government has said repeatedly, is to make the
world safe for future innovation. The door to fair competition must
be left open, the government insisted, so that the Microsoft Corp.
cannot thwart its next head-on challenger with illegal tactics as
it did the Netscape Communications Corp., the pioneer in Internet
browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   In their papers supporting the government's proposal to split
Microsoft into two companies, three economists have identified the
challenger that could be the ``next Netscape'': Microsoft's own
Office suite of software, like Word for word processing and Excel
for spreadsheet calculations.
</P>
<P>
   The government plan, no doubt, will strike the executive team at
Microsoft as a ``Pogo'' policy for competition, recalling the
observation of Walt Kelly's cartoon possum: ``We have met the enemy
and he is us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the economists intend no humor in their prediction that the
Office business, once placed in a separate company from Microsoft's
industry standard Windows operating system, will be a powerful
force for reviving competition in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   That idea is the linchpin argument in trying to convince a U.S.
District Court in Washington that splitting up Microsoft is a risk
worth taking, a step that would serve to increase competition,
accelerate the pace of innovation in America's high-technology
economy and benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And the prediction is being made by three leaders of the
emerging ``new mainstream'' in economics: Paul M. Romer of Stanford
University, Carl Shapiro of the University of California at
Berkeley and Rebecca M. Henderson of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. They are economists in their late 30s and 40s who focus
on the effects that innovation and new technology have on economic
growth, industrial organization and corporate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual debate over the government's remedy will
revolve around the innovation arguments presented by the
government's economic advisers. The court's decision, Romer wrote,
``will profoundly affect the information industry, the most
technologically dynamic sector in our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Microsoft would agree entirely with that statement,
but it argues that the government proposal is a dangerous gamble
with history, given the fast-changing conditions in high-technology
markets whose direction even entrepreneurs, let alone courts,
cannot predict.
</P>
<P>
   But Romer and his colleagues say the remedy is needed precisely
to protect and accelerate the innovation process. ``By encouraging
conditions that encourage increased competition in the operating
system market,'' Romer wrote, ``this remedy will increase the rate
of innovation in the software industry and thereby increase the
rate of growth for the economy as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The lasting stream of benefits that can be expected
to follow from this remedy will substantially outweigh any
temporary costs that it may involve.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways, the economists say, that a stand-alone
Office business could bring new competition to the software
industry. The first is that Office, like Netscape's Navigator
browser, has the potential to become a software ``platform''
capable of competing with Windows. Netscape posed a frightening
challenge to Microsoft, trial evidence showed: As a layer of
software that sat on top of the Microsoft operating system, it
could replace Windows as the technology that controls the look and
feel of computing.
</P>
<P>
   And for software developers, the Netscape browser threatened to
replace Windows in providing the key software hooks _ known as
application programming interfaces, or APIs _ that programmers
write if their electronic commerce applications, e-mail and games
are to run smoothly on personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal memo in 1995, ``The Internet Tidal Wave,'' Bill
Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, warned that Netscape could
``commoditize'' the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup, Henderson wrote, will ``have the effect of putting
important middleware into the hands of a firm that has no incentive
to protect Windows.'' She added that both Office and the Internet
Explorer browser, which would be placed in the Office company under
the government proposal, are ``popular applications that expose
APIs and are widely distributed.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson wrote, ``Office is, like Navigator, an application in
wide demand for its own sake that rivals Windows in its level of
penetration.'' Accordingly, she stated that an independent company
controlling Office ``might threaten Windows much as Netscape
threatened Windows in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office company, Romer wrote, could foster competition and
innovation in the operating system market in a number of ways. It
could, for example, develop its own operating system. Most likely,
this would be an operating system tailored to the Office
applications for computing in emerging markets, like on handheld
machines or so-called Web applications.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Word or Excel might reside on a central computer,
with customers tapping into it over high-speed networks using an
Internet appliance instead of a personal computer running the
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The other way for a stand-alone Office company to encourage
competition would e to support operating systems that compete with
Windows, like Linux, an increasingly popular version of the Unix
operating system. An independent Office business would have a
strong incentive to make sure Office programs run on Linux, the
economists say, because they would no longer be trying to help
Windows maintain its dominance.

ON PRO BASKETBALL: RAPTORS SEEM TO BE CATCHING UP TO THE HYPE
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO  &UR; _  &LR; After a blowout loss at home earlier this season,
Charles Oakley delivered a blunt post-mortem: ``There's a lot of
hype around here, and you can't believe the hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Davis was not part of the hype. You have to have a
sports-drink commercial and throw down corkscrew dunks to be part
of the hype. Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady were part of the hype.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was more like Oakley, a big, strong rebounder with a
decent offensive game, traded to the Toronto Raptors for a younger
player with potentially more upside.
</P>
<P>
   Two hardened playoff warriors, essentially told by their former
teams, ``We're better off without you.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, who was a New York Knick for 10 years, was traded to
Toronto in the summer of 1998 partly because management felt he was
outplayed by Davis in a second-round loss to Indiana, where Davis
spent the first six years of his career.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Davis was traded to Toronto last off-season after the
Pacers were stunned by a younger, athletic Knicks team in the
conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   There was almost symmetry to it, some sort of hoop karma. Davis
jumped over a worn-down Oakley one season. And Marcus Camby, the
player acquired for Oakley, swooped in for a rebound dunk over
Davis the next season _ hastening his departure.
</P>
<P>
   What came around in the NBA, indeed, went around.
</P>
<P>
   The younger, cheaper player acquired by the Pacers for Davis was
a corn-silk thin high school kid named Jonathan Bender, who may one
day be very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never talked about that,'' Davis said Friday afternoon
after a Toronto practice. ``We just never have. New York may still
use that as an excuse. But if that's the reason they traded
Charles, then that was a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I've just been happy that I've had a chance to play
with Charles. I've learned a lot from him. And I understand why
he's been the player and the leader he's been.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley on Davis: ``A.D. knows how to play, simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the story of two veterans exiled to the Canadian border
to play out their careers on a lottery team. Somehow, the plot
changed. The kids they were supposed to slowly nurture turned out
to be better and more mature than advertised. The veterans had more
than a little game left. And together, in a woeful marketplace none
of their peers wanted to play in less than two years ago, they
enraptured a hockey province. They constructed a nice model for the
new millennium:
</P>
<P>
   Oak and A.D., T-Mac and V.C., working it out with their
supporting cast over time.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you see what is in front of the Raptors: an 0-2 deficit
against the Knicks in a best-of-5 first-round series, an exit from
the playoffs as early as Sunday afternoon in front of the
franchise's first postseason crowd. Maybe their coach, Butch
Carter, is Canada's answer to Kathie Lee Gifford _ they cannot keep
quiet for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe the brush fires and the difficult losses are merely
growing pains, stones in an unfinished wall. Maybe being
transferred from an established company to a start-up shop _ rife
with mad geniuses _ is not the worst thing to happen to an NBA
veteran anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Davis, Oakley had a choice to leave Toronto last summer.
Rather than teach and baby-sit Carter and McGrady, he could have
been Shaquille O'Neal's bodyguard. The Lakers offered him their $2
million a year veteran exception, a three-year deal worth about $6
million.
</P>
<P>
   When Oakley and Jerry West, the Lakers' president, were filmed
walking through the not-yet-completed Staples Center in hardhats
last summer, Oak's legions had to nod and smile.
</P>
<P>
   Here was the gritty former Knick who came to embody the team's
scrapping '90s style, the player so broken up weeks after the trade
for Camby that he spent most of one afternoon at a summer golf
outing barking to former teammates, ``Watch out, I'm comin' back
with Shaq.'' Patrick Ewing left the links early that day.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Oak had a real shot to win a title. Fitting, no?
</P>
<P>
   But he went for the money. No one could blame him. Toronto was
able to offer $18 million over three seasons. Oakley's last NBA
contract was worth three times more than the Lakers could pay. He
took the Canadian exchange rate over the untold value of a possible
championship ring. With Davis, he continued to help run a day care
center, watching the kids grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even thought about that,'' said Vince Carter when
asked if he ever envisioned playing without Oakley. ``I just got so
used to him being here, you don't even think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley and Davis have clashed with the team's young stars over
offensive roles (Translation: the old guys wanted more shots). But
grudges die quickly here. ``Their experience means a lot,'' Carter
said. ``What it comes down to is, they've been in the playoffs. We
haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis grabbed nearly 3,000 rebounds and became a better
offensive player each season in Indiana. He wanted to start instead
of coming off the bench. The Pacers decided to pledge their loyalty
to Dale Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you look back,'' he said. ``I still love that team.
I wish them all the best in the world. I didn't want to leave. It
was just a situation where I wanted more responsibility. They
trained me to be that way. They trained me to be this type of
competitor. I want to win. I want to contribute. And then once I
get to the point, you're not going to give me the opportunity?''
</P>
<P>
   As Davis spoke, reporters and camera crews scurried wildly about
the team's practice facility, trying to find another player to
denounce Butch Carter's latest controversial remarks.

   This has been some week in Toronto. Players benched. Court
papers served. Roiling cauldrons of dissension, about to spill
over. Reminds you of Knicks practice, circa 1999.

   ``It's tough to deal with sometimes, especially in Indiana when
things were so cut and dry,'' Davis said. ``There was a history of
the team since the ABA days. That's just how it's been. You don't
have all these growing pains that this team has.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``you have to go through them in order to
understand them.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Davis managed a rueful smile. His coach was popping off
in the gymnasium. Oakley meandered by, his head bobbing, mumbling
something that made Davis laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors are not imploding. Held up by a couple of adults,
they are taking their first, courageous steps. In time, you can
believe the hype.

 &HT;    CAUTION URGED ON MICROSOFT BREAKUP
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Both Microsoft's critics and defenders want the judge
to take his time before agreeing to the government's plan to cleave
the software giant in two.
</P>
<P>
   But they differ sharply how the breakup proposal made on Friday
by the Justice Department and 17 states would impact one of the
most dynamic sectors of the nation's economy. Nor do they agree on
the potential impact on investors, who have seen Microsoft's stock
lose one-third of its value in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And some antitrust figures who approve of U.S. District Thomas
Penfield Jackson's verdict on April 3 that Microsoft is a predatory
monopolist also feel the remedies the government wants, which
include slapping on regulatory handcuffs until the breakup takes
hold, go too far while others feel they don't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   The far-reaching proposal, which has infuriated top Microsoft
executives, calls for one company to own only the Windows operating
system. The other would market such Microsoft applications as Word
and Excel while also laying claim to the Internet Explorer browser,
the chief issue that caused the landmark suit to be filed two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies -- only one would be permitted to retain the
Microsoft named -- would be barred from merging for another 10
years. The actual terms of the corporate divorce would written by
Microsoft itself, subject to review by the government and the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Neukom, Microsoft's chief counsel, who sat at the defense
table throughout the 77-day trial, contends that the current
timetable set by Jackson to move the case forward needs to be
revised.
</P>
<P>
   Says Neukom: ``The government's unprecedented and extreme remedy
proposals will require a significant expansion of the remedy
process currently contemplated by Judge Jackson's order. Even the
government will have to agree that an American company deserves
more than 12 days to respond to a government proposal to tear apart
a $400 billion company.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom argues that ``the government's excessive demands will
require months of discovery and evidentiary hearings and added that
government's proposals ``simply delay the ultimate resolution of
this case because Jackson ``all parties recognize this case
(ultimately) will be decided by the appellate courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Two figures in the case whom Neukom eagerly wants to depose are
Robert Greenhill and Jeffrey Williams, the chief executive and the
managing director of Greenhill &AMP; co., an investment advisory firm
that served as a consultant to the justice department in devising
the breakup formula.
</P>
<P>
   In a supporting brief filed with the court, the Wall Street
analysts wrote that the breakup ``will not result in a material
decrease in (Microsoft's) market value over the intermediate to
longer-term.'' Under the right conditions, they said, it could even
be ``positive.''
</P>
<P>
   That view upsets Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, who told Wall
Street analysts in a conference call Friday night: ``Microsoft will
be greatly damaged by this kind of split. No one should think that
shareholder value would be preserved with this kind of activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates also told the analysts that ``Microsoft could never have
developed Windows under these rules ... because without the great
work of the Office team and the Windows team it never would have
come together.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an admission that may come to haunt Microsoft's co-founder
since, in the past, the company has always strenuously maintained
that there exists ``a Chinese Wall'' between the two sets of
programmers that has never been breached.
</P>
<P>
   Software competitors have often complained that Office
developers held an inside track to vital parts of the Windows code,
a charge that the Microsoft brass in the past have vigorously
denied. The Justice Department chose not to make the applications
suite part of the case, although the original complaint filed by
the state attorneys general did so.
</P>
<P>
   Even as an embattled Microsoft seeks to extend the remedy phase
of the trial, a go-slow signal to Jackson was also flashed by
Robert Litan, a former Justice official involved in an earlier
phase of Microsoft's duel with the government who directs economic
studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Litan favors ``breaking up the Windows monopoly itself, perhaps
in three equal-sized pieces, each with the same intellectual
property to the Windows source code.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the monopoly gone,'' he says, ``there would be no need
for continued judicial supervision, either of the new Windows
competitors or the rest of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he adds, ``the claim that Microsoft's monopoly is so
important to the U.S. economy is a little hard to square with the
company's claims that technology is moving so fast as to render any
severe sanction overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with three other well-known economists, Litan has
submitted a brief to Jackson that reads in part: ``We believe that,
because the underlying remedy issues are so complex, the key
concern is the quality of the assessment rather than the speed of
the resolution. Hence, a careful study and assessment of
alternatives should not be sacrificed in the rush to resolve
uncertainties surrounding the outcome of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio and Illinois, two of the 19 states that are parties to the
case, declined to go along with the government's formula. Ohio
Attorney General Betty Montgomery: ``A reorganization could be
difficult to undo, and its effects would be difficult to predict.''

FOR ILLINOIS GOVERNOR, AN EXPLANATORY TOUR 
DUST SWIRLS IN BATTLE FOR A KEY HOUSE SEAT 
OREGON INITIATIVES TORMENT GOVERNOR 
ADDING UP THE SCORE: BUSH 308, GORE 160
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ill., Utah, Ore.) By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost since the day he took office in early 1999, Gov. George
Ryan of Illinois has been under heavy political fire.
</P>
<P>
   First, he had to deal with the fallout of a federal corruption
investigation into the way the state handed out leases and drivers'
licenses. Next, he found himself struggling to explain to angry
taxpayers why vehicle fees had been increased. Then came taxpayer
outrage about increases in liquor levies, followed by criticism of
the governor's support for riverboat gambling.
</P>
<P>
   By early March, Ryan, a Republican, was in such bad standing
with voters that polls found only one in four had a favorable
opinion of him and only one in three approved of the way he was
running the state.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, things got even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Roeser, the president of the Family Taxpayers Network, a
group of Illinois conservatives who favor tax reform, demanded that
Ryan step down as chairman of Gov. George W. Bush's presidential
campaign effort in Illinois, a crucial state in Election 2000.
Ryan's troubles, Roeser warned, would drag Bush down in the state
this fall and, equally bad, would doom Republican efforts to seize
full control of the Illinois Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Roeser said he was forming a new conservative group, Republicans
United, that would press Ryan to give up the Bush campaign post and
that would seek to overturn bills Ryan had pushed through the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The governor countered that he had the full support of Bush and
accused Roeser of being on ``the right fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ryan said he would embark this week on a
border-to-border tour of Illinois to meet constituents in a series
of town hall gatherings. ``This is an important opportunity to
explain to people the work we've been doing and hear what's on
their minds,'' said the governor's spokesman, Dennis Culloton.
</P>
<P>
   DUST SWIRLS IN BATTLE FOR A KEY HOUSE SEAT
</P>
<P>
   With only a six-vote majority in the House, Republican
congressional leaders are taking no seat the party holds for
granted _ especially the one held by Rep. Merrill Cook of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, a two-term conservative who represents the state's 2nd
Congressional District, which includes most of Salt Lake City, is
about as vulnerable as any House Republican running this year, not
so much because of his politics as his contentious,
shoot-from-the-lip behavior. Over the last 18 months he has gotten
himself banished from the Utah Republican Party's headquarters
because of an angry, profane outburst; he has feuded with, and
fired, his chief of staff, who accused him of delusional behavior;
and he has been found guilty by a jury of reneging on a $175,000
payment he owed his 1996 campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican leaders became so concerned about Cook's
behavior last year that some quietly began casting about for
someone to challenge his renomination, and two candidates
eventually signed up: Derek Smith, a computer company founder, and
Jeff Wright, a venture capitalist. Some national party leaders
toyed with the idea of joining the state leaders in their search,
but they eventually decided to follow the usual policy and stick
with the incumbent, however troubled.
</P>
<P>
   No matter.
</P>
<P>
   Cook is still in political trouble. And so, too, are Smith and
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   On May 6, at a convention of district Republicans, a vote will
be taken to choose the nominee. But the winner must get 60 percent
of the vote. Otherwise, there will be a primary runoff on June 27
between the convention's two top vote-getters.
</P>
<P>
   All of the major House leaders have rallied to Cook's side in
the struggle for convention votes. But Smith and Wright are
campaigning hard.
</P>
<P>
   The best bet is that there will be a June runoff, but who will
be in it is only a guess. And it may not matter.
</P>
<P>
   The latest 2nd District preference poll, conducted 10 days ago
by The Deseret News of Salt Lake City, had the Democratic nominee,
Jim Matheson, son of former Gov. Scott M. Matheson, beating all the
Republican hopefuls by two to one or better.
</P>
<P>
   OREGON INITIATIVES TORMENT GOVERNOR
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to ballot initiatives, the growing bane of
governors and state legislatures, no one does it better than Bill
Sizemore.
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore is the director of Oregon Taxpayers United, a
conservative group that sees government as a meddlesome, wasteful
squanderer. For the better part of a decade, he and his
organization have been end-running and bedeviling Oregon governors
and the Oregon Legislature with anti-tax and anti-spending
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, it appeared that Sizemore had finally overreached
and met his match in Gov. John Kitzhaber, a popular Democrat. He
challenged the governor's re-election effort and was thrashed by a
ratio of better than 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Sizemore is back. Big time.
</P>
<P>
   By Election Day, he will have no fewer than five Taxpayer United
initiatives on the ballot, one of which would allow Oregonians to
deduct their entire federal tax bill from their state tax return.
Should the referendum pass, finance experts say, it would cost the
Oregon treasury about $1 billion a year, requiring huge cuts in
state programs. By one calculation, the cuts in the education
budget might force schools to close a month early.
</P>
<P>
   Kitzhaber is working so hard to defeat the Sizemore initiatives,
especially the tax deduction measure, that he has less and less
time to devote to other state business and has abandoned his own
tax reform and education proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the other day whether he felt that Sizemore was dictating
how the state was run, Kitzhaber replied, ``Sometimes I think that
my destiny in my eight years as governor is to keep my finger in
the dike.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore's reading on that: ``The governor is kind of a sideline
player in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   ADDING UP THE SCORE: BUSH 308, GORE 160
</P>
<P>
   The Hotline, the popular Internet political tip sheet, keeps a
running tab of presidential preference polls in various states as
they become available. Here is how they added up as of the end of
last week:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush led in 27 states, together worth 308
electoral votes. Vice President Al Gore led in 12 states, together
worth 160 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Needed to capture the White House: 270 electoral votes.

A PLAYOFF TEAM IN TURMOIL, EXCEPT IT'S NOT THE KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ It was a familiar situation for the New York
Knicks, waking up in recent days to headlines of dissension and
controversy. But as they rubbed the sleep from their eyes, they saw
that the stories were about their opponents, the Toronto Raptors,
and not them.
</P>
<P>
   While the Raptors seem on the verge of disintegrating as they
approach what could be their last game of the season, the Knicks
found themselves in a position that they were unaccustomed to,
being the poised and focused team. But after enduring a tumultuous
season in 1999 that still finished with them earning a spot in the
NBA finals, the Knicks were one team that did not believe that the
Raptors' bickering rendered them any less dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether it's nice to see it or not,'' Houston
said of the Raptors' problems. ``But we've learned from that. You
really can't let those kind of things distract you. What it does is
put more negative things in your mind that directs your attention
from what you're supposed to be doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially in the playoffs, this is not a time to get into
quarrels. When things go wrong within a game or within a series,
you have to stick together even more, especially here in New York.
We've learned that.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Raptors, the off-the-court intrigue has been more
interesting than their performance on the court. Before the series
began, coach Butch Carter was prompting laughter in both locker
rooms by filing a defamation lawsuit against Knicks forward Marcus
Camby. While he dropped that suit, he stopped the laughter in his
own locker room by yanking the co-captain Doug Christie from the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the Knicks took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-5-game
series, Carter criticized his team, without naming names, saying
that players who were potential free agents were focused as much on
their individual situations than the team's. He then said that the
team lacked an on-floor leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to put it aside last year,'' Latrell Sprewell
said. ``So that shows it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' problems last season make the sniping in Toronto
seem tame, with General Manager Ernie Grunfeld being fired late in
the regular season, and the status of coach Jeff Van Gundy dangling
while the Madison Square Garden president, Dave Checketts, courted
Phil Jackson. Sprewell was still coming off of the bench until the
Eastern Conference finals, and his lawyer was openly threatening to
move his client out of New York if he was not going to be in the
starting five.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Knicks somehow overcame all of that, as well as a
season-ending injury to Patrick Ewing, to advance to the NBA
finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be productive as a team you have to stick together,''
Houston said. ``You can't start pointing fingers. That's one thing
we've always been able to do, is make sure everybody is on the same
page. You look at yourself in the mirror and see if you're doing
your job correctly and then you go about your business.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons we haven't gotten down on each
other, haven't gotten down on Jeff, because we realize that we have
to just go out and do our jobs. We can't blame each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is when we're here together as a team, we're
together. We're all focused on one goal and that's winning. Guys
may go home and tell their wives something different. I don't know
and I really don't care. The difference is, when we're here
together or when we're on a plane, when we're together we're
family. We're brothers. That's what it has to be in order for you
to win the game.''

DOCTORS SUE YALE, SAYING COST CUTS HURT PATIENTS
</HEADLINE>
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Three longtime physicians have accused Yale
University's School of Medicine of implementing policies that
endangered the lives of patients, and then punishing the doctors
when they complained.
</P>
<P>
   The university denies the claims, which are contained in a
lawsuit the doctors filed against Yale in January. The claim
focuses on how doctors in the school's diagnostic radiology
department have been treating patients at Yale-New Haven Medical
Center, the teaching hospital for the medical school. It takes
specific aim at the department's chairman, who the suit says
implemented measures, as early as 1995, that saved the school money
but carried ``unacceptable patient-care and safety consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   When the doctors complained to the radiology department, they
said in the suit, the chairman retaliated by cutting their
salaries, disrupting their sabbaticals and disparaging them to
executives at other medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients have suffered,'' said one of the plaintiffs, Dr.
Morton Burrell, a professor of radiology who has been on the
school's faculty for 27 years. ``We chose to speak out about wrongs
that are going on all around us,'' he said, calling the suit a
defense of academic freedom. ``They put their foot on our
throats.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the university, Lawrence J. Haas, said the
suit's claims were baseless and that the medical school's policies,
which he refused to discuss, put no patients in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked into all of these allegations, we took them quite
seriously, and we devoted extensive resources to investigating
them,'' including hiring outside medical experts, Haas said. ``We
found no irregularities. We have been quite mystified that this
lawsuit was even filed. The facts don't support what they said.''
</P>
<P>
   A judge is expected to soon start hearing the case, which is
steeped in leaden medical language and the intricacies of the
federal Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways this is a very simple story; in other ways, it is
extremely complicated,'' said Dr. Robert Smith, 39, one of the
plaintiffs, who has left Yale for Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   The third plaintiff is Dr. Arthur Rosenfield, an author of two
books on radiology, who has taught at Yale since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Yale has not filed an answer to the suit, and Haas declined to
discuss the doctors or their claims before the university
responded. But in a five-page memorandum to the doctors dated Feb.
1, the university's vice president and general counsel, Dorothy K.
Robinson, dismissed many of the suit's charges and warned the
doctors that if they repeated them out of court, the university
might take legal action against them.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, the suit charges, the chairman of Yale's
radiology department, Dr. Bruce L. McClennan, directed doctors to
sign a backlog of radiology studies, some as old as two years, on
Yale-New Haven patients whom the doctors had never treated. Shortly
after that, the suit says, McClennan began ordering residents _
doctors with less than four years of experience _ to examine X-rays
of emergency room patients, which the suit contends is unethical
and a violation of Medicare laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``As part of these cost-cutting measures, a lot of people on
staff, including myself, felt they went way too far,'' Smith said
in an interview. ``This is Yale University, this isn't some little,
tiny practice place. We felt there were many other ways to go about
saving money than severely compromising patient care.''
</P>
<P>
   McClennan did not respond to several telephone calls and e-mail
messages seeking comment. But in her memorandum, sent nearly a
month after the three doctors filed their lawsuit, Robinson said
there had been no orders to sign unseen radiology reports.
</P>
<P>
   Attending physicians did, in fact, maintain control of patient
diagnoses made by less-experienced doctors, said Robinson's
memorandum, which was provided to The New York Times by Burrell,
who is 58. ``Consequently, we believe that patient care was not
compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's memorandum speculated that unusually ``heated''
e-mail exchanges between Burrell and a supervisor may have led to a
misunderstanding of some of the department's new rules.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit's most serious points, however, center on charges
that the policies caused ``untrained people'' in the department to
misread CT scans of patients. In September 1998, for example, the
doctors charge, one unqualified doctor mistakenly identified a
brain hemorrhage in a patient who did not have one, and failed to
diagnose such a hemorrhage in another patient.
</P>
<P>
   After Smith's and Burrell's continual complaints about these and
other policies, the suit charges, Yale responded by cutting their
salaries, ``saying some extremely bad things about'' Smith, issuing
threats to Burrell and delaying Rosenfield's yearlong sabbatical by
five months.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 1998 memorandum announcing a 5 percent pay cut for
Smith, to $158,550 a year, McClennan criticized his ``consistently
adversarial positions and attitudes'' and ``reluctance to cooperate
in the evolutionary process of change.'' The memorandum, provided
to The Times by Smith, urged him to consider the ``abruptly altered
pressures on the hospital, the university and, in fact, the
community of medicine,'' and to ``refrain from your critical public
and private activism.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Smith's salary was cut to $135,646, the suit said,
and Burrell was demoted and told that his friends would suffer if
he did not amend his ways.
</P>
<P>
   After meetings with the Yale University president, Richard C.
Levin, the university began an investigation, according to the
lawsuit, that found nothing wrong. Haas said the university also
brought in outside doctors to review the charges and found no basis
for the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The university believes the suit is primarily ``an employment
complaint,'' rather than a patient care or freedom of speech issue,
Haas said. ``This lawsuit drags in a lot of unsupported and
unfounded allegations about patient care.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Neitlich, who spent eight years in the radiology
department before leaving in January 1998, said he understood why
his former colleagues were upset. ``They feel with a large staff at
an academic hospital, you shouldn't be running it as a community
hospital,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the three doctors, who have sent dozens of e-mail
messages and letters to Yale executives, were known to be extremely
persistent in their criticisms. ``I think Bruce found that very
difficult to deal with,'' Neitlich said, referring to McClennan.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Yale lawyers, who tried unsuccessfully on
Feb. 9 to block public access to the complaint the doctors filed,
submitted a request to Judge Michael Sheldon of Superior Court to
order the doctors to pare down their suit to make resolving it
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon has not yet set a hearing date on that request.

ATP WEIGHS THE EFFECTS OF ITS NEW MARITAL VOWS
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's not easy for three to get married,'' said Patrice
Dominguez, the co-director of last week's men's tennis tournament
in Monte Carlo, Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not, but that is precisely what has happened in
Dominguez's sport. There is the ATP Tour, which represents the male
players. There are the tour's nine most prestigious non-Grand Slam
tournaments, including Monte Carlo, which used to be called the
Super 9 and are now known as the Tennis Masters Series. There is
also ISL Worldwide, the company that paid $1.2 billion for the
exclusive rights to market and profit from the Masters Series for
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sort of alphabet soup that is becoming a common dish
in contemporary sport, and though it is unfair to judge the quality
of a bouillabaisse until the ingredients have had the proper time
to stew, there is already some cause for hovering nervously over
the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the repackaged men's tour is supposed to guarantee
that all of the world's top players compete in each of the main
events, many of the game's big attractions were missing in Monte
Carlo because of aching bodies or other priorities, including Pete
Sampras, Andre Agassi, Patrick Rafter, Lleyton Hewitt and Nicolas
Kiefer. Despite bold predictions, there is also the lack, for the
moment, of a singular look for the nine series events: a uniform
identity that tells the spectator that the tournaments are linked
and special, if not nearly as special as the four Grand Slam
events.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the television companies to whom ISL has sold the
rights to the Masters Series in the bulk of western Europe and
Japan are satellite and cable broadcasters with small subscriber
bases. OnDigital, which holds the rights in Britain, has
approximately 650,000 subscribers. Pathe Sport in France does not
reach a great many more.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Renner, the director of ISL's tennis division, concurs
that this is not ideal. ``You look at the scope of the events we
work with, like the Olympics and the World Cup, and the reason they
are as big as they are is their reach, which is mostly on
terrestrial television,'' Renner said. ``Certainly if we want to
make tennis one of the top two or three sports in the world, we
have to do that. With most of the world, we've done a good job, but
in Europe, we've had some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Germany's traditional ratings busters, Boris
Becker and Steffi Graf, have retired is certainly a factor. ``It's
like coming to a big house the day after a big party,'' Renner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would we like broader coverage to start with? Yes,'' he added.
``But if you look at the Premier League six years ago when it
signed its deal with BSkyB instead of the BBC, everyone said it was
the death of soccer in England. It turned out to be very good. Why?
I think it's because government stations like the BBC don't have
the financial motivation to make the most out of a sport and to lay
down the money to get more spectators. OnDigital and Pathe, for
example, do have quality, and they are enthusiastic about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the two-year agreements the tournaments
signed do not give them much time to grow. Meanwhile, tennis runs
the risk of losing more market share and momentum in its
traditional stronghold and of confusing and frustrating an audience
that now has much greater access to lower-case events like this
week's stop in Barcelona through the pan-European channel Eurosport
than to the more important Masters Series. Eurosport, which now has
the rights to the top-tier women's events, could have had the whole
men's package but negotiations with ISL broke down.
</P>
<P>
   There were 14 cameras tracking Sunday's soggy final in Monte
Carlo in which Cedric Pioline beat Dominik Hrbaty. Moreover, the
television deals ISL signed with ESPN and Fox in the United States,
with one of the principal terrestrial networks in Gustavo Kuerten's
Brazil and, intriguingly, with a group of channels in China
guarantee more universal coverage in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that China could even have a Masters Series event
by 2001. The Stuttgart indoor tournament is for sale, and Hong Kong
is the most promising prospective buyer.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Masters Series is only in Europe and North America.
Taking it to Asia and South America would edge tennis closer to the
global Formula One model in auto racing that tennis administrators
openly envy. The downside is that cars don't get jet-lagged and
world weary, but tennis players do, and an obligatory trip to Asia
in November would only exacerbate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Less is truly more in sports. And though the ATP Tour has
simplified its ranking system and made every Grand Slam and Masters
Series event count on the computer, players can still count their
five next best results. And some of the ATP's scheduling is
dubious, for instance, cramming the three Masters Series clay-court
events (Monte Carlo, Rome and Hamburg) into five weeks before the
French Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least give a chance to rest a bit, otherwise you just burn
out,'' said Alex Corretja of Spain, who is back in form after
burning out last year.

 &HT;    GAYS HOLD MASS ``WEDDING''
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lynn Gallagher and Liz Stanley came from
Alpharetta, Ga., to stand before the Lincoln Memorial on this sunny
Saturday and exchange vows of love and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been together for a year,'' said Gallagher. ``And I
wanted to make a public statement that we're going to be together
for the rest of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I wanted to let those people across the street know that
we don't need their permission to love who we love,'' said Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Those dozen or so people across the street were anti-gay
protesters who carried a wooden cross and placards warning ``Repent
or Perish.'' But they failed to deflate the buoyance and defiance
of the more than 1,000 couples who were joined in same-sex union.
</P>
<P>
   The mass ``wedding'' was not legally recognized, of course,
since only Vermont has granted marriage-like rights to homosexual
couples. But the Rev. Troy Perry, the Universal Federation of
Metropolitan Community Churches minister who performed the
ceremony, told the couples to take heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand here knowing that love makes a family -- nothing
more, nothing less,'' said Perry.
</P>
<P>
   The staged wedding was among scores of activities arranged
around Sunday's Millennium March on Washington for Equality.
Although some gay rights groups are boycotting the event, the
streets of nation's capital were crowded on Saturday with activists
and supporters who did respond to the call for a national
mobilization.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said the march is needed to galvanize a massive gay
and lesbian turn-out in the November elections and to energize a
new generation of their movement. About 300,000 participants are
expected for the Sunday parade and rally.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth national gathering of homosexual rights
groups in the past two decades and comes at a time of both triumphs
and setbacks. Last week, Vermont enacted its law giving legal
rights to homosexual couples and President Clinton urged Congress
to pass a Hate Crimes Prevention Act protecting gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   However, California voters recently approved a referendum
denying marital rights to homosexual couples. The Supreme Court
will decide by July whether the Boy Scouts can bar a gay man from
serving as a troop leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have attained a certain level of visibility. But visibility
isn't civil rights,'' said Dianne Hardy-Garcia, the Texas lobbyist
for lesbian and gay rights who is serving as executive director of
the march.
</P>
<P>
   Especially outside of cities, activists said, homophobia has not
been cured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is okay if you stay within the Perimeter,'' said
Nicole Wilson, who came to the march from Georgia. The Perimeter is
a road that rings Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't feel that it's as accepted outside the
Perimeter,'' said Ginny Perrine, another Georgian.
</P>
<P>
   At the mock wedding, the mood was festive as couples crowded the
steps between the Lincoln Memorial and reflecting pool. Attire was
eclectic. Outfits included wedding gowns and bouquets and tuxedoes
and T-shirts and black leather and plaid Bermuda shorts. One
lesbian couple wore identical baseball caps labeled ``Bride.'' A
preppy gay couple wore khakis, white shirts with button-downed
collars and pastel ties.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Street and Rob Lett, from Richmond, Va., wore matching
tuxedoes with turquoise vests and invited a dozen friends to share
the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been together almost 11 years but we had never done
anything like this before,'' said Street. ``We thought it would be
a fun thing to do and exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good opportunity to share our relationship with folks
we love,'' said Lett.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Jett and Rich Greene had exchanged rings over a decade ago on
their fifth anniversary together. But they came from the Atlanta
suburbs to join this ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a house, a dog, wonderful neighbors. For 16 years,
we've been a family,'' said Jett. ``We wanted to declare that
commitment. Rich is the miracle in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to legally marry them, they noted, DeKalb County
willingly accepts their property tax payments.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Mullins and Terri Funderburk said they came from
Rossville, Ga., to show their commitment to each other and the
cause of gay and lesbian rights.
</P>
<P>
   If Georgia ever recognizes same-sex marriages, said Mullins,
``we'll be the first in line.''
</P>
<P>
   David Newton and Eduardo Andrade of Decatur, Ga., exchanged
rings at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show the world that we're a couple and that we
plan to stay together,'' said Andrade.
</P>
<P>
   Other events on Saturday included a concert starring Garth
Brooks, Melissa Ethridge, k.d. lang and the Pet Shop Boys and the
unveiling of new panels to the AIDS memorial quilt on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   However, the march has been criticized by some groups within the
gay rights movement who charge that there was not enough grassroots
involvement or outreach to people of color.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers ``alienated many constituencies, ... replacing
democracy and accountability with Hollywood celebrities and
back-room dealing,'' said William Dobbs, a spokesman for a
coalition of activists opposed to the march.
</P>
<P>
   ``The march's purpose, insensitive elitism, is not our purpose.
Our purpose will not be advanced by the Millennium March on
Washington,'' Ed Brown, co-chairman of the National Association of
Black and White Men Together, told the Associated Press.

THE MICROSOFT CASE: 4 EXPERTS GIVE THEIR VIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This text consists of the responses of four antitrust experts
to the government's request that Microsoft Corp. be broken into two
parts.)  
(With MICROSOFT-ASSESS, MICROSOFT-CONSUMERS) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEVEN C. SALOP, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY
</P>
<P>
   Salop, a professor of law and economics at the Georgetown
University Law Center, said the proposed remedies were, if
anything, too modest. ``I understand why the government chose this
as the best compromise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Salop said the government had taken into account concern about
severely disrupting the lives of Microsoft employees. It had also
accommodated widely expressed fears that one remedy he and many
other experts favored _ splitting the Windows operating business
into three competing enterprises _ would lead to incompatible forms
of Windows, which could disrupt a world where 90 percent of all
personal computers are sold with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But Salop said the fears of fragmentation were exaggerated.
Windows companies would have a strong incentive to keep the core
programs identical to run existing software. Marginal differences
would develop with new versions, but they would not affect most
users, he said, and computer users could be counted on to push hard
for programs to preserve compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with simply splitting Microsoft into two companies
is that there is a strong chance they would operate with a ``tacit
nonaggression pact,'' Salop said. At the very least, the Internet
and browser operations should also be split off, he said. The
Internet-centered Microsoft offspring would have a much different
business orientation, he said, and tacit collusion would be much
less likely with Microsoft in three pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Salop served as a Federal Trade Commission consultant when that
agency investigated Microsoft, and helped the Justice Department
fashion a consent decree in its first action against Microsoft. He
said he was convinced that any plan to leave Microsoft intact and
rely only on restrictions on behavior would fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conduct remedies are particularly difficult to enforce against
a company bent on exploiting any loopholes,'' he said, adding that
Microsoft's continued insistence that it had done nothing wrong
made it clear the government could expect little cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Salop said that while he understood the government's goals in
proposing three years of behavioral restraints if Microsoft is
split up and 10 years of such restrictions if it is not, it made
more sense to have them open-ended ``until a competitive
environment is achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT E. LITAN, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION
</P>
<P>
   Litan, vice president and director of the Economic Studies
Program at the Brookings Institution, supervised the government's
first antitrust investigation of Microsoft as deputy assistant
attorney general in the Justice Department's antitrust division
from September 1993 until March 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``This moves the ball across the 50-yard line toward the goal,
but it doesn't get there,'' Litan said. The proposal to split the
company is far better than relying only on conduct restrictions,
Litan said. But the government has no guarantee that after a split
the applications half of Microsoft would take crucial steps that
today's Microsoft has avoided, like developing business software
for the Linux operating system that competes with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a riverboat gamble,'' Litan said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the operating systems side would maintain its monopoly
over Windows and the company's current goal of extending the
operating system from the desktop environment it dominates into the
world of servers and Internet devices _ ``Window for the world,''
as Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, calls the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they pull it off,'' Litan said, ``you would end up with an
even stronger, more durable monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD B. MCKENZIE, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT IRVINE
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie, a professor at Irvine's graduate school of management,
sees the request that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson break Microsoft
into two parts as a policy blunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This remedy will likely do what antitrust is not supposed to
do: help competitors and not consumers,'' the 58-year-old economist
said. The best indication that the breakup would not benefit
consumers, McKenzie said, is that it is the remedy favored by
Microsoft's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want Microsoft to be hobbled so it will not compete as
aggressively against them,'' McKenzie said. ``The effect will
likely be to keep prices higher than they would be otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Trust on Trial: How the Microsoft Case is
Reframing the Rules of Competition'' (Perseus Books), McKenzie, who
said he had no financial stake in Microsoft, argues that the
antitrust case stems from Microsoft's introduction of its Windows
NT operating system in the early 1990s. The more powerful operating
system meant Microsoft was moving beyond desktop personal computer
operating systems and into the lucrative market for software that
runs on bigger computers on which corporate networks are built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to mid-1993, the rivals were perfectly happy to let
Microsoft dominate the desktop,'' McKenzie said. ``But these other
companies got very concerned that Microsoft was invading their
remaining domain.''
</P>
<P>
   While McKenzie opposes breaking Microsoft up, he described some
of the restrictions on conduct that have been proposed as
``doable.'' His favored minimal remedy would be to require
Microsoft to offer two versions of Windows, one with Internet
browsing software and one without at a discounted price.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE L. PRIEST, YALE UNIVERSITY
</P>
<P>
   Priest, a professor at Yale Law School, said the proposal to
split Microsoft's operating system business from all of its
applications software, Internet and other enterprises went ``far
beyond'' the issues actually litigated, which focused on
Microsoft's behavior in the market for Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Some narrow remedies limiting how Microsoft marketed or licensed
some products might be sustainable on appeal, he said, but there is
far too little evidence to support breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Jackson orders extensive hearings that produce evidence
that splitting the company would increase competition, the
government's plan is no more than a ``wild guess,'' Priest said.
</P>
<P>
   Priest said his guess is that such hearings might not produce
support for the government's proposal. ``It's not obvious that a
duopoly would be any better for competition than a monopoly in this
case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Priest said he had accepted an invitation from Microsoft to
critique Jackson's opinions but had yet to produce or be paid for
such work. While criticizing the proposed remedies, he expressed
sympathy for the government's predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important symbolically to go after monopolists,'' Priest
said, noting that society benefits from believing that no company
can be so big it is beyond the law. But fashioning justifiable and
effective remedies has never been easy. ``There has always been
greater faith than merited in the ability of antitrust laws to
affect monopolization,'' he said.

 &HT;    CAUTION URGED ON MICROSOFT BREAKUP
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Both Microsoft's critics and defenders want the judge
to take his time before agreeing to the government's plan to cleave
the software giant in two.
</P>
<P>
   But they differ sharply how the breakup proposal made on Friday
by the Justice Department and 17 states would impact one of the
most dynamic sectors of the nation's economy. Nor do they agree on
the potential impact on investors, who have seen Microsoft's stock
lose one-third of its value in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And some antitrust figures who approve of U.S. District Court
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's verdict on April 3 that Microsoft
is a predatory monopolist also feel the remedies the government
wants, which include slapping on regulatory handcuffs until the
breakup takes hold, go too far while others feel they don't go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The far-reaching proposal, which has infuriated top Microsoft
executives, calls for one company to own only the Windows operating
system. The other would market such Microsoft applications as Word
and Excel while also laying claim to the Internet Explorer browser,
the chief issue that caused the landmark suit to be filed two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies -- only one would be permitted to retain the
Microsoft named -- would be barred from merging for another 10
years. The actual terms of the corporate divorce would written by
Microsoft itself, subject to review by the government and the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Neukom, Microsoft's chief counsel, who sat at the defense
table throughout the 77-day trial, contends that the current
timetable set by Jackson to move the case forward needs to be
revised.
</P>
<P>
   Says Neukom: ``The government's unprecedented and extreme remedy
proposals will require a significant expansion of the remedy
process currently contemplated by Judge Jackson's order. Even the
government will have to agree that an American company deserves
more than 12 days to respond to a government proposal to tear apart
a $400 billion company.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom argues that ``the government's excessive demands will
require months of discovery and evidentiary hearings'' and added
that the government's proposals ``simply delay the ultimate
resolution of this case'' because ``all parties recognize this case
(ultimately) will be decided by the appellate courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Two figures in the case whom Neukom eagerly wants to depose are
Robert Greenhill and Jeffrey Williams, the chief executive and the
managing director of Greenhill &AMP; co., an investment advisory firm
that served as a consultant to the justice department in devising
the breakup formula.
</P>
<P>
   In a supporting brief filed with the court, the Wall Street
analysts wrote that the breakup ``will not result in a material
decrease in (Microsoft's) market value over the intermediate to
longer-term.'' Under the right conditions, they said, it could even
be ``positive.''
</P>
<P>
   That view upsets Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, who told Wall
Street analysts in a conference call Friday night: ``Microsoft will
be greatly damaged by this kind of split. No one should think that
shareholder value would be preserved with this kind of activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates also told the analysts that ``Microsoft could never have
developed Windows under these rules ... because without the great
work of the Office team and the Windows team it never would have
come together.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an admission that may come to haunt Microsoft's co-founder
since, in the past, the company has always strenuously maintained
that there exists ``a Chinese Wall'' between the two sets of
programmers that has never been breached.
</P>
<P>
   Software competitors have often complained that Office
developers held an inside track to vital parts of the Windows code,
a charge that the Microsoft brass in the past have vigorously
denied. The Justice Department chose not to make the applications
suite part of the case, although the original complaint filed by
the state attorneys general did so.
</P>
<P>
   Even as an embattled Microsoft seeks to extend the remedy phase
of the trial, a go-slow signal to Jackson was also flashed by
Robert Litan, a former Justice official involved in an earlier
phase of Microsoft's duel with the government who directs economic
studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Litan favors ``breaking up the Windows monopoly itself, perhaps
in three equal-sized pieces, each with the same intellectual
property to the Windows source code.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the monopoly gone,'' he says, ``there would be no need
for continued judicial supervision, either of the new Windows
competitors or the rest of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he adds, ``the claim that Microsoft's monopoly is so
important to the U.S. economy is a little hard to square with the
company's claims that technology is moving so fast as to render any
severe sanction overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with three other well-known economists, Litan has
submitted a brief to Jackson that reads in part: ``We believe that,
because the underlying remedy issues are so complex, the key
concern is the quality of the assessment rather than the speed of
the resolution. Hence, a careful study and assessment of
alternatives should not be sacrificed in the rush to resolve
uncertainties surrounding the outcome of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio and Illinois, two of the 19 states that are parties to the
case, declined to go along with the government's formula. Ohio
Attorney General Betty Montgomery said: ``A reorganization could be
difficult to undo, and its effects would be difficult to predict.''

 &HT;    CAUTION URGED ON MICROSOFT BREAKUP
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Both Microsoft's critics and defenders want the judge
to take his time before agreeing to the government's plan to cleave
the software giant in two.
</P>
<P>
   But they differ sharply how the breakup proposal made on Friday
by the Justice Department and 17 states would impact one of the
most dynamic sectors of the nation's economy. Nor do they agree on
the potential impact on investors, who have seen Microsoft's stock
lose one-third of its value in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And some antitrust figures who approve of U.S. District Court
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's verdict on April 3 that Microsoft
is a predatory monopolist also feel the remedies the government
wants, which include slapping on regulatory handcuffs until the
breakup takes hold, go too far while others feel they don't go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The far-reaching proposal, which has infuriated top Microsoft
executives, calls for one company to own only the Windows operating
system. The other would market such Microsoft applications as Word
and Excel while also laying claim to the Internet Explorer browser,
the chief issue that caused the landmark suit to be filed two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies -- only one would be permitted to retain the
Microsoft named -- would be barred from merging for another 10
years. The actual terms of the corporate divorce would written by
Microsoft itself, subject to review by the government and the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Neukom, Microsoft's chief counsel, who sat at the defense
table throughout the 77-day trial, contends that the current
timetable set by Jackson to move the case forward needs to be
revised.
</P>
<P>
   Says Neukom: ``The government's unprecedented and extreme remedy
proposals will require a significant expansion of the remedy
process currently contemplated by Judge Jackson's order. Even the
government will have to agree that an American company deserves
more than 12 days to respond to a government proposal to tear apart
a $400 billion company.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom argues that ``the government's excessive demands will
require months of discovery and evidentiary hearings'' and added
that the government's proposals ``simply delay the ultimate
resolution of this case'' because ``all parties recognize this case
(ultimately) will be decided by the appellate courts.''
</P>

GORE GIVES HARSH APPRAISAL OF BUSH IN SCHEDULED SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story is an added starter on the front page.) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a foreign policy speech to be delivered on
Sunday, Vice President Al Gore gives one of his harshest
assessments to date of Gov. George W. Bush, saying his Republican
rival is stuck in a Cold War time warp, has serious gaps in his
experience and knowledge and would rely on right-wing advisers for
guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore faults Bush for proposing to ``skip'' a generation of
military weapons while emphasizing research into more advanced
ones, leaving the United States unprepared for battlefields of the
next two or three decades, and for wanting to deploy an implausible
``Star Wars'' system.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president casts the Texas governor as unrealistic and
irresponsible for regarding Russia and China as enemies of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush dangerously fixates on the Cold War past when
speaking of the use of force,'' Gore says in prepared remarks that
were provided by his staff the day before they were to be delivered
in Boston. ``Stuck in a Cold War mindset, Governor Bush continues
to view Russia and China primarily as present or future enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore presents himself as more forward thinking _
constructing a kind of Gore doctrine that he calls ``forward
engagement,'' which essentially is to nip problems in the bud
rather than let them swell into crises. He says he views Russia and
China not as enemies but as ``vital partners.'' And he goes on to
give his most staunch support to date for moving China into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to assume that these gaps in Governor Bush's foreign
policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and
inveterate antipathies of his party _ the right-wing, partisan
isolationism of the Republican congressional leadership,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president links Bush with Sen. Jesse Helms, the
conservative Republican from North Carolina who heads the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee. Helms has said he will block any new
arms control agreements until a new president is inaugurated,
scuttling any hope President Clinton might have of reaching an arms
control pact with Russia, which he is to visit in June.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding China, Gore says, ``It is wrong to isolate and
demonize China, to build a wall when we need to build a bridge,''
speaking here less to Bush, who also supports open trade with
China, than to his own backers in organized labor, who vehemently
oppose such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore does not articulate any departures from his well-known
world view that he supports a strong military and would act
aggressively toward rogue nations. And he does not separate himself
from any Clinton administration foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president does carry forward the administration's
approach of elevating new issues _ the economy, health and the
environment _ to the top of the international agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a new security agenda for the global age based on
forward engagement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has increasingly criticized the Clinton
administration's foreign policy as being devoid of strategic vision
and characterized by case-by-case responses to crises. For that
reason, perhaps, Gore does not mention Clinton's name once in his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore does not seize the opportunity, in what his staff says
is a major foreign policy address, to lay out a foreign policy
agenda that diverges from the main outlines of the Clinton
administration's policies. The speech contains no specific new
foreign policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster his standing as a Democrat with strong defense views,
Gore notes that he pushed for a new generation of missiles during
his years in the Senate and was one of the few Democrats to break
with the party and vote in favor of going to war against Saddam
Hussein in 1991 after Saddam's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's political intentions are clear. The speech is one more
block that Gore is using to build his case that Bush is too
unprepared, naive and reckless to be president, and that these
failures appear perilous when they are placed against a backdrop of
an increasingly complex world.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore portrays himself as far more worldly wise than
the governor, noting that he served in Vietnam, albeit as a
journalist, a conflict that ``I witnessed with my own eyes.'' Bush
served in the Texas Air National Guard at the time. The vice
president also reminds his audience, the International Press
Institute, that he has always been more hawkish than his fellow
Democrats on foreign policy matters, notably by supporting the use
of force against Saddam and in pressing for a strong national
defense and a new generation of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore accuses the Republican leaders of Congress of a blend of
isolationism and obstructionism.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have refused to adequately fund our diplomatic and
international development efforts, from promoting peace in the
Middle East to fighting drugs in South America,'' he says. ``They
have held our contributions to the United Nations hostage to their
own political agenda for years. They have repeatedly tried to
sabotage this administration's programs even in places like Bosnia
and Kosovo where what is needed is steadiness and continuity of
purpose. They have made themselves the sworn enemies of a worldwide
effort to deal with the global environment.''
</P>
<P>
   And he lambasts Bush for having ``joined with the isolationist,
partisan Republican majority in Congress in opposing the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore essentially calls for an Americanization of the world
economy, saying America has a vital interest in promoting its own
economic prosperity throughout the world, an idea that could prompt
resentment in regions that have no desire to adapt to the free
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to promote the stable flow of investment around the
world,'' he says, although he does not describe a mechanism for
doing that within a free market system, where investors have as
much right to pull their money out as they have to put it in.
</P>
<P>
   His critique of Bush is that he is so focused on Cold War
thinking that he ignores the economic opportunities to be had.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appears to be relying on the same foreign policy advisers
used by his father, former President Bush. Without naming her, Gore
criticizes ideas put forward by Condoleezza Rice, a senior national
security adviser to President Bush and the foreign policy
coordinator for Gov. Bush.

GIULIANI WOOS INDEPENDENCE PARTY, SEEKING HELP IN REACHING OUT TO
BLACKS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Will be updated with Clinton's comments.) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y. _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani eagerly asked the
fractious Independence Party to endorse him for U.S. Senate here
Saturday, and added that the group might help him reach out to
black voters.
</P>
<P>
   When Lenora Fulani, a leader of the left-wing New Alliance Party
who controls a faction of the party, asked the mayor if the
Independence Party could help him with black voters who have been
furious over his response to a series of police shootings, Giuliani
replied, ``I hadn't thought of it that way. The answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that his problems with black New Yorkers were perhaps
because of his own ``inadequacies as a public communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, also was to speak
to the Independence Party on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the mayor's second day of campaigning since announcing he
has prostate cancer. For now, the diagnosis seems to have given
Giuliani a new focus and an enthusiasm for a race that he had been
treating sometimes half-heartedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm even thinking maybe I can campaign from a hospital,''
Giuliani told an enthusiastic group of Erie County Republicans at a
breakfast meeting at Chef's restaurant in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani recounted how a reporter had asked him the night before
in Saratoga Springs about the support he had been receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say I'm doing this for sympathy,'' Giuliani said,
laughing. ``I said, `OK, right. Well then I really am ready for the
loony bin.'''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not say Saturday that he would definitely stay in
the race for Senate, but his advisers described him as a ``changed
man'' after he received the news on Friday that the cancer was
contained to his prostate and had not spread. Giuliani did not know
that on Thursday when he held a news conference to disclose the
cancer diagnosis. Advisers also described him as unusually buoyant,
and said that on the plane to Buffalo, the mayor talked about
theology, and inquired about their own well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party, the New York affiliate of the national
Reform Party started by Ross Perot, is potentially important on the
ballot and could choose its candidate for Senate by early June. In
1998, Charles Schumer received more than 100,000 votes on the line
in his winning Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The party is in a state of confusion, however, since a judge
this month removed its chairman, Frank McKay, and reinstalled Jack
R. Essenberg. The third-largest party in the state, the party is
leaning toward endorsing Pat Buchanan for president, whom Giuliani
once called anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Giuliani said he had ``problems'' with Buchanan on
the Reform Party ticket. Saturday, the mayor would only say that he
``disagreed'' with Buchanan and that he supported his right to be
on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Third-party endorsements are particularly critical in this
year's Senate race in New York, because the race is expected to be
extremely close and the number of undecided voters is small.
Republicans typically also seek the state's Conservative Party
endorsement, but Giuliani and that party's chairman, Michael Long,
have been at odds for months. Giuliani said he spoke to Long two
days ago, but added that the conversation was personal, and he
would not say whether he had asked Long for his support.

 &HT;    Where the elite compete
 &HT;    By Tinah Saunders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ga. _ Two camouflage-clad Army Rangers crouched low in
the leafy undergrowth, trying to spot the sniper firing on them.
Suddenly, one stood and hurled a smoke bomb into the trees. Amid
the acrid green smoke, both raced forward, shooting as they ran.
</P>
<P>
   And reached the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   They had survived the fire of Cpl. Jorge Nunez, sniper
extraordinaire and one of the many challenges facing them in the
18th annual David E. Grange Jr. Best Ranger Competition, being held
this weekend at Fort Benning.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for 60 consecutive hours, the best of the Army's elite
commandos compete for little more than bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   Second Lt. Marcus Messerschmitt was competing for the third
time. He and buddy Second Lt. Fred Ahern were in third place
Saturday, hard on the heels of their competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time, I did it to see if I could, the second time,
because I thought I could have won, and this time, I'm here to
win,'' Messerschmitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I won't do it again,'' added Messerschmitt, 29. ``I'm
getting too old.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, only 27 two-man teams out of the original
45 that started Friday remained to continue the event. A grueling
19-mile foot march with full equipment and 60-pound rucksacks had
taken its toll. And one team had voluntarily dropped out so one of
its members could be at his wife's side for the birth of their
10-pound baby boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our priorities straight,'' said Col. Sam Rollinson.
</P>
<P>
   The other teams, however, had moved on with little more than a
catnap between competitions. There was the prusik climb, a
hand-over-hand rope ascent to the top of a 60-foot tower, followed
by a rappelling descent down the other side. The time to beat was
33 seconds. No one was close.
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of the field, under the trees, camouflage netting
sheltered exhausted teams awaiting the next competition.
Red-shirted medics tended the few injured. The most prevalent
complaint was blistered feet.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, after finishing the grenade toss, tying
intricate knots, assembling a myriad of weapons and completing the
bayonet assault course, the teams were scheduled to make their way
across 18 to 27 miles of wooded terrain, guided only by a map and
compass.
</P>
<P>
   At least one team was confident that it could not only complete
the night land navigation course, but make up the points it needed
to come from behind and win the Best Ranger title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been eating Motrin like candy. I'm hoping that will help
the pain in my shoulders and neck,'' said the confident
Messerschmitt.
</P>
<P>
   Strategy is at least 45 percent of what it takes to win, said
Capt. Michael Trembley, a Ranger instructor. The other 50 percent
is physical and mental skills and experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pick up the little things, like which events score
highest and where to put their focus and how to pace themselves,''
said Trembley.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who devise the competition are constantly throwing
surprises into the mix. ``Last night they had to put on their gas
masks during the march. That was a first. It makes it harder to
breathe and it's hot, and if you've packed it at the bottom of your
rucksack, you lose time digging it out,'' said Monica Manganaro, a
Fort Benning spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   For those teams that lasted through Saturday night, there's more
to come today, including an obstacle course, a swim that begins
with competitors dropped with full pack from a helicopter and a
2.3-mile buddy run.

SUDDENLY, MRS. CLINTON IS EVERYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-INDEPENDENCE-PARTY) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There can be little doubt about it. Hillary Rodham
Clinton is getting around the state.
</P>
<P>
   In just the last week, Clinton visited a dairy farm in Wyoming
County, N.Y., talking about agriculture policy to the strains of
mooing cows in the background. She spoke to a group of Democrats at
a luncheon in Penn Yan, a town of about 3,000 in the Finger Lakes
region, telling them about her vision of the upstate economy and
confessing her first experience hunting ducks. And she stood on the
stage at Alfred University, in Allegany County, to be inducted into
Omicron Delta Kappa, a national leadership honor society.
</P>
<P>
   For those who might have questioned how fully or comfortably the
first lady of the United States would immerse herself in the
minutiae of a statewide Senate campaign, the answer can be found in
the schedule Clinton has been keeping over the last few weeks.
Indeed, she seems to be in every corner of New York, from hamlets
to large cities.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she left an appearance at a high school in Watkins
Glen, in Schuyler County, on Thursday, Clinton had visited 58 of
the state's 62 counties. And, in a point she underscored several
times last week, she has every intention of visiting the remaining
four counties in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's campaign schedule signals a significant shift
from her earlier forays into New York State politics, when her
events were carefully choreographed with little spontaneous
interchange between Clinton and voters.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Clinton is spending significantly more time
interacting with voters, taking time to shake hands, pose for
pictures, sign autographs and talk with people. For example, after
an hourlong, nationally televised town hall meeting in Buffalo last
week, Clinton spent nearly another hour taking more questions from
the audience and shaking hands.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insists that her campaign style is unchanged from the
early days of her ``listening tour,'' when she spoke to relatively
small groups and rarely plunged into crowds. ``I don't feel like
I'm doing anything differently,'' she said in an interview last
week. ``I thought I spent a lot of time back in the listening tour.
But I was trying to cover a lot of ground, so I didn't have,
perhaps, as much time in my schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing her campaign schedule, she said: ``I'm doing what I
said I would do when I started: I'm meeting as many New Yorkers as
I possibly can meet and going to every county. I'm going into a lot
of different settings to see where people live and work, and I'm
having an absolutely wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton seems less inclined to engage in regular
question-and-answer periods with the news media, unlike her
Republican rival, Rudolph Giuliani, who, as mayor of New York City,
typically conducts a news conference every day.
</P>
<P>
   Her schedule and campaign style seem intent on making voters
comfortable with the notion that a woman who has never held public
office and who, until recent months, had never even lived in the
state is nonetheless a fitting choice to be U.S. Senator. Moreover,
her frequent trips _ many from dawn to late into the night _ are
also intended to provide a sharp contrast to Giuliani, who has
largely remained in New York City during the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who revealed on Thursday that he has prostate cancer,
traveled this weekend to Buffalo, for a meeting of the Independence
Party, and to Saratoga Springs, for a Republican dinner. His
campaign aides suggest that Clinton is able to travel the state
freely since she is unencumbered by the responsibilities of running
a city _ or anything else for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, Clinton was at 57 percent in the polls,'' said
Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman for Giuliani's campaign. ``She
is now approaching going to every county in the state. It seems
that the more people see her, the less they like her, given her
rapid decline in poll numbers in the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   But a recent New York Times/CBS News poll showed Clinton was 8
points ahead of Giuliani overall and was even with him upstate.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which her numerous trips produce dividends at the
polls in November remains to be seen, of course. Many in the crowds
she attracts are undoubtedly motivated by the novelty of seeing the
wife of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty exciting,'' said Debra Almeter, who operates a
large dairy farm in Strykersville with her husband and went to see
Clinton at a campaign stop last week in Wyoming County. ``I'm not a
very political person. But how often does a first lady come out
here?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be a common reaction to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``No candidate ever, ever comes here. Ever. Ever,'' Barbara
Steinwachs said after Clinton's speech in Penn Yan. Steinwachs, an
independent training consultant and the Democratic Party chairwoman
in Yates County said: ``People are thrilled. And to have it to be
the first lady makes it even more thrilling. I think people are
impressed just that she came.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people who come to see Clinton _ particularly in
small communities in western New York _ are registered Republicans
who say they have no intention of voting for a Democratic
candidate. Yates County, for example, is considered territory where
Giuliani is likely to do well, with Republicans making up 56
percent of the registered voters and Democrats accounting for 24
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Clinton's strategy, her aides say, that by going to as
many cities as her schedule allows, as frequently as possible, she
will become a political figure that voters are increasingly
comfortable with. Visiting upstate communities and discussing the
details of, say, milk prices or high air fares, her aides suggest,
Clinton is likely to pick up slivers of support and chip away at
what is perceived to be Giuliani's political strength.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And it is clear that Clinton continues to elicit strong passions
from New Yorkers. On the road to Alfred University, last week, for
example, several huge banners were placed along the highway, saying
``Go Home Hillary'' and ``Stand By Your Man _ In Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, her very appearance on the stage in the
college auditorium produced wild cheers from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last week, Clinton spent time in the early morning
hours looking at the Middle Falls, a picturesque waterfall in
Letchworth State Park in Wyoming County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful,'' she said to an entourage of reporters
traveling with her. ``Have you ever seen this sight before?'' Most
of the reporters responded that they had not. ``Well, you travel
with me,'' she said, ``and you see New York.''

 &HT;    Friday is doomsday? Cosmic lineup
 &HT;    may trigger disaster, author says
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLIJAY, Ga. _ Richard Noone is a man ahead of his time, and his
time is coming, May 5, the day Noone has predicted the planets will
line up, Earth's poles will shift, continents will crack, buckle
and collide, and we will all have a very bad day.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Richard Noone mowing his lawn? Why is his house for
sale? Why is he fretting about the extra pounds he put on this
winter?
</P>
<P>
   It is a beautiful, cool, sunny Saturday afternoon at Noone's
4,000-square-foot brick and cedar hillside home in Ellijay. Sitting
on the back deck, Noone realizes he's gotten perhaps more than he
wished for.
</P>
<P>
   The stocky 56-year-old writer with a mane of gray-blond wavy
hair, a trimmed mustache, wire-rim glasses and a baritone voice
that cracks from so many interviews, is a captive of his own
prophetic title.
</P>
<P>
   His book, ``5/5/2000: Ice: The Ultimate Disaster'' (Crown, $16
paperback), which has sold more than 400,000 copies since its
publication in 1982, is a thoroughly researched, 390-page, roughly
1-pound monument to deduction, intuition, cosmic leaps and theories
that _ if deemed loopy by much of the world _ don't entirely
collapse under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   But, there's the matter of that title.
</P>
<P>
   Is he nuts?
</P>
<P>
   A reporter keeps asking him about it. Is he sure that on Friday
a continental shift will move him and his Georgia home to somewhere
like Costa Rica?
</P>
<P>
   Noone pauses, and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the first title was?'' he says. ```The Great
Pyramid: A Structural Analysis.' Boy, with a title like that, I
would have sold four books.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Noone became a prophet of doom. And, with doom looming,
lately a lot of people are asking Noone a lot of questions.
</P>
<P>
   The main one: Where did you get that cockamamie theory?
</P>
<P>
   THE GENESIS OF A THEORY
</P>
<P>
   It's a long story, and it doesn't get any shorter in Noone's
retelling.
</P>
<P>
   A high school graduate, Noone is smart, forthcoming, devoid of
pretense. But he's also bereft of degrees in any of the subjects _
astronomy, physics, geology, architecture, engineering _ his book
bestrides like Colossus.
</P>
<P>
   He attributes everything. Getting him to condense his story into
the kind of snappy paragraph Hollywood screenwriters use to sell
$100 million action flicks is a monument of research itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a simple question _ ``When was the first Ice Age?'' _ and,
15 minutes later, Noone somehow is talking about Giorgio de
Santillana and Hertha von Dechend and their obscure but insightful
book, ``Hamlet's Mill: An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the impatient interviewer, looking for a quick
sound bite, wishes Friday would hurry up.
</P>
<P>
   The story is not simple. But, in Hollywood _ which, by the way,
has not bought rights to the book _ they'd sum it up like this:
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta importer of wigs and jewelry, who years earlier had
developed a vague interest in ruins during a post-high school trip
to Mexico, reads a book on the Great Pyramid of Giza and, through
seven years of research, concludes the pyramid was the power plant
for an ancient technologically advanced Egyptian civilization that
was wiped out by a polar shift and whose astronomers predicted
another devastating polar shift on May 5, 2000, that will be set in
motion by the gravitational pull of a rare alignment of the sun,
moon and six planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me in high school that I'd be a writer,'' Noone
says, ``I would have told you you were crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Noone wrote the book in longhand on legal pads _ 750 pages _ and
shortly thereafter, not a few people in the publishing business
figured he was crazy, too. After he sent manuscripts to about 50
publishers, a big New York house wrote back. Publishable, yes, the
editor wrote, but here's the catch:
</P>
<P>
   Could Noone at least imply that the Great Pyramid was built by
aliens from outer space?
</P>
<P>
   ``I advised them,'' says Noone, ``to visit the place of eternal
damnation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, he sold the manuscript to Astraea Publishers Inc. in
Atlanta, which printed 15,000 hard-bound copies, and then went
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down there with my accountant to collect my $15,000 in
royalties,'' says Noone, ``and the building was empty. Nobody was
there. Just a couple of chairs and desks. I never got a cent.''
</P>
<P>
   Determined not to let the book go out of print, Noone found
another Atlanta publisher. In 1986 Random House picked it up, and
Noone finally got the exposure he had sought. Coast to coast he
became a cult figure.
</P>
<P>
   BACKING UP THE CLAIMS
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago he moved from Florida to Georgia because he
figured when the cataclysm hit, the Sunshine State would be ``under
40 feet of water.'' As it was, he was already swimming in
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have been interviewed 10,000 times,'' he says of the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared on the usual suspects, and a few odd ones:
``Oprah,'' ``Donahue,'' CNN, ``CBS This Morning,'' NBC's ``Ancient
Prophesies,'' A&AMP;E's ``The Unexplained,'' ``X-Files'' creator Chris
Carter's TV show ``Millennium,'' and in The New York Times
Magazine, which last year included Noone as a member of ``America's
millennial Chicken Littles.''
</P>
<P>
   The fame is fine, Noone says: ``Otherwise people won't be aware
of my work.'' But getting lumped in with the loonies? No thanks.
</P>
<P>
   He formatted the book so all his distilled theories, contentions
and connections are backed by either an expert or another published
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way,'' he says, ``if the reader finds what I've written
unbelievable, he can argue with the expert. I'm just a reporter, a
researcher, a writer, like Carl Sagan.''
</P>
<P>
   And a tireless researcher at that. He constantly combs the news
for indications of the coming Ice Age. He waves a handful of recent
news stories at you:
</P>
<P>
   Two huge icebergs have broken off Antarctica _ one the size of
Delaware, one the size of Jamaica _ in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   Also _ more clips _ a growing number of scientists believe the
world is inching toward what could be another severe and relatively
sudden change in climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, nobody would have believed that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Noone's book contends that the existence of frozen woolly
mammoths with full meals in their stomachs indicates there was such
a sudden change in climate on the planet probably 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were flash-frozen,'' he says. ``They may have lived in
the area that is now France, and suddenly, maybe even the same day,
the poles shifted, the continents moved, and they were in what is
now Siberia.''
</P>
<P>
   `JUPITER ALIGNS WITH MARS ...'
</P>
<P>
   Noone hasn't rewritten the main text of his book since its first
publication in 1982. Instead, he keeps redrafting its lengthy
epilogue. In 1996, he added what he believes is his greatest _ and
most contrarian _ contribution to the body of knowledge about
Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't built, as Egyptologists claim, as a tomb, and it
wasn't built by slaves pushing huge blocks up ramps under the lash
of the whip,'' he says. ``It's a huge water pump, and it was built
by a technologically advanced civilization using machinery that was
powered either by water, or maybe electricity. The pyramid was a
source of power for an entire civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Noone's assertion that the Great Pyramid is something other than
Egyptologists claim has been the Holy Grail of fringe theorists for
more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1998 book, ``The Giza Power Plant,'' writer Christopher
Dunn argues the pyramid was powered by ``harmonic resonance.''
</P>
<P>
   Noone lifted his theory from obscure tinkerer/inventor Edward J.
Kunkel, who published ``Pharaoh's Pump'' in 1962 and was, until his
death, a long-distance friend of Noone's.
</P>
<P>
   ``His book is impossible to read,'' says Noone. ``It's terribly
written. When I would get to a part I didn't understand, I'd call
him and we'd talk for hours until I understood what he was trying
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Kunkel or no Kunkel, Egyptologists still believe
Noone's _ and others' _ wild revisions of ancient Egyptian history
are fragrant flapdoodle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of theories have been around since the 1880s,''
says Peter Lacovara, an Egyptologist at Emory University's Michael
C. Carlos Museum who has visited the Great Pyramid 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say that the dimensions of the pyramid are some sort of
predictor for the past and future human history, that it's
everything except a tomb. It's just ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomer Chris Impey at the University of Arizona is just as
incredulous about Noone's theory that Friday the gravitational pull
from a rare alignment of the moon, sun, Earth, Mercury, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter and Saturn will set off a polar shift.
</P>
<P>
   Noone says May 5, 2000, is predicted by the Great Pyramid
because it's the last date on the pyramid's time line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most graphic way to explain it,'' says Impey, ``is that
the newspaper your readers are holding when they read this story
has more gravitational effect than any of the outer planets, no
matter how they're lined up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hunting around for something to get excited about
since the turn of the century didn't bring the apocalypse many
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say this is a pretty poor excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Y2K REDUX?
</P>
<P>
   While Noone's fame as a prophet of doom is wide in weird
circles, he's a mystery to many, even in Ellijay, population 1,180.
</P>
<P>
   It's an anonymity he works hard to maintain, doubly easy because
he works from home, running a business by telephone, selling orange
peel oil as fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather people don't know I live here,'' he says. ``I'm a
very private person. I don't know many people up here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gilmer County Public Library added ``5/5/2000'' to its
collection a year ago after a librarian read a story about Noone in
the newspaper and realized he's a local. In a year, the volume has
been checked out 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   Ellijay Mayor Al Hoyle, who mixes around town pretty well and
runs a pizza parlor, apologizes: ``I'm sorry. I never heard of
Richard Noone, or his book.''
</P>
<P>
   Noone says he has a network of experts around the world he stays
in touch with through his Web site (www.rnoone.com) and on the
telephone. And, lately, there have been many press inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   A film crew from ``Extra'' was out filming a segment slated to
air this week.
</P>
<P>
   And a reporter from the Canadian magazine ``Saturday Night''
wants to come down, interview Noone, stick around for Friday, and
then ask people in town what it feels like to still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any point in that,'' says Noone. ``Now, if he
wants to talk to me on May 18, because that's the window, May 5
through May 18, then maybe that would make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the contrarian experts whom Noone counts as colleagues _
many of whom back some of his theories and have appeared on talk
shows with him _ squirm when asked about that Friday prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Mac B. Strain, a career geologist with the U.S. Geological
Survey and author of ``The Earth's Shifting Axis,'' pauses when
asked what his plans are that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My calendar is open,'' he says by telephone from his home in
Colorado. ``I don't have anything planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, aren't you worried?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, oh,'' says Strain. ``No. There are too many unknowns. I
absolutely will not lose sleep over it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Noone's most devoted believers is 44-year-old Steve Myers
of Coquille, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Myers picked up Noone's book seven years ago and became so
transfixed by his revelation about Kunkel's pump that, two years
ago, he formed the Pharaoh's Pump Foundation, which counts 40
members, is starting a newsletter and has a Web site
(www.thepump.org).
</P>
<P>
   Myers and his followers have half-built a 20-foot-tall version
of the pump Kunkel described _ and patented it _ based on the
configurations of the internal passageways of the Great Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   In two months, says Myers, it will be complete and they'll test
it. He says the pump, which is fueled by fire, could change the way
the world obtains drinking water and irrigates crops.
</P>
<P>
   If the pump works, ``it will be confirmation that the Great
Pyramid was not built by God as a confirmation of Bible prophecy,
or a ruthless Pharaoh using the backs of slaves,'' Myers says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will say that it was built by a civilization of advanced
technology that was erased by something, maybe a polar shift.''
</P>
<P>
   THE END MAY NOT BE NEAR
</P>
<P>
   Noone would rather not die to prove his point.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, his plans for staying alive _ which include
finishing a mountain house in Blue Ridge with walls that can
withstand 450 mph winds _ are behind schedule.

   ``The house isn't finished,'' he says, ``and won't be by May
5.''
</P>
<P>
   The one he lives in is pretty stout, and is stockpiled with
enough food _ gallon tins of freeze-dried spaghetti and meatballs,
and tossed salad, for starters _ that he and his wife and three
children should survive for a year if his prophecy comes true.
</P>
<P>
   His main worry, this Saturday afternoon on his deck overlooking
a small valley and three pecan trees he just planted, is another
matter: Is he being sandbagged by the reporter? Will this be
another one of those tongue-in-cheek stories like that writer at a
St. Louis newspaper did a few weeks ago?
</P>
<P>
   He is assured that the reporter did think he must be crazy,
which is why he came up to do the story.

<P>
   The truth is, Noone probably fricasseed his credibility himself
with that doomsday title.
</P>
<P>
   What do his wife and children think while they watch him
puttering around the yard thinking he can win May Garden of the
Month? Isn't the end in two weeks?
</P>

   ``I'm undecided about what will happen May 5,'' he says. ``I've
done everything I can to protect my family, and what I've predicted
may not happen for another 10,000 years. That's what I tell them.

   RUSSIA-UKRAINE-$ADV30 _ The Ukraine _ What does this former
Soviet republic think about new Russian President Vladimir Putin?
His first trip ``abroad'' is supposed to be either to Belarus or to
Ukraine, two countries that have extremely different views toward
their old Soviet masters. The Ukraine in the last nine years has
tried to break free from dependence on Moscow _ and not very well,
however, because of its basketcase economy _ while Belarus has
towed the Soviet line. But one of the ways Ukraine has given Moscow
the finger is flirting with NATO, which Moscow didn't take very
kindly too. A bit too close to the Russian border for its comfort.

   MEXICO-ELECTION-$ADV30 _ MEXICO CITY _ Mexico heads into
uncharted territory with the most competitive presidential election
ever held in this country. Challenger Vicente Fox is closer than
any opposition politician has ever been to defeating the candidate
of the PRI, which has controlled the presidency for 71 years. By
most accounts, Fox won a debate this week, catapulting him even
further toward a possible victory on July 2. But analysts say don't
underestimate the PRI, which has a formidable political machine and
is often accused of benefitting from every tool at its disposal _
including sympathetic media and the government itself _ to win
elections. On Friday Mexico's independent Federal Elections
Institute, an agency charged with trying to ensure clean elections,
releases a report showing, among other things, that television news
coverage this month has tilted dramatically toward favoring the
ruling party's candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa. (Ferriss).

with Nazi Germany. The story of that flight and rescue is now to be

   JEFFERSON-MONTICELLO _ What Thomas Jefferson did with Sally
Hemings is fast turning from a historical debate to a racially
charged brawl. Ken Wallenborn resigned last month as a guide at
Monticello, Jefferson's plantation, because he refused to tell
visitors that the third president probably fathered some of
Hemings' children. Despite that recent conclusion by Monticello's
caretaker, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, Wallenborn
represents an increasingly vocal backlash to DNA evidence and
Hemings' ancestors' oral history that the widower Jefferson and
Hemings were lovers. A curtain riser pegged to the Jefferson
family's reunion in Charlottesville May 6-7, during which
Wallenborn's group plan to unveil a foundation aiming to debunk
what they consider ``politically correct'' revisionist history.

WELLS GAINS THE VICTORY FOR BLUE JAYS IN THE BRONX
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since the New York Yankees traded David Wells to the
Toronto Blue Jays last year, Yankee Stadium might have been the one
place in the city where Wells was not made to feel welcome. He
could go to Dorian's and raise a glass, stop by Howard Stern's
studio and trade bawdy stories, but twice last year Wells was
beaten by his former teammates in The House That Ruth Built.
</P>
<P>
   Wells did not last long in Saturday's game, either, but long
enough to finally get a victory in Yankee Stadium, as Toronto
dumped the Yankees, 6-2, before 38,783. Wells (4-1) pitched five
innings before leaving with stiffness in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez, who had won his first four decisions, was
charged with the loss, having allowed nine hits, a walk and five
runs (four earned) over 6 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Before Toronto catcher Alberto Castillo batted in the top of the
third inning, he stood at the edge of the batter's box and chatted
with his positional counterpart, the Yankees' Jorge Posada, and it
appeared that Castillo was telling Posada something about Wells.
Castillo tugged at his shirt as he spoke to Posada, in the same
manner Wells had done the previous inning, when Wells and Castillo
had to discuss their signs repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Posada and Castillo would have many stories to tell about their
respective pitchers, both as talented and athletic as they are
unusual in manner and style. Wells' huge body is hidden underneath
the folds of his baggy uniform, but teammates say he is so flexible
that he can do leg splits like a 96-pound gymnast. He makes no
secret of the fact that he loves to go out and have a good time,
and he loves to be in the middle of a crowd, the center of
attention; as Bernie Williams watched him go through rehearsals for
an appearance on David Letterman's television show on Thursday, the
thought occurred to Williams that Wells is, without a doubt, a New
Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is perched on his toes in his delivery, with the
balance of a ballerina. He has mixed more easily with teammates
this season, his third with the Yankees. Last Sunday, he and Cone
carried on a conversation about their respective pitching
mechanics, Cone speaking enough Spanish and Hernandez using enough
English to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was the ace of the Yankees in one of their greatest
seasons, in 1998, and Hernandez is the ace now, and Saturday they
seemed perfectly matched, each navigating through offensive squalls
into the middle innings, fighting off rallies when neither really
had the best of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees jabbed at Wells in the first two innings. Paul
O'Neill singled with two out, stole second and scored when Williams
singled. Posada ripped a double leading off the second, and with
one out, Felix Jose lined a single to left, his first hit in the
major leagues since May 5, 1995; Posada stopped at third. Wells
looked uncomfortable at times, squatting once, which is what
pitchers do when they have back trouble, and Wells has been beset
all spring by a bad back.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees' threat was thwarted when Jose took a minimal
lead off first and got a poor jump against Wells, and was thrown
out trying to steal second, the second out of the inning. Scott
Brosius grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto tied the score in the fourth, after Posada lost his grip
on the ball while trying to throw to second base, setting up the
run. The Blue Jays had runners at first and second and one out in
the fifth, but Hernandez struck out Jose Cruz Jr. and retired Homer
Bush on a popout. To that point, opponents were 3 for 31 (.097)
with runners in scoring position against Hernandez this season.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was still straining and stretching, repeatedly asking for
a new baseball from the umpire. As always, Hernandez looked to be
in complete command, despite the fact that his slider was somewhat
benign, lacking the sharp bite. He retired Raul Mondesi and Carlos
Delgado to start the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fullmer singled, and there were a succession of three
right-handed batters due to hit. Hernandez usually dominates
right-handers because of his slider.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez reached a two-strike count against Tony Batista, and
Batista slammed a double to left-center, Fullmer rounding the bases
and scoring the go-ahead run. Hernandez jumped ahead in the count
to Marty Cordova, one ball and two strikes, and he could not finish
off the left fielder, who drew a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gonzalez fell behind in the count no balls and two strikes;
Hernandez could not close out the at-bat quickly, the count reached
3-2 and Gonzalez blistered a double over the head of Williams in
center field, and two runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was relieved for the bottom of the sixth inning, having
allowed one run on five hits, without a strikeout.

WILLIAM F. GALLAGHER, 77, LEADER OF FOUNDATION FOR THE BLIND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Francis Gallagher, a retired president of the
American Foundation for the Blind, died on April 19 at his home in
Webster, Mass., south of Worcester. He was 77 and had long been
ill, said the foundation, based in Manhattan, where Gallagher
formerly lived on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher, who lost his own sight in boyhood, joined the staff
of the foundation in 1972 as director of program planning. In that
role, he oversaw policies carried out by regional branches
stretching from New York to San Francisco, and advised on matters
like fund raising, public relations and research objectives.
</P>
<P>
   He was named associate director for advocacy in 1978, managing
field services, government relations, publications, conferences,
workshops and training sessions. He advanced to executive director
in 1980, added the title of president in 1989 and retired the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which in addition to serving the blind preserves
the archives of Helen Keller, the organization's principal
fund-raiser and adviser into the 1950s, credits Gallagher with
having kept staff and trustees abreast of the needs of the blind by
establishing national advisory boards of leaders in education,
rehabilitation and aging.
</P>
<P>
   It says he also helped improve standards for the accreditation
of specialized schools and agencies that offer services to the 10
million Americans who are blind or have limited sight.

   William Gallagher was born in Maynard, Mass., near Boston, and
graduated from the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown,
Mass., where he was president of the student council, president of
the athletic association, captain of the wrestling team and a
member of the debating society. He graduated from Holy Cross
College with a degree in sociology in 1948 and received a master's
in social work at Boston College in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   He started 40 years of service to the blind that year as a
children's social worker for the city of Boston and for the
Catholic Guild for All the Blind in Newton, Mass. He then worked at
rehabilitation centers in Newton and in Bridgeville, Pa., and in
1965 was named director of rehabilitation services for the New York
Association for the Blind.
</P>
<P>
   He remained in that position until recruited by the American
Foundation for the Blind in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher is survived by a sister, Mary Langan, of Clifton Park,
N.Y. His wife, Catherine O'Brien Gallagher, died in 1990.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The party is kicking this night as Luther Campbell of
2 Live Crew fame tries to create the ``ultimate freak party,'' a
XXX-rated, booze-fueled sin fest inside the Coco Bongo nightclub in
Cancun, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He has the money: $2,000 in cash that guys eagerly hand over to
entice the ladies to get wild.
</P>
<P>
   He has the talent: a handful of buxom, skimpily clad young women
willing to perform sexual acts for the prize money.
</P>
<P>
   He has the celebrities: ``Ladies and gentlemen _ Ray Lewis,''
Campbell announces on the 1999 video.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the Baltimore Ravens star linebacker, enters Coco Bongo
with Joseph Sweeting. Rap music blares. Lights strobe. A shirtless
Lewis dances between two women, all grinding hips in time with the
music.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women is soon seen engaging in sexual acts _ first
with a woman, then with a man. The crowd of hundreds goes wild.
Lewis and Sweeting don't participate in any sex acts. But they've
got front row seats.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a year later, Lewis and Sweeting find themselves charged
with two counts of murder in the Jan. 31 stabbing deaths of two men
in Buckhead shortly after this year's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether prosecutors or defense attorneys are even
aware of the mail order video. As of Friday, it had not been
mentioned in either defense or prosecution documents filed with the
court. It's even less clear whether jurors will be shown the tape
during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts question the video's relevance _ except to
establish a relationship between Lewis and Sweeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prejudice of that sort of tape greatly outweighs its
probative value,'' says Alan Baverman, an Atlanta criminal defense
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the tape, ``Luke's Freak Show: Cancun 1999,'' could still
play a peripheral role in the case. For prosecutors, it supports
their contention Lewis was friends with co-defendants Sweeting and
Reginald Oakley, the third man charged with murder. In his initial
statement to police, Lewis denied knowing much of anything about
the people he partied with after the Super Bowl. His lawyers filed
a motion to have Lewis tried separately and have attempted to
distance Lewis from his co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The tape could also serve to refute defense lawyers' efforts to
portray Lewis as a solid family man _ a recurring theme in the NFL
linebacker's February bond hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever role it plays, the video illustrates part of what has
made the case so intriguing to the public: the close relationship
between up-from-the-streets pro-athletes and the friends they don't
leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   FRIENDS FROM THE PAST
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting is a fledgling music producer in Miami who also
promotes shows at strip clubs along Miami Beach. Oakley is a small
time songwriter, producer and wannabe actor in Baltimore who, until
last year, ran a hair salon.
</P>
<P>
   While Lewis and other big-time athletes with eight-figure
contracts may have left their poorer, rougher upbringings behind,
they don't turn their backs on friends and family. To do so would
invite ridicule and opprobrium, say those familiar with the
intersecting worlds of sports and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   So the newly wealthy and celebrated sometimes continue to
surround themselves with some of the unsavory trappings _ the thug
life, the misogyny, the hard-core partying _ of their previous
lives, at times with disastrous results. It's an environment
sometimes peopled by hookers and drug dealers, con men and killers.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting has been arrested for cocaine possession, car theft and
possession of a firearm by a felon, for which he was twice sent to
federal prison. Oakley has been arrested a handful of times on
charges of car theft, assaulting an officer, firing a gun into a
man's house and more. Lewis has been accused three times _ but
never convicted _ of assaulting women.
</P>
<P>
   All three grew up relatively poor, in neighborhoods where
athletes, musicians and their moneyed lifestyles were idolized.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rapper and ball players,'' says Campbell, who successfully
straddles the worlds of sport and entertainment, ``all come from
the same area, came up the same way. The combination has always
been there. The music, hip-hop culture, is really the hip-hop
nation, know what I'm saying? So everybody has a degree of respect
for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, former leader of 2 Live Crew, gained infamy the last
dozen years for his raunchy rap music denigrating women. Campbell
and two band mates were arrested on obscenity charges in 1990 after
their appearance at a Hollywood, Fla., nightclub. A judge had
previously ruled obscene the band's 1989 album, ``As Nasty as They
Wanna Be.''
</P>
<P>
   An appellate court judge, though, later overturned that ruling.
The album sold more than 2 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   For Lewis, the music and film worlds can provide glitz and
gorgeous women and the high-octane rush typically found on the
football field. For Oakley and Sweeting, hanging with big-time
athletes adds panache to their lives, boosting their prestige and
marketability.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about people from a particular community who
happen to have money, fame and visibility,'' says Todd Boyd, an
assistant professor at the University of Southern California who
wrote ''The Day the Niggaz Took Over: Basketball, Commodity
Culture, and Black Masculinity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Those things are not necessarily abundant when it comes to the
African-American community as a whole,'' Boyd adds. ``Athletes and
entertainers make a lot of money. So when you start to think about
who travels with whom, who hangs with whom _ at some point water
seeks its own level.''
</P>
<P>
   `NICE, EASYGOING CAT'
</P>
<P>
   A former high school wrestling star, Joseph ``Oomph'' Sweeting
broke into the entertainment business staging promotions at South
Florida strip clubs like Club Baby Doll and Black Gold. That's
where Sweeting crossed paths with Lewis and Campbell, a friend and
counselor to a long line of players in the University of Miami's
high-profile football program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows him,'' former Miami player Tolbert Bain says
of Sweeting. ''You see him out. He promotes things in nightclubs
and most players go to nightclubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Campbell, ''He's a nice, easygoing cat. I know he was a
good friend of Ray's. I know they're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting and Campbell are close. The soundtrack for ``Freak Fest
2000,'' Campbell's latest XXX video, debuted last month and
Sweeting produced the single ''Lay Your A_ Down.'' He also plays a
pimp in the video.
</P>
<P>
   At 18, Sweeting was sentenced to a year in jail for grand theft
in North Florida's Duval County. A year later, he was charged with
stealing a car in the Fort Lauderdale area. Sweeting was also
arrested for cocaine possession, but charges were never filed
because the search was deemed illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting was later reportedly linked to the Untouchables, which
authorities described as a violent street gang responsible for
drive-by shootings and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when Sweeting was 22, he was sentenced to federal
prison for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Within
months of his release, he was again charged with possession of a
firearm and returned to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was one of the first people prosecuted by the feds for a
felon in possession of a firearm,'' said Metro-Dade County homicide
Detective Jerry Starkey. ``He was singled out because of his record
and the fact he was so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sweeting changed, family members say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe had some problems, but that's all long ago,'' says his
mother, Daisy, outside their cinder block home in Goulds, a rough
section southwest of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Sweeting says his older brother is now legit and argues
the rap sheet is old news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of that is 15 years ago, half his life,'' Anthony said.
''You got so many people in the black community that go into
institutions and change their life. All you hear about are the
have-nots.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Sweeting said he discussed going with his brother to the
Super Bowl, but decided he couldn't break away from his beauty and
hair care supply business. His brother, he said, went to Atlanta
searching for contacts to enhance his entertainment career.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's writing music, working with a lot of up-and-coming people
here in Miami,'' Anthony said, adding that his brother would also
occasionally visit Lewis and other friends in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR EXCITEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, in Baltimore, was also trying to expand his professional
horizons.
</P>
<P>
   While growing up in small town North Carolina, Oakley wrote
poetry and songs and loved music, says mother Novella. Bored with
life in sleepy Oxford, N.C., Oakley moved to Charlotte, 150 miles
westward, for his last two years of high school. He'd bop back and
forth between the two towns, getting into trouble in each. From
1985 to 1992, Oakley was charged with roughly 25 criminal counts,
including assault, possession of a stolen vehicle, embezzlement,
assault on a law enforcement officer and firing into an occupied
dwelling.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1989, Oakley stole a Nissan Maxima, ran two police
roadblocks and jumped from the car while it was traveling at 35
mph, according to a police officer in Granville County. He escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Oakley was convicted of assaulting an officer and
other charges and sentenced to two years in prison. While being
transferred between jails, Oakley escaped. He was recaptured four
years later and finished serving his sentence in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Baltimore to pursue a career producing and managing
musical acts. Oakley also ran Garfield's Phase II Beauty Salon in
the rundown Pimlico neighborhood of northwest Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield Yuille, the featured national model for clothing line
FUBU, invited Oakley to live with him. He also introduced Oakley to
Lewis, according to Jesse Ingram, a Maryland entertainment lawyer.
The limousine driver who put Lewis at the scene of the Atlanta
murders told police he'd routinely chauffeur Oakley, Yuille and
Sweeting from Lewis' suburban mansion to Baltimore Ravens home
games.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors want Yuille to testify about the friendship between
Oakley and Lewis. Yuille wasn't in Atlanta during the Super Bowl,
says Ingram, who has represented him.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield's salon closed in 1999. Yet employees and customers
recall Oakley bragging about knowing Lewis, Denzel Washington and
members of the R&AMP;B group Dru Hill. Oakley also insisted he'd become
a big-time record and movie producer someday.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley has a business card that reads ``Azjha Songwriter and
Producer.'' His mother says Oakley managed a band that played
``love stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded good to me,'' she says. ``I always felt like he
could make it.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG PARTY
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, Sweeting, Lewis, Campbell and others made it to Atlanta
for a Super Bowl week of partying. Lewis and Campbell took rooms at
the Georgian Terrace hotel and hung out with the legions of NFL
players and former Miami Hurricanes in town for the big game.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell says he called Lewis to discuss his troubles between
the time he was first questioned by police the morning of the
murders and his arrest about 10 hours later. He says Lewis remains
his favorite player. On Campbell's Web site, the rapper wears
Lewis' No. 52 Ravens jersey while promoting videos and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a respect there, man,'' says Campbell. ''Of all the
guys I know at (Miami) _ and I know them all, from Jerome Brown to
Warren Sapp _ this man is the only one that ever said, 'Hey, man, I
appreciate all the conversations you ever had with me. I want to
bring you to Baltimore, put you up in a box and watch me play. I
want to do something for you.' This is what kind of cat this is.
That ain't no murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell recounts an incident the night before the Super Bowl
outside Club 112, an Atlanta nightspot.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were walking up to the club _ me, him, (NFL offensive
rookie of the year) Edgerrin James _ and people were running from
the club,'' Campbell recalls. ``The first thing Ray said was, 'Hey,
man, if they're fighting at the front door we don't need to go up
in there.' He said, 'I get paid to hit people on the field, I don't
get paid to hit (people) off the field, so we need to keep
going.'''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell headed back to Miami soon after the Super Bowl, missing
the partying that ended tragically outside the Cobalt lounge.
</P>
<P>
   The VIP room at Cobalt was full that night, with celebrities
like Lewis and former Atlanta Brave David Justice sipping champagne
while surrounded by beautiful women.
</P>
<P>
   Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar were nearby. So, too, were
friends Jeff Gwen and Marlin Burros. The four pals from Akron,
Ohio, were also involved in the entertainment business, just like
Oakley and Sweeting. And Baker, Lollar and Gwen had criminal
records.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen is a fledgling rapper who goes by the name Chino Nino. His
recently released CD includes songs titled ``Crawl Till We Ball,''
``Club Hoppin,'' and ``Playas-N-Hustlers.'' He was on probation for
a drug conviction when he came to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar, a cousin of Gwen's, was a barber who had been arrested
three times in Ohio for drug offenses. Baker, an aspiring artist,
was wanted by police for a probation violation involving drugs and
a gun. Burros, a music producer who also partly owned a hair salon
where Lollar worked, admitted firing the shots at Lewis' limousine
as it sped from the murder scene.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar and Baker were stabbed to death outside the Cobalt after
the two groups of men confronted each other early that Monday
morning. Lewis, free on bond, awaits trial in his Baltimore home,
leaving only to check in with house-arrest officials, consult with
attorneys, or work out at the nearby Ravens complex. It's a life
far removed from Cancun and Coco Bongo.
</P>
<P>
   There, Lewis wandered the streets and clubs with Styrofoam cup
in hand, ``Luke's Girls'' nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene from the video, Luther Campbell waves Lewis and
Sweeting into the club for a night of ``Freak Show'' debauchery.
Campbell seems concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you can play some football this year,'' he tells a
glazed-looking Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you worry? Lewis asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you're partying too hard, baby.''

years later and finished serving his sentence in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Baltimore to pursue a career producing and managing
musical acts. Oakley also ran Garfield's Phase II Beauty Salon in
the rundown Pimlico neighborhood of northwest Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield Yuille, the featured national model for clothing line
FUBU, invited Oakley to live with him. He also introduced Oakley to
Lewis, according to Jesse Ingram, a Maryland entertainment lawyer.
The limousine driver who put Lewis at the scene of the Atlanta
murders told police he'd routinely chauffeur Oakley, Yuille and
Sweeting from Lewis' suburban mansion to Baltimore Ravens home
games.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors want Yuille to testify about the friendship between
Oakley and Lewis. Yuille wasn't in Atlanta during the Super Bowl,
says Ingram, who has represented him.
</P>
<P>
   Garfield's salon closed in 1999. Yet employees and customers
recall Oakley bragging about knowing Lewis, Denzel Washington and
members of the R&AMP;B group Dru Hill. Oakley also insisted he'd become
a big-time record and movie producer someday.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley has a business card that reads ``Azjha Songwriter and
Producer.'' His mother says Oakley managed a band that played
``love stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded good to me,'' she says. ``I always felt like he
could make it.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG PARTY
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, Sweeting, Lewis, Campbell and others made it to Atlanta
for a Super Bowl week of partying. Lewis and Campbell took rooms at
the Georgian Terrace hotel and hung out with the legions of NFL
players and former Miami Hurricanes in town for the big game.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell says he called Lewis to discuss his troubles between
the time he was first questioned by police the morning of the
murders and his arrest about 10 hours later. He says Lewis remains
his favorite player. On Campbell's Web site, the rapper wears
Lewis' No. 52 Ravens jersey while promoting videos and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a respect there, man,'' says Campbell. ''Of all the
guys I know at (Miami) _ and I know them all, from Jerome Brown to
Warren Sapp _ this man is the only one that ever said, 'Hey, man, I
appreciate all the conversations you ever had with me. I want to
bring you to Baltimore, put you up in a box and watch me play. I
want to do something for you.' This is what kind of cat this is.
That ain't no murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell recounts an incident the night before the Super Bowl
outside Club 112, an Atlanta nightspot.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were walking up to the club _ me, him, (NFL offensive
rookie of the year) Edgerrin James _ and people were running from
the club,'' Campbell recalls. ``The first thing Ray said was, 'Hey,
man, if they're fighting at the front door we don't need to go up
in there.' He said, 'I get paid to hit people on the field, I don't
get paid to hit (people) off the field, so we need to keep
going.'''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell headed back to Miami soon after the Super Bowl, missing
the partying that ended tragically outside the Cobalt lounge.
</P>
<P>
   The VIP room at Cobalt was full that night, with celebrities
like Lewis and former Atlanta Brave David Justice sipping champagne
while surrounded by beautiful women.
</P>
<P>
   Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar were nearby. So, too, were
friends Jeff Gwen and Marlin Burros. The four pals from Akron,
Ohio, were also involved in the entertainment business, just like
Oakley and Sweeting. And Baker, Lollar and Gwen had criminal
records.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen is a fledgling rapper who goes by the name Chino Nino. His
recently released CD includes songs titled ``Crawl Till We Ball,''
``Club Hoppin,'' and ``Playas-N-Hustlers.'' He was on probation for
a drug conviction when he came to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar, a cousin of Gwen's, was a barber who had been arrested
three times in Ohio for drug offenses. Baker, an aspiring artist,
was wanted by police for a probation violation involving drugs and
a gun. Burros, a music producer who also partly owned a hair salon
where Lollar worked, admitted firing the shots at Lewis' limousine
as it sped from the murder scene.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar and Baker were stabbed to death outside the Cobalt after
the two groups of men confronted each other early that Monday
morning. Lewis, free on bond, awaits trial in his Baltimore home,
leaving only to check in with house-arrest officials, consult with
attorneys, or work out at the nearby Ravens complex. It's a life
far removed from Cancun and Coco Bongo.
</P>
<P>
   There, Lewis wandered the streets and clubs with Styrofoam cup
in hand, ``Luke's Girls'' nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene from the video, Luther Campbell waves Lewis and
Sweeting into the club for a night of ``Freak Show'' debauchery.
Campbell seems concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you can play some football this year,'' he tells a
glazed-looking Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you worry? Lewis asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you're partying too hard, baby.''

be taught a lesson. ``When a company gets too arrogant, its

concludes, ``in the long run, it'll be better for consumers.'' (Dan

behind to move to London with his wife, Christiane Amanpour, the
CNN foreign correspondent. During nearly eight years at the side of
Madeleine Albright, the first woman to serve as secretary of state,
Rubin fulfilled a number of roles: friend, adviser, protege, gossip
buddy, fashion consultant and self-described ``intellectual mate.''
Playing the dual role of public voice and private counsel, Rubin
recast the spokesman's post in a relentless era of 24-hour news
cycles. (Susana Raab/The New York Times)

   (NYT8) SAN FRANCISCO -- April 29, 2000 -- MICROSOFT-CONSUMERS-2
-- Akther Ahmed, 32, chief executive of an Internet startup called
Gomingle.com, says Microsoft had treated him arrogantly in business
dealings. In the end, Ahmed did decide to go to another company, a
decision that meant spending $500,000 more for the computers,
double the Microsoft price. But Ahmed says that Microsoft needs to
be taught a lesson. ``When a company gets too arrogant, its
innovation goes down,'' he says. ``If Microsoft is broken up,'' he
concludes, ``in the long run, it'll be better for consumers.'' (Dan

downtown San Francisco, uses the Windows system, and despite a
recent bug in his computer's Windows software, says he opposes
dividing Microsoft if it means destroying the Windows system. (Dan

of the Requiem exhibit at the Atlanta History Center. The exhibit
features photos taken during the wars in Vietnam, Indochina,
Cambodia and Laos by photographers who died covering the war. The
man sitting in the foreground of the battle picture is believed by
many to be Harold Webb. Webb says he can't be sure because he
doesn't remember much from that day. He was wounded in both legs,
as was the man in the photo. If the soldier in the photo is Webb,
the picture would have been about a week before his twentieth
birthday. (Jean Shifrin/The Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   GUSEWELLE-COLUMN (Undated) _ column by C.W. GUSEWELLE. Story
will move in the ``k'' category.
</P>
<P>
   WAR-VIETNAM: KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For many whose lives collided
with the Vietnam War, the cost has been exorbitant: More than
58,000 Americans dead. Three million Vietnamese. Hundreds of
thousands more wounded or missing. Billions in dollars lost. A
country torn to pieces. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those intimately involved with the war _ combat veterans,
refugees, families of the American and Vietnamese dead _ still pay
a price.
</P>
<P>
   For veterans it can be flashbacks, alienation, bitterness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For refugees, it's the loss of home and family.
</P>
<P>
   And for families of the dead it's the steepest price of all: the
relentless imagining of what might have been. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the 25th anniversary of the end of the war, what follow are
glimpses into lives touched by Vietnam, short stories about a few
of the many who remember, a few of the many who still hurt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH. Story will move in the ``a'' category.
</P>
<P>
   FISHER-VIETNAM: WAMEGO, Kan. _ On a windy March day in 1967, the
first of Wamego's Vietnam War funerals took place _ that of Sgt.
Steven Szijjarto, 26. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Wamego saw three more of its sons killed in the war,
which ended 25 years ago today, Szijjarto's burial is the one that
most remember here. For Vietnam wasn't Szijjarto's first fight
against Communism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Szijjarto was a refugee from the 1956 Hungarian revolt, a
``freedom fighter.'' He survived that fighting, only to be killed
10 years later. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shot in the head after jumping from a helicopter in a ``hot''
landing zone, he was one of 626 Kansans and 1,411 Missourians who
died in the war, who came home in aluminum caskets to towns big and
small. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By JIM FISHER. Story will move in the ``a'' category.
</P>
<P>
   WAKE-VIETNAM: KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The job sounded perfect for a
meteorologist: be a weatherman on a sleepy tropical island in the
South Pacific. Palm trees. Ocean breezes. Great pay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Lowden applied. And in 1973 he flew to a place few people
ever visit: Wake Island. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't think about was how isolating it would be. The
population was 150 _ all men.
</P>
<P>
   But when Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese, overnight, the
sleepy island awoke. It became one of the few places where Vietnam
refugees could stay until transferred to the United States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In less than two weeks, the island's population grew from 150 to
8,000 _ men, women, children and babies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lowden captured it all with his camera. &QL;

BRILLIANT MEMORIES FROM A DESOLATE ASSIGNMENT

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The job sounded perfect for a meteorologist:
be a weatherman on a tropical island in the South Pacific. Palm
trees. Ocean breezes. Great pay.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Lowden applied. And in 1973 he flew to a place few people
ever visit: Wake Island.
</P>
<P>
   What he hadn't thought about was the isolation. The population
was 150 _ all men. No television. Infrequent mail. No phone. And
the only news came from a scratchy shortwave radio _ between
high-pitched squeals. ``The lack of news didn't seem to bother
anyone else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cheered when I heard that Nixon resigned,'' said Lowden, one
of the few civilians on the island back then. ``And the commanding
officer reprimanded me. I learned to keep my political views to
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese, the sleepy island
immediately awoke. It became one of the few places where Vietnam
refugees could stay until they were transferred to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two weeks the island's population grew from 150 to
8,000 _ men, women, children and babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly we were madly building tents and cleaning up old
buildings,'' he said. ``The air base brought in doctors, nurses,
dentists, teachers and even set up a chow hall to serve Vietnamese
food. We had two weeks' notice. Then the refugees arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowden captured it all with his camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of shy, but the camera was a great way to meet
them,'' said the Kansas Citian, now 59. ``I just wanted to
experience people again. I missed beautiful women and kids. To have
squealing, giggling kids around me _ that was wonderful. I tried to
give them a sense that America would be OK, that they could put
roots down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowden befriended many refugees. Once, a Vietnamese mother asked
him with tears in her eyes whether he would adopt some of her
children _ she had heard rumors that large families were going to
be split up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really touched me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later he helped some refugees find sponsors on the
East Coast and in the Midwest. Lowden moved to Kansas City in 1978
and now teaches philosophy at Maple Woods and Longview community
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 a flood in his basement destroyed all letters, addresses
and anything else he had connected to the refugees at Wake. Luckily
the hundreds of photos he had snapped during those four months in
1975 were upstairs. He had been looking at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried and tried on the Internet to find some of the
families that I met there,'' Lowden said. ``But I've had no luck.
It would thrill me to meet anyone who went through Wake back then.
I might even have pictures of them or their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that made Wake Island a bright spot for me were
those people. Otherwise it would have been the most desolate memory
of my life.''

UN, CAMBODIA NEAR DEAL ON KHMER ROUGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an apparent breakthrough toward justice for the
wrongdoing at Pol Pot's killing fields in Cambodia, the United
Nations and the Cambodian government have reached a tentative
agreement to try Khmer Rouge leaders on genocide charges, Senator
John Kerry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Democrat, who has worked on Cambodian issues
for more than a decade, acted in Phnom Penh as mediator between the
UN and the Cambodian government on Friday and Saturday. He said he
has helped bridge their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pol Pot has died. There has been 20 years now without any
trials,'' Kerry said in an interview from Bangkok, where he stopped
for a layover on his way to Boston. ``This is the final hurdle
toward starting the trials.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge oversaw a reign of terror,
killing an astounding 1.7 million people. Three years ago, Cambodia
requested assistance from the United Nations to convene a genocide
tribunal, but the negotiations have run into numerous difficulties,
including whether foreign or Cambodian judges and prosecutors would
participate.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative deal, which has to be completed by June 15, calls
for an arrangement that includes a Cambodian and foreign prosecutor
deciding what cases to bring from the 1975-1979 period. If they
disagree, an arbitration panel then must rule within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal would consist of three Cambodian judges and two
international judges. Indictments would stand unless struck down by
judges from both sides, a point the UN had insisted upon.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodian officials had long stressed that a tribunal couldn't
override their sovereignty, but UN negotiators refused to
relinquish power because of Cambodia's politicized judiciary and
because of the precedent it would set in the emerging field of
international justice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, UN negotiator Hans Corell is expected to travel to Phnom
Penh soon to negotiate remaining details, and the Cambodian
Parliament must ratify the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   A top Cambodian negotiator confirmed the handshake deal in Phnom
Penh.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Cambodia is concerned, the government has given its
agreement,'' said Om Yentieng, an aide to Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Colm, a researcher at Human Rights Watch who has followed
Cambodian issues since 1985, said that it was hard to judge the
deal without seeing more specifics. She expressed concern, however,
about the arbitration panel, saying that it might politicize the
process by voting on contested indictments as outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   She also said it would take some time before anyone could say
the deal was certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fairly easy to announce victory in Cambodia, and then
find it reversed, given the political winds,'' Colm said. ``The
best strategy is to support the UN in its original approach to the
Cambodian problem with its fairly high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee's subcommittee on Asia and a Vietnam War veteran, agreed
that more steps need to be taken to finish the deal.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``All of us, myself included, have our eyes open for
mischief here and there. But you must remember that there will be
international scrutiny in this process. If anyone tries any monkey
business in the course of this, it will be quite evident.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry met with Hun Sen for more than three hours Friday night.
He then held meetings with a series of top officials who opposed
earlier deals, including Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng and Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, and with four local human rights groups. Kerry
said all supported this arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen and several other top officials in his ruling Cambodian
People's Party are former Khmer Rouge. Many in the party wanted to
limit the tribunal's jurisdiction to minimize chances of
prosecution. Hun Sen, 48, has never been linked to any atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Only two major Khmer Rouge leaders are in custody. Pol Pot, its
main leader, died of an apparent heart attack in 1998. Many of his
former aides live freely in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's mediation, along with efforts by other US officials,
including David Scheffer, the State Department's war crimes
specialist, has followed a parallel path to the UN-Cambodia
negotiations. Kerry said the UN supported his recent efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his motivation, he said, was personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Vietnam vet, I feel a personal linkage and responsibility
for helping to see if we can build a system of justice, and of
accountability for the terrible things that happened,'' he said.
``We played a significant role in Cambodia during the war, with the
bombings and the overthrow of the government. That is an
inheritance of that.''

25 YEARS AFTER THE FALL OF SAIGON: A JUNGLE OF MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For a nation, the cost of fighting a war is
measurable: in bodies crushed and lost, in commitments made and
broken, in prestige gained and squandered.
</P>
<P>
   For those whose lives were touched by the Vietnam War _ combat
veterans, refugees, families and friends of the American and
Vietnamese dead _ the price cannot be gauged.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans cope with flashbacks, alienation, bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees mourn the loss of home and family.
</P>
<P>
   Families and friends of the dead pay the steepest price of all:
the relentless imagining of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago the Vietnam War ended, after taking more
than 58,000 American and 3 million Vietnamese lives. Hundreds of
thousands more had been wounded or were missing. Billions of
dollars had been spent. And a country had been torn to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   On the anniversary of Saigon's fall, The Kansas City Star offers
a few glimpses into lives touched by Vietnam _ short stories about
a few of the many who remember, a few of the many who still hurt.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At 62, Ca Ho still has the seamless face of
the young. But when asked about Vietnam, his eyes turn old as time.
</P>
<P>
   Ho left Vietnam in a desperate search for freedom after Saigon
fell, a refugee from the war that has haunted America for a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom, he discovered, had a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boat carried 170 people,'' he says in Vietnamese through
an interpreter. ``One hundred fifty-two died that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them, his wife and son.
</P>
<P>
   The horror behind his words hangs in the stillness of the Kansas
City night.
</P>
<P>
   Ho stops and then smiles at his visitors. Silence fills the room
as he pours water into tiny flowered cups. Tea leaves swirl into
figure eights of brown. He folds his hands small in his lap, and
waits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Ho's story is very sad,'' says his interpreter, Doan
Nguyen, also a Vietnam refugee who fled Saigon. ``But his story is
like so many others. We Vietnamese in Kansas City are very sad for
the 58,000 Americans and those who died in our country. They leave
family and friends. Why were they sacrificed for nothing?
</P>
<P>
   ``This anniversary is sour and bitter,'' she says, referring to
the 25th year since the fall of Saigon and the end of the war. ``In
Vietnam on Sunday, they will be celebrating and having parades.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we over here remember. We will not forget....Some people,
like Ca, remember every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Killed in action
</P>
<P>
   The man in the photograph looks familiar to Jamie Derleth _ he
has her eyes, her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   She was 1 year old when he died. Too young to remember her
24-year-old father, James ``Mack'' McClafferty, killed in action in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I remember is that I grew up hating slanty-eyed people,''
says Derleth, now 32. ``All I knew from a very young age was that
people with slanted eyes killed my dad, so I hated them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hate Asians today. But as a little girl, that was the
only way I could put a face on his death.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, 1968, two soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division
arrived at the Lee's Summit door of Diane McClafferty. The soldiers
didn't have to tell her why they were there. When she saw them _ in
their white gloves and dress uniforms _ she knew.
</P>
<P>
   The McClaffertys had two children: Jamie and 2-year-old Mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still really angry about the Vietnam War,'' says Diane
Flores, 54, now remarried to a husband she calls a wonderful man.
She became a psychiatric nurse at the Veterans Hospital. ``I felt
like, in a way, by helping the veterans I was helping my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Her children never knew their biological father. But the war
touched them in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up wanting to learn all I could about the Vietnam
War,'' says Mike McClafferty, 33, who at one time signed up to be a
Marine but withdrew his application. ``But what I've learned about
the war is mostly from the Vietnam vets I meet. They didn't offer
any courses on it when I was in college.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a Vietnamese?'' Miranda Derleth, 13, asks, after
listening to her uncle talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's someone from Vietnam,'' he says. ``It's like an Italian
is someone from Italy; an American is from America. Do you know
what the Vietnam War was?''
</P>
<P>
   She bites her lip for a second. ``Was that when Japan bombed
America?''
Forever changed
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be there in a minute,'' says Chris Woelk, yelling over
the chugging of his riding mower. Slowly he becomes a tiny speck in
the verdant fields as he shears one last row of grass next to
stubbly blackberry stalks.
</P>
<P>
   Here, 50 miles from the hubbub of Kansas City and working
beneath blue skies, Woelk, a veteran of the Vietnam War, finds
peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the open air the only sounds he hears are the occasional
cattle lowing. Or the rustle of leaves by summer breezes. The
buzzing rhapsody of insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, how many vets does it take to change a light bulb?'' he
asks, once he returns to his barn. He squints, takes a toke on an
imaginary reefer and answers: ``You'll never know ma-a-a-a-an,
'cause you weren't there!
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what most people expect to hear from a Vietnam vet,''
he says with a laugh. ``I don't see myself as the typical vet. I
feel like that time in history is so political, so historical that
I share it with people if they're interested. I don't want people
to forget the lessons we learned over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Woelk, 54, farms 116 acres in Wellington, Mo. But the Vietnam
War is planted deep in his Midwestern soul. And on each anniversary
the memories come tumbling back, usually in his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Images of deep greenery, smells of rotting earth, the stench of
human waste. The dream always begins with him crossing out each
date on his homemade calendar with a large ``X,'' watching his time
in country grow ``short.'' In 1968 this was part of Woelk's daily
ritual.
</P>
<P>
   But his dreams always morph into nightmares, reruns of the same
theme: His hitch in Vietnam is up, he returns home to Kansas, and
then the government makes a mistake and sends him back for another
tour of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sleep last night knowing we'd be talking today,''
he says. ``Yeah, I dreamed about Nam last night. Not much can keep
it from seeping into my world. It was too intense an experience. It
took me 32 years before I'd talk about it. Now I can't shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Woelk can see one benefit from the war.
</P>
<P>
   It was Aug. 15, 1968, and he been in Vietnam just a few hours.
His convoy stopped. He and another soldier slid into a ravine for
cover as others worked on the engine of the lead truck. He shared a
drink of liquor with the older soldier. Then it was time to move
out.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he turned to look at his new friend, a land mine went
off. The soldier's legs seemed to hover in the air, and then
liquified. It was over in less than a second.
</P>
<P>
   And for the next 32 years, Woelk could not lose the image.
</P>
<P>
   That night back in camp, he sat away from the others, crying.
That's when the man came over. A man that was well over 6 feet
tall, very brawny, and very black.
</P>
<P>
   For Woelk, who is white and at the time clung to racial
stereotypes, what happened next changed his world. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me it was OK to cry,'' Woelk says. ``He told me that
everybody does with their first. I couldn't believe that this man
who so intimidated me at first was so kind to me. Me a perfect
stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today Woelk cannot tell the story without tears rolling
down his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I vowed at that moment to never judge another person except
for his personality,'' Woelk says. ``If there's anything good the
war did for me, it was to open my eyes to my own prejudice....I'd
really like to go back to Vietnam for that reason.''
-- more --
</P>
<P>
   for that reason.''
The war on campus
</P>
<P>
   David Awbrey tries to show his media ethics students at the
University of Kansas what it was like on the KU campus in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He has the photos of the protests about a war that few people
understood.
</P>
<P>
   He shows his students the snapshots capturing the anger, the
intensity. He tells them about Kansas' history of activism, about
John Brown a century earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But like the smoke that billowed out of the Kansas Union in
1970, his words float away. He fails to ignite his students'
curiosity about the Vietnam War, except for one question.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always want to know how long my hair was back then,'' he
says. ``My students just aren't interested in the Vietnam War. It's
out of their realm of experience. They are interested in their own
corner of the world, however. Habitat for Humanity is really big in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``But their version of that time in history is based on Austin
Powers and the other media stereotypes of drugs, sex and rock 'n'
roll. They don't get it that flunking out of a course back then
meant Saigon would be graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Austin Powers stereotype reduces a whole era to the point
that it obscures important issues like civil rights and America's
foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Awbrey, 51, was once a student protester. In 1969-70 he was the
student body president of KU. He was also in Army ROTC _ Reserve
Officers' Training Corps. For him Vietnam was close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The student union burned down, the city of Lawrence imposed a
curfew dusk to dawn. Forty-five students were arrested, and I was
one of them. Every day there was something happening, either there
was a bombing or a protest or a curfew. It was turmoil, turmoil,
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kent State happened, May 4th, the university closed down
the school for the rest of the semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saved me from flunking out....But the powers that be wanted
blood in the street. I tried to keep that from happening, along
with some other people, including the chancellor. I was in a unique
position to be a go-between.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Vietnam has yet to be played out, he says. Vietnam
was really a war of the classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's profoundly disturbing that the men who did go over got
screwed by the government,'' he says. ``The top priority for the
United States today should be the Vietnam veterans. They deserve
much better treatment. What's lasting from this war is the trauma
on this group of men....It's profoundly sad what happened to
them.''
Present at the fall
</P>
<P>
   He retired from the military in 1980. But Vasco Martin is still
a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a Marine, always a Marine,'' he says, with a little
chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   He's 62 and has cancer. If he lives five more years, he says, it
will be a miracle. He blames the war and Agent Orange, the
herbicide used to defoliate Vietnam's jungles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I at least came home and had 25 more years to live,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He's a native of Carrollton, Mo., and was one of the last
soldiers to leave Saigon before it fell April 30, 1975. He was head
of the security guard detail for the Defense Attache Office at Tan
Son Nhut Air Base.
</P>
<P>
   It was cloudy that day. Stores, banks, airline offices and even
the open-air markets were closed. Terror wrapped the faces of South
Vietnamese families trying to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The communists were coming. Shelling and rocket fire was heard
within miles of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was in charge of 16 other Marines. Their job was to
evacuate military personnel at the Defense Attache Office. More
than 5,000 people would be airlifted to safety from that site. An
additional 2,000 would be rescued from the U.S. Embassy, six miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was leaving South Vietnam for good. Odd, then,
that the Marines had assigned to his detail a new soldier, a
teenager, just arrived in the country days before.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers thinking: Gee, they're still sending people here
now?
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, he checked the area and gave two of his
sentries a ``thumbs up,'' and then moved on. Minutes later, at 3:45
a.m., a rocket fell at the entrance, killing both men: Darwin
Judge, 19, of Marshalltown, Mo., and Charles McMahon Jr., 21, of
Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The last Americans killed by hostile fire in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Martin traveled to Iowa for a ceremony remembering
Judge and McMahon, whose families were presented with the Purple
Heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of close calls in Vietnam: was shot at, ran over a
land mine in a jeep and even the last day as we were flying out of
Saigon, rockets were exploding all around us,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles. Then the smile fades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked hard all my life. I just retired, and I have a
perfect wife. Been married three years.'' He sighs. ``Yes, I'm
bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I not be? The war is still going to get me. It's
cutting my life short. But at least I wasn't left over there. A lot
of other guys were.''
Freedom's price
</P>
<P>
   For the Vietnamese community in Kansas City, Vietnam is not the
name of a war, but of their former home. A home now turned into
ugly memories of re-education camps, poverty, discrimination and
loss of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Ca Ho was a South Vietnamese policeman in Saigon. When the North
Vietnamese took over, they sent him, like thousands of others, to
the camps.
</P>
<P>
   But Ho was released after 10 days because he had no skills the
communists wanted. He and his family were condemned to the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were pushed to the forest, we had no nails. No tools.
No electricity. No water,'' he says. ``We dig holes in ground with
rocks and branches. It was very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few years the Ho family tried to survive this way. But it
was unbearable. The family planned its exodus. Destitute, they
split up: Ho and his eldest son, Dzung Viet Ho, would board a boat
first. Later they would send for Ho's wife and youngest son, and
life would smile once more.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 with the help of Catholic Charities, Ho and his son
arrived in Kansas City, two months after their passage to Thailand.
Every day they burned incense and prayed for the safety of their
family.
</P>
<P>
   The news came a year later. His wife and son's boat had sunk,
killing most everyone aboard. The date was May 7, 1981. Today it is
one of the only sentences Ho can say in perfect English.
</P>
<P>
   But moving into freedom cost him even more a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   Ho and his son tried to adjust to their new land. His son
enrolled in Northeast High School. Ho studied English at Donnelly
College. One day in 1986, Dzung went to school and never came back.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese community rallied around Ho. Missing-person
reports were filed with the police. Ho and his friends called other
Vietnamese communities across the country asking if anyone had seen
his son. But he heard no news. Learned no answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each other was all we had after the other deaths,'' he says.
``It doesn't make sense. We love each other very much. I hope he is
still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is very hard for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho spreads identification cards across the living room table.
Among them, a photo of Dzung smiling.
</P>
<P>
   It's late. A soft drumming of rain on the front porch cloaks the
stillness of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom is expensive,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Would he do it again, knowing what would happen?
</P>
<P>
   Ho slides the photos back into an envelope. He waits, then
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he would do it all again,'' the translator says. ``He
says, freedom is worth everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even life.''

<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Rebuffing concerted regional and
international initiatives, President Robert Mugabe planned to
invoke special powers to confiscate and resettle white-owned farms,
his justice minister announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 10 days, the legal framework to take land and
redistribute land to the people will be in place,'' Minister
Emmerson Mnangagwa said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement exacerbated tensions inside Zimbabwe, where
violence has claimed at least 15 lives in the runup to Mugabe's
most serious electoral challenge in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The British government and Commercial Farmers Union said the
call violated the spirit of progress toward ending the violence in
Zimbabwe, which is suffering its worst crisis since independence.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not entirely clear what powers Mugabe would invoke,
or why. Before disbanding this month, Parliament passed a
constitutional amendment allowing the government to take land
without compensating the owner. ``It's quite clearly an election
gimmick,'' said David Coltart, a senior lawyer and member of the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has escalated across Zimbabwe since opposition and
civic leaders rallied voters in February to reject a new
constitution proposed by the government, dealing Mugabe and his
ruling party their first ballot defeat in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the president, veterans of the 1970s war for
independence and other government supporters marched onto
white-owned commercial farms, beating farm workers, destroying
property, and claiming the land as their own. Vast stretches of
prime agricultural land lies in the hands of roughly 4,500 whites,
while the majority of rural blacks live as peasants on marginal
plots.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 1,000 farms have been invaded, but the opposition
continues to hold widespread support ahead of the parliamentary
elections _ due by August _ and violence is shifting to new arenas.
Opposition leaders have been killed in roadside ambushes and their
homes have been fire-bombed. Local and foreign journalists face
growing harassment.
</P>
<P>
   A bomb exploded last Saturday night in the Harare office
building of the Daily News, Zimbabwe's only independent daily
paper. Four days later, police arrested South African Obed Zilwa, a
photographer for the Associated Press, at the airport. They
detained him for three days, releasing him on bail only Saturday
after confiscating his passport.
</P>
<P>
   The state blames Zilwa, who was one of the first journalists on
the scene after the explosion, for planting the bomb. The newspaper
disagrees, and had traced a threatening call placed before the
blast to the ruling party's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging dirty and haggard from detention, Zilwa said Saturday
that ``the whole thing was politically related. There were police
officers who called me the `journalist bomber.' '' The state is due
to decide whether to prosecute Zilwa on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened rhetoric and intimidation follow a flurry of
international efforts to defuse Zimbabwe's crisis. A week ago, in a
meeting between Mugabe and regional leaders at Victoria Falls,
South African President Thabo Mbeki offered the Zimbabwean leader a
private deal: If Mugabe ended the farm invasions and organized free
and fair elections, Western donors would finance land reform and
shore up the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Britain reinforced that plan on Thursday, offering to add $57
million to previous _ now frozen _ aid in exchange for land reform
if Mugabe ended the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe refused to ensure that the invasions would end. One day
after assuring farmers that the attacks would end, war veteran
leader Chenjerai Hunzvi Saturday marched through the streets of
Harare with 2,000 supporters, vowing to deal ruthlessly with
opposition members, farm workers, and the whites who back them.
</P>
<P>
   The march, combined with Mnangagwa's announced intention to
seize more land, threatened to scuttle whatever diplomatic progress
had been made. ``There can be no justification for this,'' said
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, responding to the justice
minister's statement. ``If it takes this step, the government of
Zimbabwe will make it impossible for those who want help with land
reform in Zimbabwe to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Mnangagwa shrugged off Cook's comment. ``Britain's stance is not
our problem,'' he said. ``It does not matter what they think or
say.''

GORE OFFERS A FOREIGN-POLICY BLUEPRINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an era of extraordinary American wealth and
influence in the world, Vice President Al Gore will say Sunday that
the United States should advance its security and economic
interests abroad by giving more help to impoverished and repressed
nations.
</P>
<P>
   In his first major foreign-policy speech since he became a
presidential candidate, Gore urges a ``new security agenda'' based
on what he calls ``forward engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy would expand the definition of national security to
include such issues as health, education for women and girls, and
environmental protection abroad. All are problems that if unchecked
could escalate into a military crisis later, Gore says in remarks
for a forum Sunday in Boston at the International Press Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's foreign-policy vision, his aides said, would mean an
increase in foreign aid. This is an unpopular idea in Congress,
which must approve such assistance. It also calls for expanded US
involvement abroad at a time when many favor reduced commitments
and a more stringent standard for the use of US troops.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of Gore's speech is this: With the advent of
technology and international trade, it is impossible to retreat
from the world. Isolating misbehaving countries, except in extreme
cases, will only make them less stable and thus, a greater threat
later to the United States. And the United States, with its
overwhelming advantages, must take the lead to make the world a
better, healthier, safer place.
</P>
<P>
   With a new ``global age'' replacing the post-Cold War era, ``we
need not only a new generation of weapons,'' Gore says. ``We need a
new way of thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's ambitious vision includes expanding NATO, engaging in
peace-brokering in the Middle East, Northern Ireland, and the
Balkans, and aiding the poorest nations of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States must get involved in regional conflicts
``selectively,'' and then only where success is virtually assured
and when US allies are present to share the burden, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot be the global policeman, but we must reject the new
isolationism that says, `Don't help anywhere, because we can't help
everywhere,' '' Gore's prepared text says.
</P>
<P>
   Gore makes only passing references to rights violations, chiding
China for its record but insisting that engagement with China is
the best way to bring about change.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president criticizes Governor George W. Bush of Texas,
his Republican opponent, whom he calls inexperienced and ``stuck in
a Cold War mindset'' for his suspicion of former Cold War nemeses
Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore, in his speech, urges a close relationship with these
countries, Bush has warned against getting too cozy with either.
China in particular should be held accountable for its rights
abuses, Bush has said, echoing the concerns of both liberal and
conservative critics of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is a competitor, not a strategic partner,'' Bush said in
a speech last year. ``We must deal with China without ill will, but
without illusions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, while acknowledging China's troubles with its neighbor
Taiwan and with rights at home, says in his speech that ``it is
wrong to isolate and demonize China, to build a wall when we need
to build a bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we really isolate a nation with 1.2 billion people and
nuclear weapons?'' Gore asks. ``Can we turn our backs on one of the
most dynamic economies?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of the global age is that Russia and China are
indeed competitors, but also vital partners in our efforts to
tackle problems menacing to us all,'' Gore concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's criticisms, Gore and Bush agree on several
important foreign-policy issues. Both want to include China in the
World Trade Organization and to have permanent, normal trade
relations with China. Both want to continue sanctions against Cuba
and Iraq, and both favor an increase in military spending.
</P>
<P>
   They disagree on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,
which would prohibit atomic testing. Gore backs the treaty; Bush
opposes it. The Russian Duma recently approved the document; the
Clinton administration has been unable to persuade the US Senate to
ratify it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also wants to cut off aid to Russia over its military
campaign in the Russian republic of Chechnya, while Gore wants to
continue to engage with Russia, hoping the cooperation will
encourage reform there.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Bush, Gore says, is his lack of experience in
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush visited Mexico, where he drew attention to the
Clinton administration's failure to get ``fast-track'' legislation
passed to ease trade barriers with Mexico. Bush also met with the
Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, apparently trying to boost
his foreign policy image.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, Gore says, proposes a ``risky foreign policy scheme''
that does not ``meet the grand challenges of both the classic and
new security agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, Gore says, almost ignores Africa, a
continent perpetually suffering from war and famine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the challenges of the New Security Agenda,
Governor Bush's foreign policy is noticeably blank,'' Gore says in
his address.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Bush has outlined a foreign policy that
rejects ``protectionism and isolationism.'' But Gore contends that
the Texas governor's policies will succumb to pressures from some
elements of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to assume that these gaps in Governor Bush's
foreign-policy views and experience will be filled by the
ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party _ the right
wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican congressional
leadership,'' Gore says in the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Governor Bush willing to put partisanship aside for the
cause of peace?'' Gore adds. ``I believe America can do better, for
our own security, and for the ideals we must model to the world.''

ROBERT L.B. TOBIN, 66, ART COLLECTOR AND PATRON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.M.)  By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert L.B. Tobin, a Texas art collector and patron who built
one of the most important theater design collections in the
country, died on Wednesday at a hospital in San Antonio. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from cancer, said his friend and
lawyer, Bruce Bugg. He said that Tobin, who had been ill for many
years, had been arranging, until the very end, how to give away
more of his large art collection.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin served on the boards of the Metropolitan Opera in New York
and the Santa Fe Opera. He was also on the boards of the Museum of
Modern Art and of the Spoleto Festival in Italy. He endowed
libraries and museums, underwrote operas, sponsored symphony
premieres and championed artists and composers in many places.
</P>
<P>
   The major beneficiary of his philanthropy was the McNay Art
Museum in San Antonio. Tobin's mother, the late Margaret Batts
Tobin, was president of the museum's board of trustees for many
years. She built a special wing for the museum on the 50th birthday
of Tobin, her only son.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin filled it with his collection of theater art and design.
The wing includes the original drawings and models for Broadway
productions like ``South Pacific,'' ``My Fair Lady'' and ``Into the
Woods.'' The collection features more than 1,000 set and costume
designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and his mother were two of the most generous patrons of the
arts I have ever known,'' said Beverly Sills, chairwoman of Lincoln
Center for the Performing Arts, saying Tobin underwrote the
production of ``The Siege of Corinth'' in which she made her debut
as a singer at the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin served as chairman of the McNay's board from 1990 until
his death, and helped the museum acquire work by Rodin, George
Grosz, Arthur Dove, Albert Gleiz, Toulouse-Lautrec, Rene Magritte,
Henry Moore and David Hockney.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin was born in San Antonio on March 12, 1934, the son of
Edgar Tobin, founder of Tobin Aerial Mapping Co., which later
became Tobin Aerial Surveys. He discovered his love for the theater
and opera as a teen-ager. He attended the University of Texas at
Austin. When his father died in an airplane crash in 1954, Robert
Tobin joined the family business, which made maps for the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin and his mother were friends of Marion Koogler McNay, who
established the McNay museum in her former home, a Mediterranean
villa on 23 lush acres, in 1954. After his mother built the wing,
Tobin gave the McNay more than 8,000 books, dating from the
Renaissance to the present, to establish the Tobin Library.
</P>
<P>
   He began collecting art as a young adult, and soon became a
patron of cultural institutions in New York and Santa Fe, where he
maintained homes. With his 6 foot 6 inch frame, long white hair and
beard and his flamboyant opera capes, he became a familiar and
dramatic presence on the art scene.
</P>
<P>
   His primary residence in recent years was his family estate in
San Antonio called Oakwell, on the Salado Creek. About 100 friends
gathered there last month to celebrate Tobin's 66th birthday with a
party that the honoree was too ill to attend.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Chiego, the director of the McNay, said even though
Tobin could not attend the party, he asked to see his guests one by
one; they were shuttled by car from one house on the estate where
the party was held to the house where Tobin lay in bed.
</P>
<P>
   On his birthday the previous year, Tobin bequeathed a $3 million
gift of Russian theater designs to the McNay.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first phase of a five-year gift that will continue.
The second part of the gift to the museum arrived earlier this
month. It was a collection of 20th-century American theater designs
and 30 American paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, who leaves no immediate survivors, once tried to explain
his love of collecting. ``It's a constant search for that moment
when lightening strikes,'' he said.

UN, CAMBODIA NEAR DEAL ON KHMER ROUGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an apparent breakthrough toward justice for the
wrongdoing at Pol Pot's killing fields in Cambodia, the United
Nations and the Cambodian government have reached a tentative
agreement to try Khmer Rouge leaders on genocide charges, Senator
John Kerry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Democrat, who has worked on Cambodian issues
for more than a decade, acted in Phnom Penh as mediator between the
UN and the Cambodian government on Friday and Saturday. He said he
has helped bridge their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pol Pot has died. There has been 20 years now without any
trials,'' Kerry said in an interview from Bangkok, where he stopped
for a layover on his way to Boston. ``This is the final hurdle
toward starting the trials.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge oversaw a reign of terror,
killing an astounding 1.7 million people. Three years ago, Cambodia
requested assistance from the United Nations to convene a genocide
tribunal, but the negotiations have run into numerous difficulties,
including whether foreign or Cambodian judges and prosecutors would
participate.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative deal, which has to be completed by June 15, calls
for an arrangement that includes a Cambodian and foreign prosecutor
deciding what cases to bring from the 1975-1979 period. If they
disagree, an arbitration panel then must rule within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal would consist of three Cambodian judges and two
international judges. Indictments would stand unless struck down by
judges from both sides, a point the UN had insisted upon.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodian officials had long stressed that a tribunal couldn't
override their sovereignty, but UN negotiators refused to
relinquish power because of Cambodia's politicized judiciary and
because of the precedent it would set in the emerging field of
international justice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, UN negotiator Hans Corell is expected to travel to Phnom
Penh soon to negotiate remaining details, and the Cambodian
Parliament must ratify the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   A top Cambodian negotiator confirmed the handshake deal in Phnom
Penh.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Cambodia is concerned, the government has given its
agreement,'' said Om Yentieng, an aide to Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Colm, a researcher at Human Rights Watch who has followed
Cambodian issues since 1985, said that it was hard to judge the
deal without seeing more specifics. She expressed concern, however,
about the arbitration panel, saying that it might politicize the
process by voting on contested indictments as outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   She also said it would take some time before anyone could say
the deal was certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fairly easy to announce victory in Cambodia, and then
find it reversed, given the political winds,'' Colm said. ``The
best strategy is to support the UN in its original approach to the
Cambodian problem with its fairly high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee's subcommittee on Asia and a Vietnam War veteran, agreed
that more steps need to be taken to finish the deal.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``All of us, myself included, have our eyes open for
mischief here and there. But you must remember that there will be
international scrutiny in this process. If anyone tries any monkey
business in the course of this, it will be quite evident.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry met with Hun Sen for more than three hours Friday night.
He then held meetings with a series of top officials who opposed
earlier deals, including Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng and Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, and with four local human rights groups. Kerry
said all supported this arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen and several other top officials in his ruling Cambodian
People's Party are former Khmer Rouge. Many in the party wanted to
limit the tribunal's jurisdiction to minimize chances of
prosecution. Hun Sen, 48, has never been linked to any atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Only two major Khmer Rouge leaders are in custody. Pol Pot, its
main leader, died of an apparent heart attack in 1998. Many of his
former aides live freely in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's mediation, along with efforts by other US officials,
including David Scheffer, the State Department's war crimes
specialist, has followed a parallel path to the UN-Cambodia
negotiations. Kerry said the UN supported his recent efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his motivation, he said, was personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Vietnam vet, I feel a personal linkage and responsibility
for helping to see if we can build a system of justice, and of
accountability for the terrible things that happened,'' he said.
``We played a significant role in Cambodia during the war, with the
bombings and the overthrow of the government. That is an
inheritance of that.''

   MOUNT LEBANON, Pa. _ Stunned congregants rallied in prayer to a
bullet-pocked, swastika-smeared synagogue Saturday as police
pursued a hate-crime motive in the suburban shooting rampage that
left five people dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking the tack of ethnic intimidation, a hate crime,''
said Chief Paul Wolf of the Allegheny County Police in summarizing
the killing spree on Friday. The suspect in the shootings, Richard
Baumhammers, a 34-year-old lawyer, is accused of killing a lifelong
Jewish neighbor, two Asian restaurant workers, a grocery store
clerk born in India and a black karate student.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers, who is also accused of critically wounding a second
man of Indian descent, was described by his lawyer Saturday as
deeply troubled psychologically and under medication. ``He clearly
has an extensive history of mental illness,'' said the lawyer,
William H. Difenderfer, after visiting the suspect and his family
here.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers, a strapping man with a goatee and mustache, angered
the crowd outside his arraignment on Friday as he maintained an
unblinking stare and tight grin. ``Death penalty!'' some shouted.
But Difenderfer said the perceived smirk on Baumhammers' face was
more a symptom of mental disturbance than of satisfaction with the
bloody 20-mile course he is accused of wending through the southern
suburbs of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``His parents want to cry out to the victims their sympathy and
devastation,'' Difenderfer said. Baumhammers' parents are prominent
dentists here in the affluent, hilly Virginia Manor neighborhood.
For 31 years, they were close friends with the first victim, a
next-door neighbor, Nicki Gordon, 63, who was shot in her home on
Elm Spring Road.
</P>
<P>
   As detectives investigated the pattern of the slayings,
worshipers arrived Saturday for services at the Beth El
Congregation of the South Hills. This is the synagogue where Gordon
was revered as a mainstay volunteer and where the police say
Baumhammers shot out the front windows and painted red swastikas on
the facade after killing her.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were crying, it was terrible,'' Barry Trilling, a
lawyer, said outside the synagogue, describing the scene of
mourning for Gordon and the other victims. Trilling and other
residents said the area had been a peaceful bedroom community proud
of its reputation for tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man just went nuts,'' said Trilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a madman,'' said Sue Trilling, his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers, whose parents emigrated from Latvia, was described
by authorities as a lawyer who specialized in immigration and
export-import cases. But Difenderfer said his client had been
professionally idle in recent months and living with his parents
while undergoing psychiatric care.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage occurred over a two-hour period across two counties
and four townships with witnesses later identifying Baumhammers as
a gunman who was remarkably placid in approaching and leaving the
shooting scenes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Robinson Town Centre shopping plaza, five miles west of
here, bouquets were left by mourners at the locked front door of
the Ya Fei Chinese restaurant. There, two workers, Ji-ye Sun and
Thao Pham were killed before the eyes of diners when, the police
said, Baumhammers suddenly entered, took aim, shot them and calmly
returned to his black Jeep Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   The other fatalities were Garry Lee, a 22-year-old black man
shot as he worked out in a storefront karate school in Center
Township, and Anil Thakur, a 31-year-old shot at the India Grocers
in Scott Towne Center. Patil Sandip, a 24-year-old worker at the
grocery, remained in critical condition Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to realize that there are a lot of sick people in the
world, and we're going to have these things from time to time,''
said Jim Roddy, Allegheny County executive, wishing for no further
gunplay in this busy suburban area.
</P>
<P>
   In an unrelated shooting spree in March, a black man, Ronald
Taylor, is accused of killing three white men and wounding two
others in fast-food restaurants in nearby Wilkinsburg. Charged with
ethnic intimidation and homicide, Taylor, 39, was later diagnosed
as a schizophrenic and is undergoing evaluation at a state mental
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're strongly opposed to all this gun action in America,''
said Stanley Roth, an elder at Ahavath Achim Congregation in nearby
Carnegie, a second synagogue sprayed with bullets. ``With guns,
people with mental problems and hate in their hearts have the
opportunity to devastate the community,'' said Roth, who took the
synagogue's Torah scrolls to safety after the front windows were
shot out. ``This was a sickening thing to happen in a very innocent
community.''

JACK BEST, 87; HELPED HATCH A DARING ESCAPE FROM NAZIS
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Best, one of the last survivors of the audacious group of
British prisoners in World War II who constructed a glider under
the noses of their Nazi captors in order to fly from the roof of
their prison to freedom, died April 22 in a hospital in
Herefordshire, England. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Before the glider could be put to the test, the notorious
Colditz prison, a huge Saxon castle near Leipzig in eastern Germany
where Best and many other British airmen were imprisoned, was
liberated by U.S. forces in 1945. But because the plan was so
daring and its secrecy so effective, it has become one of the
legends of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Best was a consultant for Channel Four, a British
commercial television channel, when it constructed a full-scale
replica of the glider with its 32-foot wingspan and flew it for a
documentary called ``Escape From Colditz.'' The original glider had
been broken up and used for firewood at the war's end.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, the glider replica, together with some of the
actual tools Best made to help construct it, and other memorabilia,
will go on display at the Imperial War Museum in London.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to build the glider was hatched by Best and two of his
fellow British prisoners at Colditz Castle. Their plan was to
construct a two-man glider in a secret workshop in one of the
castle's attics. When completed, the glider was to be taken to the
roof and launched by a catapult, which consisted of a series of
cables and pulleys.
</P>
<P>
   The planners reckoned that their captors would be looking for
tunnels and underground escape routes, nothing as audacious as a
leap to freedom. The catapult was to be given its impetus by a
massive counterweight _ a bathtub filled with concrete that was to
be dropped to the ground, flinging the glider into the air.
</P>
<P>
   If all went well, said Kenneth Lockwood, the secretary of the
Colditz Association, a survivors' group, the glider would
noiselessly soar for about a mile from a height of about 100 feet
down over the town of Colditz, over farmland and finally over the
River Mulde, landing on the far side of the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing was to cross the river,'' Lockwood said in a
telephone interview on Friday. ``If they could clear that they
could reach a nearby railroad station, board a train and make it to
Switzerland, which was neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood also said that Best, having failed at an earlier chance
to escape, agreed to give his seat on the glider to someone else.
``Even though he was a pilot who could have flown the glider,''
Lockwood said, ``he said he would stand down for someone else. His
specialty became making the tools to construct the glider _ like a
saw, a plane and a chisel.''
</P>
<P>
   The glider was basically made from wood taken from bed slats and
floorboards. Its skin was fashioned from cotton sleeping bags. It
took nine months to construct.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood, who had been captured in Belgium, said he was part of
the ``stooging system'' in which he would serve as a lookout to
warn those constructing the glider to cease their work if a guard
approached.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after liberation that the Germans learned that the
glider had been constructed. The survivors of Colditz were
especially pleased by the success of the replica glider almost half
a century later because it proved to them that their plan was a
smart one and that they could have soared away from the supposedly
escape-proof Colditz Castle.
</P>
<P>
   John William Best was born in Vivod near Llangollen in North
Wales. As a young man, he moved to Kenya to learn farming. It was
from Kenya that he enlisted in the Royal Air Force in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Best was captured in 1941 after he was forced to ditch his plane
off the coast of Greece. He was held at the Stalag Luft III prison
_ known from the film ``The Great Escape'' _ but tunneled his way
out with a fellow prisoner. They made it 125 miles to Szczecin,
Poland, before being recaptured. They were then sent to Colditz.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Best returned to farming in Kenya, but in the
1960s he returned to England, where again he went into farming.
</P>
<P>
   Best's marriage to Constance Otter ended in divorce. He is
survived by his second wife, Elisabeth Bunting of Leominster,
Herefordshire; a son, Bob, and a daughter, Tanda Wilson-Clarke,
both of North Wales; and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Best had a most wonderful sense of humor,'' Lockwood
said. ``If we hadn't had a sense of humor about all this we would
have gone around the bend.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: LIKE IT OR NOT, PUBLIC IS NOW PRIVY TO POLITICIANS'
HEALTH
</HEADLINE>
  By JOYCE PURNICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Americans once knew little about Franklin D.
Roosevelt's paralysis from polio or John F. Kennedy's struggle with
Addison's disease. Woodrow Wilson's failing health was kept dark
and mysterious, and Sen. Jacob Javits told voters less than they
needed to know about his terminal fight with Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   But when a biopsy of his prostate gland came back positive last
Wednesday, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani held a news
conference on Thursday. When a predecessor, Edward Koch, collapsed
at his gym a few years back, he told reporters from his gurney that
he was fine. We know that Janet Reno's shaking hands betray not
nervousness but the impact of Parkinson's disease, that Bill
Bradley has an irregular heartbeat and that President Clinton's
hearing is not what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   We know a great deal today about the health problems of
prominent people _ more than some of us want to know. But we know
it anyway, because they tell us. Because what used to be private
has become public, in every arena of life. Savvy public figures _
especially political candidates _ reveal all before the rumor mill,
fed by an aggressive, competitive press, does it for them.
</P>
<P>
   What happened between then and now? Nearly a half century.
``Things have changed and changed radically, and I think for the
better,'' said Richard Reeves, a biographer of President Kennedy.
``We've moved along with the curve of openness that is the 20th
century.'' An openness sometimes bordering on performance art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oprah did it,'' Reeves said, only half kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Kennedy years, there have been Watergate and its
aftertaste of cynicism. The de-demonization of cancer, a word that
once was only whispered. Treatments for cancer, AIDS and other
diseases that control or cure them. The confessional nature of a
society filled with people who want their 15 minutes. The ``rapidly
diminishing, if not disappearing zone of privacy for public
officials,'' in the words of Alan Brinkley, a historian at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a sense of obligation these days, a feeling that
talking publicly about illness informs people, emboldens them to
have mammograms and colonoscopies and blood tests for prostate
cancer _ the tests that alerted Giuliani to his problem.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the prominent, shame has been replaced by a candor
that can veer from the refreshing to the relentless. Illness gives
the celebrity patient an opportunity to become a representative for
his or her condition, to inform and educate, sometimes with
remunerative rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole _ the failed presidential candidate who became a
national spokesman for erectile dysfunction and Viagra after his
surgery for prostate cancer _ praised Giuliani last week for
speaking publicly about his cancer, saying his openness ``will
benefit potentially hundreds of thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The city comptroller, Alan Hevesi, who had prostate cancer four
years ago, talked about it at the time and says he is sure his
openness saved the lives of other men. Telephone calls and letters
convinced him that the impact ``was extensive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees manager, who was treated for prostate
cancer last year, said the same. ``I thought it was best to be as
honest as I could be, and then after getting all the letters and
cards from all the people who have had this, I realized this was
the best thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For politicians, there is also ample proof that any attempt to
color the truth can hurt much more than telling the public about a
disease, unless it is debilitating or life-threatening. ``It's not
a crime to be unhealthy, but exactly the same as with a crime, it's
not the crime, it's the cover-up.'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Even absent a cover-up, a candidate can hurt himself if he is
not candid enough. Many contend that happened with Bill Bradley
during his unsuccessful campaign for president last fall. He has
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which produces brief bursts of
irregular heart rhythm. It is a common condition _ a nuisance,
Bradley called it. But he did not mention the condition, first
diagnosed in 1996, until he had to be hospitalized after suffering
a bout of irregular heartbeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have disclosed it before the campaign,'' said Howard
Rubenstein, the New York public relations consultant. ``Here he
goes portrayed as a jock, athlete, intelligent strongman. Suddenly
he's seen as vulnerable.'' There were many reasons the Bradley
campaign faltered, but that was clearly one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Long after full disclosure of health matters had become common
in politics, Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, a presidential
candidate in 1992, had to acknowledge that he had mishandled the
matter of his cancer. At first, he told voters he had been
successfully treated for lymphoma, but later, after dropping out of
the race, he acknowledged under pressure that he and his doctors
had concealed a recurrence. He died of cancer in January 1997, just
as his first term would have ended.
</P>
<P>
   Even what was known about his lymphoma probably hurt his
candidacy, political analysts say today. Many also believe that had
the public understood the serious nature of Addison's disease,
Kennedy would have lost to Richard Nixon in 1960. And mental
illness is still generally considered damaging to a candidate, as
it was in 1972 when George McGovern was forced to replace his
running mate, Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, after it was
disclosed that he had been hospitalized for depression.
</P>
<P>
   But generally voters do not recoil at knowledge of a treatable
condition, say advisers to candidates and the politicians
themselves. Plus, what, they ask, is the choice?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always the downside in that people can start a
whisper campaign and question whether someone is up to the job,''
said Peter Powers, Giuliani's friend and adviser. ``But if you are
up front and honest about it and confront it, especially today with
the media so large and the Internet out there, people would know
everything anyway. So you just deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch, who advised his doctors to tell the public everything
there was to know about the stroke he had while in office (and then
he told people everything he knew about it, too), agreed. ``In
today's world, it's going to get out, so it's far better to get it
out in a responsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's story, for instance, was already leaking by the time
he held his news conference.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Americans knew only sketchy outlines of Dwight D. Eisenhower's
heart problems, compared with what they would know today. Some
candidates kept the truth from the public. In 1972, Bella Abzug
made many an enemy by challenging Rep. William Ryan of New York,
who was suffering from throat cancer but denied he was ill. He won
the primary, then died three months later.
</P>
<P>
   But President Lyndon B. Johnson was showing the world his
gallbladder surgery scar in 1965; nine years later, Betty Ford was
forthcoming about her breast cancer and drinking problem, getting
plaudits for raising awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan did try to maintain his privacy when he had
surgery for colon cancer in 1985, but then wrote an open letter to
the American public when he was found to have Alzheimer's disease
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Now the expectation of openness is a given. ``It's just
unacceptable in our culture for someone running for office to say
my health is my own business,'' Brinkley said. ``Because to some
degree, for people running for office, their health isn't their
business.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the walls of the gallery at Pace University hang
pictures of Jesus as a poor black death row inmate. The Messiah as
a panhandler. Christ as TV anchor. The savior as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-month exhibit billed ``35 of the top images of Jesus
Christ for the new millennium,'' the featured artists are winners
of a contest sponsored by The National Catholic Reporter, the
weekly newspaper. The contest was intended to elicit the many faces
of Jesus as seen by an increasingly diverse human family.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people from 19 countries submitted entries. The
judge for the 10 finalists, Sister Wendy Beckett, the BBC's art
critic, wrote of the winners, ``Every viewer will understand our
Lord more deeply as he or she thinks of what this image could be
and responds to what the artists have made visible.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner, Janet McKenzie of Island Pond, Vt., used a black
woman for the model of her ``Jesus of the People.'' When it ran on
the cover of The Reporter, feathers flew, with one parish
threatening to protest her painting.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's editor, Michael J. Farrell, wrote in the
exhibition's program that Jesus remained still controversial, 2000
years after his birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were it otherwise, he would scarcely be kin to the original,
the charismatic Messiah who stirred up and, for better or worse,
left no one unaffected,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie's picture includes a yin-yang symbol and an eagle
feather, evoking Asian and American Indian cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been an aspect of the painting that hasn't been
ripped apart and celebrated,'' she said. ``The essence of Jesus is
just love. I don't think it matters what image he's celebrated in,
as long as you get the essence, the point of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another artist, Michael F. Di Nunzio of Bad Wiessee, Germany,
depicted Jesus as a news broadcaster next to a phone on a
television screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guiding thought beyond all my pictures of Jesus is what
would Jesus do if he were to live today,'' said Di Nunzio, who was
visiting New York for the opening. ``Of course he would make use of
the medium of television, not only to communicate his message but
to communicate himself, because he is the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Joanna Chan, a Maryknoll nun and host of the exhibit,
also submitted an entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a young, exuberant, risen lord, dancing in the streets of
Jerusalem, dancing with an Arab,'' she said. ``It's my dream of
world peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Other artists featured were a 1983 Nobel Peace Prize nominee, S.
Graham Sargent, who depicted Jesus as a jug spilling water into the
sea, and Father John B. Giuliani, an internationally known icon
painter.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit opens Monday and runs through June 30 in the gallery
of the Schimmel Center for the Arts, at Pace University, on Spruce
Street in lower Manhattan. It is free and is open Monday through
Friday from 1-5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit will travel to Chicago's Catholic Theological Union
in July.

FOR COWBOYS, ALL THAT IS OLD AND BORING IS NEW AND EXCITING AGAIN

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A little more than two years ago, Ernie Zampese
packed up himself and his boring, predictable offense, then headed
on down the NFL road. The Cowboys needed massive change.
</P>
<P>
   Out with the old. In with the new.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Chan Gailey packed up himself and his boring,
predictable offense and headed on down the NFL road. The Cowboys
needed massive change.
</P>
<P>
   Out with the old. In with the old.
</P>
<P>
   Say there, Mr. Jones. Are we confused, or is it just you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was a little surprised,'' the 64-year-old Zampese said
Friday at Valley Ranch, where he's unpacked himself and his offense
for another stay. ``Jerry and I were talking at the Senior Bowl
\Rin February\S, and he mentioned he'd like to bring back the old
offense. Then he said he wanted me to come with it. As a
consultant. I never knew exactly what a consultant did. But I'm
willing to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes perfect sense, if, that is, you're willing to
believe the system makes players instead of the players making a
system. As long as there has been football, that's been an ongoing
debate.
</P>
<P>
   But the offensive philosophy of Zampese was in place when three
Super Bowls were won at Valley Ranch. The offensive philosophy of
Gailey had no such local roots, nor any prayer of establishing
same. Two years and gone. Things moved fast, particularly once
Jerry Jones started doubting his original decision to throw out the
Zampese system and have Gailey take the offense in another
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Did, however, the system really matter in the first place? Both
ended up failing. Or was it players within both systems who failed?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the system matters,'' said new head coach Dave
Campo, who as the Cowboys' defensive coordinator worked daily in
practice against what Zampese and Gailey wanted to do. But at the
first minicamp of his regime, Campo watched Friday as a Zampese
protege, Jack Reilly, began to re-install the offense of choice for
Campo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious to everyone we've got a strong-armed quarterback
who can get rid of the ball in a hurry,'' Campo said of Troy
Aikman. ``What I want is an offense that is based on the
quarterback getting rid of the ball in a hurry, and getting it into
the hands of playmakers. The old offense \Rnow the new offense\S
does just that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, that didn't happen in that woeful 6-10 season of
'97, making it, temporarily anyway, Ernie's last stand at Valley
Ranch, as well as the last stand of imitation head coach Gunsmoke.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Could it have been receivers Anthony Miller and
Stepfret Williams disappearing as alternatives to Michael Irvin? Or
tight ends Eric Bjornson and David LaFleur being a bit overmatched
in trying to replace Jay Novacek? Or Emmitt Smith having the worst
season of his career, leading to speculation he was finished? Or
maybe it was that awful offensive line of George Hegamin and Erik
Williams at tackles, Larry Allen and Nate Newton at guards, and
Clay Shiver at center? Three of them were gone within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the system, or the players within the system?
</P>
<P>
   Campo, of course, won't exactly spend sleepless nights debating
the subject. He doesn't care which one or why. It's now his head
coaching butt on the line, and he wants offensive results. Pronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I think it will be different is we've got talented,
game-breaking kind of people at wide receiver \RJoey Galloway and
Rocket Ismail\S, and in Jackie Harris \Ra tight end, H-back type\S;
I feel we've made one of the most important free agent signs of the
off-season,'' Campo said. ``Harris gives us that inside threat in
the passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Campo invoked the name of Emmitt without a direct
reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do offensively will involve contributions from Jack,
Ernie and myself,'' he said. ``I will be involved in the philosophy
of the offense but not in calling the plays. I want a power attack,
I know that. One thing I understand is attacking a defense. I was
on the other side for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zampese critics long have said he commits to the pass first,
the run second. Zampese long has said he strives for balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a personal opinion, but I've felt we got a little
predictable with what we tried to do in the running game,'' Campo
said. ``I want a running game that is more diversified. And the
very last thing I want anyone to say is we're boring on offense.
With our playmakers at receiver, and with Emmitt and with Troy, we
absolutely can't be boring.''
</P>
<P>
   At Valley Ranch, it's the kind of thing that can get you fired.
Then get you rehired. This, of course, leads to confusion, unless
it's Dave Campo, who is perfectly clear about what he expects. As
of this first minicamp weekend, so is everyone else.

STARS STILL HAVE FEAR OF SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ If you thought the San Jose Sharks looked bad in
Game 1, you should have seen them lose Game 6 to St. Louis in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   They were worse. They weren't only beaten. They were
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Blues are no longer in the playoffs, bounced by
those same Sharks a game later.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we should be afraid of right now,'' Stars winger
Brenden Morrow said. ``You don't want to count the Sharks out too
soon because I think a lot of people had them counted out after
Game 6, and they came back and dominated Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks are neither the prettiest nor the most talented team
in the NHL. But when it comes to going quietly, they simply don't
know how to do it. So the Sharks' sorry performance in Game 1
against Dallas is a pretty good indicator that they are going to
come out with raised sticks, harder hits and adrenaline pumping for
Game 2 of their best-of-seven series at 6:30 tonight at Reunion
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not ones to go away with adversity,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``It's not so much Game 1 vs. Game 2 or Game 2 vs.
Game 7. It's every time they seem to have adversity, they respond
in a very strong manner and a very determined manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars must at least match and preferably better that emotion
and determination if they are going to hold on to home-ice
advantage. The players know this and have discussed it.
</P>
<P>
   But saying and doing are totally different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edmonton did the same thing to us,'' Stars center Guy
Carbonneau said. ``We know they were going to come back hard in the
third game, and we didn't react the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars figure the Sharks' plan for Game 2 will be much like
Edmonton's in Game 3 of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be physical, be more desperate,'' Stars winger Blake Sloan
said. ``All those Hitchisms.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Sharks want to be more physical. They have to be better
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks allowed 16 goals in their three losses to St. Louis
and only six in their four victories, including one in Game 7. The
Stars won, 4-0, in Game 1 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to focus on realizing how we beat St. Louis and the
games we lost against St. Louis. Game 1 against Dallas was similar
to Game 1 against St. Louis,'' Sharks winger Jeff Friesen said.
``It shows you if you give up four goals to Dallas with \REd\S
Belfour in net, you are not going to win many games. ... If we play
like we did \RFriday\S night, it will be a short series.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams expect the series to go six or seven games. So what's
the big deal? This is, after all, only Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lose it, the momentum of the series swings the other
way,'' Hitchcock said. ``I always felt Game 2 determines the flow
of the entire series for the team that has home-ice advantage as
Game 3 determines it for the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars last lost a Game 2 on May 9, 1998, against Edmonton,
going 6-0 in Game 2s since.
</P>
<P>
   The players realize the importance of Game 2. It doesn't allow
them to retain home ice, but it puts the pressure on the Sharks to
win at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to go home down 2-0,'' Stars winger Mike Keane
said. ``It's something where we have to win our games and put
pressure back on them. Your building can work for you and against
you. ... I think we're happy with the first game, but still, big
deal, it's one game.''
</P>
<P>
   That is another lesson the Stars learned from the Blues. If you
have the Sharks on the mat, don't let them up.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues did, and they're no longer in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet we learned from that,'' Stars winger Jamie
Langenbrunner said. ``If we let up, we'll get in trouble. We don't
want that to happen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Morrow: ``We can't get caught in the same trap St. Louis
did.''

FOR COWBOYS, ALL THAT IS OLD AND BORING IS NEW AND EXCITING AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A little more than two years ago, Ernie Zampese
packed up himself and his boring, predictable offense, then headed
on down the NFL road. The Cowboys needed massive change.
</P>
<P>
   Out with the old. In with the new.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Chan Gailey packed up himself and his boring,
predictable offense and headed on down the NFL road. The Cowboys
needed massive change.
</P>
<P>
   Out with the old. In with the old.
</P>
<P>
   Say there, Mr. Jones. Are we confused, or is it just you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was a little surprised,'' the 64-year-old Zampese said
Friday at Valley Ranch, where he's unpacked himself and his offense
for another stay. ``Jerry and I were talking at the Senior Bowl
\Rin February\S, and he mentioned he'd like to bring back the old
offense. Then he said he wanted me to come with it. As a
consultant. I never knew exactly what a consultant did. But I'm
willing to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes perfect sense, if, that is, you're willing to
believe the system makes players instead of the players making a
system. As long as there has been football, that's been an ongoing
debate.
</P>
<P>
   But the offensive philosophy of Zampese was in place when three
Super Bowls were won at Valley Ranch. The offensive philosophy of
Gailey had no such local roots, nor any prayer of establishing
same. Two years and gone. Things moved fast, particularly once
Jerry Jones started doubting his original decision to throw out the
Zampese system and have Gailey take the offense in another
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Did, however, the system really matter in the first place? Both
ended up failing. Or was it players within both systems who failed?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the system matters,'' said new head coach Dave
Campo, who as the Cowboys' defensive coordinator worked daily in
practice against what Zampese and Gailey wanted to do. But at the
first minicamp of his regime, Campo watched Friday as a Zampese
protege, Jack Reilly, began to re-install the offense of choice for
Campo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious to everyone we've got a strong-armed quarterback
who can get rid of the ball in a hurry,'' Campo said of Troy
Aikman. ``What I want is an offense that is based on the
quarterback getting rid of the ball in a hurry, and getting it into
the hands of playmakers. The old offense \Rnow the new offense\S
does just that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, that didn't happen in that woeful 6-10 season of
'97, making it, temporarily anyway, Ernie's last stand at Valley
Ranch, as well as the last stand of imitation head coach Gunsmoke.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Could it have been receivers Anthony Miller and
Stepfret Williams disappearing as alternatives to Michael Irvin? Or
tight ends Eric Bjornson and David LaFleur being a bit overmatched
in trying to replace Jay Novacek? Or Emmitt Smith having the worst
season of his career, leading to speculation he was finished? Or
maybe it was that awful offensive line of George Hegamin and Erik
Williams at tackles, Larry Allen and Nate Newton at guards, and
Clay Shiver at center? Three of them were gone within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the system, or the players within the system?
</P>
<P>
   Campo, of course, won't exactly spend sleepless nights debating
the subject. He doesn't care which one or why. It's now his head
coaching butt on the line, and he wants offensive results. Pronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I think it will be different is we've got talented,
game-breaking kind of people at wide receiver \RJoey Galloway and
Rocket Ismail\S, and in Jackie Harris \Ra tight end, H-back type\S;
I feel we've made one of the most important free agent signs of the
off-season,'' Campo said. ``Harris gives us that inside threat in
the passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Campo invoked the name of Emmitt without a direct
reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do offensively will involve contributions from Jack,
Ernie and myself,'' he said. ``I will be involved in the philosophy
of the offense but not in calling the plays. I want a power attack,
I know that. One thing I understand is attacking a defense. I was
on the other side for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zampese critics long have said he commits to the pass first,
the run second. Zampese long has said he strives for balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a personal opinion, but I've felt we got a little
predictable with what we tried to do in the running game,'' Campo
said. ``I want a running game that is more diversified. And the
very last thing I want anyone to say is we're boring on offense.
With our playmakers at receiver, and with Emmitt and with Troy, we
absolutely can't be boring.''
</P>
<P>
   At Valley Ranch, it's the kind of thing that can get you fired.
Then get you rehired. This, of course, leads to confusion, unless
it's Dave Campo, who is perfectly clear about what he expects. As
of this first minicamp weekend, so is everyone else.

 &HT;    Gustafson keeps lead, but Webb lurks
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sweden's Sophie Gustafson is hanging in there at the
Chick-fil-A Charity Championship, leading by two strokes, but
there's a shootout brewing for today's final round at Eagle's
Landing Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for those hopeful of overtaking Gustafson, who shot
a 3-under-par 69 Saturday to move to 10-under 134, the par-5 18th
only allowed her a par. The way red numbers were flying at the
finish Saturday, that almost felt like a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   In a late scoring flurry, eagles at the 18th by Karrie Webb, Amy
Fruhwirth and Michelle McGann helped tighten the leaderboard and
add some tension to the conclusion of the $900,000 tournament
hosted by Nancy Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sophie did us a favor there by not making a birdie or
an eagle there,'' said Webb, who climbed to 7-under after another
so-so day. ``She could have had a three or four-shot lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for her first LPGA win after six international
victories, Gustafson, 26, is being chased at 8-under by 1995
champion Laura Davies, who stormed into contention with a 66 that
included 18 greens hit in regulation; and McGann, who fired a
second consecutive 68. Fruhwirth (70) is three shots back at
7-under along with Webb.
</P>
<P>
   While an unknown player to American audiences, Gustafson is no
stranger to her LPGA colleagues. A long hitter who can reach most
of the par-5's, she has an aggressive swing that can produce a wide
expanse of numbers. This week she's in a scoring groove. Saturday's
round included her third eagle in two days, at the 13th after a
3-wood to 15 feet, two birdies and two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson struggles with a severe speech problem, but has spent
two days of smooth shotmaking. Of the big names below her on the
leaderboard, Webb included, she said, ``I've played with them
before and I've beaten them before.''
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson goes into the final round with nothing to lose and
nearly certain to better her highest finish on the LPGA Tour this
year, a ninth in Hawaii Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be fun,'' said the Swede, who played on
the 1998 Solheim Cup team. ``This is good for me and it's a great
field. If I can play (this well) after two rounds, I know I can
handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Webb of Gustafson, ``She has a tremendous amount of talent.
When she's on, she hits it long and extremely straight. I've seen
her hit it off the planet as well. Being as aggressive as she is,
she's bound to make a few mistakes, but also a good amount of
birdies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chances are,'' said Davies, her Solheim Cup teammate, ``she'll
be tough to beat tomorrow. I've never seen her lay up in my life.
She reminds me of me about 12 years ago, when I didn't care less
where I hit it, as long as it was far.''
</P>
<P>
   The cut came at 4-over 148.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Rachel Hetherington solidified making the cut
by eagling the 18th for a 72 and 146. Just making it was tournament
host Nancy Lopez, who shot a 75 for a 148. Mary Beth Zimmerman made
the cut at 148.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie Jones shot a 72 for 146. Krissie Register missed the cut
at 153 on a second-round 80.
</P>
<P>
   Davies is making a serious run after two consecutive missed cuts
in the Chick-fil-A. With so much length _ even with her driver
holstered _ and so many short irons in her hand, Davies knocked
approach shots close all day. Which for a chance to beat Webb, not
to mention Gustafson, is mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karrie's probably more dominant in her world than Tiger
(Woods) is in his,'' Davies said. ``I'm even actually practicing a
little more.''

THEIR FURY IN CHECK, THOUSANDS HOLD PEACEFUL PROTEST IN MIAMI OVER
CUBAN BOY
</HEADLINE>
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI, April _ The anger and disappointment filled 18 blocks.
Old men who have hated Fidel Castro since 1959 shouted fresh rage
Saturday on the hot asphalt of Southwest Eighth Street, and young
people who have never stepped foot on Cuban soil waited in line to
buy T-shirts that read ``Elian We Love You.'' People prayed, made
speeches, and just stood, being here, because it was important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll get to stay in this country,'' said Carmen
Nunez, one of thousands who came to Miami's Little Havana Saturday
in peaceful protest of the federal raid here a week ago to seize
Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here for the cause, for my people, for my blood, for my
country,'' said Nunez, 42, a legal secretary who came to Miami from
Cuba when she was 10. Like many people here, she has accepted the
reality that Elian, the 6-year-old Cuban boy who was rescued off
the Florida coast in November, is with his father now and probably
will soon be back in Cuba. That does not mean she has to like it.
</P>
<P>
   One week after Elian was taken from the home of Miami relatives
in a pre-dawn raid by federal agents that resulted in violent
protests and more than 300 arrests, Cuban-Americans here again took
to the streets, still bitterly angry but peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of several thousand people, representing three
generations of Cuban-Americans, milled in the streets and denounced
President Clinton, Attorney General Janet Reno and the United
States. The crowd Saturday never apparently reached the 100,000
people that the organizers had promised, but people said it was
still a strong message to this nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been to Cuba in my life, but I felt I just had to
be here,'' said Ileana Martinez, 29, a teacher. ``We can't
understand why this is happening, and we're here to show the world
how criminal this is.''
</P>
<P>
   But this peaceful demonstration, which lasted less than two
hours, drew only a fraction of the attention that was drawn by the
earlier demonstrations. Only local, Spanish-language television
stations carried the protest live Saturday, unlike last week's
live, network coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami police refused to give an estimate of the crowd size,
which they routinely do at such demonstrations. The Associated
Press said tens of thousands of people had joined the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Miami, the Cuban-Americans' demands for justice seemed
to fall on mostly deaf ears, as a majority of Americans seemed not
only distant, but angry at the denouncements of the United States
and the upside-down American flags that have become a symbol of
protest in Little Havana..
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators here loudly booed a plane that flew over with a
banner that said, ``America Loves Janet Reno.''
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd, some protesters made it clear who they are backing
in this fight. Spanish-language radio announcers urged
demonstrators to vote only Republican and some carried signs that
read: ``America, be patient. Nine more months of Clinton and Co.''
</P>
<P>
   Many demonstrators waved signs saying ``Carollo for President,''
lauding Mayor Joe Carollo of Miami, who has sided with the Cuban
exiles in this confrontation with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The rally Saturday came just a day after the resignation of the
city's police chief. On Friday, William O'Brien resigned, saying he
could no longer work for Carollo, who he called a divisive and
destructive mayor.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation came a day after Carollo fired the city manager,
Donald Warshaw, who had refused to fire O'Brien in the aftermath of
the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo was angry at O'Brien, who learned of the raid an hour
beforehand but did not alert the mayor, because Carollo had sided
with Elian's Miami relatives against the federal government's
decision to reunite the child with his father.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he kept silent because telling the mayor would have
been like telling the family. It would have brought many more
demonstrators to the house, and put police officers, Elian, the
family and others in danger of a larger, longer confrontation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo said he was also angry with the chief because of the way
the Miami police responded to last weekend's demonstrations, which
left piles of tires and overturned trash bins blazing in the
streets. Carollo said O'Brien and Warshaw, a former chief of
police, gave officers a ``green light'' to attack protesters.
</P>
<P>
   While Cuban-Americans applauded the mayor, many other residents
have reacted harshly to the turmoil in City Hall, saying that
Carollo did not believe he served anyone except the city's
Cuban-Americans, who make up 60 percent of registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami city officials act like heads of state, scapegoating and
firing Cabinet ministers after a lost war with a foreign power,''
said David Abraham, a law professor at the University of Miami.
``This mixture of bellicosity and crude posturing continues to
bring justified suspicion and disrepute down on Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Many demonstrators did see the Elian fight as a battle against a
foreign power, the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't believe us,'' said Ana Ruiz, 30, a nurse.
``They haven't been there,'' she said of Cuba and its Communist
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to listen,'' she said, referring to Clinton
and Reno. ``They don't want to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Saturday, at least, it was a peaceful confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I like to see,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, leader
of Movimiento Democracia, an anti-Castro group that advocates
nonviolent protests. ``This is a nonviolent, massive

   Elian was far away from the chants and cheers. He is with his

 &HT;    GAYS HOLD MASS ``WEDDING''
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lynn Gallagher and Liz Stanley came from
Alpharetta, Ga., to stand before the Lincoln Memorial on this sunny
Saturday and exchange vows of love and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been together for a year,'' said Gallagher. ``And I
wanted to make a public statement that we're going to be together
for the rest of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I wanted to let those people across the street know that
we don't need their permission to love who we love,'' said Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Those dozen or so people across the street were anti-gay
protesters who carried a wooden cross and placards warning ``Repent
or Perish.'' But they failed to deflate the buoyance and defiance
of the more than 1,000 couples who were joined in same-sex union.
</P>
<P>
   The mass ``wedding'' was not legally recognized, of course,
since only Vermont has granted marriage-like rights to homosexual
couples. But the Rev. Troy Perry, the Universal Federation of
Metropolitan Community Churches minister who performed the
ceremony, told the couples to take heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand here knowing that love makes a family -- nothing
more, nothing less,'' said Perry.
</P>
<P>
   The staged wedding was among scores of activities arranged
around Sunday's Millennium March on Washington for Equality.
Although some gay rights groups are boycotting the event, the
streets of nation's capital were crowded on Saturday with activists
and supporters who did respond to the call for a national
mobilization.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said the march is needed to galvanize a massive gay
and lesbian turn-out in the November elections and to energize a
new generation of their movement. About 300,000 participants are
expected for the Sunday parade and rally.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth national gathering of homosexual rights
groups in the past two decades and comes at a time of both triumphs
and setbacks. Last week, Vermont enacted its law giving legal
rights to homosexual couples and President Clinton urged Congress
to pass a Hate Crimes Prevention Act protecting gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   However, California voters recently approved a referendum
denying marital rights to homosexual couples. The Supreme Court
will decide by July whether the Boy Scouts can bar a gay man from
serving as a troop leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have attained a certain level of visibility. But visibility
isn't civil rights,'' said Dianne Hardy-Garcia, the Texas lobbyist
for lesbian and gay rights who is serving as executive director of
the march.
</P>
<P>
   Especially outside of cities, activists said, homophobia has not
been cured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is okay if you stay within the Perimeter,'' said
Nicole Wilson, who came to the march from Georgia. The Perimeter is
a road that rings Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't feel that it's as accepted outside the
Perimeter,'' said Ginny Perrine, another Georgian.
</P>
<P>
   At the mock wedding, the mood was festive as couples crowded the
steps between the Lincoln Memorial and reflecting pool. Attire was
eclectic. Outfits included wedding gowns and bouquets and tuxedoes
and T-shirts and black leather and plaid Bermuda shorts. One
lesbian couple wore identical baseball caps labeled ``Bride.'' A
preppy gay couple wore khakis, white shirts with button-downed
collars and pastel ties.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Street and Rob Lett, from Richmond, Va., wore matching
tuxedoes with turquoise vests and invited a dozen friends to share
the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been together almost 11 years but we had never done
anything like this before,'' said Street. ``We thought it would be
a fun thing to do and exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good opportunity to share our relationship with folks
we love,'' said Lett.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Jett and Rich Greene had exchanged rings over a decade ago on
their fifth anniversary together. But they came from the Atlanta
suburbs to join this ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a house, a dog, wonderful neighbors. For 16 years,
we've been a family,'' said Jett. ``We wanted to declare that
commitment. Rich is the miracle in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to legally marry them, they noted, DeKalb County
willingly accepts their property tax payments.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Mullins and Terri Funderburk said they came from
Rossville, Ga., to show their commitment to each other and the
cause of gay and lesbian rights.
</P>
<P>
   If Georgia ever recognizes same-sex marriages, said Mullins,
``we'll be the first in line.''
</P>
<P>
   David Newton and Eduardo Andrade of Decatur, Ga., exchanged
rings at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show the world that we're a couple and that we
plan to stay together,'' said Andrade.
</P>
<P>
   Other events on Saturday included a concert starring Garth
Brooks, Melissa Ethridge, k.d. lang and the Pet Shop Boys and the
unveiling of new panels to the AIDS memorial quilt on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   However, the march has been criticized by some groups within the
gay rights movement who charge that there was not enough grassroots
involvement or outreach to people of color.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers ``alienated many constituencies, ... replacing
democracy and accountability with Hollywood celebrities and
back-room dealing,'' said William Dobbs, a spokesman for a
coalition of activists opposed to the march.
</P>
<P>
   ``The march's purpose, insensitive elitism, is not our purpose.
Our purpose will not be advanced by the Millennium March on
Washington,'' Ed Brown, co-chairman of the National Association of
Black and White Men Together, told the Associated Press.

HORSE RACING 101 IN TIME FOR KENTUCKY DERBY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Miami Herald funnyman Dave Barry wrote a column about a
rare trip to the track a couple of years ago, he might have spoken
for everyone who ventured into the strange world of horse racing
for the first time without a tour guide and a translator.
</P>
<P>
   Barry, like most novices, was confused by the Daily Racing Form
and its pages and pages of arcane phrases and numbers. ``The
so-called Racing Form in fact has nothing to do with racing,'' he
concluded. ``It's a means by which espionage agents send each other
messages in secret code.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry quoted the ``gibberish'' in a handicapping column: ``Magic
Way has the highest Beyer in the field, which is a nice starting
point at the maiden level.'' Come again _ in English?
</P>
<P>
   For racing executives, it isn't funny.
</P>
<P>
   As they try to restore their sport's popularity, they're often
reminded that one obstacle is its jargon, its sheer complexity, its
image as an insider's game. The intricacy that prompts diehard
horseplayers to praise it as the world's most challenging gambling
game also causes novices to throw up their hands in confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute in weeks like this, when the
newspaper and television buildup to Saturday's Kentucky Derby will
give horse racing its broadest exposure of the year. What will the
sport gain if a reader is enticed by a profile of a great jockey,
only to be intimidated by some reference in paragraph 14 to
``Dosage'' or a ``5-furlong breeze'' or a ``Beyer figure''?
</P>
<P>
   So, increasingly, the racing industry is attacking the problem,
seeking to educate newcomers to the track _ or, at least, make it
easier for them to learn on their own.
</P>
<P>
   An example: Santa Anita Park in Arcadia held free ``beginners'
seminars'' every day during the racing season that ended Monday.
Groups of 20 to 60 people heard staff handicapper Bill Downes
explain the basics of terminology, the types of races, how to read
the track program, how to place a bet and how to watch a race.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita also offered lessons in deciphering the Daily Racing
Form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I explain about the exacta part-wheel and the
trifecta box, the newcomers area like, `Whoa! What is that?' I tell
them, if you really are a newcomer, keep things simple, go with
win, place and show (bets), exactas and daily doubles. The tris and
triples (can wait).''
</P>
<P>
   Another example: At Hollywood Park in Inglewood, which opened a
65-day season Friday night, the track program now includes a full
page of simplified analysis for each race, aimed at what president
Rick Baedeker calls ``new or intermediate patrons.''
</P>
<P>
   But how many new patrons would understand this commentary on
Miss Pixie, a filly who ran third as a longshot in Friday's
featured Senorita Stakes? ``Popped and stopped in Arkansas; tough
post and meets other speed; bred on top to handle turf,'' it read.
``Keeps pace red hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the newcomer wasn't put off by that, he could have bet
on Miss Pixie at one of the ``new bettors' windows'' _ with tellers
presumably selected for their patience _ Hollywood Park has dotted
throughout the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always told people who come to the track for the first
time, it's not necessary to know how to handicap, you can still
have a good time, and have a chance of winning, by picking names or
numbers or colors,'' said Allen Gutterman, Hollywood Park's vice
president for marketing. ``The game would be a lot healthier if
more members of the public came out and just had a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people find (the racetrack) because they have a
gambling gene. But I'd be out of business if I had to depend on
that.'' Hence the effort to educate.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't seem to be necessary in other sports. Not that
baseball and football aren't complicated; try explaining the
infield fly rule to an Englishman. But in other sports, fans don't
feel obligated to participate by trying to bet on the winners.
</P>
<P>
   As American society moves farther from the soil, people may feel
less familiar with horses. As newspapers and magazines have shrunk
their racing coverage _ mirroring declines in track attendance in
the era of simulcast wagering _ people may be less comfortable with
racing vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   And as the spread of casinos and lotteries has siphoned away
casual gamblers, what's left at racetracks are studious
handicappers whom the general public might consider unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can cash a bet and say, `Twenty minutes of handicapping are
responsible for that winner.' It's very satisfying,'' Gutterman
said. ``But it takes an investment of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching potential fans to pick winners _ or enjoy the
intellectual challenge of trying _ is a goal of the National
Thoroughbred Racing Association. Among the organization's first
projects in 1998 was the distribution of a ``pocket wagering
guide'' in 3.5 million copies of Sports Illustrated magazine.
</P>
<P>
   This week in Louisville, home of the Kentucky Derby, the NTRA
plans to unveil a marketing tour called ``The NTRA Racing
Experience,'' a tractor-trailer that will crisscross the country
carrying interactive displays ranging from jockey profiles to a
``you ride the horse'' virtual-reality feature.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the NTRA will begin distributing Playbill-style fan guides
at major races like the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have 150,000 people at Churchill Downs, and maybe
50,000 of them are horseplayers. One-hundred thousand are novice or
barely above novice,'' said Eric Wing, an NTRA spokesman. ``These
(magazines) are not designed to crowd out the track program in any
way. In fact, part of it tells you to refer to the program to make
informed bets. But it will tell you how to watch a race, the
different kinds of bets, what to say at the (betting) window, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fan education is so key. It's one thing to run television ads
and make the sport look exciting. But if people see that ad and
come to the track and feel befuddled, what have you
accomplished?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THINGS TO KNOW AT THE TRACK
</P>
<P>
   1.Because racetrack gamblers compete not against the ``house''
or against an expert's point spread but against each other under
the so-called parimutuel system, it's possible to turn a profit in
the long run if you're smarter than the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   2.Track officials aim to present competitive races by grouping
horses of comparable ability _ or, at least, similar credentials.
Thus, female horses and young horses invariably run against horses
of the same gender and age; winless horses (maidens) invariably run
against other winless horses; horses with a single victory often
run together, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   3.As a rule of thumb, the larger the purse, the more important
the race and the better the horses. Championship-level and other
high-quality races come with names _ like the ``Santa Anita
Handicap'' or the ``Hollywood Futurity.''
</P>
<P>
   4.In the simplest terms, handicappers assess a horse's chances
of winning based on 1) his overall ability (judged by the quality
of horses he has defeated, how fast he has run, and his pedigree);
2) his apparent fitness (his recent performances, his physical
appearance, his trainer's reputation); and 3) his suitability to
today's race (depending on the distance, running surface, likely
pace, etc.)
</P>
<P>
   5.Mostly, handicapping is a matter of interpreting the data in
the Daily Racing Form, whose ``past performance'' charts provide
information in about two dozen categories for each horse _ more
than you'll learn about a shortstop by reading his stat box in the
average major-league media guide.
</P>
<P>
   6.Better to have a good horse with a bad jockey than a good
jockey with a bad horse. The most important person in a horse's
life is not the jockey but the trainer, who is responsible for
keeping him in shape and choosing his races (though a domineering
owner is eligible to overrule the trainer).
</P>
<P>
   7.Because of their pedigrees and training, horses vary
significantly in their affinity for races of different distances
and running surfaces. Only a horse of rare versatility could
compete in both the three-quarter-mile Breeders' Cup Sprint and the
1-mile Belmont Stakes. Cigar, twice Horse of the Year in the 1990s,
won once in 11 races on turf but won 18 times in 22 races on dirt
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   8.Horses can begin racing at age 2, when they're the equivalent
of human teen-agers, and tend to keep getting faster up to age 4 as
they mature physically and mentally. The winner of the Kentucky
Derby, restricted to 3-year-olds and held in May, probably won't be
the fastest horse in the country at his moment of glory.
</P>
<P>
   9. The ``best'' horse _ the betting favorite _ wins about 33
percent of the time. Blame bad luck on the track, the tendency of
horses to go off form without announcing it, and the fact
handicapping is an inexact science.
</P>
<P>
   10.When a horse seems to speed up in order to pass his opponents
in a thrilling stretch run, that's usually an optical illusion. In
most cases he's taking advantage of opponents who are weakening
faster than he is. In a typical three-quarter-mile race, the first
quarter is run in 22 seconds, the second in 23, the third in 24-25.
</P>
<P>
   11.Highlights of the racing calendar: preparation of 3-year-olds
in the winter and spring for the Kentucky Derby on the first
Saturday in May; the Triple Crown races (Derby, Preakness, Belmont
Stakes) in May and June; debuts of precocious 2-year-olds in the
summer and fall; initial clashes between top 3-year-olds and older
horses in the fall; preparation of horses of all ages and
specialties for the Breeders' Cup races in October or November.
</P>
<P>
   12.Most of the above applies solely to thoroughbred races. There
are also quarterhorse races (mostly a quarter-mile or less) and
harness races (the ones in which the horses pull little buggies).
Thoroughbreds, quarterhorses and standardbreds (harness horses) are
entirely different breeds. &QL;

 &HT;    Klesko finds comfort zone in San Diego
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ For all the trade talks concerning Ryan Klesko in
his 10 years with the Braves organization, when it finally happened
last December it came as a relief of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko, who was traded to the Padres with Bret Boone and minor
leaguer Jason Schiell for Reggie Sanders, Quilvio Veras and Wally
Joyner, is comfortable here in his native Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   He's renting a house on the beach. His mother, Lorene Klesko, is
only an hour's drive away. And he's sporting some blond streaks in
his hair and mutton-chop sideburns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it worked out for both teams _ Andres (Galarraga) is
coming back and they've got a good outfield,'' Klesko said of his
former team. ``I was coming from one good organization to another
good one over here. The whole change was a positive. They wanted my
leadership and experience over here to help them win. I know most
of the guys from playing against them in high school and growing
up. Nine or 10 guys are from California.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko is the Padres' everyday first baseman. He still struggles
against left-handers, a deficiency that made him a platoon player
with the Braves. He was hitting .182 (2-for-11) entering Saturday,
and Padres manager Bruce Bochy sometimes goes to veteran Ed Sprague
off the bench. But Friday night, Klesko doubled off Braves
left-hander Mike Remlinger
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are calling him their best power hitter since Fred
McGriff, another former Brave. In his last few years as a Brave,
Klesko was criticized for overswinging and not living up to his
34-homer, 93-RBI season in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He's responded to his new environment by hitting .289 through
Friday night with six homers. He's driven in 20 runs, which would
put him on a pace to drive in 100 runs for the first time in his
career. Entering Saturday's game against the Braves, Klesko had hit
in seven consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   He's mainly hitting fifth, though he's occasionally appeared in
the third slot when Tony Gwynn has been out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko said he hasn't had much time since the start of the
season to keep up with his friends on the Braves, though he does
talk to John Rocker on a regular basis. The two went hunting
together in the offseason. Klesko still has his 250-acre farm in
Covington, Ga. and doesn't plan to give it up anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Playing for the Braves) was part of my past; I enjoyed it,''
Klesko said. ``It's something I'll always remember. Atlanta is
basically my home, and it probably still will be for a while.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore fields marathon questions
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four hours of voter questions wasn't too much for Vice President
Al Gore, who took on immigration, education, abortion and dozens of
other topics at a record-long town hall meeting Friday night in
Albuquerque, N.M. Gore kept his promise to stay until every person
with a question was served. He set a new personal record, talking
to the audience for more than two and a half hours and then took
questions one on one for another 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Tough questioner Jessica McKenzie, 17, asked: ``Why is it
illegal to kill a baby five seconds after it's born and not illegal
five seconds before it's born?'' Gore responded with: ``Didn't she
do a good job of presenting her point of view?'' then went on to
say women should be allowed to choose abortion. ``I think he
avoided the question,'' Jessica said later.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Gore helped assemble a playground in a low-income
neighborhood in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH WINS TEEN MOCK-ELECTION
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush accepted the Republican presidential
nomination Friday _ from a mock-convention put on by teen-agers in
Portland, Ore. Bush was nominated Thursday by a 3-1 margin over his
former rival Sen. John McCain. In accepting the nomination by
telephone from Austin, Bush told the 2,000 students that he will
``run a campaign that will lift our spirits.'' The students play
the parts of delegates, committee chairs and caucus chairs in the
event that dates to 1964.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH AND MCCAIN MAKE UP DIFFERENCES
</P>
<P>
   A May 9 meeting between Bush and McCain will go ahead as
scheduled after aides to both Republicans met Friday and patched up
their differences. McCain threatened Thursday to pull out of the
meeting because of publicity surrounding the event and reports that
Bush wanted to discuss the vice presidency, a prospect the U.S.
senator from Arizona said he has ruled out. But on Friday, McCain
adviser John Weaver and Bush campaign manager Joe Allbaugh agreed
on an agenda for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH AHEAD IN OHIO, POLL SHOWS
</P>
<P>
   A new presidential poll of Ohio voters by the University of
Cincinnati has Bush leading Gore by eight points. The poll,
conducted April 5 through 22 of 531 likely voters, found Bush ahead
of Gore 47 percent to 39 percent in a state that political analysts
say could go to either Bush or Gore. Ralph Nader of the Green Party
got 4 percent, Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party, 3 percent, with 7
percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, a newly released preference poll has Bush
ahead 39 percent to 38 percent, with 18 percent of the respondents
undecided. The poll, by Elway Research, surveyed 400 registered
voters April 11 and 12 and has a margin error of plus or minus 5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   DEMONSTRATIONS TO BE PART OF SHOW
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have agreed to drop their free-speech lawsuit against
the city of Philadelphia, and the stage has been set for a week of
noisy demonstrations at this summer's Republican National
Convention. The Pennsylvania Consumer Action Network is leading the
creation of an anti-Republican coalition named ``R2K'' that hopes
to coordinate a mass rally and parade. ``This city, thankfully,
recognizes that dissent is an integral part of our democracy,''
said ACLU legal director Stephan Presser. But the settlement is
contingent on the approval of Philadelphia 2000, host committee for
the July 31-Aug. 3 convention.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it all began two years ago, with the federal
and state governments filing their landmark antitrust suit against
Microsoft, Kevin O'Connor, an assistant attorney general in
Wisconsin, was struck with a numbing fear: What would the
plaintiffs do if they actually won the case against one of the
richest and most powerful companies in America?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the dog chasing the bus,'' O'Connor said. ``What's
he going to do if he catches it?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer came Friday. The Justice Department and 17 states
asked a federal judge to break Microsoft into two companies that
would compete with each other and, they contended, change the rules
of competition across the software industry. On Saturday,
government officials were relieved, behaving in some ways like a
new parent after a long and tortured labor. And that it was.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few weeks, the Justice Department and 19 states
were sometimes in warring camps that reconfigured themselves as
events swirled around them. All think it something of a miracle
that a vast majority wound up in agreement on a single remedy
proposal. (Two attorneys general dissented.)
</P>
<P>
   Within the Justice Department, the job was easier. On Sunday,
April 2, the day after mediation efforts broke down, Joel I. Klein,
the assistant attorney general who heads the antitrust division,
convened his senior aides and polled them on their preferred
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``And everyone said the same thing: ops-aps,'' said one person
with knowledge of the discussion. Ops-aps is the term coined within
the department for the proposal to create two new companies, one
that would have the Windows operating system and another that would
have the applications software, like word processing and
spreadsheet programs.
</P>
<P>
   A roughly similar idea had been offered during the settlement
talks. But this point of consensus was reached only at the end of a
long and bumpy road.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after O'Connor worried about the dog and the
bus in May 1998, the states had agreed to form a remedies
committee, which began work well before the trial opened in October
1998. After almost a year of research, consultations with experts
and intense internal discussions, they came up with a plan that was
presented at the group's annual convention in Washington in March
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal called for forcing Microsoft to auction the source
code for the Windows operating system to other companies, which
would develop and improve it, creating competition in the operating
system business.
</P>
<P>
   The states were not interested in breaking up Microsoft, even
though the antitrust trial was almost over and it was clear that
Microsoft had put on a miserable defense in court.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Miller, the Iowa attorney general, who was by far the most
active of the 19 attorneys general, said the idea ``was somewhere
between conduct and structural'' _ that is, between merely
restricting Microsoft's behavior and actually restructuring the
company.
</P>
<P>
   But as the states quickly found out, there was one big problem.
When they talked to the various companies that might be bidders in
the Windows auction, they learned that none had any interest in
bidding. The consensus was that the computer code was too
complicated, and the price was likely to be too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we discarded that idea,'' Miller said. And another attorney
general, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, said the government's
ability to impeach the credibility of Microsoft executives who
testified helped convince him and others about that time that
remedies intended to modify Microsoft's conduct probably would not
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw that there was no moral core to their defense,'' he
said. ``It was all bluster and rhetoric, so I came away thinking
that it was very risky to believe there would be even a scintilla
of credibility on their part'' when it came to hoping they would
abide by conduct restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   About the time the states were reaching this point in their
thinking, Klein chartered a wide research project on remedies using
department staff and academic experts. Over the summer, Justice
Department personnel spoke with dozens of computer industry
leaders, analysts, venture capitalists, lawyers and others to gauge
their views on remedies. Klein carried out many of the interviews
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those consulted were Microsoft allies; others were
theoretically loyal customers, and still others were competitors.
But ``the broad consensus, when you took the competitors out of it,
was that Microsoft could and would evade conduct remedies,'' a
person with direct knowledge of the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Still no decision was made. But then Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson issued his findings of fact on Nov. 5, declaring Microsoft
a market-stifling monopoly, and opinions within the Justice
Department began to coalesce. The department began looking for an
investment banking firm to help explore the economic ramifications
of a breakup or other structural remedy, an official said. On Dec.
2, it hired the New York firm Greenhill &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, court-sponsored settlement talks opened,
mediated by Judge Richard Posner, chief judge for the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Chicago. By the time he asked for remedy ideas early
this year, the Justice Department was ready. The department
proposed splitting Microsoft into three companies. One would hold
Windows 98, and another would have Windows 2000, the new operating
system recently released, primarily for big corporate users. A
third company would hold the rest of Microsoft's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   This was intended to create immediate competition in the
operating system business, and the states joined in advocating the
idea. But after a period of discussion, Posner said he had spoken
to Microsoft, and the company had made it clear it was not willing
even to discuss the proposal. One official said Posner also raised
his own objections, saying he believed an appeals court would not
look favorably at the idea. ``It would arouse tremendous resistance
in Congress, allowing Microsoft to rally public opinion against the
suit,'' the official added, paraphrasing the judge.
</P>
<P>
   That breakup proposal was dropped. Instead, the Justice
Department, Posner and Microsoft, often represented by its
chairman, Bill Gates, fell into intense negotiations over a set of
conduct remedies. Posner essentially locked the states out of the
process, several state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As the states got word of the discussions, they grew distressed.
They considered the plan under discussion wholly inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states just would not have agreed to it,'' Miller said. As
a result, he and others said, the attorneys general were relieved
when the talks broke down on April 1. But they were also
demoralized. The judge had issued a statement praising the
negotiating parties but had pointedly failed to mention the states.
And Microsoft blamed the states for the failure of the talks _ an
idea state and federal officials denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale was down,'' Miller said. But more important, in
meetings with the litigants, Jackson had made it clear he wanted to
complete the remedy phase of the trial quickly. On April 5 he said
he wanted a joint state-federal remedy proposal by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   That was three days after the meeting in Klein's conference room
in which the group had reached consensus on the ops-aps breakup
strategy (though the department had much work to do on the details
of its proposal). But the last the states had heard, the Justice
Department was proposing a range of conduct remedies to Posner.
</P>
<P>
   And Harry First, a senior official in the New York attorney
general's office, said the states figured ``the judge didn't want
two different opinions in front of him.'' The states also believed,
``after Justice's performance in the settlement talks, that it was
not at all likely they would go for a structural remedy,'' another
state official said, so ``we decided we would devise as long a list
of conduct remedies as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-April the centerpiece of the states' evolving proposal
was three ideas that Miller called ``conduct plus'' remedies. The
first was to prevent Microsoft from adding new products to Windows
unless they were distributed on a separate disk that users could
chose whether to install. The second was to require Microsoft to
divest itself of Internet Explorer, the Web browser that is part of
Windows. It would be put in a separate company. And the third was
to require Microsoft to create versions of its package of
applications software, Microsoft Office, for other operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas and others were proposed at meeting of the attorneys
general in Chicago on April 13. All the states but Louisiana
attended. Even the states that opposed structural remedies, notably
Ohio and Illinois, seemed to like the ideas. ``They seemed pretty
interested,'' Miller said. So the states prepared a list of conduct
remedies, with those three ideas at the center.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department, meanwhile, officials were talking to
industry leaders about the ops-aps idea, and other short-term
conduct remedies to go with it. Soon after, Klein took the idea to
Attorney General Janet Reno for approval, and she gave it.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of all this, the states decided to send the
Justice Department a copy of their proposal, unsolicited. ``We
wanted to get it to Justice as soon as we could,'' First said.
Another official said, ``We hoped it would prompt some discussion
with them,'' because so far there had been no substantive contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department did not respond substantively even to
this, though Klein did tell Miller, ``I can see you put a lot of
work into this,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Work continued on the state plan, but experts consulted by the
states began pointing out significant problems with some proposals.
For example, what if Microsoft simply reported, a year later, that
it had been unable to create a version of its Office software for
Linux, another operating system? What recourse would the attorneys
general have?
</P>
<P>
   Then, on April 17, Klein individually called Miller, Blumenthal
and Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer of New York. He told them
they would be surprised and pleased by the federal proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be more aggressive than what you are considering
now,'' Miller quoted Klein as saying. One knowledgeable person said
Klein was trying to signal his department's direction without being
specific; he was afraid of leaks.
</P>
<P>
   But none drew the conclusion that Klein seemed to intend. ``He
didn't convey a whole lot,'' said First, who was on the call with
Spitzer. ``From my point of view, as we were trying to draft
something, it was sort of meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said, ``The conversation wasn't very specific.''
</P>
<P>
   And Miller said, ``I thought maybe he was saying they were going
to come up with some proposals in the midrange, conduct-plus sort
of things.'' So the state research continued, but experts and
analysts began poking more and more holes in the proposals. ``It
got very frustrating,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on April 20, Klein convened a conference call with his
aides and the same three attorneys general. He told them exactly
what the Justice Department intended to propose: the ops-aps idea
along with a set of conduct remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat surprised,'' Miller said. So were the others.
``But the more I thought about it,'' he added, ``I was pleased'' _
particularly since the states' proposal was rapidly falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he asked Klein how he had come to his proposal. He
said Klein told him: ``We looked at conduct plus, like you did. But
we came to the conclusion that it wouldn't work as well as we had
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the states had come to the same conclusion, ``but we
hadn't announced it.'' So the states embraced the federal plan,
noting that many elements were identical to their own.
</P>
<P>
   Now all of them have to wait for the decision of the judge.
``It's not appropriate to speculate on how he will proceed or how
he will rule,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   But with a chuckle, another official said, ``I would bet he'll
reach his decision more easily than we did.''

WILL MAGIC BE WORKED ON CLIPPERS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Magic Johnson looks around the NBA and sees his contemporaries
everywhere. Michael Jordan is a part-owner/general manager in
Washington. Larry Bird is coaching in Indiana. Isiah Thomas is
being courted by Atlanta. Byron Scott seems certain to land a
head-coaching job this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson might own a small percentage of the Lakers, but he knows
his name, personality, knowledge and skills could probably be best
used to turn around a franchise. And there's a perfect opportunity
for him to perform some Magic on a certain troubled team in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's the Clippers. Perhaps it seems strange to Laker fans,
but Johnson would be willing to offer himself to the woebegone
organization, if given a percentage of the team and complete
control over personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But someone with the Clippers has to call him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows where I live,'' Johnson said. ``I won't toot my
horn.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: He's available if the Clippers make the right
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson certainly has a good handle on the current mess that
management has made of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until they have people who want to win and put people in the
right positions, they won't,'' Johnson said. ``You can't do it with
a low payroll and what they've been doing for 20-some years. I
don't know what's the problem, but they have one.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson knows he would immediately add credibility to the
Clippers' sorry reputation, probably even more than Jordan did in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on right now (in the NBA), you have to give fans
a sign (for hope),'' Johnson said. ``You have to bring in free
agents.''
</P>
<P>
   And he knows he could convince a free agent to come to L.A. and
play for the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, no free agents even want to look at them. Look
who's out there: Tim Duncan, Eddie Jones, Grant Hill, Tracy
McGrady. If they were serious about winning, they could get one of
those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``But none of those players will even look at them. Orlando,
Miami ... those are the teams they are talking about now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tantalizing scenario, watching Johnson run a franchise
that could be $11 million under the salary cap. He might even be
willing to coach the team.
</P>
<P>
   But it will never happen. Clippers owner Donald Sterling would
sooner re-sign Maurice Taylor to a $71 million contract than
relinquish a piece of his franchise, even if it is rotten.
</P>
<P>
   It's still something Johnson thinks about, but he knows bold
moves that make sense and excite fans have never been a trademark
of the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been down this road too many times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SINKING IN SEATTLE: The Sonics are not going down quietly, but
unfortunately for them, it's mostly been off the court.
</P>
<P>
   There's rampant speculation that coach Paul Westphal will be
fired after the season. Guard Gary Payton was fined $10,000 for
refusing to speak to reporters, and owner Barry Ackerley underwent
surgery Friday for an unspecified cardiac procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But the real fireworks began with a published report that
forward Chuck Person had checked himself into Game 2 when Westphal
wasn't looking. Westphal and Person both denied the story.
</P>
<P>
   But when Person was questioned about the story, he exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know why we are losing?'' he shouted. ``It's all
of your fault. This team is working its (rear ends) off, and you
guys are making it lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole incident left Westphal exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with his sentiment, but it's not the media's fault we
are losing,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Westphal. He thought the Sonics' usual hijinks would be
eliminated by keeping Vernon ``Mad Max'' Maxwell off the playoff
roster.
</P>
<P>
   REUNITED: There's one player who wouldn't mind playing for the
Clippers. Former point guard Darrick Martin, currently with the
Kings, has an opt-out clause in his contract after the season and
would like to return to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Nuggets are ready to approach the Clippers
regarding free-agent guard Derek Anderson. Denver would like to
offer guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad in a sign-and-trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to work with the Clippers to help them get back
something in return,'' Nuggets coach Dan Issel said.
</P>
<P>
   SWIFT TURNAROUND: LSU forward Stromile Swift is apparently
getting ready to turn pro, despite previously saying he intended to
stay in college. Swift is hearing the legitimate talk that he could
be a top-five pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   If the draft were held today, the top five picks probably would
be Cincinnati forward Kenyon Martin, Iowa State forward Marcus
Fizer, Swift, Minnesota center Joel Pryzbilla and Cincinnati
forward DerMarr Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   RETREAD DEPT.: Lenny Wilkens barely left Atlanta before the
Hawks were going to fire him, and his name already appeared on the
short lists of New Jersey, Washington and Seattle. He will get a
formal interview with the Wizards next week. Isn't Bill Fitch
available?
</P>
<P>
   At least Detroit is expected to do the right thing this week by
signing George Irvine to a long-term deal. Irvine's presence is
expected to be the only chance the Pistons will have retaining
Grant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ROGERS REWARDED: Phoenix forward Rodney Rogers will officially
be named the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year on Monday. &QL;

Astros walk away with win over Brewers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MILWAUKEE _ Considering how eager baseball teams are to sell
sponsorships and naming rights, it's a wonder no one managed to get
the March of Dimes lined up for this one.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they are synonymous with walkathons.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros drew 14 walks, a club record for nine innings, en
route to a 10-3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday
afternoon. After drawing 11 walks in the first game of the series,
the Astros tied a 56-year-old record National League record for
walks in consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined for 25 walks Saturday and just 12 hits,
including five by the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an ugly game all around,'' Astros first baseman Jeff
Bagwell said. ``That wasn't much fun for either club. This game was
such a debacle that it's hard to get a feel for how the game went.
The only good thing that came out of it was that we got a win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won consecutive games for only the third time this
season, the first since beating St. Louis on April 12 and San Diego
on April 14. The only other back-to-back victories for the Astros
came in the first two games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   With a victory in one of the next two games, the Astros could
win a series for the first time since taking two of three in the
season-opening set at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're capable of throwing up six or seven wins in a row, and
now would be a good time to do that,'' Astros shortstop Tim Bogar
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers are running a promotion this weekend called ``Spring
Madness,'' and most of the seats in County Stadium could be had for
less than $4. Nevertheless, the paying public still had every right
to cry rip-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a very entertaining game,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said. ``But at least we came out on the good side of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Astros starter Scott Elarton nor his Brewers
counterpart, Everett Stull, managed to throw more strikes than
balls in their abbreviated outings. Stull was yanked after 3
innings, and Elarton's poor control cost him a victory despite
being supported by 10 runs. Elarton, who walked eight batters, was
done after throwing 103 pitches in just 4 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually don't struggle to throw strikes,'' said Elarton, who
walked only one batter in his previous start, a six-inning outing
against the Padres. ``But I just couldn't figure it out. That was
pretty obvious all day long. I couldn't make an adjustment. I
tried, but I just never could do it. I'm not happy with the way I
pitched, but we won the game, and that's the main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Maddux pitched 2 scoreless innings to get the win, and Jay
Powell and Jose Cabrera worked a scoreless inning apiece to close
out the victory. It was a solid effort by the Astros' bullpen,
which got a much-needed rest thanks to Chris Holt's one-hit shutout
in the first game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Stull, who allowed seven runs but only one hit, set the tone for
the day by walking Craig Biggio and Roger Cedeno on his first eight
pitches. Two batters later, Stull walked Ken Caminiti with the
bases loaded to force home the first run of the game. Richard
Hidalgo also drew a bases-loaded walk, and Mitch Meluskey had a
sacrifice fly as the Astros took a 3-0 lead in the top of the first
inning, which lasted 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a game where you didn't even think about
swinging the bat,'' Bogar said. ``I heard a comment on the bench
that (Stull) will throw four balls before he throws a strike, so
just stand there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros sent nine batters to the plate in the first, fourth
and fifth innings, scoring four runs in the fourth and three more
in the fifth. Caminiti drew his second bases-loaded walk in the
fourth, and Daryle Ward had a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti drove in two runs in a more conventional manner with a
fifth-inning single, while Bagwell kept the theme of the day alive
in that inning with the fourth bases-loaded walk of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to be patient in situations like this,'' Bagwell
said. ``It's hard enough to hit in the big leagues, but it's even
harder when you're trying to hit (pitches out of the strike
zone).''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers left the bases loaded against Elarton in the second,
third and fourth innings before his good fortune finally ran its
course. Lyle Mouton's three-run homer in the fifth put the Brewers
on the scoreboard, and Elarton lasted only two more batters. The
24-year-old righthander fell two outs shy of qualifying for his
first win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end I was just trying to throw the ball down the middle
of the plate and make them hit it,'' Elarton said. ``Mouton made me
pay.''

EDITORS: KELLEY MC IS CQ &HT;    
 &HT;    SUSPECT IN SLAYING OF A&AMP;M STUDENT LURKED IN SHADOWS OF INTERNET
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
and JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Kelly had her charms, for sure. She was 21,
strikingly pretty and didn't go in for wild body-piercing or
tattoos. Even better, she attended Texas A&AMP;M University. Proximity
was the biggest plus.
</P>
<P>
   Or so Scott Schneider, a psychology major and creator of the
``Aggie channel'' Internet chat room, first thought. It was Sept. 3
when he met ``Kelley mc'' online. He knew little about this ``nice
girl'' other than that she seemed to care about his life. Yet, for
a girl so close, she sure was hard to meet in person.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Kelly wasn't a person at all. She was instead,
according to an arrest warrant, a 31-year-old San Antonio man named
Kenny Wayne Lockwood.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood, police believe, used the anonymity of the Internet to
pose as a young woman and converse with men at Texas A&AMP;M. When one
student, Kerry J. Kujawa, got too close, police believe Lockwood
shot him in the back of the head and dumped his body in a Hays
County field.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, police arrested Lockwood at a hospital in San
Antonio. He confessed to the killing, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorm roommate Charlie Branham last saw Kujawa April 7, leaving
College Station, hoisting a blue duffel bag and saying he was en
route to San Antonio to meet his Internet interest, Kelly. She was
having problems with some other guy and needed help, Kujawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a face-to-face meeting with his elusive
correspondent, the 20-year-old mechanical engineering major with a
prestigious scholarship met his death. His body was found April 19,
about 500 feet from a cattle guard on a Hill Country ranch near
Dripping Springs. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy
could not say for certain what day he died.
</P>
<P>
   During the week and a half that he was missing, posts from
Kujawa continued to appear in an Internet chat room. Kelly also
chatted, sharing happy news that the two were engaged. She was
going to meet Kujawa's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kelly ever met Kujawa, she had a bumpy relationship with
Schneider. Some of the tumults played out in the chat room in front
of other anonymous participants. Regulars took sides, some with
Schneider, others with Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Schneider to doubt Kelly's very
existence, at the very least, her gender. He had his reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship started promisingly. Schneider and Kelly
chatted several times a day, every day, for about two months.
Almost from the beginning, Schneider wanted to meet Kelly, but she
kept putting him off with one excuse or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a dating relationship,'' Schneider said Friday. ``It
was more of like a friendship thing because I made it clear that it
wasn't going to be a personal, intimate relationship until I met a
girl. I just made that clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider tried to arrange a date to attend an A&AMP;M football
game. Kelly couldn't make it but her little brother ``Isaac'' would
love to go, she said. Schneider agreed. Maybe, Isaac could share
details about his interesting sister, Schneider thought.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider found Isaac to be something of an oddball. For one
thing, Isaac's teeth were very yellow, almost green, Schneider
said. Also, Isaac seemed very cautious in what he said,
circumspect, as if trying to say something Schneider might want to
hear. And although he claimed to be 19, he looked more like he was
30, Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider's suspicions would not be confirmed until months later
when police showed him a photograph of ``Isaac,'' who in reality
was Lockwood.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider's relationship with Kelly deteriorated after the
meeting with her ``little brother.'' Kelly, it seemed, always had
an excuse for not seeing him or even talking to him on the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   To placate his concerns, Kelly sent pictures. The photographs
were of a slender, attractive brunette with hazel eyes. In the chat
room, she shared stories about a large ranch where she had ridden
horses and gone deer hunting. She said she shot a deer, but then
wept when she saw it was dead. That comment _ an unusual reaction
if this were a man, Schneider thought _ somewhat assuaged him.
Still, he could not shake his skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I started having doubts that this person was real
because they wouldn't call or weren't what they said they were,
then I tried to cut off a lot of communication,'' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   He went so far as to block Kelly from entering the chat room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a lot of things to prevent future contact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider lifted the ban in January after an outcry from Kelly's
chat room friends.
</P>
<P>
   Karey Lynn Lee, a moderator at the chat room, knew the frequent
visitor named Kelly as a female pre-law student at A&AMP;M. Lee, of
Etoile, and other chat room regulars _ some from as far away as
Australia _ congratulated Kelly on her engagement announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the virtual world, I knew her very well,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and others got to know Kelly last fall in the chat room
where Aggies and others play trivia games about A&AMP;M traditions, as
well as general topics such as science, history, geography and
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly was always talking about her new boyfriend,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee doesn't recall being online at the same time as Kujawa and
Kelly. But he said Lockwood had more personas than just Kelly.
Lockwood also logged on to chat rooms as Kelly's little sister
``Kate.'' Kate was Internet savvy, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   On Good Friday, Lee received his final message from Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and Kerry were on their way to Houston to spend Easter
with his parents. The ruse was still going on,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed normal that she would go with Kujawa for Easter, so
Lee and others thought nothing of it. However, on Sunday, the
friend in Australia told Lee she'd heard a rumor that Kelly's
boyfriend had been found dead and that Kelly was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured out what had happened,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lee went to the Texas Rangers with his information
and identified others in the chat room who had talked with Kelley.
On Tuesday, the investigators located Schneider, who had Isaac's
phone number on his caller ID. He gave it to police, and it turned
out to be Lockwood's number.
</P>
<P>
   One reason other chat room visitors weren't suspicious was that
Kujawa continued to log in and chat online, even after he was
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Branham said he received a message from his roommate on April 9.
The message was sent from Kelly's screen name. The sender
identified himself as Kujawa and said he would be staying with
Kelly through April 10. The sender also wrote that Kelly's little
brother would be coming to College Station. Don't be surprised, the
sender told Burnham, if the little brother should turn up in the
dormitory room.
</P>
<P>
   The little brother did, at least that's who Branham assumed he
was. He found the man sitting at Kujawa's computer. Kujawa's blue
duffel bag was on the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider believes it was Lockwood posing again as little
brother Isaac. He assumes Lockwood was trying to destroy evidence
at the computer, perhaps a sign that the slaying was not
well-planned.
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;M police force, the Hays County Sheriff's Department and
the Texas Rangers tracked Lockwood down by piecing together the
complex computer relationship. After identifying Kujawa's body,
they began piecing together the computer puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M University Police Director Bob Wiatt still uses a pen and
paper or a telephone to communicate. He said Kujawa's mother begs
everyone to be careful while on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Kujawa is telling everybody, `My God, be wary of the
Internet and who you're speaking with,''' Wiatt said. ``Her son was
killed because he believed that this girl, Kelly, was really
Kelly.''

ORIOLES, MUSSINA ADD TO RANGERS' WOES

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates freely predicted before
the season his team might get off to a slow start and get better as
the year went along.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not quite what he expected. A slow start is one
thing, but burying yourself early is another. The Rangers are in
danger of doing just that after a 3-1 loss to the Baltimore Orioles
yesterday afternoon at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mussina's complete-game performance for the Orioles handed
the Rangers their 10th loss in 12 games and left them 8-15 on the
season. It's the most losses in April in club history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going in the direction we want to go,'' Oates said
``We preach patience. We want to be patient but ... we're missing
something. I thought we would be more consistent. To think we'd
start \R8-15\S ... I honestly thought our offense would be more
consistent top to bottom, I thought our bullpen would be a whole
lot better and I thought our defense had a shot at being better
than it's shown.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting proved to be the Rangers' downfall yesterday against
Mussina. They managed only one infield hit through four innings,
then, after a few balls got through or fell in, they were 1-for-8
with runners in scoring position over the last five innings.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that the Rangers had to go against one of the
best right-handers in the American League without three of their
best left-handed hitters. The Rangers have Rusty Greer and Frank
Catalanotto on the disabled list, and Rafael Palmeiro couldn't
start yesterday because of a strained left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a little different; it would make it a little
tougher for him if you could throw more left-handers out there,''
shortstop Royce Clayton said. ``But that's `what if.' ... You can't
look at it that way. You have to give him credit. He pitched a
great game. Sure, we're missing a couple of bats in the lineup ,but
we should have better efforts than what we've shown the past couple
of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Mussina said it's a much different lineup, both without the
left-handers and the players the Rangers lost in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much different team,'' Mussina said. ``Even their
colors are different. It's almost like they're not the Texas
Rangers anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates knew there would be a change, but he didn't expect the
Rangers to slip this much so soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get better, yeah. But when you've been in this
game 34 years, your gut tells you something. That edge is not
there,'' Oates said. ``We don't have it right now, and it's up to
me to find it. My job is to find a way with this personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers used to be able to count on their offense to bash
the opposing team into submission. But with some big bats missing
from last year, that's no longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no margin for error when you're scoring two or three
runs a game, whether it's pitching, base running, defense,'' Oates
said. ``This team is eventually going to score runs, but it's going
to take time to get the offense going. Those other things can be
made better now.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro didn't start, but he did pinch hit in the tense ninth
inning, when the Rangers broke up Mussina's shutout bid with a
leadoff double from Chad Curtis and David Segui's one-out
run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   After Ruben Mateo singled and Gabe Kapler popped out, Palmeiro
came to the plate to pinch hit for catcher Bill Haselman. But
Mussina walked him to load the bases, then got Mike Lamb to fly out
to right to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Oliver took the loss, but Oates said, ``Three runs beat
us today. In today's game, you'll lead the league if you can give
up three runs. You'll run away with it. But I wouldn't want us to
have one on the other side.''

RANGERS PITCHER THOMPSON HAS NEXT REHAB START POSTPONED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Rangers pitcher Justin Thompson was forced to shut
down his bullpen throwing session yesterday after feeling pain in
his left shoulder and has been scratched from Tuesday's start for
the Tulsa Drillers.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson underwent shoulder surgery Aug. 27 to repair a torn
labrum, and the Rangers had been hoping he was close to joining
their rotation. He has made three starts on a medical
rehabilitation assignment in the minors, but the Rangers don't know
when he'll throw again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated, yeah, but I'm not going to get discouraged,''
Thompson said. ``I talked to Dr. \RJohn\S Conway, and he said if
I'm feeling any discomfort, not to try throwing through it at this
stage.'' Conway is the Rangers' orthopedic consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson threw 25 pitches in the bullpen yesterday and said
``three or four pinched me pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to leave manager Johnny Oates concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, anytime somebody says they have a sharp pain at the
point of surgery,'' Oates said. ``I don't know a whole lot right
now, but I have no idea when his next rehab assignment will be. ...
That's a pretty big change.''
</P>
<P>
   However, trainer Danny Wheat said, ``It's just a little bump in
the road. He's very fortunate it hasn't happened before. It's
unrealistic to think he could have gone through this thing without
a setback.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are calling it inflammation in the shoulder, and
Wheat said the Rangers aren't planning for Thompson to undergo
X-rays or an MRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't put a timetable on it,'' Thompson said. ``I'm
going to let it calm down, and when I can throw a little bit in the
bullpen without discomfort, then we'll go again.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who was acquired from the Detroit Tigers in the Juan
Gonzalez trade, was scheduled to pitch Tuesday for the Tulsa
Drillers. If all had gone well in that game, the Rangers were
planning on his pitching for them against the Oakland Athletics
five days later.
</P>
<P>
   His last outing was Tuesday for the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks.
He pitched 5 2/3 innings and threw 102 pitches, allowing eight runs
on 10 hits. His 30-day medical rehabilitation assignment ends May
15. At that point he must be activated or put back on the disabled
list.

EVEN BEFORE FIGHTING _ AND DYING _ IN VIETNAM, STEVEN SZIJJARTO WAS
NO STRANGER TO BATTLING COMMUNISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAMEGO, Kan. _ On a windy March day in 1967, the first of
Wamego's Vietnam War funerals took place _ that of Sgt. Steven
Szijjarto, 26.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wamego saw three more of its sons killed in the war,
which ended 25 years ago today, Szijjarto's burial is the one that
most remember here. For Vietnam wasn't Szijjarto's first fight
against communism.
</P>
<P>
   Szijjarto was a refugee from the 1956 Hungarian revolt, a
``freedom fighter.'' He survived that fighting, but was killed 10
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in the head after jumping from a helicopter in a ``hot''
landing zone, he was one of 626 Kansans and 1,411 Missourians who
died in the war, who came home in aluminum caskets to towns big and
small.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, I remember,'' said Katie Glynn, who was at St.
Bernard's Catholic Church the other day. She remembers the
incredible dignity of Szijjarto's foster parents, Fred and Helen
Kilian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army had come early in the morning to notify them that
he'd been killed, and they came directly to the church. Right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Szijjarto's burial in St. Bernard's cemetery, north on Kansas
99, didn't occur, however, until March 30, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The delay was caused by what then was an everyday reality _ the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Szijjarto was born in Hungary in 1940. In 1956, the Hungarian
revolution erupted. Szijjarto, 16, picked up a gun and fought
against the security police and the invading Soviet army.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Deak, Szijjarto's buddy from those days, remembered that
he had a Tommy gun and Szijjarto an old rifle. Deak said ``it was
very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Szijjarto, Deak, and a young kid named Nick Edvy fled to
Austria. Those three, like thousands of others, ended up in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Deak went to Michigan; Szijjarto and Edvy were placed with the
Kilians. Neither boy spoke English. They would point at something
and the Kilians would say the English word.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember is how big the sky was,'' said Edvy, now 56, a
retired captain in the Riley County police force who lives in
nearby Manhattan. ``And bananas. I'd never eaten a banana before I
came to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were free. We'd get in the Kilians' Oldsmobile and maybe go
up to Concordia. Just do it. That would be a trip that would take
days and all kinds of planning in Hungary if you could make it at
all. Things like that absolutely blew me away.''
</P>
<P>
   Right out of high school and well before Vietnam, Szijjarto
joined the U.S. Army. By 1965, Edvy had been drafted and was in
Vietnam running truck convoys to and from fire bases. It was
dangerous duty. Edvy wrote Szijjarto, his ``brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `You don't want to come here,''' said Edvy. ``I
told him that we were pulling our punches. We weren't fighting to
win. He wrote back that he had to come. Steven knew the communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven had never finished that war in Hungary.''
</P>
<P>
   Szijjarto was killed in December, within 30 days of arriving in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, because Szijjarto had a mother and sisters still in
Hungary, shipped the body to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarians wouldn't accept it. The casket was stored in a
warehouse in Germany. There were negotiations. After almost three
months the Hungarians refused to change their minds. Edvy
remembered their stated reason was that Szijjarto was a traitor
because he'd fought against the communist state in the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The body was shipped back to America. Finally there was the
funeral, with hundreds packing the cemetery here. Among them was
Alf Landon, the former Republican candidate for president of the
United States. Landon didn't know Szijjarto. He was there, he said,
as a matter of simple respect.
</P>
<P>
   After the service the crowd ebbed. And the war went on.
Eventually, Wamego would see three more burials.
</P>
<P>
   Two were brought back in 1968 _ John G. Southall, 22, a Marine
corporal who'd been wounded once and then died of injuries in a
jeep accident, and Spec. 4 Michael C. Zeller, 20, a medic killed in
a firefight.
</P>
<P>
   In spring 1969, David Lee Kitchen, 19, a Marine lance corporal,
came home. He died of ``hostile fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Southall, who is buried in the Wamego City cemetery, was also an
immigrant. He was born in London. His father, Fred Southall, who
died in 1991, had been a British soldier in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Zeller is buried in the Catholic cemetery in St. Marys, just
east of here. His mother Bertha, 73, still lives on the south side
of Wamego.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other misfortunes for the Zellers over the
years. Bertha's husband and the father of Michael is in a home in
Manhattan with Alzheimer's disease. Their youngest son, Pat, 50,
lives at home, paralyzed from the waist down and in a wheelchair
since 1959 when he was struck by a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Michael got killed it just tore this family up,'' said
Pat Zeller. ``Never been the same since. But, you know how it is,
life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen was the last young man to come home. He was buried in a
small cemetery in Michigan Valley. Lyle Honig, who's worked at the
Wamego Times since the 1950s, said the Kitchens have been gone from
town for years.
</P>
<P>
   Time does heal some wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Edvy has been back to Hungary several times. He has seen
Szijjarto's family. They want the body to remain here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what Steven is in Hungary now?'' asked Edvy. ``He's a
hero.''

BRILLIANT MEMORIES FROM A DESOLATE ASSIGNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The job sounded perfect for a meteorologist:
be a weatherman on a tropical island in the South Pacific. Palm
trees. Ocean breezes. Great pay.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Lowden applied. And in 1973 he flew to a place few people
ever visit: Wake Island.
</P>
<P>
   What he hadn't thought about was the isolation. The population
was 150 _ all men. No television. Infrequent mail. No phone. And
the only news came from a scratchy shortwave radio _ between
high-pitched squeals. ``The lack of news didn't seem to bother
anyone else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cheered when I heard that Nixon resigned,'' said Lowden, one
of the few civilians on the island back then. ``And the commanding
officer reprimanded me. I learned to keep my political views to
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese, the sleepy island
immediately awoke. It became one of the few places where Vietnam
refugees could stay until they were transferred to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two weeks the island's population grew from 150 to
8,000 _ men, women, children and babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly we were madly building tents and cleaning up old
buildings,'' he said. ``The air base brought in doctors, nurses,
dentists, teachers and even set up a chow hall to serve Vietnamese
food. We had two weeks' notice. Then the refugees arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowden captured it all with his camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of shy, but the camera was a great way to meet
them,'' said the Kansas Citian, now 59. ``I just wanted to
experience people again. I missed beautiful women and kids. To have
squealing, giggling kids around me _ that was wonderful. I tried to
give them a sense that America would be OK, that they could put
roots down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowden befriended many refugees. Once, a Vietnamese mother asked
him with tears in her eyes whether he would adopt some of her
children _ she had heard rumors that large families were going to
be split up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really touched me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later he helped some refugees find sponsors on the
East Coast and in the Midwest. Lowden moved to Kansas City in 1978
and now teaches philosophy at Maple Woods and Longview community
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 a flood in his basement destroyed all letters, addresses
and anything else he had connected to the refugees at Wake. Luckily
the hundreds of photos he had snapped during those four months in
1975 were upstairs. He had been looking at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried and tried on the Internet to find some of the
families that I met there,'' Lowden said. ``But I've had no luck.
It would thrill me to meet anyone who went through Wake back then.
I might even have pictures of them or their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that made Wake Island a bright spot for me were
those people. Otherwise it would have been the most desolate memory
of my life.''

25 YEARS AFTER THE FALL OF SAIGON: A JUNGLE OF MEMORIES

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For a nation, the cost of fighting a war is
measurable: in bodies crushed and lost, in commitments made and
broken, in prestige gained and squandered.
</P>
<P>
   For those whose lives were touched by the Vietnam War _ combat
veterans, refugees, families and friends of the American and
Vietnamese dead _ the price cannot be gauged.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans cope with flashbacks, alienation, bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees mourn the loss of home and family.
</P>
<P>
   Families and friends of the dead pay the steepest price of all:
the relentless imagining of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago the Vietnam War ended, after taking more
than 58,000 American and 3 million Vietnamese lives. Hundreds of
thousands more had been wounded or were missing. Billions of
dollars had been spent. And a country had been torn to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   On the anniversary of Saigon's fall, The Kansas City Star offers
a few glimpses into lives touched by Vietnam _ short stories about
a few of the many who remember, a few of the many who still hurt.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At 62, Ca Ho still has the seamless face of
the young. But when asked about Vietnam, his eyes turn old as time.
</P>
<P>
   Ho left Vietnam in a desperate search for freedom after Saigon
fell, a refugee from the war that has haunted America for a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom, he discovered, had a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boat carried 170 people,'' he says in Vietnamese through
an interpreter. ``One hundred fifty-two died that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them, his wife and son.
</P>
<P>
   The horror behind his words hangs in the stillness of the Kansas
City night.
</P>
<P>
   Ho stops and then smiles at his visitors. Silence fills the room
as he pours water into tiny flowered cups. Tea leaves swirl into
figure eights of brown. He folds his hands small in his lap, and
waits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Ho's story is very sad,'' says his interpreter, Doan
Nguyen, also a Vietnam refugee who fled Saigon. ``But his story is
like so many others. We Vietnamese in Kansas City are very sad for
the 58,000 Americans and those who died in our country. They leave
family and friends. Why were they sacrificed for nothing?
</P>
<P>
   ``This anniversary is sour and bitter,'' she says, referring to
the 25th year since the fall of Saigon and the end of the war. ``In
Vietnam on Sunday, they will be celebrating and having parades.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we over here remember. We will not forget....Some people,
like Ca, remember every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Killed in action
</P>
<P>
   The man in the photograph looks familiar to Jamie Derleth _ he
has her eyes, her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   She was 1 year old when he died. Too young to remember her
24-year-old father, James ``Mack'' McClafferty, killed in action in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I remember is that I grew up hating slanty-eyed people,''
says Derleth, now 32. ``All I knew from a very young age was that
people with slanted eyes killed my dad, so I hated them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hate Asians today. But as a little girl, that was the
only way I could put a face on his death.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, 1968, two soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division
arrived at the Lee's Summit door of Diane McClafferty. The soldiers
didn't have to tell her why they were there. When she saw them _ in
their white gloves and dress uniforms _ she knew.
</P>
<P>
   The McClaffertys had two children: Jamie and 2-year-old Mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still really angry about the Vietnam War,'' says Diane
Flores, 54, now remarried to a husband she calls a wonderful man.
She became a psychiatric nurse at the Veterans Hospital. ``I felt
like, in a way, by helping the veterans I was helping my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Her children never knew their biological father. But the war
touched them in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up wanting to learn all I could about the Vietnam
War,'' says Mike McClafferty, 33, who at one time signed up to be a
Marine but withdrew his application. ``But what I've learned about
the war is mostly from the Vietnam vets I meet. They didn't offer
any courses on it when I was in college.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a Vietnamese?'' Miranda Derleth, 13, asks, after
listening to her uncle talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's someone from Vietnam,'' he says. ``It's like an Italian
is someone from Italy; an American is from America. Do you know
what the Vietnam War was?''
</P>
<P>
   She bites her lip for a second. ``Was that when Japan bombed
America?''
Forever changed
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be there in a minute,'' says Chris Woelk, yelling over
the chugging of his riding mower. Slowly he becomes a tiny speck in
the verdant fields as he shears one last row of grass next to
stubbly blackberry stalks.
</P>
<P>
   Here, 50 miles from the hubbub of Kansas City and working
beneath blue skies, Woelk, a veteran of the Vietnam War, finds
peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the open air the only sounds he hears are the occasional
cattle lowing. Or the rustle of leaves by summer breezes. The
buzzing rhapsody of insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, how many vets does it take to change a light bulb?'' he
asks, once he returns to his barn. He squints, takes a toke on an
imaginary reefer and answers: ``You'll never know ma-a-a-a-an,
'cause you weren't there!
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what most people expect to hear from a Vietnam vet,''
he says with a laugh. ``I don't see myself as the typical vet. I
feel like that time in history is so political, so historical that
I share it with people if they're interested. I don't want people
to forget the lessons we learned over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Woelk, 54, farms 116 acres in Wellington, Mo. But the Vietnam
War is planted deep in his Midwestern soul. And on each anniversary
the memories come tumbling back, usually in his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Images of deep greenery, smells of rotting earth, the stench of
human waste. The dream always begins with him crossing out each
date on his homemade calendar with a large ``X,'' watching his time
in country grow ``short.'' In 1968 this was part of Woelk's daily
ritual.
</P>
<P>
   But his dreams always morph into nightmares, reruns of the same
theme: His hitch in Vietnam is up, he returns home to Kansas, and
then the government makes a mistake and sends him back for another
tour of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sleep last night knowing we'd be talking today,''
he says. ``Yeah, I dreamed about Nam last night. Not much can keep
it from seeping into my world. It was too intense an experience. It
took me 32 years before I'd talk about it. Now I can't shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Woelk can see one benefit from the war.
</P>
<P>
   It was Aug. 15, 1968, and he been in Vietnam just a few hours.
His convoy stopped. He and another soldier slid into a ravine for
cover as others worked on the engine of the lead truck. He shared a
drink of liquor with the older soldier. Then it was time to move
out.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he turned to look at his new friend, a land mine went
off. The soldier's legs seemed to hover in the air, and then
liquified. It was over in less than a second.
</P>
<P>
   And for the next 32 years, Woelk could not lose the image.
</P>
<P>
   That night back in camp, he sat away from the others, crying.
That's when the man came over. A man that was well over 6 feet
tall, very brawny, and very black.
</P>
<P>
   For Woelk, who is white and at the time clung to racial
stereotypes, what happened next changed his world. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me it was OK to cry,'' Woelk says. ``He told me that
everybody does with their first. I couldn't believe that this man
who so intimidated me at first was so kind to me. Me a perfect
stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today Woelk cannot tell the story without tears rolling
down his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I vowed at that moment to never judge another person except
for his personality,'' Woelk says. ``If there's anything good the
war did for me, it was to open my eyes to my own prejudice....I'd
really like to go back to Vietnam for that reason.''
-- more --
</P>
<P>
   for that reason.''
The war on campus
</P>
<P>
   David Awbrey tries to show his media ethics students at the
University of Kansas what it was like on the KU campus in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He has the photos of the protests about a war that few people
understood.
</P>
<P>
   He shows his students the snapshots capturing the anger, the
intensity. He tells them about Kansas' history of activism, about
John Brown a century earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But like the smoke that billowed out of the Kansas Union in
1970, his words float away. He fails to ignite his students'
curiosity about the Vietnam War, except for one question.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always want to know how long my hair was back then,'' he
says. ``My students just aren't interested in the Vietnam War. It's
out of their realm of experience. They are interested in their own
corner of the world, however. Habitat for Humanity is really big in
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``But their version of that time in history is based on Austin
Powers and the other media stereotypes of drugs, sex and rock 'n'
roll. They don't get it that flunking out of a course back then
meant Saigon would be graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Austin Powers stereotype reduces a whole era to the point
that it obscures important issues like civil rights and America's
foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Awbrey, 51, was once a student protester. In 1969-70 he was the
student body president of KU. He was also in Army ROTC _ Reserve
Officers' Training Corps. For him Vietnam was close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The student union burned down, the city of Lawrence imposed a
curfew dusk to dawn. Forty-five students were arrested, and I was
one of them. Every day there was something happening, either there
was a bombing or a protest or a curfew. It was turmoil, turmoil,
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kent State happened, May 4th, the university closed down
the school for the rest of the semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saved me from flunking out....But the powers that be wanted
blood in the street. I tried to keep that from happening, along
with some other people, including the chancellor. I was in a unique
position to be a go-between.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Vietnam has yet to be played out, he says. Vietnam
was really a war of the classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's profoundly disturbing that the men who did go over got
screwed by the government,'' he says. ``The top priority for the
United States today should be the Vietnam veterans. They deserve
much better treatment. What's lasting from this war is the trauma
on this group of men....It's profoundly sad what happened to
them.''
Present at the fall
</P>
<P>
   He retired from the military in 1980. But Vasco Martin is still
a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a Marine, always a Marine,'' he says, with a little
chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   He's 62 and has cancer. If he lives five more years, he says, it
will be a miracle. He blames the war and Agent Orange, the
herbicide used to defoliate Vietnam's jungles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I at least came home and had 25 more years to live,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He's a native of Carrollton, Mo., and was one of the last
soldiers to leave Saigon before it fell April 30, 1975. He was head
of the security guard detail for the Defense Attache Office at Tan
Son Nhut Air Base.
</P>
<P>
   It was cloudy that day. Stores, banks, airline offices and even
the open-air markets were closed. Terror wrapped the faces of South
Vietnamese families trying to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The communists were coming. Shelling and rocket fire was heard
within miles of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was in charge of 16 other Marines. Their job was to
evacuate military personnel at the Defense Attache Office. More
than 5,000 people would be airlifted to safety from that site. An
additional 2,000 would be rescued from the U.S. Embassy, six miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was leaving South Vietnam for good. Odd, then,
that the Marines had assigned to his detail a new soldier, a
teenager, just arrived in the country days before.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers thinking: Gee, they're still sending people here
now?
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, he checked the area and gave two of his
sentries a ``thumbs up,'' and then moved on. Minutes later, at 3:45
a.m., a rocket fell at the entrance, killing both men: Darwin
Judge, 19, of Marshalltown, Mo., and Charles McMahon Jr., 21, of
Woburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The last Americans killed by hostile fire in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Martin traveled to Iowa for a ceremony remembering
Judge and McMahon, whose families were presented with the Purple
Heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of close calls in Vietnam: was shot at, ran over a
land mine in a jeep and even the last day as we were flying out of
Saigon, rockets were exploding all around us,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles. Then the smile fades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked hard all my life. I just retired, and I have a
perfect wife. Been married three years.'' He sighs. ``Yes, I'm
bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I not be? The war is still going to get me. It's
cutting my life short. But at least I wasn't left over there. A lot
of other guys were.''
Freedom's price
</P>
<P>
   For the Vietnamese community in Kansas City, Vietnam is not the
name of a war, but of their former home. A home now turned into
ugly memories of re-education camps, poverty, discrimination and
loss of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Ca Ho was a South Vietnamese policeman in Saigon. When the North
Vietnamese took over, they sent him, like thousands of others, to
the camps.
</P>
<P>
   But Ho was released after 10 days because he had no skills the
communists wanted. He and his family were condemned to the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were pushed to the forest, we had no nails. No tools.
No electricity. No water,'' he says. ``We dig holes in ground with
rocks and branches. It was very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few years the Ho family tried to survive this way. But it
was unbearable. The family planned its exodus. Destitute, they
split up: Ho and his eldest son, Dzung Viet Ho, would board a boat
first. Later they would send for Ho's wife and youngest son, and
life would smile once more.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 with the help of Catholic Charities, Ho and his son
arrived in Kansas City, two months after their passage to Thailand.
Every day they burned incense and prayed for the safety of their
family.
</P>
<P>
   The news came a year later. His wife and son's boat had sunk,
killing most everyone aboard. The date was May 7, 1981. Today it is
one of the only sentences Ho can say in perfect English.
</P>
<P>
   But moving into freedom cost him even more a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   Ho and his son tried to adjust to their new land. His son
enrolled in Northeast High School. Ho studied English at Donnelly
College. One day in 1986, Dzung went to school and never came back.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese community rallied around Ho. Missing-person
reports were filed with the police. Ho and his friends called other
Vietnamese communities across the country asking if anyone had seen
his son. But he heard no news. Learned no answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each other was all we had after the other deaths,'' he says.
``It doesn't make sense. We love each other very much. I hope he is
still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is very hard for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho spreads identification cards across the living room table.
Among them, a photo of Dzung smiling.
</P>
<P>
   It's late. A soft drumming of rain on the front porch cloaks the
stillness of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom is expensive,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Would he do it again, knowing what would happen?
</P>
<P>
   Ho slides the photos back into an envelope. He waits, then
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he would do it all again,'' the translator says. ``He
says, freedom is worth everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even life.''
</P>

FOREIGN AID TOO OFTEN GIVES LEADERS A LICENSE TO STEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, like planets aligning, items in the news fall into a
logical and illuminating conjunction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case on that recent day when it was reported in a
dispatch out of Geneva that Swiss authorities have begun filing
charges in the alleged looting of Nigeria's treasury by one of that
country's former dictators. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The $650 million found in Swiss bank accounts of Sani Abacha,
his family members and cronies surpasses by a full $100 million the
amount stashed there by Ferdinand Marcos during his long misrule in
the Philippines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, a story out of New York on that same day told of a new
United Nations report whose conclusion was that bad government is
one of the chief reasons why many nations remain desperately poor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's astonishing that something so obvious and so widely known
by so many for so long should now be regarded as news at all. The
real news is that the unsayable has finally been said aloud _ and
by the agency that is the largest single aid-distributor on the
planet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The report by the U.N. Development Program calls into question
some of the long-held assumptions about the development process. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The worst fallacy is belief that top-down foreign aid _
assistance provided to central governments _ will be used to
improve the lives of the worst-off, when the truth is that
frequently it never reaches the intended beneficiaries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, much of it is simply stolen by those in power at the
top, or diverted to pet projects that serve their personal or
political interests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and early 1970s, there was a genuine hope that
assistance from the wealthy countries could, over a reasonable span
of years, raise the most impoverished peoples out of absolute
misery and put them on the way, if not to prosperity, at least to
bearable lives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, however, conditions in many parts of the Third
World were seen actually to worsen by every objective measure:
widening illiteracy, poor nutrition, increased infant mortality,
shortened life expectancy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, enthusiasm for development aid began to flag. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Examples of rotten rulers have been legion, but Joseph Mobutu
was the poster boy. He was our client, and one of the larger
recipients of U.S. support. The Congo _ Zaire under his rule _ was
strategically placed and immensely rich in natural resources, yet
its people continued to suffer terribly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An estimate toward the end of his reign put the one-time
colonial soldier's personal worth at nearly $13 billion. In plain
words, Mobutu built his fortune by stealing us and his own country
blind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In such intractable places, the report declares, the old
strategies simply don't work. When the regime at the top is inept
or corrupt, help can't reach the targeted needs. Therefore, if
development is to occur, aid's top priority must be to foster
honest and capable governments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such talk evokes wounded squeals from Third World tyrants, who
complain that donor countries are attempting to meddle in their
internal affairs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The powerful, it is argued, have /{always/} enriched themselves.
And they have /{always/} showered the blessings of rule on their
kinfolk, their clans, their villages and tribes. It's the tradition
in such places. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, the aid-givers have a tradition, too. When they invest in
something, they expect a result. Recipient nations will do well to
understand that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when they could play West and East against each
other, but that time is past. The Cold War has ended. The world _
and the rules _ have changed. &QL;

HOME RUNS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Former Dodgers shortstop and manager Bill
Russell stood on the fake grass at Tropicana Field in Florida last
weekend, holding a baseball in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, now a bench coach for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, flipped
the ball around like he was a child with a new toy. The seams on
the baseball are so flat, he noted. The ball is so hard, more like
a golf ball.
</P>
<P>
   Russell didn't say it, but you had to believe he was thinking,
``If they used this ball when I played, I could've hit home runs
like Kevin Elster.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball commissioner Bud Selig claims the ball is the same.
Sure it is. And Enron Field in a pitcher's park.
</P>
<P>
   The home run has always been a fan favorite. Even the term
``home run'' has meaning beyond the baseball park. But now, it is
also baseball's cash cow. It is baseball's Golden Goose.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa showed exactly how important the
home run was to fans, and consequently, the owners' pocketbooks. So
baseball, it seems, made a business decision. Make the ball harder.
Make the parks smaller. Expansion means more teams, which means
diluted pitching. Umps, don't be afraid to squeeze the strikezone.
Players, go ahead and use Andro, Creatine, etc. Bulk up.
</P>
<P>
   Selig won't admit to any conspiracy theory, but the evidence is
in.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have hit 52 homers in April, more than any team in
April in baseball history (and for those who bash the American
League for its lack of pitching, the Cardinals play in the National
League).
</P>
<P>
   At Houston's Enron Park, there have been 46 homers in 12 games.
Last season in the Astrodome, there were 118 homers in 81 games.
Suffice it to say, that number will be surpassed sometime in June.
</P>
<P>
   But the best evidence is all around us. Home runs are being hit
everywhere, by everybody. Through Friday, there were 20 players on
a pace to hit 50-plus homers this season. There were seven players
on a pace to hit 60-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's early. But to put it in perspective, one only needs
to look at the 1980s. Nobody during the decade hit 50 homers in a
season. Between Cincinnati's George Foster in 1977 and Detroit's
Cecil Fielder in 1990, not a single player hit 50. Fielder was the
first American League hitter to get 50 since Roger Maris and Mickey
Mantle in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jermaine Dye is on a pace for 77.
</P>
<P>
   Even before McGwire and Sosa hit it big, baseball was moving
toward the home run ball. Before Fielder in 1990, the 50-homer mark
had been reached only 17 times by 10 players in major-league
history. Since Fielder, six players have done it 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   That's just the way it is now. Baseball determined what the
owners needed to make money. But is it what baseball needed?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Angels manager Mike Scioscia, who played the entire
decade of the '80s, when hitting 30 homers in a season was a big
deal. ``Power is part of the game and it gets a lot of notoriety.
But for every Tony Gwynn, there are three Mark McGwires as far as
guys coming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the run total gets higher and higher, a lot of strategy is
washed under the bridge. We stole four bases in a game against
Toronto and it didn't mean a thing as far as the outcome. Playing
for one run early these days plays into the other manager's hands,
because he can sit back and wait for his guys to pound the ball. A
lot of strategy used for a long, long time might be phased out.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia was quick to note that players today are bigger and
stronger, and consequently there will be more power in the game.
What he said doesn't make sense is juicing the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia remembered when the Angels played an exhibition game
against Cal State Fullerton just before the start of the season.
The Titans used their own college baseballs when they pitched, and
the ball had considerably less jump off the bat than when his
pitchers threw the major-league baseballs to the Titans hitters.
(Please, no jokes about the Angels pitching).
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope nobody is playing with the specifics of the ball,'' he
said. ``The game did pretty well for the first 120 years.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;

appears every other week. &QL;

FICK TRYING TO FIND HIS PLACE IN DETROIT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Fick hears the cliche all the time, but he refuses to
utter the popular phrase of professional athletes without adding to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be here,'' he said, rolling his eyes and not
sounding excited as he sat in the dugout before a recent game.
``But not that happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fick was forced to be a spectator last season. He doesn't want
to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a month into what he hopes will be his first full season
in the major leagues, Fick has spent far more time on the Detroit
Tigers' bench than playing. Not playing last season because he was
rehabilitating from shoulder surgery was difficult enough, but not
playing when he is healthy is more discouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Being asked to play positions other than catcher and being on a
team with the worst record in the major leagues doesn't make coping
easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' Fick said. ``I'm sure you know the line
</P>
<P>
   you hear a lot of people say they'd do anything just to be in
the big leagues and it's great just to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well ... it's just like playing Little League. You want to
play every day, no matter where you're at.''
</P>
<P>
   Fick's first taste of not playing came in 1999 when he injured
his left shoulder taking a swing during spring training. He needed
surgery that left him on the disabled list until September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back on it, it's probably one of the better things
that ever happened to me,'' said Fick, who was dealing with
off-field problems such as the death of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked forward to getting on the field and trying to forget
about everything, and I ended up being hurt,'' he said. ``I spent
the whole summer in Florida rehabbing by myself. It was kind of a
reality check. Baseball wasn't there for me. It was the first time
I had to struggle without my dad there. I'm a stronger person
because of it. I learned that baseball's not always gonna be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a kid. I had a hard time growing up, but that kind of
helped.''
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old can't remember a time when he wasn't involved in
baseball. His five older brothers _ including his oldest brother,
Chuck, a professional scout _ taught him the sport he played at
Newbury Park (Calif.) High School and Cal State Northridge before
signing with the Tigers as a fifth-round draft pick in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He was the 1997 Midwest League MVP and batting champion when he
batted .341 and had a 32-game hitting streak at the Single-A level.
He was one of the Southern League's top offensive players in 1998
and made the jump from Double-A to the majors at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Fick made his mark last season by hitting a grand slam that
nearly cleared the right-field roof for the final home run hit at
Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed hitter's ability to hit to the opposite field,
handle breaking pitches and not strike out often encouraged the
Tigers, but his room for growth as a catcher prompted Detroit's
offseason trade for Brad Ausmus.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ausmus is signed through 2001, Fick is not expected to see
much time at at catcher and vows he will play regularly for some
team, if not the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Fick's easiest way into the starting lineup is as a designated
hitter, but three of his nine starts this season have been at first
base. He also works out at third base. He has three errors and is
batting .243.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Fick's stats were better, Tigers first-year manager Phil
Garner insists he is not ready to alter the starting lineup of his
struggling team because, ``It's been going on for a while since
before I got here and you're not gonna change the stripes on a
zebra in a few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   A five-game suspension, scheduled to begin May 6, for his
participation in a recent brawl, ensures Fick more time off the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard on me,'' Fick said. ``I'm used to playing every day.
I'm used to being counted on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the 10th guy around here. There's only nine positions, so
you know. ... Right now, I know my role is just to be ready when
called upon.'' &QL;

GORE'S VISIT DRAWS ATTENTION TO KC NEIGHBORHOOD'S REVITALIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Having stood in the midday sun Saturday,
overseeing the transformation of a central-city park from
drug-trafficking trash pit to safe haven, Kevin Evans perspired a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the heat, the Kansas City Parks and Recreation worker
was happy to heft another tool _ and hand it to Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny, new purple and pink playground equipment had been bolted
snugly together _ all except for a final curving slide saved for
the vice president to wrench together in front of the assembled
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Gore _ dressed candidate casual in khaki pants, polo shirt,
cowboy boots and a Palm Pilot hanging on his left hip _ put his
elbow grease into a socket wrench under Evans' direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to figure out why Kevin here is sweating while I'm
doing all the work,'' Gore quipped. His joke, of course, was
stating the obvious, that this campaign stop piggybacked on the
efforts of Kansas Citians who had refurbished Montgall Park, near
22nd Street and Benton Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's done their part,'' Gore told a crowd of about 100
people at the park in a short speech a few minutes later. ``This is
like celebrating a birth, because a neighborhood is being reborn.
It's a born-again neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly why Evans was glad to have Gore, or anyone who
comes with a media entourage, in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can bring attention to revitalization like this,
it can only help,'' Evans said. ``And where (Gore) goes you have
all the TV and the radio and the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, used the
park and a backdrop of children perched on the new playground
equipment to call for a variety of things he believes government
can do to help troubled neighborhoods restore themselves: ``more
after-school programs ... universal preschool ... a commitment to
connect all the classrooms to the Internet ... to treat teachers
like the professionals that they are ... more community police
officers who are working with the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Later his campaign issued a release touting Gore's plan that he
says would put an added 50,000 police officers on the street. The
campaign also said Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the near-certain
Republican presidential nominee, has a tax-cut plan that would make
paying for such crime-fighting programs impossible. The campaigns,
naturally, differ on whether Gore's approach would reduce crime or
whether Bush's plans would hurt efforts to pay for police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore's visit to Montgall Park unveiled no new administration
or campaign initiatives. Rather, his staff passed out releases
recapping a grab bag of positions he'd talked about through the
campaign. One said: ``Gore would fight to provide a prescription
drug benefit under Medicare, a strong, enforceable patients' bill
of rights and universal health care access for children.''
</P>
<P>
   At the park, he called on people to make old neighborhoods shine
in a way that suggests a healthy community. And key to that health,
Gore said, were efforts like the one that teamed Children's Mercy
Hospital, police officers, parks workers and volunteers to start
converting the neighborhood from one in decline to one on the mend.
</P>
<P>
   And to make that happen, Gore said, the community must carve out
a territory that allowed children a safe place to play. ``When
children feel safe, and families feel their children are going to
be safe, then the neighborhood comes back to life,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Later at a town hall-style meeting, Gore would emphasize the
message again that Kansas City was taking positive steps.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Downtown Airport on Air Force Two about 1:30 p.m.,
Gore was greeted by Democratic U.S. Rep. Karen McCarthy of Kansas
City and Missouri Auditor Claire McCaskill.
</P>
<P>
   He made no public remarks at the airport but spent 30 minutes
inside the terminal meeting supporters and local political
officials, such as Jackson County Legislature Chairman Victor
Callahan, Kansas City Councilman Troy Nash and Woody Overton,
General Services Administration regional administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's police-escorted motorcade included two limousines, seven
control and staff vehicles, a press bus and a Johnson County
ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   It took him to the corner of Agnes Avenue and 22nd Street, where
he strolled one block west and one block south.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 100 or so people at the park _ nearly equaled by
police officers, Secret Service agents, city workers and
journalists _ stuck to tossing flying discs or playing basketball
when he first arrived. But a few lined up along an orange temporary
fence for a better look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Al!'' shouted 12-year-old Christine Vedros of Leawood,
Kan. ``Say hello to Tipper (his wife) for me!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will,'' he yelled back with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   He greeted a few families on their porches, talked to a young
woman on the corner and then _ by her cell phone _ to one of her
friends.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked, the vice president chatted casually for less than
five minutes with a handful of police officers who were familiar
with the neighborhood. Before the speech he spent about 20 minutes
helping Evans assemble the slide.
</P>
<P>
   Next he headed for Attucks Elementary School _ and a catered
dinner of smoked ribs _ before holding court before a meeting of
ostensibly undecided voters who had been selected by civic
organizations contacted by the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that many of you are undecided about this election,''
Gore was quoted as saying in a press release handed out before the
event. ``That's why I've invited you here tonight. I want to give
you a chance to hear directly from me, and I want the chance to
listen and to learn from you.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 people were gathered in the school's small
gymnasium, a relatively intimate setting where the vice president's
staff said he planned to stay until he had fielded everyone's
questions.
</P>
<P>
   At a similar meeting Friday night in Albuquerque, he spoke for a
Gore campaign record: four hours and five minutes.

LONG BALL MIGHT CHANGE WAY ASTROS PLAY GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Houston Astros went from the hardest place in baseball to
hit a home run to a place that resembles a field in Williamsport,
Pa., and it's forced manager Larry Dierker to change his style of
managing.
</P>
<P>
   Speed, defense, manufacturing runs, strong pitching _ you know,
the fundamentals that make up a good ballclub _ are on their way
out in Houston because no longer are 2-1 and 3-2 games part of the
equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been a team that won by emphasizing pitching,
speed and defense, but we might not be able to rely as much on that
part of our game (at Enron Field) as we did at the Astrodome,''
Dierker said. ``We might have to rely less on manufacturing runs
and more on trying for the big inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he'll wait a little longer before making that his
final judgment since the Astros have had only two homestands, but
so far, it's certainly heading that way.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's new bandbox has averaged 12.6 runs through 12 games,
nearly 4 more than at the Astrodome last season. And there's an
average of 3.67 homers hit per game at Enron Field, compared to 1.3
per game at the Astrodome last season.
</P>
<P>
   And the Astros aren't adjusting well. Houston is 3-9 at home,
the pitchers are going nuts, and the Astros entered Saturday six
games out of first place. The last time Houston was that far away
from the top of the division was 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think two homestands is enough of a sample to say for
sure, but based on what I've seen so far, we might need to change
our philosophy a little,'' Dierker said. ``We may be sacrificing
less or maybe not using the hit and run as much early in the game,
or certainly not as much as we used them in the Astrodome.''
</P>
<P>
   REGARDING HENRY: Florida Marlins owner John Henry is racking his
brain to figure out how to make the residents of South Florida buy
him a new ballpark. Even Gov. Jeb Bush shot down a cruise tax, so
now Henry has brainstormed another idea to make people pay for
something they apparently don't want.
</P>
<P>
   Henry came up with the idea of building a 25,000-seat ballpark
that left room for expansion. That would spread the cost over time
and allow him not to have another fire sale on players who are
eligible for salary arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that's got to be just grand for baseball. No longer are
teams dumping soon-to-be free agents; the Marlins are getting ready
to dump players three years from free agency.
</P>
<P>
   CY JOHNSON: Arizona lefty Randy Johnson is 5-0, has a 1.06 ERA,
and leads the National League in strikeouts (53), innings (42),
shutouts (two) and opponents' batting average (.148). He's pitched
in all but 2 innings of games he's started.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, I've done my job,'' said Johnson, the reigning Cy
Young Award winner. ``I try not to get caught up in numbers. I'm
surprised more pitchers haven't done that.''
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden wasn't
pleased about watching his club get walloped by the Dodgers last
weekend. The Dodgers won the three games by a combined 36-7 score,
and the Reds led for half an inning in one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason right now, we're atrocious,'' Bowden said.
``We're just playing bad baseball. You can't put too much
camouflage on it. Right now, the general manager stinks, the
starting pitchers stink, the relief pitchers stink, the hitters and
fielders stink. We need to buy some deodorant and cologne.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds responded by winning two of three from the Mets. &QL;

BUSH TAKES NOTE OF THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF A FUND-RAISING
FIASCO 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George W. Bush homed in on one of Vice President
Al Gore's potential vulnerabilities Saturday, gleefully telling a
convention of radio talk show hosts in New York City that they were
meeting on the anniversary of Gore's fund-raising appearance at a
Buddhist temple in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, quickly
got into the irreverent spirit of talk radio, mocking his
Democratic opponent in his brief appearance in the city. ``This is
the fourth anniversary, to this very day, of his historic visit to
the Buddhist temple,'' he told the National Association of Radio
Talk Show Hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, who earlier in the week headlined a $21.3
million Republican fund-raiser, said Gore had performed an
``amazing fund-raising act where you can convert poverty into
wealth.'' Bush added, ``I'm sure he's celebrating this occasion in
private.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd applauded, Bush said: ``Too bad he's not here. He's
a man who knows a lot of things about a lot of subjects, including
radio technology.'' Bush added, in a reminder of how Gore once took
credit for the Internet, ``I'm sure he invented it.''
</P>
<P>
   For four years, Republicans have been using Gore's appearance at
Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif., to tie him to the
Democrats' campaign finance excesses in the last presidential race
and to raise questions about Gore's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president gave several different accounts of his
appearance at the temple, saying he did not know the lunch had been
a fund-raiser, and eventually drawing a distinction between a
fund-raiser and a ``finance-related event.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Hsia, a longtime Gore fund-raiser, was recently convicted
on five felony counts for her role in arranging illegal donations
to the Democratic National Committee, including some from the event
at the Buddhist temple. The Justice Department charged that she had
arranged for monks and nuns to write checks to make it appear that
they were the donors to the Democrats. In fact, they were
reimbursed by the temple, which is barred from making political
contributions because it is a tax-exempt religious institution.
</P>
<P>
   After his short speech, Bush hopped from stand to stand in the
Empire Hotel, near Lincoln Center, where radio hosts were on the
air. He was interviewed by four hosts in rapid succession, and was
heard on a computer-oriented show and WFAN, a sports station.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Gore's plan to hold local schools accountable for
student performance, Bush derided the plan as ``pretty shallow
accountability.'' And of his scheduled meeting in May with his
former rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Bush said: ``I know what
I want to achieve. I want to have a good visit with a man I knew
before the primaries. He was a friend of mine and I'm confident
he'll be a friend of mine after the primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he understood that the changing political times meant
that the talk show hosts needed some consolation. ``The Clinton
era's ending,'' he said. ``This is a guy who provided you with a
lot of interesting material.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit to the broadcasters was Bush's only campaign stop
Saturday in New York. He spent more time flying from Austin, Texas,
and back, than he did in the city.

WHAT IS CURE FOR SPRINGTIME BLUES? 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Blues folded up faster than anyone expected, and that no
doubt will trigger changes in St. Louis next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to overreact, but we didn't play very well,''
said general manager Larry Pleau, reached at his office just before
the weekend. ``And we've got to remember to give some credit there
to the Sharks. At the same time, though, we have to put blame on
our own shoulders. There are no excuses for what happened. We
played our game in spurts, but we didn't do it consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   No league has as many early-round upsets as the NHL. It's the
nature of the sport. Pucks end up in the net for no reason.
Witness: Jaromir Jagr's shot in Game 1 vs. Philadelphia Thursday
night that banged off John LeClair, ricocheted off a defenseman's
skate, and beat an unsuspecting Brian Boucher. The shot appeared to
be about 10 feet off net. But the end result was a 1-0 Penguins
lead, and from there the Flyers never mounted much of an attack on
netminder Ron Tugnutt.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues didn't exit the postseason as a result of such, shall
we say, shooting serendipity. But the sight of St. Louis defenseman
Marc Bergevin cuffing a puck and literally throwing it in his own
net (what was he thinking?) for a San Jose goal early in the series
was a showcase piece from the Museum of Stanley Cup Horrors. Wow.
Back in the days when Gerry Cheevers was coaching the Bruins, I saw
Wayne Cashman make a similar move (hard to believe, referee Wally
Harris had put the whistle away), but he tossed it by the Winnipeg
goalie. The Bruins hustled onto the bus and got out of town with
the tie.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's no surprise that Pleau will shop for a defenseman
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like all 30 teams,'' Pleau said. ``Everyone wants to get
defensemen.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture might have looked different in St. Louis had the
Blues won the Ray Bourque swap-a-thon back in March. Pleau made a
serious pitch (believed to include Marty Reasoner) for Bourque.
Word around FleetStreet is the Blues came in second. The magic
Bourque is working behind the Colorado blue line very well might
have worked for the Blues. Faced with a backline of Bourque, Chris
Pronger, and Al MacInnis, the Sharks likely wouldn't be tangled up
with the Stars in Round 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a believer in what a lot of people say, that the
regular season means nothing,'' said Pleau, whose club finished
with the league's best record (51-20-11, 114 points). ``That's a
lot of hogwash. The players and coaches here did a great job. Did
we play well in the playoffs? No. Is that because (of the toll) of
the regular season? No. That would be the easy way out. We just
didn't play well enough in that series _ period.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleau knows he faces abundant second-guessing and media
scrutiny, especially because his team went from regular-season
domination to first-round elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone _ management, coaches, and players _ we're all more
responsible to the media today than we were 20 years ago,'' said
Pleau. ``I like that. I think it's great. It makes us all more
accountable in this business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the second-guessing is incredible. But to me, that's
great. The fans love it. If you listen to the talk shows here, it's
full of, `Should Larry Pleau be fired? Should (head coach) Joel
Quenneville be fired?' Hey, people care, and they want answers _
that's why they're paying $85 a ticket to go to the game, right?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A future in the NHL
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix is convinced that
Swedish forward Sami Pahlsson, whom he swapped to the Bruins in the
Bourque deal, will play in the NHL. ``To think of him as a top-line
player, that would be a little too much,'' said Lacroix. ``But
he'll definitely be a solid player. If he was (with Colorado), I'd
think of him more as a third- or fourth-line player, especially
with the people we have here.'' Pahlsson, by the way, is working on
a Team Sweden line with fellow Bruin P.J. Axelsson at the World
Championships, which began Saturday in St. Petersburg, Russia . . .
Lacroix on tough guy Martin Grenier, another component of the
Bourque deal: ``I think he's too young to tell how he'll project.''
. . . Boucher, of Woonsocket, R.I., entered Round 2 with the
second-lowest goals-against average (1.58), all time, for rookie
netminders in the playoffs. No. 1 is Bill Durnan, 1.53 for Montreal
in 1944; No. 3 is Terry Sawchuk, 1.68 for Detroit in 1951 . . . At
last count, there were no fewer than 280 NHLers, enough to fill 14
teams, who were making $1 million or more per year. A penny's worth
of perspective: In 1991-92, there were only eight skating
millionaires _ Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Brett Hull, Steve
Yzerman, Scott Stevens, Paul Coffey, Chris Chelios, and Bourque . .
. Reports circulating late last week had the Flames, if they go up
for sale at the end of June, possibly landing in Oklahoma City.
Please, stop the insanity. There are still bona fide big league
towns out there, including Houston, Portland, and San Diego. The
last thing the NHL needs is another small US town trying to play
big boy hockey . . . Great sight in the Denver Pepsi Center
Thursday night: a pair of true-blue Bourque fans wearing game
sweaters that were one-half Bruin and one-half Avalanche. Think Jay
and Michael Feenan, from Boston, order the surf 'n turf special (8
oz. sirloin, 8 oz. lobster tail) when they go out to eat, too?
Relax. No one is selling the sweaters. They were home-tailored.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No hits on lottery
</P>
<P>
   The NHL hasn't fixed a date for the lottery that will determine
the order for the June 24-25 entry draft in Calgary. At the moment,
the Bruins hold the No. 7 pick, their second-highest pick since
1987, when Glen Wesley was chosen third. Other than Joe Thornton,
No. 1 overall in '97, their highest picks have been a pair of No.
8s (Sergei Samsonov, '97; Johnathan Aitken, '96) and one No. 9
(Kyle McLaren in '95). Based on the outcome of the lottery, the
Bruins could pick as high as fourth and as low as eighth . . . Jeff
Gorton, the Bruins' assistant VP of hockey operations, just
returned from a scouting tour through Russia and Switzerland.
``It's no secret that it will be a European draft,'' he said.
``That's where the skill is, and out of 30 first-round picks, I'd
say a minimum of 20 will be from Europe.'' . . . OK, Kevin Stevens
got himself into a stupid jam when he was arrested in January, and
his brief time here in the Hub didn't earn him Hall of Fame status,
but both of his former Ranger bosses, ex-GM Neil Smith and ex-coach
John Muckler, believe he can still be an effective player in a
limited role. He is a free agent July 1, and he says he'll work for
bottom dollar, accepting even a training camp invite. History
aside, he would be worth a look here. His upside might not be more
than 18-20 goals and, say, 45 points, but he could be worth it at
the right price. Nothing wrong with having guys in the lineup who
feel they have something to prove . . . Junior hockey standout
Jonathan Roy, a high-scoring center for Moncton in the Quebec
League, recently was a patient at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington,
where he was treated for a rare form of cancer (rhabdomyosarcoma)
that attacks the muscle tissue. The club owner is Robert Irving,
billionaire owner of Irving Oil in Canada and longtime friend of
the Lahey. Roy, who had 123 points this season, is back in Moncton,
awaiting word on tests to determine his treatment . . . Look for
the Oilers to entertain offers this summer for ex-BC Eagle Bill
Guerin and slick defenseman Roman Hamrlik. Both would be fine
additions for the Blues, but they'd have to part with some young,
cheap talent _ the likes of Jochen Hecht and Michal Handzus . . .
Oilers boss Glen Sather emphatically denies any interest in moving
to Manhattan to be part of the Rangers' new management structure.
One source believes the Rangers will hire three front office types
to direct the club.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coyote may roam
</P>
<P>
   What's next for Coyote power forward Keith Tkachuk? Surgery,
possibly. According to his Boston-based agent, Bob Murray, Tkachuk
may have ligament damage inside an ankle, which required
pain-killing shots just to suit up for the playoffs. ``He shouldn't
have been playing,'' said Murray. ``But that's Keith. He's a
warrior, and he wants to be in there even when he knows,
healthwise, he shouldn't be.'' Meanwhile, Murray isn't sure what
sweater Tkachuk will wear in 2000-01. ``Much of that will be
determined by the ownership situation out there,'' said Murray.
``For Keith's part, he loves it out there, he loves his teammates,
and he wants to play for Phoenix. But based on the track record _
you're talking about a team that essentially traded him twice last
year, once to Carolina and once to the Rangers _ I'd have to think
they'd probably trade him over the summer. I'd like to be
optimistic and say he'd be back, but I can only go on their
history.'' On May 17, the Coyotes' new ownership, Ellman Co., is
expected to hand over $10 million toward the purchase of the club.
If Ellman takes control, it remains to be seen whether drastic
changes, including the replacement of GM Bobby Smith, will take
place . . . BU freshman goalie Rick DiPietro has until Monday to
declare for the draft. If he does, he will surrender the remaining
three years of his college eligibility, and he'll likely be
destined for a one- or two-year tuneup in the minors (IHL or AHL).
Word along Comm. Ave. is that it's highly likely DiPietro will
enter the draft. One teammate put the odds at 70-30 of DiPietro
going pro. ``He's a terrific prospect, and fun to watch,'' said
Gorton. ``He brings that element to the ice that not too many do,
the way he's able to handle the puck like a third defenseman.'' In
all likelihood, said Gorton, DiPietro will be selected in the first
round whenever he enters the draft . . . It's a reach, and maybe a
long one right now, but the dollars NHL clubs might generate from
the Internet could be the money stream, if pooled and divvied up
equally, that could keep the struggling Canadian clubs afloat. Come
to think of it, baseball's small-market woes might be similarly
remedied . . . Bruins trainer Don Del Negro accompanied Hal Gill
and Steve Heinze on the Team USA squad bound for the World
Championships. Onetime Boston draft pick Ben Clymer, who signed as
a free agent and played 60 games with Tampa Bay this season, also
is with the Yanks . . . If the Avalanche do win the Cup, do you
suppose the parade route will start in Denver and end in Danvers?

HARD TIMES, HARD FEELINGS AT PC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ It was the first week of April, and Tim Welsh was
feeling good, better than he had during the longest season of his
coaching career: a 1999-2000 campaign in which the Providence
basketball team had finished a dismal 11-18.
</P>
<P>
   The record was bad enough. Welsh had never had a losing season
in three years at Iona. And in his first season at Providence,
Welsh's team had gone 16-14 and received an NIT bid.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more to it. Welsh had been forced to scramble from
the get-go when his planned starting backcourt disappeared. One
guard, Sean Connolly, a 6-foot-4-inch sophomore from Peabody,
Mass., transferred to Ohio State. The other, John Linehan, a 5-9
junior, missed almost all of the season with a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   But now the winter was over, and Welsh felt upbeat. Golf season
was ahead of him, and he could start thinking about better things
for next year.
</P>
<P>
   At 39, Welsh was not so far removed from his playing days at
Potsdam State that he didn't know what his players were feeling at
the end of a long season. He called a team meeting. No assistant
coaches. No one but Welsh and his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like at this time of year,'' Welsh said.
``It's spring. Basketball season is over, and you want to have some
fun. That's fine. I did that when I was a player myself. But be
careful out there. Don't do anything foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   After two seasons, Welsh thought he knew the character of his
team, as well as the characters. He knew kids such as Linehan,
Erron Maxey, and Abdul Mills had potential to be much better. He
knew Donta Wade, Llewellyn Cole, and Jamaal Camah had had ups and
downs during their careers and needed some structure in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   When the meeting broke up, Welsh sat in his office and thought
he had done what he needed to do. Said the things he needed to say.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, things changed.
</P>
<P>
   The first call came late on a Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was already asleep,'' said Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   That call was followed by another _ and another.
</P>
<P>
   Four of his players had been arrested in an off-campus fight,
four others were implicated, and a program that had seemed to be
heading north was now heading south. Again.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute had begun over the weekend when Thomas Cook, a
Providence senior who worked as a bouncer at an off-campus
gathering spot called the Prime Time Cafe, refused to admit one of
the players into the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Words were exchanged. The basketball players, regarded by many
in the student body as mercenaries with very little link to campus
life, moved on. But after a weekend in which tempers slowly began
to flare, the players apparently sought to reopen the issue. At
about 10:30 p.m. on Monday, April 10, eight of them showed up at an
off-campus house shared by Cook and two other seniors, Mark Hogan,
and Ryan Kerwin.
</P>
<P>
   Reports vary on what occurred next. But the bottom line is that
four of the players _ Wade, Camah, Cole, and forward David Murray _
were deemed the point men in a confrontation that turned very
physical, with Cook and Hogan receiving severe facial injuries.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Players' futures uncertain
</P>
<P>
   Wade, Murray, and Cole are facing felony assault and
conspiracy-to-assault charges. Camah is facing a misdemeanor
assault charge.
</P>
<P>
   As the legal proceedings unfolded last week, a six-member
committee appointed by PC officials also conducted hearings on
campus, charging the eight players with violations of the school's
code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The college's penalties ranged from expulsion to suspension and
probation. Expulsion is the most severe, with no chance of
returning. Suspension means a one-year absence, while probation
allows a return to school but not to the team.
</P>
<P>
   The players have another week to appeal, but most observers feel
that given the public nature of the incident and the prevailing
mood on campus, a reversal is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The only good news for Welsh is that three of his best players _
Linehan, Maxey, and Mills _ apparently were not involved in the
incident and can play next year.
</P>
<P>
   But with whom? Cole is a senior and would have been gone next
year anyway. Camah has been in trouble before, and sources close to
the program say he will not be missed.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh has three incoming freshmen committed for next season:
forward Marcus Douhit and guards Shieku Kabba and Donnel Allick.
But if the school penalties stick, he will need to attract more
talented players to avoid a second straight losing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to the degree that you see yourself in the
headlines in a negative sense,'' said Welsh. ``All you want to do
is coach the team, do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Glory days just a memory
</P>
<P>
   If this were just a blip on the radar screen, a one-time
incident _ just a ``fight,'' as one observer close to the scene
called it _ it would quickly disappear.
</P>
<P>
   But athletic life at Providence College is not like it once was.
The Friars used to be one of the elite college basketball programs
in the East, with a strong tradition that produced such prominent
coaches and players as Joe Mullaney, Dave Gavitt, Rick Pitino, John
Thompson, Lenny Wilkens, and Ernie DiGregorio.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh knew what he was undertaking when he accepted the job in
April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't coming here unless I got a long-term contract,'' said
Welsh, who signed a seven-year deal. ``I knew all about the great
tradition and expect to get back to that again, but to do it the
right way, it was going to take some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh was pleasantly surprised with the Friars' winning season
his first year. With Connolly and Linehan as his backcourt and a
solid nucleus of players such as Maxey and Wade coming back, he
thought the team could advance a notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linehan and Connolly were my staples,'' said Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   But Welsh knew Connolly was a very perishable commodity. When
coach Pete Gillen left Providence for Virginia in the spring of
1998, Connolly decided he'd had enough. Welsh had to do some heavy
bargaining to keep the player from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Coach Gillen had stayed, I would have stayed, too,'' said
Connolly last week from the basketball offices at Ohio State. ``The
situation there was all right, but I came to play for Coach Gillen,
and when he left, I wanted to leave right away. I gave it a year
and decided I wanted to go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   That decision might have been prompted partly by the atmosphere
around the team when Welsh arrived. Gillen had faced what almost
every PC coach has in recent years: a hard time getting quality
people to come to a school that doesn't offer a lot in social
amenities, especially to black students.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A campus divide
</P>
<P>
   While no one says so publicly, the gap between the student body
and the basketball team has been growing wider for the past several
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime observers of Civic Center home games also noticed a
paucity of students this year that was sometimes embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was as simple as a losing season. Maybe it went
deeper than that. The Friars' roster had no white players, wasn't
that good, and had some citizens of questionable character.
</P>
<P>
   Camah, a 6-4 junior from Salem, Mass., was a case in point. In
December, Camah had appeared before the PC judicial board over an
incident involving a reporter at the student paper, The Cowl. The
paper reported that Camah had pleaded no contest to a domestic
disorderly charge involving his girlfriend at a campus dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   When the story appeared, Camah responded by throwing a newspaper
rack in an altercation at the paper's office. He was suspended for
a game against Central Connecticut and required to write an apology
to the newspaper and perform 25 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been some resentment of what many on campus view
as a bottom-line attitude on the part of the administration toward
the school's athletic program. The administration made an unpopular
decision a year ago to drop baseball, one of the more successful
Friars athletic programs, because of Title IX considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be hard-pressed to go back and find the last time
something was done that was really innovative,'' said one longtime
observer of the athletic program. ``The present administration, as
evidenced by the baseball fiasco of a year ago, is really very
bottom-line oriented.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to have lost their soul a little. PC always
succeeded because of the people, whether it was Joe Mullaney or
Dave Gavitt or Rick Pitino. It was always like a family. That's
absent now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating to see them wallowing. They seem to have
lost their passion. They kind of got fat and happy and forgot
whence they came. It's all very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director John Marinatto concedes that PC faces some
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have to be creative,'' said Marinatto, ``because we
can't solve every problem by writing a check. PC is what PC is.
We're a small Catholic school. But one situation is not going to
stop us from its mission.''
</P>
<P>
   But questions linger over how well the basketball program's
mission jibes with the college's. The Friars must compete in the
Big East. But the campus is small. Seventy-four percent of the
school's 3,700 undergraduates come from the Northeast. Women make
up 57 percent of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of connection with the basketball team, whose players
seem to have very little in common with the student body, is
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches who have come through the program in recent years
have used PC as a steppingstone. That proved so troublesome to the
administration that it put a buyout penalty in Welsh's contract,
the first time a Friars coach has had one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Changes take toll
</P>
<P>
   `If you look back at it,'' said Texas coach Rick Barnes, who
coached the Friars from 1988 until 1994 before leaving for Clemson
and then Texas, ``they have had tremendous upheaval in the last few
years. After a long tradition of people like Joe Mullaney and Dave
Gavitt, they had a seven-year period where they had four different
coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes conceded he took academic chances with some players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our battles,'' he said. ``It was never easy because the
talent wasn't in your backyard. You had to go out and sell
Providence, and to do that you had to sell yourself. At a place
like that, if a kid qualifies by NCAA minimum standards, I'm not
sure if you can have any kind of other restriction. If a kid
qualifies by NCAA rules, you had better be able to get him in
school.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that kids who can help the team athletically may
have baggage, and that puts even more of a burden on the coach.
</P>
<P>
   In Gillen's final days, the Providence administration endured
what was largely a dysfunctional basketball roster, with players
feuding, sometimes during the course of a game. With the latest
incident, the administration may put pressure on Welsh to bring in
players who are less likely to cause trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But Welsh is restricted there as well, because the type of
players who fit that mold could very easily take a look at
Providence and decide that almost every other school in the Big
East has something better to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Welsh pleads for patience. So do his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest thing they need is stability,'' said Big
East commissioner Mike Tranghese, a former Providence sports
information director who knows the program as well as anyone. ``If
people have patience with Tim over the long haul, they can be fine.
The truth of the matter was that when Tim came on board, there
wasn't a lot there. I know they have the right coach, if everybody
has patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese doesn't buy the theory that you can't win at
Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look around our league at BC, at Seton Hall, at St.
John's, at Villanova,'' he said. ``Everybody in our league has won
at some time. For some schools it's not automatic every year, but
it can be done and has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh hopes so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is similar to Iona,'' said Welsh. ``Same mission,
same type of student-athlete. What upsets me most is the character
issue. Character is important to me in recruiting and once they get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Welsh gets tougher
</P>
<P>
   Since the incident, Welsh has had meetings with his players
almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them they are going to see me more than they ever
dreamed about,'' he said. ``I told them they learned a lesson in
life. Sometimes you have some great kids who, on the spur of the
moment, will get themselves into a situation. But you can have good
kids and in one 10-minute incident, it can all be erased.''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh said he has heard words of contrition from almost all of
his players. What the players have heard from their coach is a
tough-love speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to move on from this, put things back together,''
Welsh said. ``I told them that the chances are they're all going to
live another 50 years, and if they can look back at this as just an
isolated incident in their lives, they will have done pretty well.
But they also have to learn from this. We all do.''

   The age of alternative/extreme sports is upon us. They are
making it with their own youthful audience. So why should an
alternative version of football be any different?
</P>
<P>
   Sports fans from age 13 all the way up into their early 30s are
looking at things a little differently than us 40somethings-and-up.
Professional wrestling, love it or hate it, is one of the most
popular entertainment ventures among the younger generation. Vince
McMahon, president and CEO of the World Wrestling Federation, knows
marketing, and somehow, someway, he's going to bring football,
WWF-style, to a national audience.
</P>
<P>
   And the bet here is that one of NBC's highest-rated programs
will be ``Saturday Night XFL'' next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because America loves football and young America loves
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Since the XFL was announced in February, the consensus has been
that it won't make it. But that opinion is coming from
traditionalists and the segment of the population that is not
entirely sure what the league is all about. There have been wild
rumors that the games will be fixed and that coaches will be
hitting players over the head with chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keller, vice president of football operations for the
eight-team league, wants to make some things clear. The football
will not be a sham. It will not be scripted. It'll just be looser.
The people in the league simply won't take themselves so seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a football person,'' said Keller, a former executive with
the NFL's Seattle Seahawks, the USFL's Michigan Panthers, and
various World League and NFL Europe teams, plus a former linebacker
at Michigan and with the Dallas Cowboys. ``I've made my living in
football. If this was anything but real football, I would never
have taken the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller and his staff will try to rid the game of the ``dumb and
boring plays'' and the silly taboos of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The fair catch is gone. Touchbacks are not allowed. Kickoffs
will be made from the 25-yard line, and even if the kicker has a
strong enough leg to boot it deep into the end zone, the returner
must bring it out.
</P>
<P>
   Keller said there will be rules to protect the quarterback, but
not to the ridiculous extent of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The league will allow a player to be in motion heading toward
the line of scrimmage, and as in the college game, a receiver will
need only one foot in bounds to make a catch. On defense, there is
no 5-yard limit on bumping the receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The league, which is scheduled to begin play Feb. 3, 2001, is
toying with the idea of a field goal being worth 4 points from 50
yards and beyond. And extra-point kicks may be abandoned; teams
would have to run or pass it in.
</P>
<P>
   Player salaries? There is a scale even the NFL would love.
</P>
<P>
   Players will receive a base salary of $50,000, with numerous
chances to earn more based on wins and championships. Players on
the winning team will receive $3,000 per game per man. Head coaches
also will be rewarded for victories above their $150,000 salary.
Ties are discouraged; neither team would receive the bonus in that
case. A team that wins the championship will earn $25,000-$30,000
per man.
</P>
<P>
   There will be seven-man practice squads, earning $1,000 per
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a league of opportunity,'' said Keller. ``Winning and
being a starter is rewarded. What I see it as is an upgraded USFL.
Because the league is under one entity, we feel we have a better
chance of being able to control the expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does the WWF come in? Personality, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Players will be allowed _ even encouraged _ to celebrate in the
end zone or after a great play. Teams probably will have their own
dances. Certainly, they'll have unique uniforms, which are
currently being designed. If you've seen some of the WWF wrestlers'
garb, you can only imagine the color schemes and imaginative
nicknames in store.
</P>
<P>
   And if you've seen the women of the WWF, well, you'll probably
see women in the XFL, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great creative department here,'' said Keller at WWF
headquarters in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   This league will encourage players to do interviews, unlike the
NFL, which controls media access. The huddles will be miked, and
the locker rooms will be shown live before and after the game. WWF
stars will attend games and be available for halftime interviews.
There will be a lot of in-game sideline interviews, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   To speed up games, only 35 seconds will be allowed between
plays, and halftime will be shorter than it is in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   At the wages being offered, it would seem difficult to attract
big-name players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a territorial draft so the players will be known in
those parts of the country where the team plays,'' said Keller,
``but we certainly can't say that a big-name NFL player would
choose to play in our league. That's not going to happen. But with
salary cap issues in the NFL, there are a lot of players who people
recognize who find themselves out of the game. They would certainly
want to resume their careers someplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller said there are 20-30 candidates for head coaching jobs,
and fans would recognize some of the ex-NFL coaches who have
applied. He said he's received applications from former college
coaches, former NFL assistants who would love to have a head job on
their resumes, and people from NFL Europe and the Canadian Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're about 30 days from hiring our general managers
and about 60 days from hiring our coaches,'' said Keller.
</P>
<P>
   If the XFL does take off, would it ever consider taking on the
NFL head-to-head? Keller said there are no such plans. The concept
was to devise football for fans to watch after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has always been a little afraid of McMahon. It tried to
buy him out of his Monday night TV time slot a couple of years ago
because his wrestling shows were digging into ``Monday Night
Football'' ratings. So paranoid are some NFL people that they put
out the word at league meetings last month in Palm Beach, Fla., not
to discuss the XFL among themselves or with anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Keller said the league has secured most of the stadiums it will
need _ in places such as Miami, Orlando, Washington, Toronto,
Chicago, and Los Angeles _ but it is making one last scan of other
venues to make sure the best facilities are secured.
</P>
<P>
   He said two more teams will be added, with Boston a candidate,
but as we know there aren't many viable sites in Boston unless
Nickerson Field is revitalized.
</P>
<P>
   We are all skeptical of new leagues, but this one has incredible
juice with McMahon, NBC, and the flavors of wrestling and football.
If McMahon can create The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H,
the Big Show, etc., he probably can create football personalities
that fans will flock to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The XFL is aiming to make football fun again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Corner hasn't been sharp
</P>
<P>
   If Bill Belichick can straighten out Antonio Langham, it would
be a major coup. Langham's career has plummeted since he was a
highly touted rookie out of Alabama six years ago. It's not etched
in stone that Langham will beat out Tebucky Jones for a cornerback
job. Patriots fan may recall that when Langham was with the 49ers
in 1998, after signing a five-year, $17 million deal, he allowed
six touchdowns and committed seven penalties in his first six games
before being benched . . . Bruce Armstrong and Zefross Moss may
have been considered too old by the Patriots, but they were also
two of the more respected players on the team. Moss was a tough guy
who played in a lot of pain. Two seasons ago, he missed a week
after Bruce Smith had knocked Armstrong into the back of Moss's
legs. Then Moss attempted to practice with his ankle heavily
wrapped. Two defensive players who were out with injuries came over
to him and asked, ``What do you think you're doing?'' Moss replied,
``I'm trying to practice so I can play.'' The players told Moss,
``Don't come back too soon _ you're making us look bad.''
Armstrong's locker room impact has been well-documented. When
things were going bad, nobody had more of the players' ear than
Armstrong, a man who had been through all the battles and all the
situations and had a knack for putting things in perspective. The
Patriots have lost that (though they still have a chance to get him
back). Good luck to them. While Grant Williams and Lance Scott may
have upside, and Adrian Klemm may eventually be a good player, the
immediate effect could be ugly. Some who watched the Seattle-Miami
playoff game say that Williams had one of the worst games they'd
ever seen by an offensive lineman. Patriots offensive coordinator
Charlie Weis, when asked if offensive line may be the area taking
up most of his time and patience, said, ``I think it's going to be
a position where there'll be some strong competition. We have a
combination of guys who have 4-5 years experience and guys who are
first- and second-year players really getting after it and
competing. I think that can only make us better.'' . . . Not many
football players would go out and get a copy of their offensive
coordinator's biography so they could read up on the guy. Sean
Morey did. The Patriots receiver, playing in NFL Europe for the
Barcelona Dragons, picked up a copy of Sam Rutigliano's book.
Rutigliano, a long-time NFL coach, most notably with the Cleveland
Browns, is assisting former Boston College coach Jack Bicknell in
Barcelona. ``He's an interesting guy,'' said Morey. ``I just wanted
to learn about him. He's an excellent coach. The great thing here
is that I'm getting great coaching and I'm learning all the time.''
He caught 10 passes for 107 yards (including a 19-yard TD) last
week against Berlin after missing four weeks with a high ankle
sprain. ``It was torture just sitting around,'' said Morey, who sat
for most of last season on the practice squad. ``I tried to make
the best of it. Learned everything I could. I watched a lot of film
so I could mimic the tendencies of the receivers we were going to
face for the scout team so I could get Ty (Law) and Steve (Israel)
ready. I also soaked in everything I could from Shawn (Jefferson)
and Terry (Glenn) and Troy (Brown). I watched how they did things,
what they did to get themselves free. I also worked on my speed
with (assistant coach) Mike Morris.'' The Patriots didn't draft a
receiver, so Morey should get more of a look. He met with receivers
coach Ivan Fears before leaving for Europe to get an idea of what
he needed to improve on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All the wrong moves
</P>
<P>
   Nice choice, Peter Warrick. Dump a legitimate agent, Michael
George of SFX in New York, for Norm Nixon, a former basketball
player? Some players deserve what they get. A year ago, Ricky
Williams dumped Andrew Brandt of Woolf Associates (now the Green
Bay Packers' contract negotiator) to go to Master P, and signed an
awful contract. This is certainly one of the reasons Brandt and
Patriots negotiator Jack Mula left the agent business; it's getting
dirtier and dirtier, according to industry sources. Agents are able
to steal clients because the NFL agent-player contract is one of
the weakest in sports. Some of the bigger firms have been signing
players to big-time marketing deals, which tend to be more binding.
Boston-based Brad Blank says that some of his more established
clients are solicited ``three or four times a month'' by other
agents. But after making such a switch, most players find that the
grass isn't greener. Agents do get together twice a year, but so
far they are not policing themselves . . . Brandt had a deal with
Sam Adams the night before the draft, but the next morning, Adams
reneged and signed with Baltimore. That's when Brandt flew to Los
Angeles and signed Russell Maryland to a two-year, $3.5 million
deal with a $1.75 million bonus. He got it done in one day . . .
Weis chuckled at a report that he had already scripted 15 plays for
Michael Bishop. ``If you run across a copy of those plays, I'd like
to see them,'' said Weis . . . The Patriots are putting new deals
for Drew Bledsoe and Glenn on the back burner. They are the team's
two best offensive players, and they can't be completely happy
about this. Say this about Glenn: Perhaps he hasn't accomplished
what Marvin Harrison has for the Colts and what Keyshawn Johnson
did for the Jets, but Glenn is arguably more valuable to his team
because the Patriots don't have Edgerrin James or Curtis Martin.
Glenn is the show, and everybody knows it. Especially with Ben
Coates gone . . . Klemm played on Hawaii's 0-12 team in 1998. ``It
was real depressing,'' he said, ``but what I'll always remember is
the celebration last year when we won our first game.'' . . .
Speaking of Klemm, many thought he would go to St. Louis in the
first round, but the Rams passed. Then they traded with Chicago,
moved up 21 spots in the fourth round, and took Klemm's teammate,
tackle Kaulana Noa. Klemm was often overshadowed at Hawaii because
Noa got more publicity as a native Hawaiian . . . Is ``Carl Pickens
wants out of Cincinnati,'' the longest-running and most boring
drama in the NFL? Just get rid of the guy . . . North Andover's Rob
Konrad is being considered at various positions in the Dolphins'
training camp. He has been used at lone setback, fullback, and even
slot receiver.

BRADLEY NEARS SUNSET OF SHINING CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the twilight of a most spectacular career, there is a sense
of fulfillment, and from where she sits, the view is quite
heartwarming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made my history,'' said Pat Bradley, the pride of
Westford. ``More than I ever could have imagined when I was 11 and
got into this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The glorious run started in 1974, and a special highlight
remains that first win in 1976, an event called the Girl Talk
Classic, in which she defeated Judy Rankin, Bonnie Lauer, and
Sandra Post in a playoff. There would be 30 more LPGA Tour
victories, including at least one in each of the four major
championships _ the US Women's Open, the LPGA Championship, the
Nabisco Championship, and the du Maurier Classic _ and in 1991 the
hard-to-open doors of the LPGA Hall of Fame swung clear for her
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, my career is coming to an end,'' said Bradley.
``There's nothing very surprising about that. That's reality. It's
the cycle of competitive life and it's taking its turn with new
players.''
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, indeed, for Bradley turned 49 last month and since
that Hall-clinching 1991 campaign, in which she won four times,
there has been just one victory. The top 10 finishes, once a given,
have dwindled to just five in the last three years. Players who are
younger and stronger have come along to make things even harder for
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a renewed passion as she tackles a full schedule
in 2000, a year she envisions as ``the crown jewel to my career.''
Bradley will captain the US Solheim Cup team in the women's
equivalent of the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a great deal to me,'' said Bradley, who played on
three Solheim teams, including the debut edition in 1990. ``It's
kind of like our Olympics, our chance to represent our country.
It's a very special moment for me and for all of our players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Solheim Cup will be played at Loch Lomond in Luss, Scotland,
Oct. 6-8, with the teams determined by a points system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rock of my team is no surprise,'' said Bradley. ``Juli
Inkster, Meg Mallon, Sherri Steinhauer, Dottie Pepper, and Kelly
Robbins _ it's a great nucleus of experience. But there are
up-and-coming stars like Kelli Kuehne (ninth in the standings) and
new Solheim faces like Nancy Scranton (seventh), and I look forward
to the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Having returned last week from a promotional visit to Scotland,
Bradley had rave reviews for the Tom Weiskopf-designed Loch Lomond
(``It has a tremendous variety of holes'') and for the way the
event is being welcomed over there (``They'd love to do the Ryder
Cup, possibly in 2009, so we're kind of a steppingstone'').
</P>
<P>
   She also faced questions about a topic that will not fade: the
hard feelings stemming from last September's Ryder Cup at The
Country Club in Brookline. The infamous celebration at the 17th
green is very much a concern for both Bradley and European captain
Dale Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to stifle competitive spirit or spontaneous
emotion,'' said Bradley, ``but we've got to make sure that we
channel them so that the rules of the game and the friendships that
we have worked hard over the years to secure are maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not take part in the 1998 Solheim Cup at Muirfield
Village in Dublin, Ohio, but she is aware that the competition got
intense and some Europeans took exception to the fiery antics of
some Americans, most notably Pepper. Bradley isn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dottie bleeds red, white, and blue,'' said Bradley. ``She's a
student of match play. Dottie knows what she can do and what she
can't do. Her spontaneous enthusiasm and competitive fire is what
every team would like to have. I'm just very happy she's on my
team. But I don't foresee that as a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   What could be a problem, said Bradley, is going through 2000
with ``one eye on my game and one eye on the others.'' But it's a
problem she gladly welcomes, and truth be told, she may not even
have one eye on her own game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are more concerned with the stock numbers than the
numbers on your own scorecard,'' she said, laughing, ``then things
have definitely changed for you.''
</P>
<P>
   So if this, her 27th year on Tour, is her finale (she said she
might play 10 events next year), then certainly she has been
blessed with a fitting farewell gift. It is something she never
could have envisioned back in the summer of '67, the Impossible
Dream season, when the Red Sox created magic daily. The 16-year-old
Bradley won the New Hampshire Amateur that summer, then repeated
two years later. She won New England Amateur titles in 1972-73,
then set off on a marvelous ride through professional golf.
</P>
<P>
   As the ride nears its end, it is one that should be applauded,
even by those who think golf begins and ends with the PGA Tour.
Ponder for a moment that, in 1986, Bradley won three majors and
finished fifth in the US Women's Open and you get an idea of the
quality of her play.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Circuit clout
</P>
<P>
   Brad Faxon has always been one of the more popular players on
the PGA Tour, a credit to his candor and willingness to give back
to the game. But he said he's become ``a lot more popular (with his
peers) since this event,'' a reference to the CVS Charity Classic,
which debuted in 1999 and will take the stage for a second time
July 9-11 at Rhode Island CC in Barrington. Although weekly pro-am
events are part of the routine for PGA Tour players, there aren't a
lot of chances to play in pro-pro best-ball events, a refreshing
change of pace. Faxon and Billy Andrade have modeled their event
after Peter Jacobsen's Fred Meyer Challenge, and they did such a
good job that their only problem this time was ``how to say no'' to
good friends and colleagues. ``But there were only 20 spots,'' said
Faxon. This time, they used the schedule to their advantage. For
instance, with the British Open July 20-23, some players _ such as
1999 CVS participants Stuart Appleby and Lee Janzen _ will head
over for some golf in Ireland as early as July 10, so they declined
invites. No problem, said Faxon. They went to Justin Leonard and
enticed him by saying how easy it would be to play in their event,
then fly out of Boston on the 11th or 12th for Scotland. Plus, he
would be paired with Davis Love. Leonard signed on. In fact, said
Faxon, the pairings are a selling point, as they were a year ago
when Jack Nicklaus played with his son Gary. This year, Greg Norman
was on the fence until Steve Elkington _ his pal from Australia _
came aboard. Now they can practice for this fall's President's Cup
competition. Jeff Sluman, who teamed with Appleby to win last
year's event, liked the idea of having Hal Sutton as a partner (who
wouldn't?), so two more were locked up. Then there is John Daly,
who can be either a crowd delight or a sponsor's nightmare. But in
recent events, Daly has shown a commitment to hard work and
rediscovering a game that is well worth the price of admission . .
. Tiger Woods, Karrie Webb, and Chad Campbell have streaked into
view with impressive play early in 2000. Chad Campbell? Indeed, as
in the Hooters Tour's Chad Campbell, winner of three straight.
``Everything's kind of falling into place right now,'' said the
Texan, who has not exactly captured the golf world's fancy quite
like Woods (six straight wins) or Webb (four). But the 25-year-old
understands where he is _ or where he isn't: ``It'd be nice to be
playing the PGA Tour or BUY.com tournaments, but it really doesn't
seem like I'm in a position to do that.'' . . . Some readers
inquired as to the whereabouts of former Senior PGA Tour staples
Larry Laoretti and Gay Brewer. You rarely see their names these
days because they have fallen out of the top 70 for career money
among Seniors. Brewer turned 68 last month. Laoretti, 60, will
probably tee it up only in the US Senior Open, which he won in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Controversial driver
</P>
<P>
   Quite a dilemma seems to be taking shape as the USGA and the
Royal and Ancient see things a bit differently regarding ``hot''
drivers. At the center of the controversy is Callaway's ERC, a
thin-faced driver that has been rejected by the USGA because of its
``springlike effect.'' The R&AMP;A wants to take its time before
deciding whether to follow the USGA, which brings up this
possibility: Colin Montgomerie may have the ERC in his bag at the
British Open in July but not at the PGA Championship in August.
Funny that Montgomerie would be involved in a controversy over a
driver, since that is the one aspect of his game that is never a
worry. The man could split a fairway with a shovel. Now, if he
could only fix his putting . . . The European Tour finally lands in
Europe with a rather important event (the Spanish Open), and where
are marquee names Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood? In Togo, Japan,
of course, playing amid all those Ozakis in the Chunichi Crowns . .
. His caddie is on his honeymoon, so Montgomerie borrowed Peter
Coleman from the vacationing Bernhard Langer for the Spanish Open.
``Bernhard and I have the same game _ I just play it quicker,''
said Montgomerie . . . The New England PGA announced its slate of
major award winners this week, and they included Paul Parajeckas of
Woburn CC as PGA Professional of the Year and Sue Kaffenburgh of
Hyannis GC as Teacher of the Year. Other winners: Wayne Natti of
Bethlehem CC in New Hampshire, Junior Golf Leader Award; Don Lyons
of George Wright GC in Hyde Park, Bill Strausbaugh Club Relations
Award; Bill Safrin of Myopia Hunt Club, Horton Smith Award for
Education; Tom Murphy of Burlington, George S. Wemyss Award for
exemplary promoter of golf in New England; and merchandisers of the
year to Mike Medeiros of Nashawtuc CC in Concord (private), Leigh
Bader of Pine Oaks in Easton (public), and Toby Ahern of Ferncroft
(resorts).

ROSENBLATT LEFT TO PONDER IFS AND BUTTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT RESERVATION _ It's the boxing equivalent of
a baseball rainout. You train and prepare, and then misfortune
strikes and the event is over.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when a boxing match is stopped because of an
accidental head butt, one wonders what might have been done to
prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   Surely Dana Rosenblatt wondered this Friday night, after his
10-round middleweight bout with Jimmy Crawford was stopped with 45
seconds left in the second when the two butted heads and blood
began squirting from Rosenblatt's forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Malden, Mass., middleweight spoke about the cuts
suffered in his last six fights, all of which led to trips to the
hospital. He and manager Joe Lake spoke about Lake's warning to him
between rounds about stepping into Crawford head-first.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt also talked about the months of training that went to
waste. Not to mention the plans for a possible summer bout against
Tony Ayala on HBO that were put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, maybe it's me,'' said Rosenblatt, whose record
is now 36-1-1. ``I'm not sure. Maybe I'm bending in or leaning
forward, I don't know. It happens all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, whose previous fight also was stopped after an
accidental head butt, is now 32-2-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I saw the squirt of blood, I knew it was going to be
bad,'' said Rosenblatt.
</P>
<P>
   Each fighter felt he was beginning to assert himself when the
butt occurred. Rosenblatt's plan was to begin with the jab, then go
to the body, and he was doing just that, particularly in the second
round. Crawford, meanwhile, was countering the assault, trying to
catch Rosenblatt coming in with shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit him with some shots early and he felt them,'' said
Rosenblatt.
</P>
<P>
   The capacity crowd booed when the stoppage was announced, but
clearly Rosenblatt could not have continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing the tissue below the skin level,'' said Michael
Schwartz, the ringside physician. ``It was an extremely deep cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have never stopped all night. They wouldn't have
been able to close that and the blood in the eyes would have gone
all night and in addition that cut could have become deeper. Then
you get into danger and worried about it being closed effectively
and infection and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both fighters said they would welcome a rematch, but Lake wasn't
so quick to call for one. If HBO officials still want Rosenblatt
for the Ayala fight in the summer, said Lake, he doubts there will
be another bout with Crawford soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see what the HBO people say before we come back
here,'' he said.

<P>
   Lake also voiced concern about his fighter's propensity for
getting cut in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at what point it becomes a major issue, Lake said, ``It's
a major issue now.''

PIAZZA SITS AS THE METS PICK UP 23 HITS
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Mike Piazza was encouraged when he woke up Saturday
morning. He was still injured _ the Mets' cleanup hitter would not
be swinging a bat Saturday _ but Piazza's elbow and wrist felt
better a day after they were battered in a home-plate collision. He
will not need long to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza expects to miss only a few games, meaning he could be
back during the Mets' next series, a four-game visit to Pacific
Bell Park, the new home of the San Francisco Giants. But this is
the Mets' only visit this season to Coors Field, and what a place
for a great hitter to miss.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who has hit better than .400 here, could only watch
Saturday as his teammates enjoyed a historic offensive day. The
Mets pounded out 23 hits _ not one of them a homer _ to tie a
26-year-old club record for hits in a nine-inning game. Todd Pratt
and Edgardo Alfonzo had four apiece as the Mets punished the
Colorado Rockies, 13-6.
</P>
<P>
   For Pratt, who is catching in Piazza's place, the four-hit game
was the first in his eight-year career, and it was a fitting way to
begin his latest extended playing stint.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm going to play a couple of games in a row and Mike's
going to be out, I take a little bit of pressure off myself because
I know I'm going to be out there tomorrow,'' Pratt said. ``I think
that carried into today's game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt saw Piazza before the game, and Piazza was upbeat, his
spirits high. It was a different reaction, Pratt noticed, than
Piazza had last April, when his sprained knee worsened the day
after it occurred and forced Piazza onto the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels a lot better than last night,'' Piazza said. ``I feel
it's going to heal quickly. I'm just fortunate it was nothing
major. Minor injuries occur all the time at this position.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Mets have Pratt, who played well in Piazza's
absence early last season and in the division series against
Arizona, when he hit the clinching home run in Game 4. He played
down his role in Saturday's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine's going to just be a three- or four-game stint,'' Pratt
said. ``I'm happy for the guys that are in there every day that we
need to get hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt was referring to Alfonzo, who pulled his average above
.300 for the first time since the season-opening series in Japan,
and Todd Zeile, who had three hits. Derek Bell also contributed
three hits, and Rickey Henderson, Jay Payton and Rey Ordonez had
two apiece. Every Met in the starting lineup, in fact, had a hit by
the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The former Met Masato Yoshii suffered much of the damage,
allowing six runs on nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii, who was traded by the Mets in January, lasted only three
and two-thirds innings, and his outing provoked the same kind of
reaction the Mets' Mike Hampton had on Friday night. Then, Hampton
surrendered six runs in an inning and took out his frustrations
with a right hook to the dugout sports-drink cooler. After leaving
in the middle of a six-run inning Saturday, Yoshii pounded
furiously on the coolers in the home dugout.
</P>
<P>
   His anger was understandable. Larry Walker had given the Rockies
a two-run lead with a home run off Rick Reed in the first inning,
and Yoshii gave it away in the second, when three Mets hits tied
the score, 2-2. The six-run fourth, highlighted by a run-scoring
triple by Payton, put the Mets ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's triple scored Zeile, and five more runs would scamper
home off Yoshii and reliever Rick Croushore, the last two on
Zeile's second single of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Payton had gotten two hits Friday, matching his total in 23
at-bats during the Mets' recent homestand. Saturday morning,
however, Payton was still thinking about the double play he had
grounded into with the bases loaded in that game, and he studied
video of himself on a hand-held monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the triple, Payton singled and lined sharply to second
on a ball that was dropped for an error. He now has consecutive
multihit games for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets built a lead of 12-2 in the sixth inning, after Pratt
doubled home Payton, and that was more than enough for Reed, who
improved to 3-0. Pitching for the first time in 10 days after
missing a start with a bruised left hand, Reed worked seven
innings, allowing six runs, all earned, on 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give up six runs here,'' Reed said, ``it's like giving
up three runs anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said his hand was sore from hitting; the pain was most
acute when he swung and missed in the sixth inning, and he said he
probably should not have even tried to swing. But Reed had no plays
in the field, Pratt lobbed his throws back to him, and Reed is not
concerned about making his next scheduled start.

ATHENS IN TROUBLE; ORGANIZERS IN DENIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More troubling than Athens's tragicomic disorganization only
four years before the 2004 Summer Olympics is the Fantasyland
denial by both organizers and the government that there's even a
problem. ``There is no cause for concern,'' the Culture Ministry
insisted after International Olympic Committee president Juan
Antonio Samaranch warned recently that the Games could be taken
away if the Greeks don't make ``drastic changes'' by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The Lords have never yanked the Olympics from a host city, and
it's unlikely they could find an alternate site on such short
notice. But after watching the organizers dawdle for three years,
Samaranch felt compelled to sound a 1,000-decibel warning.
</P>
<P>
   Athens is months behind in virtually every area of the checklist
_ construction, venues, infrastructure, communications, security,
traffic, and accommodations. It's not just foot-dragging, the IOC
says. It's cluelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our partners do not understand what the Games are,'' says
Jacques Rogge, who heads the IOC's oversight commission.
</P>
<P>
   What the Lords are hoping is that the global embarrassment will
shock the Greek government into taking over and getting
preparations on the fast track. ``It is circulating internationally
that we are a laughingstock,'' groaned the daily newspaper Ta Nea.
Who's cackling loudest? The Romans, who lost the bid to Athens.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting in synch
</P>
<P>
   If some noses in the US Olympic family are already out of joint
over the USOC's new corporate emphasis, wait until CEO Norman Blake
starts streamlining the sports governing bodies to get them in line
with their international federations. That would mean one
organization for figure skating and speedskating and one for
swimming, synchronized swimming, diving, and water polo. That may
make flow-chart sense, but it's a political minefield. As it is,
the US skeleton folks want to split from the bobsled people after
the 2002 Winter Games for the usual divorce reasons: irreconcilable
differences . . . Even if Toronto lands the 2008 Summer Games
(which will be awarded next year), the US still will bid for 2012,
even though there's zero chance that the IOC will choose
consecutive North American sites. Since eight cities (New York, Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Houston, Tampa, Cincinnati, and
Washington/Baltimore) are already spending money, the USOC feels
compelled to stay the course . . . Tough sell this year to convince
off-duty NHLers to play in the men's world ice hockey
championships, which began this weekend in St. Petersburg, Russia.
The international federation thought it could get more of them to
play by pushing the date three weeks past the end of the regular
season. By now, though, anybody not involved in the playoffs is on
the golf course. And few of them wanted to spend two weeks in
Russia anyway. That's a boost for the Motherland, which hasn't won
the title since 1993 and has been off the award stand for six
years. Dim medal chance for the US, which was sixth last year and
has only 13 NHLers (including Bruins Steve Heinze and Hal Gill) on
the 23-man roster. But with the Swiss and French in their group,
the Yanks at least should make it out of the prelims . . . Home
cookin' could help the US women's ice hockey team break its
six-year run of silver medals behind Canada next year, when the
world championships will be held in Minneapolis. Though the Yanks
won the inaugural Olympic title at Nagano, they've never gone gold
at the global tournament.

   Running scared
</P>
<P>
   USA Track and Field types are crossing their fingers and hoping
that the ``right'' person wins the Olympic men's marathon trials in
Pittsburgh a week from Sunday. If the victor hasn't met the A
standard of 2:14 (and only David Morris and Joe LeMay have), the
Americans will get to send only one entrant to the Games for the
first time in history. That's what happened to the women, when
unknown Christine Clark ran (slowly) to daylight in the South
Carolina heat. With Morocco's Khalid Khannouchi, the world
record-holder, unlikely to get citizenship clearance (plus the
signoff from his native country) in time, the odds are more than
decent that the ``wrong'' guy could break the tape . . . Terrific
performance by the US gymnasts at the recent Pacific Alliance meet
in New Zealand. The women, in their first competition since Bela
Karolyi took over as team coordinator, took the title ahead of the
Chinese and Australians, with Elise Ray winning the all-around and
Morgan White sharing third. The men were less than 15 hundredths of
a point behind the world champion Chinese, with Blaine Wilson
winning the all-around . . . It's lucky-loser heaven for the US
boxers. First, lightweight David Jackson got a ticket to the
Olympics after Marshall Martinez quit for personal reasons. Now,
light heavy Olanda Anderson gets one because world champ Michael
Simms Jr. was kicked off the squad for attitude-related issues,
including tardiness, blowing off practice, and missing curfews.
It's the first time that two boxers ended up off the team. The good
news for the beleaguered Yanks, though, is that all 12 survived the
regional qualifiers for the Games . . . The US baseball team that
will face Chinese Taipei in Pawtucket, R.I., in August isn't the
team that will be going to Sydney. It's the usual collection of
college all-stars who barnstorm every summer. The Olympians, who'll
all be minor leaguers from 40-man rosters, won't even be chosen
until Aug. 25 and won't play together until they get to Brisbane,
where they'll train for two weeks before they meet Japan, the
defending silver medalists, in their opener. Former Yankee GM Bob
Watson and former Angels GM Bill Bavasi will co-chair the selection
committee.

   Dizzy schedule upcoming for the US Olympic women's soccer team.
After this week's US Cup in Portland, Ore., they head Down Under
for the Pacific Cup in Australia in early June, then back for the
CONCACAF Gold Cup (playing at least once at Foxboro Stadium). Then,
they travel overseas for July tournaments in Germany and Norway,
and back to the States for an exhibition series before leaving for
Sydney. Along the way (probably on May 7 in the US Cup final),
ironwoman midfielder Kristine Lilly will become the first player,
male or female, to earn 200 international caps. The 28-year-old
Lilly, who has played all 90 minutes in 191 of her 198 matches, has
performed against 34 countries. Even so, her mark may not last
long. Teammate Mia Hamm is only 11 matches behind her . . . The US
Olympic women's basketball team, which is done until midsummer,
went 29-2 on its seven-month exhibition odyssey (losing only to
Tennessee and Brazil) and was 11-1 against national teams. The
squad, which still has one player to add, will reconvene after the
WNBA season ends in August and play nine exhibition games on the
way to Sydney . . . After winning only three medals in Atlanta
(none gold), the US Cycling people have abandoned a one-shot
selection for Sydney. Though some team members will come out of
last week's track trials in Texas, most will be chosen in July by
coaches who'll consider reputation, rankings, and recent
performance . . . Why were next month's US Olympic dressage trials
moved from New Jersey to Florida? Because the West Nile horse virus
is still lingering around the Northeast and the US Equestrian Team
is worried that European countries will nix their plans to hold
their final trials overseas during the summer . . . Speedo's new
$300 ``sharksuit,'' which covers the body from neck to ankles, is
causing ripples in the swimming world. The Fastskin suit is legal,
says the international federation, since it has no ``devices'' like
flippers or fins to make swimmers go faster. And Speedo says it'll
make it available to all comers. The sharksuit, which cuts down on
water drag, could do for swimming what the clap skate has done for
speedskating . . . NBA center Vlade Divac and Algerian distance
runner Noureddine Morceli are the most prominent names among the 44
candidates for the eight athletes' spots on the reformed IOC. Also
running is former US volleyball player Bob Ctvrtlik, who was
appointed last year but whose term expires this summer. They'll be
elected by the athletes at the Sydney Games . . . The US Olympic
team will use San Diego's old naval training center as a processing
place for Sydney. With a traveling party of 1,000 (including 600
athletes), the USOC needs a site that has enough space to issue
team gear, take team photos, and do medical checkups. ``We don't
always win the most medals,'' says Greg Harney, the USOC's Games
prep wizard, ``but we have the most baggage.''

BIG MAN ON CONTINENT IS CLASS OF EUROPEAN DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Wallace, the Celtics' general manager, is barnstorming
through Europe, and this week he will lay eyes on the one player
Over There who is making a case for himself as a lottery pick in
June.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Iakovos Tsakalidis, and he will become a household
name in more than the city of Athens (where he plays) and the
country of Georgia (where he was born) before long. He's 7 feet 2
inches, weighs around 220 pounds, and is either 20 or 22, depending
on whom you talk to.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace will see him Wednesday night in Greece, and he's looking
forward to it. Tsakalidis is projected to be a late lottery pick,
and the Celtics, who are short up front, likely will have a late
lottery pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a legitimate lottery talent,'' said Wallace, who has seen
the kid on tape and heard about him through the grapevine.
``There's always a scarcity of big men. But the big question with
him, as with a lot of these guys, is the contract. To quote Stan
Kasten, `International is synonymous with trouble.' He's clearly
lottery material. We'll see what happens when you start peeling
back the pages of the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   A Greek spy reports that Tsakalidis's contract with AEK Athens
expires in 2003 and the team would be disinclined to let him go for
the 2000-01 NBA season. But NBA teams have been known to wait for
Eurotalent; the Bulls waited three years for Toni Kukoc, and
Portland waited nine years for Arvydas Sabonis. Denver is still
waiting for 1996 first-rounder Efthimios Rentzias.
</P>
<P>
   Tsakalidis (also known as Tsakalov in some circles because of
his birthplace) has been tutored overseas by Dusan Ivkovic, who
also worked extensively with Vlade Divac, Kukoc, and the late
Drazen Petrovic. This season, Tsakalidis averaged 9.4 points and
7.2 rebounds while leading his team to the Saporta Cup title. If
his age is determined to be 20, he must apply for the NBA draft;
the deadline for that is May 14.
</P>
<P>
   But Tsakalidis is not alone in whetting the appetites of NBA
talent spotters in Europe. As many as four others could be drafted
in the first round, along with Zeljko Rebraca, probably the best
overall player in Europe, whose rights belong to the Raptors. He's
playing for Panathinaikos.
</P>
<P>
   As Wallace said, ``There's something over there this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Players who, depending on whether they enter the draft, could
warrant first-round status include:
</P>
<P>
   --Josip Sesar, a 6-5 shooting guard from Bosnia-Herzegovina who
played last year in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   --Olumide Oyededji, a 6-9 native of Nigeria who played for Dirk
Nowitzki's old team in Germany. He was not only named MVP of the
German All-Star Game, he also won the Slam Dunk title. Now 19, he
made an appearance at the Chicago predraft camp last year.
</P>
<P>
   --Marco Jaric, a 6-6 shooting guard who played in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   --Hidayet Turkoglou, a 6-8 swingman who is under a nine-year
deal with Efes Pilsen in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   You may hear other Europeans announce for the draft, but in many
cases, it is the work of their agents. If the lads go undrafted,
they become free agents, giving them more leverage.
</P>
<P>
   European players may also become more NBA-friendly next season,
when the league moves to make the European game faster by using a
24-second clock and allowing teams to have eight seconds to get the
ball over halfcourt. That will enable many of the teenagers now in
the pipeline to be better acquainted with the NBA game when they
reach draftable age.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A Net loss
</P>
<P>
   Don Casey saw it coming, knew it was coming, and, well, still
feels it could have waited. But after breakfast last week with
friend and Nets owner Lewis Katz, Casey was told he would not be
back to coach the Nets. New Jersey had until May 10 to move on
Casey's option year, but it was a foregone conclusion he'd be a
goner. Still, he wonders whether anyone else could have done any
more than he did with what he had. ``If you look at the bottom
line, it could fool you one way or another,'' Casey said. ``The
bottom line was not that bad. The problems were the beginning, at
2-15, and the end, when we lost three starters. Everybody forgets
the middle. Everybody points to all the close losses. What did they
want? Would they rather we'd have lost by 20? Getting in position
to win is one thing. Winning is another.'' Casey has been around
long enough to know the drill. The Nets want buzz. They need
someone they can market, even though the Celtics have shown good
coaches can be marketed for only so long. The Nets are locked in
with four huge contracts (Jayson Williams, Keith Van Horn, Stephon
Marbury, and Kerry Kittles). If all the players were healthy, New
Jersey could have a decent team. Casey never had Williams, had a
subpar Kittles most of the year, and spent a good part of the
season trying to get Marbury and Van Horn to work together. The
news that Casey was not coming back was out and about well before
Katz delivered it in person. ``I was hoping that maybe they were
mulling it over and saying, `Let's see what they can do with
everyone back,' '' Casey said. ``But I guess they felt they had us
for one year. And they waited for Passover and Easter to be over.''
Maybe he should have put lamb's blood over his door . . . Casey,
who has been given a three-year gig with Katz's foundation, is
represented by Lonnie Cooper, the Atlanta-based agent who handles
many NBA coaches, including Lenny Wilkens. Cooper said Wilkens will
have ``the option'' of working next season, although it would seem
Washington would not be a good fit for him. (Can you imagine
Wilkens and Rod Strickland?) Wilkens will be 63 when next season
starts and, despite being the winningest coach of all time, has a
rather spotty record where it counts: in the playoffs. He was 17-30
in six playoff appearances with the Hawks and, in seven years in
Cleveland, he managed to win exactly one best-of-seven series
(against the Celtics in 1992). Cooper said he anticipated as many
as eight jobs opening up this summer. As of now, the list includes
Atlanta, New Jersey, Washington, Dallas (although Don Nelson may
stick around), and Indiana. There also could be vacancies in
Detroit, Los Angeles (Clippers), and Vancouver. Throw in Denver
(new ownership) and some team that fails in the playoffs, and you
could have as many as 10 openings . . . One of the rites at Madison
Square Garden this time of year is for John Starks to show up at a
playoff game and have his face shown on the Jumbotron, evoking
cheers from the fans. The same thing happened when the Knicks
hosted Toronto. Starks, a free agent now, said he would love to
return and play in New York. He'll be 35 in August . . . Throwing
out last year's playoff seedings (six games separated teams 1-8),
the Pacers' loss to Milwaukee Thursday night represented only the
third time a No. 1 seed in the East has lost in the first round at
home since 1984. The other two occasions were in 1994, when Atlanta
lost to Miami, and 1995, when Orlando lost to the Celtics. In both
cases, the No. 1 seed rallied to win. The Pacers went into Game 3
against the Bucks with an 18-0 record against teams that had beaten
them in their previous meeting . . . Antoine Walker and Kenny
Anderson were among 27 players who started all 82 games this
season. The Celtics were one of six teams that had two or more
players go wire to wire, led by Vancouver, which had four. (Can you
imagine what would have happened to the Grizzlies had they had any
injury problems?) Eleven teams had no one start 82 games. The Iron
Man of the Year award, however, goes to Chris Gatling. He appeared
in 85 games with Orlando and Denver. The record for games played in
a season is 88, held by Walt Bellamy during the 1968-69 season,
when he spent time with the Knicks and Pistons . . . In case you
missed it, the Celtics lost a coin flip with Denver and will get
the 11th pick in the draft if they don't win the lottery. Both
teams have nine chances out of 1,000 to move into the top three of
the lottery, which will be held May 21 . . . Eddie Jones was asked
by the Charlotte Observer to name the five hardest players to
defend. His first two were Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson. Among
the other three was Paul Pierce. ``I like that kid,'' Jones said.
``He's going to be a player.''

<P>
   Bird: bad Pacing
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird thought his team had what it took to win it all two
years ago. He may have thought so last year as well. This year?
Well, it was clear Bird had concerns even before the playoffs
started. Indiana barely squeaked out a win in Game 1 and was
bludgeoned in Game 2 by the Bucks. One thing Bird despises: getting
embarrassed at home. ``I hate it,'' he said. ``I remember when we
would lose at the Garden, I hated the feeling of walking out of
that building. As a player, that's the worst thing that ever
happened to me.'' He also said he thought practice was a good
barometer for a team in the postseason and complained about
listless workouts prior to the Game 2 debacle. ``If they don't
practice well, they don't play well,'' he said. As for Rik Smits,
who is pondering retirement, Bird said, ``I don't talk to Rik about
his injuries. Every time I ask him, he tells me that something's
wrong. So I stopped asking him. The last time I asked him was two
years ago.'' . . . Here's a name to put in your Down The Road
folder: Nate Huffman. He's a 7-1, 215-pound center who spent the
last year playing for Maccabi Tel-Aviv and already is drawing
interest from NBA people in much the same way John Amaechi did.
Huffman played two years for Central Michigan and another year with
the CBA Idaho Stampede. He's been overseas the last two years and
has developed a serviceable game around the basket, especially on
offense. In the just-concluded European Final Four, won by Dino
Radja's old team, Panathinaikos, Huffman averaged 25 points, 7.5
rebounds, and 2 blocks. He reportedly has an option in his deal
with Maccabi to leave for the NBA and has as a tattoo of the NBA
logo on his right arm . . . If Walker is cyber-savvy, he ought to
go to ESPN.com and click on an article by Mike Monroe of the Denver
Post. Monroe talked to Karl Malone about the Mailman's offseason
conditioning program, and the words resonate here. ``You don't
become an All-Star or a great player when the season starts,''
Malone said. ``You just maintain then. All your work is done in the
summer.'' Malone often has criticized up-and-comers for not
preparing properly for play. His summer conditioning program is
legendary. ``You are made into a great player in the summertime,
when it's not so easy to work,'' he said. ``(Non-playoff teams)
have five months off. Well, it's kind of easy to take that first
month off. Then it's, `Aw shoot, I'll take another month off.' Then
it's another two weeks . . . In the summertime, it's easy to get in
your nice Benz, fly here and fly there with five or six of your
buddies. But how many of those buddies are going to say, `Hey,
let's train. Let's get in the weight room'? They don't. They're
saying, `Let's hang out here, let's hang out there.' . . . You've
got a lot of money, a lot of nice, material things. But a lot of
people you hang out with are not going to tell you the stuff you
really need to hear.'' Concludes Malone, ``Commitment is in the
summer, when no one wakes you up, no one sets your alarm clock, no
one gives you an itinerary. You just do it yourself.''

SOX GET LOST IN THE SUN

   CLEVELAND _ If it's not raindrops, it's sunspots. And just as
umbrellas were useless to the Red Sox with the Cleveland Indians in
town for last weekend's three-game washout, sunglasses were of no
help to right fielder Darren Lewis here Saturday afternoon under a
high sky in Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Sox hope to avoid a three-game sweep by the Indians
this weekend, it may take more than sending Pedro Martinez to the
mound this afternoon. They might want to call on weatherman Bruce
Schwoegler for some advice on how to cope with the elements.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox dropped their second straight one-run game to the
Indians Saturday, a taut 3-2 decision that turned on Lewis's
inability to catch Jacob Cruz's fly ball in the fifth inning. Lewis
was charged with an error on the play, but for as much chance as he
had of seeing the ball, Lewis might as well have been wearing a
blindfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it when it went up,'' Lewis said. ``It was one of those
that went up in the sun and kind of came straight down in it. I did
everything you're supposed to do to get the ball out of the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis flipped down his shades. He held his glove high overhead,
trying to shield the sun. He ducked his head, hoping to catch a
glimpse of white on white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know,'' said manager Jimy Williams, ``having seen a lot
of day games, that when you see the reflection of the sun on the
glasses, you know it's a tough play.''
</P>
<P>
   It should have been the easiest of plays. Cruz's fly ball was
nothing like Richie Sexson's line single to right or the double
scorched into the left-field corner by Einar Diaz, the two hits
given up by Sox starter Ramon Martinez just before Cruz came to the
plate. Cruz, playing because Kenny Lofton has a strained biceps,
hit a fly ball to medium right field, just a few steps to Lewis's
right.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis looked up. He searched the sky in vain until it was too
late. The ball dropped just behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it right at the last second,'' he said. ``But I couldn't
get close enough to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett, the center fielder, was close enough to make a
play, and he had a view of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't call him off,'' Everett said, ``because I thought he
had it. I wasn't sure, and when you're not sure, you don't do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   While the ball enjoyed its freefall, Sexson scored and Diaz took
third, from where he scored on Omar Vizquel's sacrifice fly to make
it 3-1. Cruz was credited with a sacrifice on his fly ball, too,
and Lewis was saddled with an error by an unsympathetic scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Everett) said he could have caught it,'' Lewis said, ``but
that was one of those in-between plays where you don't have a lot
of time to have a conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Those runs became the difference when the Sox, who had taken a
1-0 lead on Mike Stanley's home run off Chuck Finley to start the
second inning, scored again in the eighth when Wilton Veras
doubled, took third on Lewis's single, and came home when Jose
Offerman grounded into a force play.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox still had two on and two out when Cruz flagged down
Stanley's deep drive at the wall, crashing awkwardly into the wall.
Earlier, Cruz took away extra bases from Nomar Garciaparra in the
sixth with a lunging catch after making a long run. Garciaparra's
14-game hitting streak expired when he walked in the eighth,
leaving him 0 for 3 on the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who had seven hits in Friday's 4-3 loss to the Indians,
had just five Saturday, their bats going quiet after last
Wednesday's 21-hit salute in Texas. Leadoff man Offerman remains
buried in his slump, which is now 4 for 34 after an 0 for 3
Saturday. Utility infielder Manny Alexander, Williams's startling
choice to DH against Finley, struck out twice and failed to get the
ball out of the infield in four at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   And the Indians' outfield played good defense for the second
straight game, Cruz's two catches coming in the aftermath of David
Justice's big play the night before on Troy O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad about it,'' Lewis said. ``But what are you going to
do? Plays like that are part of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had opportunities to win, but they made good plays on the
warning track, and we have two one-run losses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are paying Finley $27 million to give them a better
shot against the iron of the AL East, the Sox and Yankees. The
37-year-old lefthander, who is now 3-0 and leads the AL in
strikeouts at least until Martinez makes up a 2-K difference (42 to
40) this afternoon, is now 28-18 lifetime against the Sox and
Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finley didn't beat us,'' said Everett, who had an infield hit
in four trips and struck out twice, the second time against
reliever Steve Karsay, who has saved each of the last two games.
``I won't give him any credit for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``His pitching didn't beat us. We lost the game in the field,
not because of good pitching.''

INDIANS ARE SAFER WITH FINLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ They are the four richest families in the
neighborhood known as the American League. They reside in an
exclusive baseball cul-de-sac, and spend most of their time
figuring out how they can be better than each other.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Indians are old-money residents. They've been in
the wealthy 'hood since '95, playoff participants for five
consecutive seasons. The Red Sox and Rangers are the nouveau riche.
They have three postseason appearances since '95. Any other folks
who sneak into the gated playoff community (the Orioles and
Mariners have done it twice) are tagged with a ``Just Visiting''
label.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at Jacobs Field, more than 42,000 people got a chance
to see how the AL rich live. No way was this just another game
between the Indians and Sox. These were two nosy neighbors
investigating each other, trying to peer over the fence to see if
one had reason to be jealous of the other.
</P>
<P>
   The last two games _ both Cleveland wins _ were the first since
last fall in which the Indians have seen the Sox with Carl Everett.
This was also the first the Sox have seen of Chuck Finley as an
Indian.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way I would trade the 28-year-old Everett for the
37-year-old Finley. But who could blame the Sox for also wanting
what the Indians have? The Sox' want is certainly not one of
excess; they certainly could use a lefthander whose career epitaph
will read: He Always Handled The Yankees (16-9 in his career).
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always going to give you a label,'' Finley said
after his 7 2/3-inning, seven-strikeout performance Saturday.
``It's better to have that label than for someone to say, `He Can't
Do It.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Couple Finley's work with Saturday's 3-2 Indians win and what
you have is a neighborhood power statement. We can all fool
ourselves if we want and pretend that the White Sox can win the AL
Central. We can worry about the Blue Jays and Orioles in the East.
We can continue to say nice things about the A's and Angels. But
when October arrives, don't expect the neighborhood to change too
much. If the Sox return to the playoffs, the Indians and Yankees
will be there with them.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too early to ask if the Sox are better-equipped to win
the pennant than they were last season. It is obvious that they are
better with Everett as the starting center fielder and Darren Lewis
as an outfield rover. But it's difficult to resist playing chess
with the Indians. They added Finley to a rotation of Bartolo Colon,
Jaret Wright, Charles Nagy, and Dave Burba. This is no longer a
Looks Good on Paper argument; if the Indians can do Sunday what
they never have done _ beat Pedro Martinez _ they will sweep the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's only April. Yes, they have been one-run games that
could have been won by the Sox. No, a sweep would not cause the Sox
to panic. But I am sure the current Indians have inspired Boston GM
Dan Duquette to think about tinkering with his team.
</P>
<P>
   You remember the Indians from October, right? Does this look
like the same team? I don't think so. The biggest difference is
Finley. The pitcher is married to actress Tawny Kitaen, who said
she became intrigued when she first saw Finley's ankles (she says
they are the sexiest she's ever seen). Kitaen used to be married to
David Coverdale, the former lead singer of a Led Zeppelin ripoff
rock group named Whitesnake (how's that for subtle commentary?).
She has said it's no coincidence that the group fell apart when she
left Coverdale.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who haven't won a World Series since 1948, don't
care about Finley's ankles. They don't listen to Whitesnake. They
are in love with their new pitcher's left arm, and if other members
of the cul-de-sac are honest, they will tell you that they are hot
for Finley's arm, too. Last winter, the Sox, Yankees, and Orioles
all tried to sign the former Angel. Boston lost out, Finley said,
because he thinks the Indians have the best chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart and soul is with this team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone in baseball knows Finley has had success against
the rich-boy Yankees, few know he also has dominated Nomar
Garciaparra in his career. Garciaparra, who had his 14-game hit
streak broken Saturday, is 1 for 14 vs. Finley. The pitcher was
asked if he knew about those numbers. He shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm just having trouble remembering where I put my keys,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, teammate David Justice was saying that he has
always respected pitchers such as Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he's like Sandy Koufax and Bob Gibson,'' Justice
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also threw in a playful dig at Kenny Lofton, who is not
expected to face Martinez Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kenny gets over his Pedro-itis,'' Justice said, ``he'll
be back.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice also respects pitchers such as Finley, guys who
aren't stars but who know how to pitch. ``Basically, pitchers who
have game,'' the outfielder explained. Finley has game. He joins a
few other Indians who have game, too.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean for the Sox? Well, we know that they will
continue to live among the baseball elite. But when they look
outside their windows, they see three World Series flags flapping
outside the recent Yankee estate. They also see the Indians
surrounding the pinstriped home, trying to see how they can win a
flag of their own. If the Sox are swept in this series _ the
calendar be damned _ they will know that they need an upgrade or
two.

WILL IT BE 10 FOR 10 AT NAPA 500?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ There have been nine different winners in nine
NASCAR Winston Cup races this season.
</P>
<P>
   Will today's NAPA Auto Parts 500 at California Speedway produce
the 10th?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd sure like to be the 10th,'' said Ontario, Calif., native
Mike Skinner, who will start from the pole in search of his first
Winston Cup victory. ``But it's tough. I think the guy (starting)
42nd, if he gets his setup right, is going to be the guy to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track position is very, very important. But if a guy back
there in 35th place gets his car hooked up and you have a long
green-flag run, before long he's going to have track position
because he's faster then everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been the case in the three previous Winston Cup events at
California Speedway, which has seen Jeff Gordon produce runaway
victories in 1997 and 1999 and Mark Martin win in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Most wouldn't be surprised if the same scenario repeated itself
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a possibility (again),'' said Ricky Rudd, who
starts third in his Texaco Ford Taurus. ``You want to sit here and
talk about how exciting it's gonna be and it very well may be the
greatest race we've ever seen here at California, but this type of
racetrack has that potential. If you hit a really good chassis
setup you can check up on the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Gordon did when he beat teammate Terry Labonte in
the inaugural event in 1997 and repeated in finishing ahead of Jeff
Burton last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy gets going and gets his car balanced, then he'll run
away,'' said Tony Stewart, who starts a disappointing 32nd.
``That's just the characteristic of this kind of track. It's fast,
it's flat, and momentum is so important here. If a guy is off just
a little, he's off a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   That might give the edge to Skinner. The former Winston Cup
Rookie of the Year, who finished a career-best second at Talladega,
Ala., two weeks ago, was near the top of the practice results
before taking the pole with an 186.061-mph lap on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to get the car handling real well and the
rest of it takes care of itself,'' Skinner said. ``If you've got to
lift off the gas when you get behind a car coming off a corner, you
can't pass that car. You've got to be able to make a run at 'em,
make your move and go on. If you're pushing (moving up the race
track), you ain't going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   And you are also not going to make it unless you can average 50
laps between pit stops, which Martin found out in 1997 when he was
forced to pit from the lead with 10 laps remaining in the 250-lap
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they keep telling me,'' said rookie Scott Pruett,
who starts sixth. ``You have to make it to 50 (laps) on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just how fast the race goes and how many long
green-lap runs we have. You have to make the right amount of stops
to put you in those fuel windows to be able to cut (a stop) down,
rather then add one.'' &QL;

`INTIMIDATOR' A CONTENDER AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ What comes around, goes around.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in NASCAR Winston Cup understands that more then Dale
Earnhardt, who after nearly three subpar seasons in the late 1990s
appears to have recaptured his championship form.
</P>
<P>
   Since finishing a disappointing 21st at the season-opening
Daytona 500 in February, Earnhardt has one victory and seven top-10
finishes in eight races. He comes into today's NAPA Auto Parts 500
fourth in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a race team right now that every man on it, they're
pumped to win,'' said Earnhardt, who has his best chance at winning
a Winston Cup championship since 1995. ``They're coming to the race
track pumped to win. They're excited. You don't have to do
something exciting to excite them. They're ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a far cry from where Earnhardt the `Intimidator' was
just a couple of seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   After winning 70 races and seven Winston Cup championships
between 1979 and 1994, he dropped into the mainstream. Earnhardt,
who was recently voted ESPN Driver of the Decade, won just once in
97 races between March 1996 and February 1998, including going
winless in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I was at,'' Earnhardt said. ``Everybody
talked about me being gone or whatever. I've been (here). I just
kept working and the guys kept working and we didn't give up on
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did team owner Richard Childress, who realized early in
1999 that he hadn't provided Earnhardt with the best possible
equipment during those lean years. The former Winston Cup regular
rebuilt his two-team operation, adding aerodynamic specialist Louis
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the critics said it would never work because of the
personalities, you know, with me and Dale involved,'' Childress
said. ``It hasn't been nothing but positive. If anything, our
working relationship has been stronger. I think it makes mine and
his personal relationship stronger because we got a common thing
we're all working at.''
</P>
<P>
   But Earnhardt's slump wasn't just mechanical. His 49-year-old
body had taken its toll following three major crashes between 1996
and '98, including rolling his Monte Carlo at Talladega in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt addressed that issue by having surgery this past
December to repair a ruptured disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better than I have in a long time after getting my neck
worked on back in December,'' said Earnhardt, who won three times
last year. ``It took a lot of strain and stress off me, so I'm in
better shape. I think what happened to me happened in '96 at
Talladega and it was something that didn't really get aggravated
until March of last year when I wrecked in Atlanta. Last year, I
was racing pretty much with a lot of pain and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   And the improved feeling has shown on the race track this
season. Earnhardt finished second at Rockingham, won at Atlanta,
and was a close third at Talladega. He's suddenly a contender
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebuilding process was a long hard thing,'' Earnhardt
said. ``To put it into perspective that's what we did, we just
rebuilt. We were ready this year. I think we're more ready this
year, team-wise, than we've been in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   And it has the team thinking about that eighth Winston Cup
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us want to see Dale win that eighth championship,''
Childress said. ``I think it would mean a lot to the sport,
(Richard Childress Racing) and for Dale to win that eighth title
and down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I think about every day.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' Earnhardt said. ``I've mellowed as I've gone on
and got smarter. I still drive the race car pretty good. I'm just
enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   So are his fans. &QL;

WEATHER NICE, BUT UCLA SCRIMMAGE NOT SO GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA concluded its injury-marred spring practice
with a short scrimmage Saturday under a brilliant sky at remodeled
Drake Stadium, but its performance didn't match the weather. The
offense sputtered and the defense dominated as 20 ailing players
watched from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Ryan McCann completed 3-of-6 passes for 18 yards and
an interception during the 30-minute scrimmage. He also fumbled
twice and fell once while retreating from center.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve quarterback Scott McEwan was 4 of 7 for 18 yards and
struggled with the basics, as well. A makeshift offense line
contributed to the woes, as did the absence of top receivers
Freddie Mitchell (baseball) and Brian Poli-Dixon (hamstring).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed with some performances of the
quarterbacks,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``We looked like the
Keystone Kops out there ... (but) we're missing 20 players, and
it's hard to have any continuity or consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Cory Paus, competing with McCann for the starting
job, did not participate in the scrimmage because of offseason
shoulder surgery, but he was sharp in the non-contact drills. Paus,
who started seven games last year, was the most consistent passer
throughout the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo won't name a starter until training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with the way I played this spring considering
I couldn't throw the ball for four months in the offseason,'' Paus
said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting tailback DeShaun Foster (sprained knee) didn't play,
and second-stringer Jermaine Lewis played sparingly. That created
an opportunity for third-stringer Akil Harris, a redshirt freshman
from Monrovia. He scored the only touchdown and had nine carries
for 53 yards, including a 40-yard burst that was the afternoon's
lone offensive highlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job,'' Toledo said. ``He's going to be an
excellent back.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING GOOD: Despite a month of injuries, the coaches had time
to evaluate several underclassmen who redshirted last year. Four
made lasting impressions: defensive tackle Rodney Leisle, defensive
ends Dave and Mat Ball, and guard Shane Lehmann.
</P>
<P>
   Leisle is the projected starter at one of the tackle spots
(alongside Ken Kocher) after outplaying junior Anthony Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   INJURY UPDATE: None of the spring injuries are expected to
linger until training camp. However, reserve linebacker Billy
Pieper's career is in jeopardy because of a neck problem that is
partly congenital and partly related to football, a school official
said. The Bruins will consult with specialists before making a
final decision.
</P>
<P>
   BARNES UPDATE: Basketball player Matt Barnes attended Saturday's
scrimmage and expects to join the football team for training camp
as a receiver. For now, basketball is secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to work with the quarterbacks and receivers in the
summer and report in August,'' Barnes said. ``I'm going to stick
with football until it ends and then go play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his decision to play football, Barnes was projected to
start at power forward in place of NBA-bound Jerome Moiso. &QL;

KENSETH WINS AUTO CLUB 300

<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ It was a lot like deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Busch Grand National Division driver Matt Kenseth won
Saturday's Auto Club 300 at California Speedway, finishing just
ahead of Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happened last year. Only don't ask Burton to
relive those memories. Not that he is bitter about losing to
Kenseth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't remember finishing second last year,'' Burton
said. ``I don't recall last year's race at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth remembers his first victory on the Busch series at
California Speedway. When asked to compare the two, he said this
one was much sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a lot like this year in that we didn't have the
fastest car. Jeff had the car to win,'' Kenseth said. ``Last year
was just more uneventful. At the end of the race I was leading, but
I didn't know how it happened. I definitely had to work harder for
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, when Kenseth beat Burton under caution, the
defending race champion had to fend off three surging challengers
in the final laps. Among those drivers was Burton, who led the race
for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until an oil spill on lap 117 of the 150-lap race
brought out a caution flag and bunched the drivers that Burton lost
his lead for good. He dropped behind his brother, Ward Burton, on
the restart. Even though the two Winston Cup regulars raced side by
side for a while, Jeff couldn't pass Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the fight for first as the race winded down was Kenseth
and pole winner Jeff Green. But Ward Burton lost control of his car
with eight laps to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got loose,'' Green said of Ward Burton. ``He tried to
save it, but he couldn't. Ward was trying so hard just to keep Matt
and me off of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton spun out coming out of turn 4. When Jeff Burton went
high to pass him, Kenseth went low and came out in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed,'' Jeff Burton said. ``But I won a race at
Vegas the same way. Matt won this one. So I'm not going to stomp my
feet about it. It was a little bit of a bad break for us. But what
comes around goes around.''
</P>
<P>
   When racing resumed with four laps to go, Kenseth blasted out to
take about a half-second lead and held it until the end of the
race. He credited the strong restart to taking four fresh tires
while pitting under caution.
</P>
<P>
   Green finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth, a NASCAR Winston Cup regular who will run with his
brother in today's NAPA Auto Parts 500, won for the second time
this season on the Busch series. It was also his ninth career
victory in Busch competition.
</P>
<P>
   Green, the Busch series points leader, has yet to win a race in
10 events this season. He said that if he ends up winning the
points title, he would also like to win at least one race to go
along with it. But he also said he doesn't mind sharing the track
and the limelight with Cup drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an awesome time there at the end,'' Green said. ``I
enjoy them running with us. I learn so much by having them out
there, and they put people in the stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Sauter was the top-finishing rookie, coming in 10th. Ron
Hornaday Jr. of Palmdale, the series' rookie points leader,
finished a lap down in 19th. &QL;

OPENING DAY IN EASTERN SIERRA IS ABOUT MEMORIES

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. _ Very early Saturday morning, George
Rozuk caught a fish.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as his wife had told him to do, he opened the package
shehad wrapped. Inside was a framed photo of George Rozuk Jr., age
10. Theboy in the photo beamed, showing three fingers and holding a
large trout from a long-ago opener, his first opener and the first
of many to comewith Dad. Georgie was proud because his three trout
came before anyone else had any.
</P>
<P>
   His father looked at that old photo Saturday morning, as the
orange light of dawn slowly revealed Crowley Lake and the thousands
of anglers who had come here, and he cried.
</P>
<P>
   George Rozuk Jr., 24, died in an automobile accident on April
15.
</P>
<P>
   They were to come here together on Saturday, George Sr. and
George Jr., as they always had. Instead, George Sr. came with a
sign on hisRV. ``Crowley bound in memory of my son.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my family I was going to God's country,'' said Rozuk,
who is from Covina. ``God took my son, and I feel deeply in my
heart this is where my son wanted me to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the shoreline from Rozuk stood Jeff Cox of Boron and his
son, exactly in the same spot they stood last year and exactly in
the same spot they stood the year before that. Fishing was slow,
and they were cold, and it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   A half-mile away, Reggie Rodriguez of Canyon Country fished
theWhiskey Creek Inlet. Across the way his wife Bea fished. They
were married on the opening day of trout season 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie's been fishing up here for 30 years, ever since his
father brought him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys I first fished with, they were in their 60s then,''
Rodriguez said. ``They're all gone now. I come out here now and
think about them. I think about the things they did, the things
they said.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's trout opener in the Eastern Sierra was like that.
Itwas not about fish, who caught them and how big they were _
although that's what people talked about. What mattered was love
and family, the past and the future, connecting and reconnecting.
</P>
<P>
   George Flores of Sylmar looked at the two small fish on his
stringer and a pole that hadn't been hit in a while. A dozen
buddies from the Valley fished all around him. ``I think,'' he
said, ``this is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Bea Rodriguez hadn't fished before she met her husband-to-be.
But, Reggie told her, she'd better learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I love being here and watching him catch his fish,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   One year, not too long after they had gotten together, Bea and
Reggie fished Owens River. She wore waders for the first time and
figured one of her feet grew increasingly uncomfortable because
that's just the way waders were. Finally, her foot hurt just too
much.
</P>
<P>
   She took the boot off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' she said, ``I didn't know these were fur-lined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not,'' Reggie said.
</P>
<P>
   She turned the boot upside down, and out came a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Bea screamed, chucked the boot into the river, and ran. Then a
gull swooped before her, Hitchcock-style, and squaked. Bea,
hysterical, turned and sprinted.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie retrieved the boot and then retrieved his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever you come out here with, you bond,'' Reggie said.
``When you get back to the city, you see that individual and things
are different. Something has changed between you, and it never goes
away.''
</P>
<P>
   George Rozuk stands alone on the shore, an eye on his pole and
his mind on his son.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 people came to the funeral, George said.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say,'' he said, ``two hundred of them were his
girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   A respectful distance away, George Sr.'s friend Armando Angulo
milled about.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs some time alone,'' Angulo said, nodding toward the
boat a short distance offshore in which George's brother Charlie
and his good friend Dan Sanchez fished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here for his support,'' Angulo said. ``George hasn't
really broken down yet. I'm trying to keep myself together, but
it's hard. I still hear it in his throat, the cry for his son.''
</P>
<P>
   George and Armando display the photo of 10-year-old George Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out here for my boy. I hope you guys understand it,''
George Sr. said. ``My boy, he would have wanted it. He loved
everybody. He was always helping people.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boy went everywhere and did everything with me. He did a
lot more than what most kids do with their dads,'' George said. ``I
used to tell him, `Mijo, every day is a special day.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Weatherly of Mammoth Lakes and his son Walker, 12, are
heading home. They trolled Crowley and limited out in an hour and a
half.
</P>
<P>
   Walker proudly shows off a large cutthroat he caught, the
day'sprize of an impressive stringer.
</P>
<P>
   Fred's the preacher for the High Sierra Christian Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishing is all about memories,'' he said. ``One of these days,
we'll sit around and remember. Remember the day we caught all those
fish? Remember the day we caught that old cutthroat? Remember how
cold it was that day?
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' he said, ``how much fun we had?''
</P>
<P>
   Remember. And never forget. &QL;

SHARKS CONFIDENT DESPITE GAME 1 DEBACLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ San Jose winger Jeff Friesen skated off the Reunion
Arena ice after yesterday's optional skate, looked at a group of
reporters and said, ``The sun came up today.''
</P>
<P>
   One day removed from a 4-0 loss in Game 1 against the Stars, the
Sharks remained composed and confident. They didn't get bogged down
with talk about turning the series into a war of attrition. They
stressed improving the penalty kill, raising their intensity,
taking advantage of scoring opportunities and, most important,
getting their forecheck in gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play with more emotion and we will,'' defenseman
Jeff Norton said. ``How we do it is we get back to dropping the
puck in properly, get bodies on guys, obviously, we can't take bad
penalties against these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks depend on a strong forecheck. They dump the puck into
the zone and use their forecheck to gain puck possession. The
Stars, with a big assist from the return of Sergei Zubov, cleared
their own zone swiftly and took the Sharks out of their game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we had success against St. Louis was to get our
forechecking going,'' center Vincent Damphousse said.
\Nsubheds:Line changes Sharks coach Darryl Sutter said line changes
might be coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like any of the matchups,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter said the Stars surprised him by matching their No. 1 line
of Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Brenden Morrow against his top line
of Vincent Damphousse, Owen Nolan and Dave Lowry. Sutter expected
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock to attack that line with checkers Guy
Carbonneau, Mike Keane and Blake Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what the matchups were going to be,'' Sutter
said. ``Who did they want against Vinny? I think it was different
than what we thought it would be. We probably have to make some
adjustments.''The Sharks realize their best games come when they
play disciplined and positionally strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games we lost \Rto St. Louis\S we were undisciplined,''
Jeff Friesen said. ``The three games they beat us, they beat us
5-3, 5-3, 6-2. It shows you, you give up four goals to Dallas, with
\REd\S Belfour in net, you're not going to win any games.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, in the Sharks' four victories over the Blues,
they allowed a total of six goals.] \Nsubheds:Briefly The Sharks
remain confident goalie Steve Shields can rebound again from a poor
outing. ``We don't worry about Shields at all,'' Mike Ricci said.
``He's a great competitor. He is going to be there. We just have to
make sure we're there in front of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he will raise his intensity level for Game 2, the
long-haired Ricci said, ``Maybe I'll shave my head.''

SHARKS CAPTAIN OWEN NOLAN FEELING PLENTY OF PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Owen Nolan is hurting. Apparently so much that his
status for today's Game 2 is shaky.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' Nolan said, ``I'll be playing in Game 2.''
</P>
<P>
   More is ailing the Sharks' captain than his bruised left foot
that blocked St. Louis defenseman Al MacInnis' slap shot in Game 7
of their first-round series. In the final weeks of the season,
Nolan suffered a concussion and a shoulder injury, forcing him out
of four crucial games.
</P>
<P>
   The shoulder was still bothering him against St. Louis, but in
keeping with the hockey code this time of year, he kept that topic
to himself and played through the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into specifics,'' said Nolan, who had six
goals and eight points against the Blues. ``The second I start
telling you guys, they \R the Stars\S start coming after it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sore and kind of hampered a little bit.But, it's just
something you've got to battle through. I'm sure a lot of guys are
going through that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars didn't need to know his medical history to target him.
The Stars came after him early and often in the 4-0 victory in Game
1. Nolan didn't seem able to find his typical burst to the puck and
lacked the punch he usually brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you ask Nolan what's wrong, you never know,'' teammate
Jeff Friesen said. ``He takes it personally. It's hard to get close
to Nolan when he's hurt. If he needs time to rest, everyone has to
pick up the slack.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks' regular-season leader in goals (44), hits (209),
takeaways (70) and minutes (21:07) per game, Nolan registered no
hits on Friday and had four shots. Stars goalie Ed Belfour made a
sliding save on Nolan's one golden scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took it to the net once really strong, but there were a
couple of times he'd have a grimace on his face,'' Stars winger
Brenden Morrow said. ``We noticed he wasn't 100 percent, but he's
still dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks need him. He has scored nearly a third of their
playoff goals and is the greatest scoring threat on a team not
blessed with a roster full of gunslingers. The Sharks win by
throwing the puck at the net and banging it home, something they
say they must do more of in Game 2 _ with or without their captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can't play, it's because he's hurt,'' Sharks coach
Darryl Sutter said.

FUSAICHI PEGASUS FACING SCRUTINY AS DERBY NEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the 126th running of the Kentucky Derby is conducted
Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., the world will find
out if a goofball can win horse racing's biggest event.
</P>
<P>
   Horses regarded as goofballs don't have a good record in the
Derby. Fusaichi Pegasus acts like a goofball. He tossed his rider
and flipped over onto his back Thursday after what was supposed to
be a routine gallop. Nothing seems routine for Fusaichi Pegasus,
yet he certainly might be favored to win the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   If he is, it's because almost everything Fusaichi Pegasus does
between the lines _ from starting gate to the wire in horse racing
_ is win. Although he lost his career debut in December by a neck,
he's put together a winning streak of four races.
</P>
<P>
   His previous race, in the Wood Memorial Stakes in New York, is
thought to be his best. He sat behind a quick pace of 464/5 seconds
through the opening half mile, getting mud kicked into his face for
the first time in his career. Not deterred, he passed the leaders
and drew off to win by four lengths in a final eighth of a mile in
122/5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   He sandwiched that performance by holding up the start of the
race when he refused to budge from the top of the stretch, his
attention diverted to the parking lot where buses were moving,
according to jockey Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Once past the finish line, he put on the brakes again. It took a
pair of handlers from trainer Neil Drysdale's barn to go and walk
him back.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was caught on national television highlight reels
Thursday during his flipping episode. If Drysdale is worried, he's
not showing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the press has to make a do about something because it's
your job,'' Drysdale said. ``But in my mind, this colt isn't that
bad. I've had a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has anybody been watching him? He's fine. \RThursday\S was the
first time he's done anything wrong since he's been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Horses who become their own worst enemies have trouble at the
Derby. There are four examples from the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge came into Kentucky last year off a big victory
in the Santa Anita Derby. Along with entrymate Excellent Meeting,
General Challenge was the Derby favorite.
</P>
<P>
   But he sweated profusely during a schooling session in the
paddock the week of the Derby. He ended up running 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Pulpit was the morning-line favorite in 1997. Because he was
close to losing his composure in the post parade in front of
140,000 people at Churchill, he was excused and allowed to be by
himself on the backstretch. He ran fourth and later had a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Unbridled's Song was the betting favorite in '96, and he also
was excused from the post parade. He wore a bar shoe designed to
help a slight hoof injury, and he faded to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   In '92, Arazi was the heaviest betting favorite since Easy Goer
in 1989. Arazi tossed a rider during morning exercise hours in the
week leading up to the Derby, and he finished eighth.
</P>
<P>
   There might be one more thing that Fusaichi Pegasus will have to
overcome to win the Derby. The colt wears wraps on his front
ankles, which sometimes is a sign of unsoundness. Fusaichi Pegasus,
however, has been wearing the wraps for every career start.
Drysdale said he uses them for support of the ankles because
Fusaichi Pegasus is a big horse.
</P>
<P>
   A research of ``Daily Racing Form'' charts and winner's circle
photos shows that a Derby winner hasn't worn front wraps during the
race since Tomy Lee in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale said the front wraps _ or what's under them _ aren't
the reason Fusaichi Pegasus sometimes balks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a horse with a mind of his own,'' Drysdale said.
``But he doesn't get excited or nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bit of a rascal. He wants to be in charge, so we go
along with it because he's bigger and stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   People seeking a more controlled horse will look at The Deputy.
He won the Santa Anita Derby and is being ridden by two-time Derby
winning jockey Chris McCarron.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, he looks like the `livest' Derby horse I've been
on,'' McCarron said. ``He's professional. And the more professional
the horse is, the better chance they have to overcome misfortune.''
</P>
<P>
   In their only meeting, Fusaichi Pegasus beat The Deputy by
three-quarters of a length in the San Felipe Stakes. The Deputy
rallied from about six lengths behind, but Desormeaux never used
his whip in the stretch.

HERGES KNOWS HIS TIME MAY COME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Matt Herges realizes his scoreless innings streak,
along with his Dodger career, could end at any time, so he's not
about to take any success for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Herges, a 30-year-old reliever who has spent parts of eight
seasons in the Dodgers' minor-league system, has started the season
by pitching 15 consecutive scoreless innings through Saturday's
game against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   His spot in the bullpen is tenuous, however, because the team
remains uncertain of what it will do when Gregg Olson, out with a
strain to his left forearm, returns from the disabled list in the
next week or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm the only guy down here whose job isn't secure,''
Herges said. ``I have other options as far as what the team can do
with me, and I just don't know what they are going to do. Gregg
obviously belongs up here, there's no question, so something is
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Herges started the season as the 12th man in a 12-man bullpen,
on the roster mostly because outfielder Geronimo Berroa was on the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Herges is to continue pitching well enough to
make it difficult for the Dodgers to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a run is going to come eventually,'' Herges said. ``I'm
not going to pitch good all the time, so once I do allow a couple
runs in a game, I'll have to come back and prove to people that I'm
a good pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, every pitch I throw is important, because I have to
prove to (manager Davey Johnson) that I belong here. Maybe that
would (bother) some other guys, but not guys who have been in the
minors for eight years. This is all just gravy for me.''
</P>
<P>
   SHORT REST: Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek returned to the
starting lineup after a one-game absence. Grudzielanek, who is
making a transition after spending most of his career at shortstop,
came into the game hitting .198, but hit a two-run home run in the
first inning, his second of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a real big believer in streaks, I thought it
always had more to do with luck, but I don't think I've ever been
through a stretch this bad before,'' Grudzielanek said. ``It's been
weird, because during this little stretch I've picked it up, got my
stroke back a little, and then I lost it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it will come back for good soon enough though.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, one of the Dodgers' top fielders in 1999, has made
only one error this season before Saturday but said that learning a
new position is an ongoing and sometimes difficult process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to ask a lot of questions about things I'm supposed
to do,'' Grudzielanek. ``It's coming along, and I feel a little
more comfortable every day.''
</P>
<P>
   GOLDEN BOY: The Dodgers gt one of their first glimpses Friday of
why right fielder Shawn Green won a Gold Glove with Toronto last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Green hit a two-run double to give the Dodgers their winning
margin, but his biggest play may have come in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins had a 2-0 lead against Carlos Perez, and had runners
on the corners with one out. Mark Kotsay hit a fly ball to right,
and Green made the catch and threw to the glove of catcher Todd
Hundley, who tagged out Dave Berg. It was Green's second outfield
assist of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is to just get behind the ball and make a
good throw,'' Green said. ``You don't ever want to short-hop it,
that's the worst thing you can do, and you want to keep the throw
low so the first baseman can grab it if he needs to.''
</P>
<P>
   SHORT HOPS: Sheffield's multihomer game was the 16th of his
career. ... Johnson isn't sure when Olson would be activated, but
he said the reliever should begin throwing in the next few days.
... Orel Hershiser is back in the bullpen, but Johnson said he will
remain an important part of the pitching staff. ``I didn't bring
him here to mop up games,'' Johnson said. ``I expect him to be a
big part of our success.'' ... Johnson did some minor lineup
adjusting, switching Sheffield and Green to No.3 and No.4 and
Adrian Beltre and Todd Hundley to No.6 and No.7. &QL;

about to take any success for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Herges, a 30-year-old reliever who has spent parts of eight
seasons in the Dodgers' minor-league system, has started the season
by pitching 15 consecutive scoreless innings through Saturday's
game against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   His spot in the bullpen is tenuous, however, because the team
remains uncertain of what it will do when Gregg Olson, out with a
strain to his left forearm, returns from the disabled list in the
next week or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm the only guy down here whose job isn't secure,''
Herges said. ``I have other options as far as what the team can do
with me, and I just don't know what they are going to do. Gregg
obviously belongs up here, there's no question, so something is
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Herges started the season as the 12th man in a 12-man bullpen,
on the roster mostly because outfielder Geronimo Berroa was on the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Herges is to continue pitching well enough to
make it difficult for the Dodgers to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a run is going to come eventually,'' Herges said. ``I'm
not going to pitch good all the time, so once I do allow a couple
runs in a game, I'll have to come back and prove to people that I'm
a good pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, every pitch I throw is important, because I have to
prove to (manager Davey Johnson) that I belong here. Maybe that
would (bother) some other guys, but not guys who have been in the
minors for eight years. This is all just gravy for me.''
</P>
<P>
   SHORT REST: Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek returned to the
starting lineup after a one-game absence. Grudzielanek, who is
making a transition after spending most of his career at shortstop,
came into the game hitting .198, but hit a two-run home run in the
first inning, his second of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a real big believer in streaks, I thought it
always had more to do with luck, but I don't think I've ever been
through a stretch this bad before,'' Grudzielanek said. ``It's been
weird, because during this little stretch I've picked it up, got my
stroke back a little, and then I lost it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it will come back for good soon enough though.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, one of the Dodgers' top fielders in 1999, has made
only one error this season before Saturday but said that learning a
new position is an ongoing and sometimes difficult process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to ask a lot of questions about things I'm supposed
to do,'' Grudzielanek. ``It's coming along, and I feel a little
more comfortable every day.''
</P>
<P>
   GOLDEN BOY: The Dodgers gt one of their first glimpses Friday of
why right fielder Shawn Green won a Gold Glove with Toronto last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Green hit a two-run double to give the Dodgers their winning
margin, but his biggest play may have come in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins had a 2-0 lead against Carlos Perez, and had runners
on the corners with one out. Mark Kotsay hit a fly ball to right,
and Green made the catch and threw to the glove of catcher Todd
Hundley, who tagged out Dave Berg. It was Green's second outfield
assist of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is to just get behind the ball and make a
good throw,'' Green said. ``You don't ever want to short-hop it,
that's the worst thing you can do, and you want to keep the throw
low so the first baseman can grab it if he needs to.''
</P>
<P>
   SHORT HOPS: Sheffield's multihomer game was the 16th of his
career. ... Johnson isn't sure when Olson would be activated, but
he said the reliever should begin throwing in the next few days.
... Orel Hershiser is back in the bullpen, but Johnson said he will
remain an important part of the pitching staff. ``I didn't bring
him here to mop up games,'' Johnson said. ``I expect him to be a
big part of our success.'' ... Johnson did some minor lineup
adjusting, switching Sheffield and Green to No.3 and No.4 and
Adrian Beltre and Todd Hundley to No.6 and No.7. &QL;

GONZALEZ MAY BE PLAYING FOR BIG CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There is big money in big offensive numbers.
So one can imagine how Juan Gonzalez feels.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the ballparks built for home runs, Detroit's Comerica
Park has gained a reputation as a pitcher's park. The Tigers
pitchers might like the idea, but Gonzalez is in his free-agent
year. If his numbers take a hit, so will his leverage in contract
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But not to worry, Tigers fans. Gonzalez is a team player, right?
</P>
<P>
   Guess again.
</P>
<P>
   Word around the league is that Gonzalez is so concerned with
numbers, pitchers are pitching him differently to take advantage of
his selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   Angels pitcher Scott Schoeneweis made that clear after he
pitched against the Tigers last week. Gonzalez came to the plate in
the sixth inning with two on and two out. With the Tigers trailing
by two, Gonzalez represented the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any smart pitcher would be careful with Gonzalez, but
Schoeneweis' comments implied that Gonzalez doesn't believe taking
a walk will help his contract run.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling us he wants RBI,'' Schoeneweis said. ``He
might swing at pitches out of the zone, so just keep it out of the
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis kept it out of the zone, Gonzalez swung and flied
out. Gonzalez, who wore out his welcome with the Rangers before
being traded, is hitting .245 with three homers and six RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ARE YOU LISTENING, PIAZZA? While with the Dodgers, catcher Mike
Piazza insisted he wouldn't switch positions to prolong his career.
Once a catcher, always a catcher.
</P>
<P>
   But now the best catcher in baseball is saying he will move from
behind the plate in the not-to-distant future.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez has won eight Gold Gloves and he's only 28, but
he could make a move at age 31 or 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to play catcher my whole career,'' said
Rodriguez, the AL MVP last year. ``I'm going to play another
position. I'm going to start working a little bit at other
positions, take some ground balls, do some things. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   If he stayed at catcher, he could conceivably end his career in
10 years or so regarded as the best catcher ever. But he's afraid
the grind of the position would hurt his offensive numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I could put up more numbers if I played another
position,'' he said. ``Right now, I'm very happy being behind the
plate, but later, we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Where would he play? Third? First? Actually, he sees himself
more as a second baseman, a la Craig Biggio, who made the switch
from catcher to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good athlete, he has good hands and a good arm,''
Rangers coach Bucky Dent said. ``It would be a matter of him
learning to play over there. Biggio did it. I think (Rodriguez)
could, too.''
</P>
<P>
   INDIANS HAVE COMPETITION: In recent years, the AL Central has
been pretty much a joke. The Indians were a lock to win the
division, and the only playoff hopes any other team in the division
had would be as the wild card.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, though, are off to a fast start and seem to
believe they'll compete with Cleveland all season.
</P>
<P>
   At 17-7, Chicago not only leads the Indians (13-7) by two games
in the standings, they have the best record in the American League.
The team is young, but refuse to call this season a rebuilding
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not necessarily playing for development, but to win,''
White Sox manager Jerry Manuel said. ``We're close. I feel that.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is almost certain about the AL Central. Someone named
Manuel will be the division-winning manager. Cleveland's manager is
Charlie Manuel (no relation).
</P>
<P>
   SHORT HOPS: The Angels' Troy Glaus has a chance to win the first
Gold Glove by a third baseman in franchise history. His primary
competition will be the Yankees' Scott Brosius. ... No juiced
baseball? Orioles shortstop Mike Bordick has seven homers and 29
RBI in 23 games, a pace for 49 homers and 204 RBI. ... Do the
Mariners miss Ken Griffey Jr.? The new Safeco Field has something
to do with it, but the M's are averaging 35,954 fans per game this
season, nearly 10,000 more than they averaged at this time last
season. Also, they're in first place. &QL;

LAKERS BENCH OUTPLAYING `BENCH MOB'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Give the Lakers a little more time, a few
more playoff wins, and perhaps, finally, someone will slap a clever
nickname on the reserves. Or at the least, recognize their
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   If you outplay one of the league's most celebrated and
coolest-named benches, certainly you've earned an identity. With
defense, rebounding and some timely scoring, that's what the
Lakers' anonymous second unit has done in this first-round playoff
series against the Sacramento Kings, and their vaunted ``Bench
Mob.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, up 2-0 in the best-of-five series, go for the sweep
this afternoon at Arco Arena, and the benches should figure
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   The Bench Mob has played like a group stripped of its ``Tommy''
guns and pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   Peja Stojakovic burned the Lakers for 20-plus points per game in
the regular season, but is averaging 3.0 points in the series,
making 2 of 12 shots. Jon Barry is averaging 5.5 points. Of the
Kings' reserves, only Tony Delk has scored in double figures 17
points in Game 1 and the last 10 points came in garbage time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lakers' unheralded reserves are quietly playing
solid defense and playing the Bench Mob to a virtual draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've gotten to that point, our bench has really
stepped in and played well, and we've had some real good efforts
from them,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``Even though they're not the
group that takes shots a lot of times, they come in and play
defense and do the things we ask them
</P>
<P>
   get the ball to Shaquille (O'Neal) or whatever. They've done a
fine job and I'm very pleased with what they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the firepower brought by O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glen
Rice, offense from the bench is a luxury, not a necessity. They've
provided it where needed _ 11 points from Rick Fox in Game 2, 8
points from Robert Horry in Game 1. The reserves have also
accounted for 20 of the Lakers' 49 assists in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jackson expects the balance could quickly shift to the Kings
today at Arco Arena. Bench players, he has observed, tend to play
better at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our bench might have trouble with their bench on the
home court,'' he said. ``They'll have more liberties, they'll be
more comfortable. Barry got a couple shots last game, he's starting
to look like he's coming off that (back) injury and downspell that
he had a little bit. Stojakovic had one 3-pointer (in Game 2).
Delk, we were able to contain a little bit the last game, but he's
been a problem for us. And basically (Lawrence) Funderburke has
been eliminated by (Chris) Webber's great play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those are the guys that hurt us in past games. I wouldn't
be surprised if Rick (Adelman, the Kings' coach) went to his bench
a little bit earlier and a little bit longer than he has in the
first two games.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's Webber and Jason Williams or Delk and Barry, the
Lakers expect a feisty Kings attack today as Sacramento faces
elimination. The Kings went 30-11 at Arco Arena this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be tough,'' said Ron Harper, ``because we know
when their crowd gets in there and they start shooting them wild
shots and they start to hit some that we need to take the ball back
inside ... that's a really tough place to play. That's really a
great place to play. I mean, the fans are right there on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Lakers' bench can outplay the Bench Mob once more,
that crowd will fall silent, and then someone can get back to
finding them a nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call it being overshadowed by an MVP season (by
O'Neal) and great play by Kobe and Glen,'' said Fox, ``but we've in
a lot of ways just accepted the fact that we're fill-ins to a
triangle offense that's going to make Glen, Shaq and Kobe have
great opportunities for themselves. As a whole, we're not asked to
be big-time scorers. But we're all capable of feeding off of those
guys and as for recognition, I think it will come a lot more once
we're able to follow through with the game plan here and win out
and win a championship.'' &QL;

DEVILS BEAT MAPLE LEAFS, 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Most hockey teams will settle for a split of two games
on the road to open a Stanley Cup playoff series. The Devils might
have deserved better than that here with the Toronto Maple Leafs in
the Air Canada Center.
</P>
<P>
   But they could have gotten worse against this opportunistic and
resourceful team, which they outplayed twice.
</P>
<P>
   So the Devils will take Saturday night's 1-0 victory home for a
1-1 deadlock in the four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Colin White, a rookie defenseman, scored for the Devils early in
the game, and goalie Martin Brodeur made it stand up.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the third period, with Toronto applying pressure,
the Devils' Jason Arnott received a double minor for high-sticking
Garry Valk at 8 minutes 20 seconds. With the capacity crowd
roaring, Toronto directed intense pressure at Brodeur early in the
man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Maple Leafs' second power play ticked away, the
Devils' penalty killers took control and worked the puck down the
other end. Helping in this effort was Brodeur, one of the league's
better puck-handling goalies, who cleared the puck the length of
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs' failure to score on this opportunity left them 2 for
33 on the power play in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minute, Toronto pulled goalie Curtis Joseph for an
extra attacker and earned a face-off in the Devils' end after an
icing with 40 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Although Toronto's Mats Sundin won the face-off, the Leafs could
not control the puck and it left the zone. They never got another
shot on goal and the Devils ended the game with a 33-20 edge in
that department.
</P>
<P>
   Games 3 and 4 of this series will be at Continental Arena on
Monday and Wednesday nights. The winner of the series will meet
either Pittsburgh or Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils dominated the first two periods but led by only a
goal thanks to White, who scored on a slap shot at 6:41 of the
first period. Arnott assisted on the goal, which came at the end of
a good shift of forechecking.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the only instance of this tactic, which the Devils
used to dominate long stretches of play. Devils Coach Larry
Robinson used all four of his forward lines, which kept the Toronto
defensemen busy around the net of Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Mogilny of the Devils had prime chances in the first
two periods. On the first, he and Patrik Elias blitzed Joseph for
three or four shots in succession. On the second, Elias fed Mogilny
on a two-on-one, and Mogilny's hard shot was turned away by Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   But the Leafs also had their moments. An early one came when
Wendel Clark, the veteran and fan favorite, split the Devils'
defense.
</P>
<P>
   His shot was stopped by Brodeur, who also took a penalty on the
play for roughing Clark after the whistle.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs also hit a goal post midway through the second period
after Tomas Kaberle fired from long range _ a shot that may have
been tipped by Kevyn Adams as it moved toward the net. Adams got
the rebound but put the puck on Brodeur's pads.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto, a team at its best when it is skating freely, picked up
the pace in the second half of the second period with its captain,
Sundin, creating chances with aggressive skating. Sundin was
double-shifted by Pat Quinn, the Toronto coach.
</P>
<P>
   On one of his best chances, near the end of the period, Sundin
intercepted a Bobby Holik pass and stickhandled through several
Devils, forcing White to take a penalty for holding the stick.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils killed the power play, but the score remained cause
for concern.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, a 2-1 Toronto victory, the Devils also outplayed
Toronto, but the opportunistic Leafs won that one in the third
period. Another Toronto trait is to win despite being outshot.
</P>
<P>
   After two periods, Elias and Petr Sykora each had three shots,
tied for the lead on the Devils. Mogilny also had three.
</P>
<P>
   His coaches have been urging him to shoot more _ he had no shots
in Game 1.

FORMER ENERGY DEPT. ADVISER CITES FLAWS IN NUCLEAR COMPLEX 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1996, a truck carrying nuclear warheads skidded off an icy
road in Nebraska and crashed. For half a day, no one in government,
including the president and his cabinet, knew the degree of danger,
or if any nuclear material had escaped into the environment,
because radiation monitors on the government's fleet of weapons
trucks had been removed after complaints from drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers had said the monitors showed that they were facing
potential health risks from their cargoes.
</P>
<P>
   These accusations have been made by Robert Alvarez, who from
1993 to 1999 was a policy adviser in the Department of Energy,
which runs the nation's nuclear complex. Before that, as a Senate
aide, he specialized in helping oversee the department.
</P>
<P>
   In an article for a journal, Alvarez calls problems with the
atomic fleet ``emblematic of the department's inept and often
arrogant management culture.'' The mind-set has become so backward,
he says, that the complex is now basically a ticking time bomb
waiting to go off in a serious accident or an inadvertent nuclear
blast.
</P>
<P>
   His 12-page analysis appears in the May/June issue of The
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which was posted over the
weekend on the group's Web site, www.thebulletin.org.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Energy Department officials said that although
the department's handling of weapons had problems, Alvarez was
blowing them out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   In his article, Alvarez said the uncertainty in the Nebraska
incident was cleared up after a federal crisis team arrived and
found no danger. But the underlying woes persisted. Today, he said,
the drivers are still disgruntled and the trucks still have no
radiation monitors. Until their salaries were raised recently, he
added, atomic truckers were paid less than those who haul
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Energy officials and outside experts agree that the department
has serious problems, with roots in the vast responsibilities and
liabilities incurred during the Cold War in making 70,000 nuclear
arms. The challenges now lie in old age and downsizing. The
department owns more than 20,700 facilities and buildings,
including 89 nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major elements of Energy's complex are closing down,'' Alvarez
said in the article, ``leaving a huge unfunded and dangerous
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Alvarez's overall accusations, Ellen Livingston, the
department's senior adviser for environmental affairs, said,
``We've gone to great lengths to develop safety and training
programs to limit the hazards because we recognize the handling of
nuclear materials is a risky business.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, who is now a consultant to antinuclear groups, said the
department was wrong in playing down his charges but right in
calling him an antagonist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I was their golden boy and they booted me out
and now it's sour grapes,'' he said in an interview. ``They used me
as an internal critic. If I've got an ax, it's one I've been
grinding for 25 years.''

   &UR; THE WONDERS OF THE INVISIBLE WORLD: Stories &LR;  By David Gates.
Vintage Contemporaries, $12. These mordant tales are filled with
aging male hipsters whose ironic detachment and heightened
self-awareness leave them unable to connect with the real world.
``Gates can be very funny,'' Gerald Marzorati wrote in The New York
Times Book Review last year, but mostly he ``is concerned with
creating characters you haven't met in fiction before, getting just
right the words they use to disengagedly engage their women and
their friends and even their inner selves.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Clear Springs: A Family Story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Bobbie Ann Mason. HarperPerennial, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The author revisits her old Kentucky home, and in recounting the
details and Southern traditions of her upbringing sheds light on
the inspiration for much of her fiction. ``Mason gets to the heart
of a whole generation,'' Josephine Humphreys wrote here last year.
``She can write the hard truth about home, love, loss and the
terrifying passage of time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Italian Fever &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Valerie Martin. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The author's sixth novel, about a young divorcee who travels to
Tuscany to settle the affairs of an American writer who has died
and left behind the manuscript of his final book, has more to do
with the development of consciousness than plot. The heroine's
adventures among the locals, particularly her sexual awakening at
the hands of her charming cicerone, make this ``a study of the
complications of lovemaking and its effects on women,'' Craig
Seligman wrote here in 1999. ``Martin's sureness of phrasing is one
of the great pleasures of her recent fiction. ... Her cool, remote
voice has mellowed, and her competence has kindled into
brilliance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In September, the Light Changes: Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Andrew Holleran. Plume, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   These carefully built tales are steeped in the cadences,
vocabulary and concerns of gay life in the late 20th century, and
reveal an obsessive awareness of the loss of friends, health and
youth. The result is a ``beautifully observed'' collection that is
``unflinching, provocative, witty and shrewd,'' Peter Parker said
here in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky: Unexpurgated Edition &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Joan Acocella. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary Russian dancer's diary, originally published by
his wife in a sanitized, scaled-back version in 1936, chronicles
his long, anguished struggle with insanity. ``In displaying its
author in all his terrifying particularity, it allows us to glimpse
in his madness, not the apotheosis, but at least the ruins, of his
genius,`` William Deresiewicz wrote here in 1999.  &UR; No
IntermissionS: The Life of Agnes de Mille &LR; , by Carol Easton (Da
Capo, $18), is a portrait of the combative American dancer,
choreographer, author and lecturer who labored mightily to be taken
seriously in the male-dominated genre of musical comedy. ``Easton
tracks de Mille's struggles with the limits of her gift,'' Joan
Acocella said here in 1996. ``De Mille fans will want to read the
book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Journey to the End of the Millennium: A Novel of the Middle
Ages &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By A.B. Yehoshua. Harvest/Harcourt, $14.
</P>
<P>
   This novel about a North African Jewish merchant who travels to
Europe with his two wives and his Muslim partner in the year 999
explores the gaps between Jews and Christians, Jews and Muslims and
men and women. ``Yehoshua is so graceful and eloquent that his
work's timeliness also succeeds, paradoxically, in making it
timeless,'' James E. Young wrote here last year.
</P>

   These tales eavesdrop on couples bantering in bars, in
restaurants and in bed, and examine the human desire for solicitude
and tenderness. ``Bausch hovers over his characters like the
guardian angel they all seek,'' Lisa Zeidner wrote here in 1999.
``His stories illuminate the charged stillness in which emotional
changes happen.''

   &UR; Weird and Tragic Shores: The Story of Charles Francis Hall,
Explorer &LR;

   In 1968, the author exhumed the body of Charles Francis Hall, a
19th-century amateur explorer who made three Arctic voyages in
search of survivors of Sir John Franklin's disastrous expedition of
1845, and he discovered traces of arsenic. This biography
``suggests who may have killed him,'' Edmund Carpenter wrote here
in 1971. ``It is both a first-rate detective story and a very
scholarly work.'' Modern Library has also reissued  &UR; The Brendan
Voyage &LR; , by Tim Severin ($14.95), a chronicle of Severin's trip
across the North Atlantic in a small oxhide boat like the ones
reputed to have been used by Irish monks on their way to the New
World in the sixth century. ``His account of the adventure is a
sailor's delight,'' one critic said in 1978. In  &UR; Voyaging:
Southward From the Strait of Magellan &LR; , by Rockwell Kent (Wesleyan
University, $16.95), the artist recounts in rousing fashion his
journey to Tierra del Fuego in a small sailboat. ``The strength and
menace and majesty of the Cape Horn region proved admirable
material for Kent's black-and-white drawings,'' the Book Review
said in 1924.

   In this novel as pioneer journal, a former minister abandons New
England for a rugged life on the Ohio frontier in 1811. The book
contains ``numerous small glories,'' Ivan Doig said here in 1985,
and the author ``toils like a stump farmer to create
verisimilitude.''

   &UR; Geographies of Home &LR;

   The heroine of this first novel is torn between memories of her
lush homeland in the Dominican Republic and concern for her
impoverished family, which is losing its strength and identity in
Brooklyn. ``The result is a deluge of intense imagery where the
magical and the real occupy the same awful and sometimes sensual
space,'' Erica Sanders said here last year.
