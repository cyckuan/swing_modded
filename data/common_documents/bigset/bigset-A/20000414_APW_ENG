<HEADLINE> Howard: Telstra Constrained in Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Australian telecommunications
company Telstra Corp. is being constrained in its deal with Hong
Kong company Pacific Century CyberWorks because of the government's
part-ownership, Prime Minister John Howard said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can't issue any shares, it can't raise any equity,'' Howard
said on Australia Broadcasting Corp. radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a large organization like Telstra, that's a tremendous
constraint and the reason they can't do it is because that would
dilute government ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard wants to sell its remaining 50.1 percent stake in Telstra
but has yet to win enough support in Australia's Parliament for a
full sale.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Telstra and Pacific Century CyberWorks announced
an alliance in which the Australian company will pay $3 billion and
contribute assets to the alliance in return for a 50 percent stake
in an Internet infrastructure company and 40 percent of a mobile
telephony company. Pacific Century CyberWorks will own the balance
of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said he was confident the sale of the government's stake
would go ahead eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sure in the end we will get strong support in our party
room for the sale of the rest of Telstra,'' Howard said. ''I think
it is in the national interest that it is fully privatized.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Says Economy Improving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan on Friday upgraded its assessment of the two
main pillars of private demand -- personal spending and capital
investment -- and said the economy is improving at a ''moderate
pace.''
</P>
<P>
   In its monthly report for April, the Economic Planning Agency
cited signs of ''more buoyant'' corporate activity, and said the
economy is moving ''toward a sustainable recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency said investment in plants and equipment is improving,
primarily in the manufacturing sector. In addition, the report
suggested personal spending may be close to turning a corner.
</P>
<P>
   ''While it can't be said that personal consumption has fully
entered a solid recovery track given the low levels of income, it
continues to rally compared with the end of last year,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is fighting to overcome a decade-long economic downturn.
The economy fell back into recession late last year after a short
period of growth.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of hope, however. Many corporations have
restructured over the past year, and industrial activity has begun
to show signs of perking up.
</P>
<P>
   The key for a sustainable economic recovery will be whether
personal spending picks up as well, the Economic Planning Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Looking at the overall picture, it looks like conditions are
improving gradually every month, but we're not at a stage where we
can declare an economic recovery,'' said Takashi Omori, director of
the EPA's national economic affairs division.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, the EPA downgraded its view on housing
construction, noting declines, especially in the construction of
private houses.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA left its assessment of the employment situation as
''severe.'' Unemployment is at a record high of 4.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Big Apple Is Big Winner in Fed Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government is giving top dollar to
the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, the most populated city in the country with about
7.4 million people, drew $44.2 billion in federal funding in fiscal
1999, according to data to be released Friday by the Census Bureau.
Los Angeles County, Calif., was next among counties and
county-equivalent areas, as termed by the Census Bureau, at $43.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The two urban areas got more federal dollars than 41 states.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the federal government distributed $1.5 trillion in
funding in fiscal 1999, a 4 percent increase from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   About 48 percent, or $735 billion, went to fund three programs:
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The money covers items such
as domestic benefits, subsidies, grants, goods and services, and
salaries and wages.
</P>
<P>
   Federal direct payments to individuals for retirement and
disability in 1999 reached $523 billion, a 3.2 percent increase
over 1998, with Social Security alone totaling $415 billion, a 3.1
percent increase. Medicare payments were down 0.4 percent to $209
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department domestic spending, which includes payroll,
defense contracts and grants, and military pensions, totaled $237
billion in 1999, a 4.9 percent increase over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Among states, California received the most federal funds, $166
billion, followed by New York at $102 billion and Texas at $98
billion.
</P>
<P>
   New York City and Los Angeles County, though, did not top the
list when it came to per capita spending: Fairfax City, Va., was
first at $101,192; New York City was 769th at $5,952, and Los
Angeles County was 1,653rd at $4,659.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fairfax City is immediately close to Washington, D.C. They are
heavily impacted with federal employees, so that means a lot of
defense and non-defense contracts, and the costs of salaries,''
said Gerard Keffer, chief of the Census Bureau's Federal Programs
Branch.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- On Sunday mornings, the sweet strains of a
saxophone and the infectious beat of a drum float from a tiny
storefront on Divisadero Street. Inside, the Church of St. John
Coltrane is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amen!'' the congregation sings, and even indifferent visitors
are caught up in the music. Toes tap, hands clap, heads bob to the
syncopated beat, and, sometimes unexpectedly, a hearty ''Praise the
Lord!'' sneaks out.
</P>
<P>
   The church is a real one, though Coltrane, the jazz icon who
died of cancer in 1967, isn't an official saint. It's officially
the African Orthodox Church and its services are an eclectic mix of
free-form jazz and religion, in jam sessions that can last three
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The church was founded on the music of Coltrane, an intensely
spiritual man whose 1964 musical meditation, ''A Love Supreme,'' is
a powerful expression of faith.
</P>
<P>
   But soon the music will be silenced here. After nearly 30 years
at its Divisadero location, the church has fallen victim to the
city's real estate crunch. Its last service at the Divisadero
location is Easter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bishop Franzo King, the landlord wanted a
month-to-month lease, meaning the $2,500 rent can increase each
month, a real possibility with lucrative technology jobs luring
high-salaried workers to the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   King is determined to continue preaching in a new,
$1,800-a-month space he found all the way across town, but it needs
a lot of work and approval from city planners. In the meantime, he
hopes to continue services temporarily at a nearby church.
</P>
<P>
   News of the move startled longtime congregants as well as other
San Franciscans who consider the church part of the city's quirky
charm. Services in the past few weeks have been packed.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Mary Deborah greets visitors to the church with a smile.
By the time the service starts, a handful of mismatched pews are
filled, many worshippers are left standing and a line snakes out
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Buttoned-down yuppies sit with tattooed hipsters and
camera-toting tourists as children frolic on the altar. A drum set
and a scattering of amplifiers round the edges of the small room,
where King plays the drums and leads a small group of musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down on the congregation is a gold-leaf portrait of
Coltrane grasping a flaming saxophone; a banner quotes Coltrane's
liner notes for ''A Love Supreme'' -- ''Let us sing all songs to
God. Let us pursue Him in the righteous path. Yes, it is true;
'Seek and ye shall find.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before the music starts, Sister Mary Deborah extolls: ''We do
need one another -- and we need the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   A congregant adds: ''We need John Coltrane music, too.''
</P>
<P>
   David Ellis, a goateed visitor from New York, stumbled across
the church's Web site one day (it is also listed in nearly every
San Francisco guide book).
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it seemed like an interesting place to go,'' Ellis
said. ''I wasn't expecting too much, to be honest. But the music is
amazing. And there's so much spirit here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea, King said. For many, the music is the path
toward enlightenment. It's not a gimmick to get people to listen to
his sermons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's an afterthought. I think it's part of the
process,'' he said. ''We feel that the music has its job, and it is
working in concert with everything else. We believe the spirit of
the Lord is in the music.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of preachers, King got the idea for the church in the
1960s, when he received his ''sound baptism'' at a Coltrane
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I became aware that John Coltrane's music was more than highly
emotional,'' he said. ''It was highly spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors often find a spark of revelation to take home, wherever
home may be. At a recent service, they came from as far as Denmark
and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what's in people's minds, if they think they're
going to a church or a cult or something,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I do know that there are people that, once here, have a
profound experience and have accepted the Lord into their lives. I
talk to people who go back to their churches strengthened and
encouraged in the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   King hopes to move his church within six months. The new
property has room for expansion, so the church can continue a wide
variety of community outreach programs, including a vegetarian soup
kitchen for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the church is holding fundraisers, and King
remains characteristically upbeat about the reluctant move.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a mess, what can I say?'' he said. ''But I have faith it
will all work out.''

<HEADLINE> Stars 3, Oilers 0  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Brett Hull scored a goal that looked a lot like
his Stanley Cup winner last summer and assisted on another, leading
the Dallas Stars past the Edmonton Oilers 3-0 on Thursday night for
a 2-0 lead in their first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Muller and Scott Thornton also scored for Dallas,
continuing an early playoff trend of production from surprising
players. Hull is the only one of the Stars' top five scorers with a
goal in the two games.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton, which will have Game 3 of the best-of-7 series on its
home ice Sunday, managed only 17 shots as Ed Belfour posted his
eighth playoff shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the credit, though, goes to a Dallas defense led by
captain Derian Hatcher, whose steamroller hits frustrated the
Oilers and triggered several penalties on retaliatory hits.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton will be happy to get away from Reunion Arena, where it
has lost 11 straight. The Oilers are in jeopardy of a second
straight first-round sweep by the Stars, who have beaten Edmonton
in nine straight playoff games. Dallas is 9-0-1 in the last 10
overall meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers goalie Tommy Salo, who made 30 stops in Game 1, again had
to be his own best defense -- and couldn't, even though he again
made the Stars earn their goals. He made 19 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Muller finished a perfectly executed 3-on-3 with Hull and Modano
by blasting a shot over Salo's left shoulder in the first period,
then Hull put in a bouncing puck from the lip of the crease with
2:05 left in the second. Thornton scored from in front of the net
on a rebound early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's goal unfolded a lot like his last playoff goal, the one
that beat Buffalo in triple overtime in Game 6 of the 1999 finals.
</P>
<P>
   On that one, Hull was just inside the crease when he pushed in a
rebound past a fallen Dominik Hasek. This time, he was just outside
the crease and it was Salo on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's 24 goals this season were second-most on the league's
lowest-scoring team. Other than Mike Keane, who scored the first
goal in a 2-1 victory Wednesday night, the rest of Dallas' goals
have been by guys with single-digit totals in the regular season.
In fact, the combined total of regular-season goals by Muller,
Thornton and Roman Lyashenko is only 21. None of those three
players were with the Stars during last year's championship run.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, though, was of a star of it and he's off to another
impressive start. He set a record last postseason by allowing one
goal or less in 10 games and he's already done it twice this
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   He's been especially tough on Edmonton. The Oilers have just 12
goals in their last 11 playoff games against him.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton got into a good offensive flow early, but couldn't
sustain it very long. The Oilers were held to one shot on four
power plays while leading scorer Doug Weight went scoreless against
the Stars for a fifth straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton was more aggressive on defense, hitting often while
holding Dallas to 10 fewer shots than Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were again without Jere Lehtinen, their best defensive
forward until an ankle injury limited him to 17 games. He's still
too sore after testing it Sunday in the regular-season finale. He
might play Sunday, when Dallas also hopes to have back defenseman
Sergei Zubov from a torn knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton's Ethan Moreau, who missed the third period of Game 1
with a bruised thigh, was back on the ice.

<HEADLINE> 7 Charged With Murder in Fire Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Ohio (AP) -- Seven men were arrested and charged with
murder Thursday in the deaths of five people in a house fire.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the fire March 29 was apparently set with
gasoline in a first-floor living room.
</P>
<P>
   Police Maj. Larry Winegardner would say only that the crime was
premeditated. ''It was planned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire killed a woman, her two teen-age children and her
fiance's two teen-age children. The fiance leaped from an upstairs
window.
</P>
<P>
   Charged were Eddie McClellan, 47; Martice Boddie, 25; Samuel
Williams, 23; Michael Wright, 23; Kendell Seay, 22; Courtney Ward,
22; and Eddie White Jr., 21, Lima police said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven, all of Lima, could face additional charges once
evidence is presented to the grand jury, said police Sgt. Michael
Keith. He would not comment on what those charges might be or a
possible motive.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney John Poppe represents Boddie.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't know anything about this,'' Poppe said. ''We don't
see any evidence to show why he was charged.''

<HEADLINE> Court Issues Stay in Elian Case  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's great-uncle defied the government
Thursday and the government blinked, letting its deadline to
collect the boy pass and agreeing to a delay that averts a
law-enforcement showdown for now. In Little Havana, thousands
cheered wildly at the news.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Elian's Miami relatives claimed victory after a
federal appeals court issued an order blocking anyone from taking
the 6-year-old Cuban boy out of the country. The Justice
Department, though, said it had agreed to a delay of ''three or
four days.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told the government to
respond to the stay by 9:30 a.m. Friday, giving great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez's family another day with Elian at the very least. Lazaro
''feels relief,'' family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said, ''at
least until tomorrow morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's court action capped a fluid, electrifying day that
began minutes after Lazaro Gonzalez dared the government to take
Elian by force. In less than 24 hours, the Miami relatives met with
Attorney General Janet Reno, publicly announced their defiance of
her, allowed Elian to speak on TV and ignored a 2 p.m. deadline to
deliver him to an airport for return to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Reno and the government have repeatedly extended
the deadline for Lazaro Gonzalez to surrender the boy despite a
standing order to do so. And this week, the nation's top law
officer took the extraordinary step of flying down herself in a
chartered plane to hammer out a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who met with Reno after
coming to America from Cuba last week, remained in Washington area.
His attorneys said the Miami relatives had, with their actions
Thursday, ''emotionally damaged and exploited this most wonderful
little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, Lazaro Gonzalez defied the nation's chief law
enforcement officers and publicly and belligerently refused to turn
Elian over to his father,'' said Gregory Craig, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez's attorney. ''Today, Lazaro Gonzalez broke the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Lazaro Gonzalez's house in Little Havana, a throng
several thousand strong massed to protest and, though it would
prove unnecessary, protect. ''War! War! War!'' some shouted in
Spanish. Others renewed pledges of nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   ''While this child remains in this house, there is hope,''
Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas said. ''We are living very tense
moments, perhaps the most tense in the last 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   After the stay was announced, the crowd jubilantly cried
''Victory!'' Salsa music pumped through the neighborhood into the
night as cars clogged 20 blocks of city streets, horns honking.
</P>
<P>
   ''A second miracle is happening in the case of Elian,'' said
Raul Gonzalez, a 72-year-old accountant who lives in the
neighborhood. ''It seems that God is guiding us.''
</P>
<P>
   The stay issued by the 11th Circuit does not specifically
prevent the government from transferring Elian to his father. But a
Justice official, requesting anonymity, said the government gave
its word that it wouldn't. The stay was issued while the 11th
Circuit decides whether to hear a full appeal of the relatives'
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Reno, who was roundly criticized for how the
government responded to the Branch Davidians in 1993, said her
department would act in a ''reasonable, measured way.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the authority to take action,'' Reno said. ''But
responsible authority means not only knowing when to take action,
but how and when to take that action.''
</P>
<P>
   After failing to reach an agreement with the family Wednesday
during a dramatic 2{-hour meeting attended by Elian, Reno ordered
them to bring him to Opa-locka airport outside Miami at 2 p.m.
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan called for a plane to take Elian, and any Miami
relatives who wanted to come, to Washington for a retreat at a
neutral site with the boy's father. No Cuban diplomats would be
present. After the meeting, the government said, the father would
take custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez insisted he would not relinquish custody of the
boy he has cared for since Elian's mother drowned off the Florida
coast nearly five months ago. ''We will not turn this child over --
not in Opa-locka, not in any 'locka,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was reported in good spirits. He ran in and out of the
back yard near a swingset and was spotted sitting on a window ledge
in the house, in profile, watching demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Andy Garcia and singer Gloria Estefan, both
Cuban-Americans, spent time with demonstrators and inside the
house. ''We want no violence. We are a peaceful community,''
Estefan said after the deadline passed. ''We urge every
Cuban-American watching to join us in the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez addressed the growing crowd with a bullhorn
during the day and called for peaceful demonstrations. ''We're not
going to fight with anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Government sources have said that the Justice Department, if
necessary, would be prepared to send U.S. marshals and immigration
agents into the house to remove Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to do this fairly, straightforwardly, without
playing games with people,'' Reno said. ''I am trying to work
through an extraordinary tragedy without having to cause further
disruption to the little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton also weighed in Thursday. ''I've tried to do
everything I can to stay out of it,'' he said in Washington. ''But
it is our obligation to uphold the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Elian, speaking in Spanish on a home video, addressed
his father, saying: ''I don't want to go to Cuba. ... I want to
stay here.'' The video was obtained by the Spanish-language network
Univision.
</P>
<P>
   Craig called on the news media to stay away from the boy because
he ''has been exploited enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida Family Court, meanwhile, a judge earlier Thursday
rejected -- as expected -- the family's request filed this week to
intercede and prevent the INS from taking the boy. Judge Jennifer
Bailey said she had no jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued by two fishermen while clinging to an inner
tube in the Florida Straits on Thanksgiving Day. His mother and 10
other people fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have been caring for him ever since and have
been fighting in court for an asylum hearing. The Clinton
administration has ordered Elian back to his father, saying only he
can speak for the boy on immigration matters.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco, Arco Merger Approved  </HEADLINE>
By T.A. BADGER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- More than a year after BP Amoco PLC
started its takeover of Atlantic Richfield Co., the path is finally
clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission voted Thursday to step out of the
way of the $27.6 billion deal after BP Amoco agreed to sell all of
Arco's Alaska assets to satisfy anti-competitive concerns.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco has a tentative agreement to sell the Alaska holdings --
oil and gas interests, tankers, pipelines and exploration rights --
to Phillips Petroleum Co. for $7 billion. That sale must be
completed within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco said it expects to complete its purchase of Arco on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Browne, chairman of London-based BP Amoco, said he
planned to ''rapidly implement the plans we have in place to
integrate our operations worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The new company will be the second-largest oil company not owned
by a government, behind Exxon Mobil Corp., a merger approved by the
FTC last November.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with FTC, BP Amoco also must sell some
pipeline and oil storage holdings in Cushing, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Once the merger goes through, Arco shareholders would get 1.64
shares in BP Amoco for each share they hold.
</P>
<P>
   FTC approval came after months of intense negotiations over how
to resolve concerns about impact of the BP-Arco merger on
competition in the Alaska oil fields and the West Coast retail
gasoline market.
</P>
<P>
   In February, FTC lawyers blocked the merger and prepared to
battle it in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   They said the combination would create ''a colossus'' that would
dominate oil exploration, production and transportation in Alaska
and dictate prices to West Coast refiners, which rely heavily on
Alaska crude.
</P>
<P>
   The divestiture agreed to Thursday would reduce the combined new
company's holding in Alaska from roughly 70 percent to 45 percent,
according to industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the five FTC commissioners said in a statement
that the consent agreement with BP Amoco ''would entirely eliminate
the overlap ... that allegedly would create a competitive
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky and one of the commissioners,
Mozelle Thompson, issued a separate statement expressing support
for the merger but concern that it would not restrict BP Amoco
exports of Alaska oil.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Exxon Mobil said Thursday it had reached an
agreement with the companies over the sale of the Alaska holdings.
Exxon Mobil had filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction against the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, California, Washington and Oregon, which together
filed a separate antitrust complaint in federal court in San
Francisco against the merger, also announced settlement of their
action, ending any challenge to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, approval of the BP Amoco-Arco combination was met
with considerable relief.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully that will be the end of a long and painful chapter
of regulatory overview ... so we can go back to work,'' Gov. Tony
Knowles said in Juneau.

<HEADLINE> American Home Pushes Drug Settlement  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a major step toward resolving health claims
against the diet drug combination fen-phen, drug maker American
Home Products said just 1 percent of the drug's users have opted
out of a multibillion dollar settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 6 million people took fen-phen before it was pulled from
the market in 1997 due to links with serious heart problems, but
just 45,000 of them have elected to refuse the $3.75 billion
settlement, American Home said Thursday, adding it has decided to
go ahead with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   March 30 was the deadline for fen-phen users to opt out. Those
who did so retain the right to sue American Home for punitive
damages. If too many people had opted out, American Home could have
scrapped the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, reached last October, would pay individual fen-phen
users up to $1.5 million. Most, however, would get far less,
depending on their level of injury and how long they took the
drugs. It includes money to pay patients who say they were injured
by the drugs and for future medical monitoring for those who are
still healthy.
</P>
<P>
   So far more than 9,000 suits have been filed against American
Home by fen-phen users, imposing a major obstacle for the company
as it tries to win back trust of investors who have seen its stock
drop because of the litigation and problems with other medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The litigation has also hurt the company's efforts to find a
merger partner. American Home lost its bid to buy rival
Warner-Lambert Co. in part because of uncertainty surrounding the
diet drug litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The national settlement still must be approved by a judge. A
hearing is scheduled in federal court in Philadelphia on May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Madison, N.J.-based American Home made fenfluramine, the ''fen''
in the fen-phen combination, and gave the drug a brand name of
Pondimin. It also made Redux, a chemical cousin. In September 1997,
the drugs were removed from the market after a Mayo Clinic study
linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage. The second
drug in the combination, phentermine, is still on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is open to anyone who used fen-phen and Redux in
the United States, whether or not they filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The number of opt outs is well within the expected range for a
nationwide settlement of this magnitude and the company is
confident that it can continue to manage this level of opt outs,''
said Louis Hoynes Jr., American Home's senior vice president. The
company said most of those who opted out of the deal aren't sick.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the opt-outs have yet to sue American Home, raising the
prospect of thousands of new suits.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company showed little concern about this.
</P>
<P>
   ''Experience with litigation of these types suggests that such
opt outs have generally weaker claims and also may be subject to
statute of limitations defenses,'' American Home said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 drug users registered to participate in the
settlement and many more are expected since a deadline for
registration hasn't yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the response to this settlement represents an
overwhelming endorsement of the settlement as a fair and
appropriate way to remedy the health problems caused by AHP's diet
drugs,'' said Arnold Levin, a plaintiff attorney who helped
negotiate the settlement.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Shareholders Defeat Bid  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco PLC weathered a surprisingly strong
challenge to its environmental record when shareholders defeated a
measure that would have blocked the company from drilling for oil
in a pristine tract of northern Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Thursday came hours before the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission approved BP Amoco's $27.6 billion purchase of Atlantic
Richfield Co. As part of the antitrust approval for the deal, BP
Amoco is selling Arco's oil holdings in Alaska, but that would not
alter BP Amoco's exploration plans.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of activists and investors proposed the
anti-drilling resolution at BP Amoco's annual shareholders'
meeting, warning of the possible danger from oil exploration in the
biologically sensitive Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The group also demanded that the money BP Amoco is spending on a
controversial offshore Arctic oil project, Northstar, be invested
instead in the development of solar power.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders rejected the resolution by a margin of about
8-to-1, according to an initial count of proxy votes.
</P>
<P>
   But the support of more than 13 percent of the proxy voters and
the extraordinary effort to galvanize investor backing for a
radical change in BP Amoco's plans indicated an unusual depth of
opposition to the company's current direction.	   ''They badly misjudged the
mood of the shareholders on this, as
evidenced by the size of the vote in favor,'' said Stuart Bell of
PIRC Ltd., which advises institutional investors on issues of
social responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was the first measure on environmental policy
ever proposed at a BP Amoco shareholder's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of London-based BP Amoco defended their record on the
environment, noting that BP Amoco's solar energy business is the
largest in the world and arguing that its operations have done no
harm to Alaska's wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ''No polar bears have died as a result of Northstar's
construction,'' BP Amoco chairman Peter Sutherland insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The company played down the outcome of the vote. A spokesman,
speaking on the customary condition of anonymity, said the support
for the resolution was overstated due to a number of abstentions
and because some ballots have yet to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the debate's significance were the concerns that BP
Amoco's acquisition of Los Angeles-based Arco would give the
British company too big a share of Alaskan crude production.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Sir John Browne noted BP Amoco's agreement to
sell off Arco's oil holdings in Alaska to Phillips Petroleum Co. in
order to win FTC approval for the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Browne added that BP Amoco would invest $8.5 billion in its
business this year and hopes to boost its profit margins by 2
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution to stop all drilling on the North Slope of Alaska
was the contentious heart of the meeting. Activists expressed
particular fears over BP Amoco's support for lobbyists trying to
open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
   While the hour-long discussions meandered into arcane details
such as the mating habits of Alaskan caribou, polite exchanges
between activist shareholders and company executives could not mask
the underlying passions.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Spencer, a shareholder and Greenpeace campaigner who
helped introduce the resolution, said that BP Amoco risked a
''meltdown'' in its reputation for sensitivity to the environment
if it refused to cease drilling in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ''How far does that green commitment go beyond the color of our
filling stations,'' he asked the company's directors. The company's
stations sport BP Amoco logos with yellow lettering on a bright
green background.
</P>
<P>
   Bell of PIRC urged BP Amoco to map out a plan to reduce its
dependence on fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland, for his part, disputed claims that the Northstar
project, which is to start pumping oil through an undersea pipeline
in 2001, runs a 25 percent risk of a major spill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This risk is simply a fiction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder Sylvia Currie said after the meeting that she
believed BP Amoco was doing an admirable job.
</P>
<P>
   The retired London librarian, who called herself an
environmentalist, said the debate over the proposed resolution was
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I walked out.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies 12, Cardinals 6  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Todd Helton and Mike Lansing each drove in three
runs in a 10-run second inning to lead the Colorado Rockies to a
12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado shelled former Rockie Darryl Kile (2-1) for eight hits
and 11 runs in just 1 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Rick Croushore (1-0) pitched three hitless innings to
earn the victory after starter Scott Karl struggled into the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies sent 15 men to the plate in the second, collecting a
club-record nine hits. During the flurry, eight straight batters
reached base safely. The Cardinals chipped in with two errors, and
Kile hit two batters.
</P>
<P>
   Neifi Perez led off the inning by reaching on shortstop Edgar
Renteria's throwing error. With one out, Karl was hit by a pitch.
Tom Goodwin followed with an RBI single, Lansing a two-run single
and Larry Walker an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo was hit by a pitch, and Helton hit a three-run,
421-foot homer. Darren Bragg hit a solo homer, and Perez tripled
and scored on Scott Servais' sacrifice fly. Karl singled, chasing
Kile, and Goodwin singled off Justin Brunette, who made his major
league debut. Lansing then got his third RBI of the inning with
another single to make it 11-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals appeared to take control early, hitting three solo
homers off Karl in the first. Leadoff hitter Placido Polanco, who
had a career-high four hits, sent Karl's first pitch into the
right-field seats. With two outs, Fernando Tatis and Jim Edmonds
hit back-to-back homers, their second and fifth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado got a run in its half on Walker's RBI single to make it
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis loaded the bases with no outs in the third, but Karl
averted major damage, allowing only one run on Tatis' double-play
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals chased Karl in the fourth after Mike Matheny
doubled, Brunette singled for his first major league hit and
Polanco had an RBI single to make it 11-5.
</P>
<P>
   Perez added a solo homer in the eighth to make it 12-5.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on second and third and one out in the ninth,
Thomas Howard's groundout drove in Polanco to make it 12-6.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire returned to St. Louis before
the game to be examined for lingering back pain. Team physician Dr.
George Paletta will conduct tests Friday. McGwire missed the first
two games of the season and also sat out Wednesday night's game in
Houston. ... The Cards placed left-hander Jesse Orosco and
right-hander Mark Thompson on the 15-day disabled list because of
elbow and groin injuries, respectively. The club purchased the
contract of right-hander Mike James from Triple-A Memphis and
recalled left-hander Justin Brunette from Double-A Arkansas. ...
Helton extended his hitting streak to 10 games. ... The Rockies
wore their new purple jerseys for the first time. It was the first
time they have not worn white jerseys at home since early in their
inaugural season (1993), when they wore black jerseys in two home
blowout losses and scrapped them.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Says He'll Play Final Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Charles Barkley wants one more game in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who ruptured a tendon in his left leg in December, said
Thursday he plans to play in the Houston Rockets' season finale, at
home against Vancouver on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had already announced he would retire at the end of this
season when he was hurt in a Dec. 8 game against Philadelphia,
effectively ending his career immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''I plan on coming back to play in Wednesday's game pending
approval from our team doctors,'' Barkley, 37, said. ''I'm looking
forward to playing a couple of minutes and leaving the court under
my own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley played for the 76ers, Suns and Rockets during a 16-year
career. He won a rebounding title in 1987, led two U.S. Olympic
teams to gold medals, was the NBA's Most Valuable Player in 1993
and was selected one of the league's 50 greatest players.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's done a lot for this organization and if he wants to walk
off the court instead of being carried off then I'm all for that,''
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It also gives the people a chance to pay one last tribute to
him.''

<HEADLINE> Doctors in line for higher reimbursement under Medicaid  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- As anyone who has spent time lately in a
hospital emergency room in New York knows, patients are often
present who need immediate attention and there are others whose
complaints are something less than emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials argue that the reason for setting up emergency
rooms was to treat people beset by health crises: car crash and
heart attack victims, kids and adults who break bones playing
sports. It is a distortion of the purpose of emergency rooms to
have them frequently providing treatment for minor cases of the flu
or colds or minor hurts like splinters or ingrown nails, they
argue.
</P>
<P>
   Yet advocates for the poor, for hospitals and for doctors agree
that emergency rooms have become the routine treatment centers of
choice in New York for Medicaid recipients because physicians in
general practice have basically closed their office doors to those
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's ridiculous,'' said Jeannie Cross, a spokeswoman for the
state Healthcare Association, which represents hospitals. ''I don't
think there's a hospital in the world that wants to see people
coming in the ER who should be going to physicians' offices.''
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of reversing that years-long trend, the new state
budget will include a boost in the reimbursement rate to doctors
for routine office visits from a minimum of $7 to about $30.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the state Medical Society, Dr. John Ostuni,
said the ''fee-for-service'' schedule due physicians under Medicaid
has essentially not changed since the program's inception more than
30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''No changes for inflation,'' Ostuni said. ''No changes for
increased overhead costs due primarily to the high medical
malpractice premiums. No changes for the increased paperwork and
other expensive administrative requirements of the Medicaid
program.''
</P>
<P>
   A $7 reimbursement -- it can range up to $18 for visits involving
more extensive treatment -- is unfair by almost any standard, the
Medical Society said.
</P>
<P>
   The same doctors who get $7 for seeing Medicaid patients in
upstate New York get just over $31 for a routine office visit for a
Medicare-covered patient and almost $38 for seeing someone covered
by Workers' Compensation. Illinois pays its doctors $30 for a
routine office visit under Medicaid, Florida $25, Texas $22.84,
Massachusetts $21.85, Pennsylvania $20 and California $18.18,
according to New York Medical Society figures.
</P>
<P>
   There was a method behind New York allowing the
''fee-for-service'' schedule to lag, according to state Assemblyman
Richard Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat who chairs his chamber's
health committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature and health administrators did not want to
encourage the operation of ''Medicaid mills,'' he said. They are
doctors' practices specializing in the quick and substandard
treatment of patients covered by Medicaid. The philosophy behind
those offices was to see as many patients as possible to maximize
the reimbursements due doctors through the Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   Gottfried said those concerns have eased.
</P>
<P>
   ''Medicaid mills are rarely seen anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is $30 enough to bring substantial numbers of doctors back into
the business of seeing Medicaid patients in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Ostuni, the Medical Society president, has assured legislators
it would be.
</P>
<P>
   ''The re-involvement of physicians in Medicaid will, for the
first time in memory, actually provide Medicaid beneficiaries with
all of the advantages of a true 'medical home,''' he said. By a
''medical home'' Ostuni meant a place in the sense that middle- and
upper-income New Yorkers think of their doctors' offices, as places
to go when they are sick and also where they can get things like
vaccinations and flu shots so they can avoid getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   Gottfried said ''time will tell'' whether the $30
fee-for-service is enough to compel many more doctors to start
seeing Medicaid patients again. But he said it is clear the number
of doctors willing to do so for the $7 fee has dropped to ''nil.''
</P>
<P>
   The state is anticipating that the fee increase will work. State
legislators approving the new fee said it will be ''revenue
neutral,'' meaning that the state will offset the higher costs of
the fee by savings through Medicaid recipients making fewer
emergency room and clinic visits.
</P>
<P>
   Those trips can cost the Medicaid program $100 or more, making
an increase in the fee-for-service to $30 seem like a bargain -- if
more Medicaid patients avail themselves of the supposedly greater
opportunities to see general practitioners in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Only half-jokingly, Assembly Minority Leader John Faso,
R-Columbia, asked this week whether redirecting more Medicaid
patients to doctors' offices wouldn't create ''problems'' elsewhere
in New York's health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wonder next year whether we're going to be faced with a
plea from the clinics to compensate them for their lost business,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Legislators agree on airport revitalization plan  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State legislators say they have agreed on an
airport revitalization plan to fund facility improvements and
subsidize the often expensive cost of in-state airfares in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan announced Thursday, the state will spend $113
million on improvements over the next five years to airport
terminals, runways and access highways. Combined with $487 million
from the federal government and municipalities around the airports,
the program will total $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ''NY SOARS,'' the Statewide Opportunities for Airport
Revitalization program was introduced by Senate Majority Leader
Joseph Bruno, who said it would boost business in New York, which
has been plagued with air fares that rank among the highest in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Improving airport facilities will increase traffic and
stimulate competition among air carriers, ultimately lowering costs
to business and leisure travelers,'' Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   Airports would have to apply for the funding, which would be
administered through the state Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative conference committees have been working to reach a
deal on a budget for the 2000-01 fiscal year that began April 1. By
Thursday evening, only the committee on education still had not
resolved its outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said the members of
that committee should agree by Monday morning. The two legislative
leaders also said they expect to settle a $1.2 billion tax-cut deal
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Those were regarded as the last two hurdles before sending the
spending plan to the full Legislature for a vote. Silver and Bruno
say they want to finish adopting a budget by the start of Passover,
at sunset next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other agreements reached Thursday by legislators, usually in
consultation with Gov. George Pataki's negotiators:
</P>
<P>
   --Revenue-sharing aid will be reintroduced for counties for the
first time in more than a decade. It was eliminated by former Gov.
Mario Cuomo amid tight fiscal times in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The new aid is designed to cover the counties' share of
additional funding created by new programs in the Health Care
Reform Act 2000 (HRCA), which the Legislature and governor approved
in December. Counties complained the new charges amounted to
unfunded mandates while Pataki argued that the counties' share of
revenues through the tobacco settlement plus hundreds of millions
in cost-savings created by the state gives counties the resources
to meet the HCRA costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be sufficient to cover the counties' HCRA
contributions,'' Silver said of the revenue-sharing aid.
</P>
<P>
   --New York's biggest cities outside of New York City will get
special aid in the budget: Buffalo ($20.5 million), Rochester ($15
million), Yonkers ($15 million), Syracuse ($10 million) and Albany
($4.5 million, in the form of a payment in lieu of taxes the city
does not collect on the sprawling Empire State Plaza office
complex.)
</P>
<P>
   --The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will get a special
allocation of $45 million, money legislators said would preclude
the need for a toll hike over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   --The Legislature recommended restoring $34.9 million in road and
bridge aid to localities under the program known informally as
''CHIPS.'' Pataki did not recommend funding for the program in his
budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   --Money will be appropriated to allow the state's Conservation
Fund to end the new fiscal year with a surplus of $4 million. That
will eliminate the need for increases in hunting and fishing
license fees for at least the next year, legislators said.
</P>
<P>
   --The Legislature will appropriate $1 million to help create a
marine pathology laboratory on Long Island, probably at Stony
Brook, to study the current blight of lobsters and other marine
life issues in the Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   --The Legislature will not switch control of the state canal
system from the state Thruway Authority to another state agency
such as the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation,
as had been recommended by some legislators. However, $100 million
in state aid will be available for improvements on the canals -- an
allocation legislators said should prevent toll hikes on the
Thruway.

<HEADLINE> Court rejects larceny charge in gasoline bootlegging case  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A district attorney's office says
authorities in New York have lost a potentially useful tool against
bootleggers because of a ruling by the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision Thursday by the state Court of Appeals
invalidated grand larceny and conspiracy charges brought against
eight New Jersey residents who were indicted in Suffolk County for
allegedly running a scam in 1994 and 1995 to import gasoline for
sale in New York which had not been taxed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we respect the Court of Appeals' decision, we believe
it takes away an important tool from prosecutors in combatting
allegations of tax fraud,'' spokesman John Zaher of the Suffolk
County district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Tax evasion charges against the men stand and they will be tried
on those grounds, Zaher said.
</P>
<P>
   A Suffolk County court judge threw out the larceny and
conspiracy charges, but they were reinstated by the midlevel
Appellate Division of state Supreme Court. That court said a jury
should decide whether the defendants ''withheld property from its
rightful owner, i.e., the state of New York'' as defined by the
larceny statute.
</P>
<P>
   But the Court of Appeals was not persuaded by that line of
reasoning Thursday. It said in a ruling written by Judge George
Bundy Smith that the taxes due the state are not ''property of the
state'' before they are remitted to the state Department of
Taxation and Finance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Accordingly, defendants did not steal money that belonged to
New York state, but rather failed to make payments of taxes which
were their personal obligations under the (state) Tax Law,'' Smith
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for two of the defendants said Thursday's ruling
affirmed what he has been arguing all along. Mark Freyberg, lawyer
for father-and-son defendants William S. and William K. Nappo, said
prosecutors were ''piling on'' unreasonable charges in hopes of
finding some that stick against his clients.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nappos' did not steal any money from New York state,''
Freyberg said. ''We continue to deny the tax evasion charges,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the eight defendants for tax charges was put on
hold pending the outcome of appeals on the other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Carey, a spokesman for the state tax department, said his
department will charge suspected tax evaders with larceny when
state taxes have been collected but not turned over to the state.
The Court of Appeals said Thursday that is an activity that fits
into the description of larceny under New York statutes, because
the state can be deemed to be the ''owner'' of the taxes which have
been collected, but not turned over to the tax department as
required by tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Suffolk County say the defendants tried to hide
the nonpayment of gas taxes by creating ''burn'' or shell
corporations to create false documentation for the sale of
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   In other rulings by state appeals courts Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   CAPITAL CASE
</P>
<P>
   The Appellate Division of state Supreme Court in Albany ruled
that Anthony Schroedel cannot plead guilty to the charges against
him in a murder case as a way of avoiding the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Schroedel had initially pleaded innocent to slaying Barbara Vogt
and slashing her 11-year-old son in Sullivan County in 1999, but he
pleaded guilty while county District Attorney Stephen Lungen was
still deciding whether to bring capital charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Lungen argued in person before the appellate division that the
state's death penalty statute gives him 120 days to decide whether
to seek death against a defendant. Schroedel was trying to take
that decision out of this hands by suddenly changing his plea to
guilty before Lungen had decided whether to make the case a capital
one, the prosecutor argued.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Schroedel has been on hold since the dispute
arose over his plea.
</P>
<P>
   REIMBURSEMENT
</P>
<P>
   The appellate division in Albany ruled unconstitutional a
provision of state law pertaining to reimbursement for personal
care services under Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The judges said the law as written is illegally vague about what
care providers can reimburse Medicaid for and what they cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved Ulster Home Care Inc. of Ulster County and the
charges it made to Ulster County for services provided to Medicaid
clients. The state Medicaid Fraud Control Unit charged that the
company received higher-than-allowed reimbursements and demanded
$675,000 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   But the company argued, and the appellate division agreed
Thursday, that state laws are too vague to give it or other health
providers a clear idea of which charges are permissible and which
are not.

<HEADLINE> Dog destroyed by judge's order but man on bench getting bit  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- It's the dream of every citizen startled by
a dog galloping amok: ridding the planet of the annoying mutt.
</P>
<P>
   But now a judge, who, allegedly without a hearing and no
witnesses other than himself, ordered the destruction of his
neighbor's 12-year-old beagle ''Baby'' because he saw it one day
running loose, is being accused of abusing that power.
</P>
<P>
   The state Commission on Judicial Conduct on Thursday recommended
removing Buckley from serving as justice in the town and village
courts of Dannemora, near Plattsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Baby's case was one of nine instances of alleged misconduct by
Buckley that were cited by the eleven-member panel. Buckley was
also accused of swearing at defendants and denying them fundamental
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''This record portrays a biased judge who routinely denies
defendants their fundamental rights and ignores proper criminal
procedure,'' the commission ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, 73, a retired phone worker, has been justice of
Dannemora's Town Court since 1987, and an acting Village Court
justice since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's ruling included an account of the judge writing
in his docket that he charged and forgave one defendant without the
accused ever being aware of the charge. He is also accused of more
than once refusing to recuse himself on cases with which he was
personally involved.
</P>
<P>
   Among the charges against Buckley:
</P>
<P>
   --In 1997, the judge allegedly misinformed a person heading to
jail of the day a tuberculosis test was given. The test was
mandatory for the person's entry to the jail. The court record says
that when the defendant explained why he had not reported for the
test, Buckley said he was not taking ''the (expletive) blame'' and
sent him to jail without bail.
</P>
<P>
   --Responding to one complaint, Buckley allegedly told the
commission there was something about a defendant that reminded him
of ''gypsy contractors'' so that he gave the accuser in the
harassment case, who was an acquaintance of the judge, more
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   --In one case, Buckley told the commission that he wanted to keep
a probate in jail for his own benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't want to know what I think'' of the ruling, Buckley
said Thursday when contacted at home. When told that his removal
was recommended, he said he agreed with the commission on that
determination and would not appeal to the state's highest court,
the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's all I can say that you can put in the paper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley added that he is considering resigning. If the
commission's ruling ousting him from the bench goes into force,
Buckley would be prohibited from ever holding judicial office again
in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Buckley's judicial fate, it comes too late for Baby,
who was killed last year after the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was either that, or go to jail for her'' the dog's owner,
Mark Bordeau, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeau said that Buckley added insult to injury by his language
in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know any stupid ass that would go to jail over a
dog,'' the judge is quoted as saying in the commission's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Ten members of the judicial panel voted for Buckley's dismissal.
The other member was absent.

<HEADLINE> Former Lt. Gov. sues estranged husband over campaign finances  </HEADLINE>
By L. ANNE NEWELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Former Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross didn't
just lose the election when she ran for governor in 1998. She says
she lost her public reputation, prospects as a political candidate,
and private job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   She says she's also still mired in debt from the campaign and
all of it is partly the fault of her estranged husband, Wall Street
millionaire Wilbur Ross, since he reneged on a promise to finance
her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross filed a lawsuit against Ross and his accountant
Tuesday, seeking at least $40 million in compensation.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross, who jumped parties and became a Democrat after
Republican George Pataki dropped her as his running mate, charged
that Ross deposited $2.25 million into her campaign account in
January 1998, but secretly had the campaign's accountant withdraw
it only days later.
</P>
<P>
   She says she did not realize the money was missing until just
before the 1998 Democratic primary, leaving her campaign in
disarray. McCaughey lost the primary to New York City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone and, running as a Liberal, the general
election to Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also charged that Ross coerced his wife into signing a
postnuptial agreement in August 1998. In exchange, he replaced
$500,000 of the campaign money. He filed for divorce a little more
than two months later.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which was filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan
and first reported by Newsday, also named the accountant, Arthur
Fox, and Fox's company, Fox P.C. Fox was simultaneously working as
an accountant for Ross and for the Betsy Ross Empire State
Exploratory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pledge of financial support by Wilbur Ross was a
fundamental premise of ... her decision to place her political
reputation and future at risk in the costly race for Governor,''
McCaughey Ross' lawyer, Bill Wachtel, wrote in her complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel charged Thursday that Ross and Fox committed fraud by
continuing to report the campaign account had more than $2 million
in it until September. He charged the pair also acted illegally by
later saying the money had been invested in the Penn-Dixie Leasing
Company and failing to report that to the Board of Elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''While she's no longer the lieutenant governor, Betsy Ross
still feels she owes a duty to the people of New York to ensure
that the integrity of the electoral process is preserved
retrospectively and prospectively,'' Wachtel said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ross, a 62-year-old investment banker, denied their
client acted improperly and said the lawsuit is another example of
McCaughey Ross continuing to ask for money she is not entitled to.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross has asked a Manhattan judge that she be paid
$25,000 a month while he decides if the postnuptial agreement is
valid.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's been making these charges for two years and we believe
in the fullness of time they will be exposed as being as bizarre
and as empty as her political career,'' Ross' lawyer, Lawrence
Mandelker, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no mystery and no irregularity involved except in her
mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The name-calling is nothing new for the 52-year-old McCaughey
Ross, who was dogged by allegations from Pataki's administration of
being unstable and erratic.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel brushed aside the name-calling and said his client is
ready to meet with state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer as soon as
possible to determine what illegal acts took place.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ultimate beneficiary of a campaign committee is the people
of New York. They're the ones who have been fooled with here and
the Board of Elections should be looking at this,'' Wachtel said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asks for at least $15 million in damages from Fox
and Fox P.C. and $25 million in damages from Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Wachtel denied the figure is inflated, even though the lawsuit
states McCaughey Ross' campaign only has $90,000 in outstanding
debts. He said what Ross went through is worth compensation and the
campaign contribution should be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Ross and McCaughey Ross, now a senior fellow at the
Washington-based Hudson Institute where she studies Medicare,
married on Dec. 7, 1995. Their divorce is pending.

<HEADLINE> Legislators approve bigger Tuition Assistance Program  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Spending on the Tuition Assistance Program
will go up by $80 million under an agreement reached by state
legislators negotiating the 2000-01 state budget.
</P>
<P>
   According to the legislative conference committee on higher
education, Thursday's deal would mean more TAP grants for college
students in New York and more families eligible for the aid. The
state spent $600 million in the recently concluded 1999-2000 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, maximum TAP grants for freshmen and
sophomores would go up to $5,000 from $4,125. After one year, the
maximum grant would be $5,000 for all students.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also agreed to raise the TAP tuition cap from 90
percent to 95 percent of a student's tuition this year. Next year
the cap will be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   TAP would be also be made available to households with incomes
up to $80,000 a year, up from the current $50,500 after deductions.
Tuition would be tax deductible and the amount the state provides
for each tuition grant would go up from the current minimum of $275
to $500.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the maximum ''upper cut'' -- grant reduction for
juniors and seniors -- will be lowered from $200 to $100 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement will keep college in the picture for even more
college-bound middle and lower income families,'' said state Sen.
Kenneth LaValle, who headed the legislative conference committee on
higher education with Assemblyman Edward Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   TAP is the state's largest aid program for higher education.
About 259,000 students currently qualify for the grants.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday the committee resolved to:
</P>
<P>
   --Increase state aid to community colleges in the State
University of New York and City University of New York systems from
$2,125 per student to $2,250 per student.
</P>
<P>
   --Spend $10 million on ''opportunity programs'' -- a series of
initiatives designed to help students cope with college. That would
restore spending back to 1994 levels.
</P>
<P>
   --Raise funding for child care programs in SUNY and CUNY systems
by $4.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   One issue still under discussion Thursday was how much the state
will spend to help SUNY and CUNY hire additional full-time faculty.
Sullivan said funding would be ''more than last year, but we don't
know how much yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators are working to iron out the details of the state
budget which was supposed to have been in place starting April 1.

<HEADLINE> Teachers' Union Calls for Exams  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's second-largest teachers' union
will propose mandatory entrance exams for new hires in efforts to
raise the bar on teacher quality.
</P>
<P>
   The American Federation of Teachers, which represents nearly a
million educators mostly in urban areas, also says states must
require that college students preparing to become teachers spend
more time in teaching in actual classrooms before they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only individuals who receive top-quality training ... and who
demonstrate that they meet high standards -- on paper and on their
feet -- should be permitted to enter the teaching profession,'' the
union said in a report to be released Friday at the annual meeting
of the Education Writers Association in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the teacher proposal, the AFT suggests that the colleges that
train teachers require students to reach a 3.0 grade point average
by their second year. Most programs accept a 2.75 grade point
average. The colleges should also require teacher candidates to
major in a separate subject, rather than just studying coursework
in the college of education.
</P>
<P>
   The AFT says its recommendations are a departure from the
traditional union anti-test stance that has stood in the way of
states either requiring such tests or improving the ones they have.
Forty-four states require teachers to pass a test to earn a
license. But the tests, which vary, grant teachers credentials
based on a range of measures from basic skills to knowledge of a
specific subject to teaching performance.
</P>
<P>
   The union studied teacher preparation programs for two years and
prepared this report, calling for an ''urgent national commitment''
to raise these standards.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes as lawmakers and educators are struggling with
ways to improve teacher quality as U.S. students lag behind other
nations in key subjects like math. The Clinton administration has
called for the hiring of 2 million new teachers over the decade to
address what it calls an imminent teacher shortage due to mass
retirements and early departures of teachers with less than three
years' experience.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Education Secretary Richard Riley called on
states to ''professionalize'' teaching by offering year-round
contracts and higher salaries. On average, teachers work under
contract for 186 school days; the typical salary for a public
school teacher was $40,582 for 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   Education Department research also showed that four out of five
teachers felt unprepared to teach children with special needs or
who speak a language other than English. U.S. teachers also say
they are not properly trained to use classroom technology.

<HEADLINE> Assemblyman accused in bizarre burglary case goes to jail  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENESEO, N.Y. (AP) -- A New York assemblyman accused of breaking
into a female aide's home and making long-distance telephone calls
agreed to a felony plea deal that ends his 28-year political career
and puts him in jail for up to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have done some terrible, wrong things -- I have brought shame
upon my colleagues, my family, people who trust me,'' Jerry
Johnson, 57, said in pleading guilty Thursday to second-degree
attempted burglary and drawing a six-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea, Johnson also will admit next week to a second
attempted burglary count in return for another six-month sentence
to be served right after his first sentence. He was taken away in
handcuffs to a jail outside his constituency.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of second-degree burglary, he could have been
sentenced to five to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican who began his political career in 1972, Johnson was
elected to the first of four terms in the state Assembly in 1992
and was up for re-election in November. His mainly rural district
extends across Livingston, Monroe and Allegany counties in western
New York.
</P>
<P>
   By failing to resign his seat by April 1, his successor will not
be selected until the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a case that cried out for understanding,'' said
defense attorney John Parrinello. ''But unfortunately in today's
world, there aren't many people out there that want to understand.
His conduct appears totally aberrant, but he's going to deal with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began in December when the woman, Bonnie
Turner, told police her pocketbook had been stolen from her car.
Authorities turned up evidence that Johnson broke into her house
Oct. 22 and placed an unspecified number of long-distance telephone
calls. The second burglary charge arose from a similar break-in on
Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of immediately surrendering to authorities, Johnson
booked into a psychiatric center in Buffalo on Jan. 27 with the
approval of Livingston County Sheriff John York, a personal friend.
Two weeks later, he pleaded innocent and was freed on $10,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   His plea places him on five years' probation and orders him to
keep away from Turner, who lives near this village 35 miles south
of Rochester. He also paid $804 to cover the cost of the telephone
calls and other damages at her home, and he agreed to continue
mental-health counseling at Steuben County Jail in Bath, 50 miles
south of here.
</P>
<P>
   Before sentencing, the defense noted that Johnson had resigned
his Albany post within the previous 24 hours, but Johnson
automatically relinquishes office on becoming a felon.
</P>
<P>
   His voice quavering with emotion, Johnson turned toward Turner
in the public gallery and solemnly apologized.
</P>
<P>
   A Rochester television station, ABC affiliate WOKR-TV, said
Turner alleged that Johnson stalked her, made harassing phone calls
and broke into her home to steal her underwear.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the U.S. Air Force, Johnson worked his way up
the ranks at Genesee and Wyoming Railroad to become general manager
in 1977. He was elected to an education board in 1972 and later
became a councilman and then town supervisor in the village of
Nunda.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, he was a ranking minority member of the mental health
committee in Albany. He is divorced and has three daughters.

<HEADLINE> Co. Ordered To Lower Fly Outbreaks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, Ohio (AP) -- The nation's fourth largest egg distributor
was ordered Thursday to reduce fly infestations that neighbors
complained interfered with their everyday activities.
</P>
<P>
   Buckeye Egg operates several barns in Ohio and ships to
restaurants and groceries in 20 states. Its 15 million chickens
produce 2.4 billion eggs a year, 4 percent of the nation's total
production.
</P>
<P>
   Buckeye Egg must take steps to eliminate the problem within 90
days, although the judge did not specify a penalty. The judge
prohibited construction permits for new egg facilities until the
steps are taken and ordered the company to monitor fly populations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the failure of the defendants to properly manage
the manure at their facilities, the neighbors in the surrounding
area live in misery as a result of house fly outbreaks,'' Common
Pleas Judge Gregory Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   The action is part of a lawsuit the state filed Dec. 1 that
accused the company of dumping dead chickens in a field, polluting
creeks and causing infestations of flies and other insects.
</P>
<P>
   The company said implementing all of the steps could force it
into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Buckeye Egg Chief Executive Officer Bill Glass declined to
comment on Frost's 18-page ruling until he had read it. He said the
company plans to follow environmental laws.

scheme to distribute 121 tons of Mexican marijuana to East Coast markets. The
Drug Enforcement Administration said FedEx's top officials fully cooperated with
the 18-month investigation, which has led to the arrests of 101 people since it
began. From shortly after midnight through late afternoon, there were 45
arrests, 22 of them FedEx employees.

Clinton Won't Ask For Pardon

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton heatedly said Thursday ''I'm not
ashamed'' about being impeached and ''I'm not interested'' in being pardoned for
any alleged crimes in the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Whitewater investigation.
But Clinton did not say whether he would accept a pardon if it were offered by
his successor. Republicans immediately pounced on his failure to answer the
question. ''The answer is I have no interest in it. I wouldn't ask for it. I
don't think it would be necessary,'' the president told the convention of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors.

   HOUSTON (AP) -- Charles Barkley, who ruptured a tendon in his left leg in
December, said Thursday he plans to play in the Houston Rockets' season finale,
at home against Vancouver on April 19. Barkley had already announced he would
retire at the end of this season when he was hurt in a Dec. 8 game against
Philadelphia, effectively ending his career immediately. ''I plan on coming back
to play in Wednesday's game pending approval from our team doctors,'' Barkley,
37, said. ''I'm looking forward to playing a couple of minutes and leaving the
court under my own terms.''

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 6, Coyotes 3  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Sandis Ozolinsh, who failed to score a goal in the
final 20 games of the regular season, scored twice Thursday night
as the Colorado Avalanche beat the Phoenix Coyotes 6-3 in the first
round of the Western Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Shjon Podein added two goals for the Avalanche, who shrugged off
the absence of injured star Peter Forsberg to take a 1-0 lead in
the best-of-7 series. Game 2 is Saturday in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-seeded Coyotes got off to a horrible start as they
attempt to advance past the first round for the first time in 13
years. Colorado led 4-0 after one period before Phoenix made things
interesting in the second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Green and Shane Doan scored less than three minutes apart
early in the second, but Alex Tanguay put home a rebound to put the
Avalanche up 5-2 heading into the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With Colorado playing conservative, Phoenix pulled within two
again when Teppo Numminem corralled a loose puck in front of the
net and beat Patrick Roy with 11:42 left.
</P>
<P>
   Podein put the game out of reach four minutes later, scoring on
a long shot that went through Sean Burke's legs. Ray Bourque,
trying to win his first Stanley Cup in 21 seasons, got his second
assist of the game to move into a tie for fourth on the NHL's
career postseason list.
</P>
<P>
   After winning their final eight games of the regular season,
Colorado carried the momentum into the opening period as Podein
scored at 4:23 to ignite the Avalanche offense.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Andreychuk, who came to Colorado in the March 6 trade with
Bourque, converted a give-and-go with Chris Drury on a power play
at 8:10, and Ozolinsh added another power-play goal six minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ozolinsh's first goal since Feb. 22, and he got his
second at 18:14 as he hit a slap shot from the top of the left
circle that sailed over Burke's right arm.
</P>
<P>
   The added scoring punch from Ozolinsh helped absorb the loss of
Forsberg, who is out indefinitely while he recovers from a
separated right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Neither goalie was particularly sharp. Roy stopped 12 shots to
win his NHL-record 111th playoff game, and Burke had 32 saves in
his first postseason game since 1998.

<HEADLINE> 10 More L.A. Convictions Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge Thursday reversed 10 more convictions
tainted by the expanding police corruption scandal, including those
of four people whose criminal records triggered deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The reversals raise to 60 the number of convictions dismissed at
the request of prosecutors who are scrutinizing criminal cases for
involvement of officers under investigation for framing, beating
and shooting innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys said they would seek help from the U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno for those who were deported after being
wrongly convicted.
</P>
<P>
   They include Israel Cid, who was a legal U.S. resident before
his arrest but now makes $80 a week in Yucatan, Mexico. Cid, 24,
was raised in the United States and English is his primary
language, attorney Gregory Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his conviction on a probation violation has been
overturned, ''our client is sitting in Mexico,'' Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service spokeswoman Sharon Gavin
said each case will be looked at individually to see whether the
defendants should be allowed back into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal is focused on the police department's Rampart
station and emerged when ex-officer Rafael Perez, a member of an
anti-gang unit, offered cooperation in exchange for a lenient
sentence for stealing cocaine from an evidence locker.
</P>
<P>
   Some two dozen Rampart officers have quit, been fired or
relieved of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan vowed Thursday to root out police
corruption as the scandal's shadow dimmed his annual
state-of-the-city address.
</P>
<P>
   ''On this you have my word,'' Riordan said. ''We will
investigate corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department. We
will expose it and we will eradicate it.''

<HEADLINE> Colombian Lawyer Faces Extradition  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- He's a Colombian attorney, a leader in a
drug eradication program in his country and he now faces
extradition on cocaine trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Manuel Tafur Dominguez, 36, has been held in a
Philadelphia jail since his March 4 arrest, accused by Colombian
officials of arranging a shipment of nearly 7 tons of cocaine to
Spain by way of Jamaica and Cuba. The shipment was seized at the
port of Cartagena, Colombia, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge Charles B. Smith on Thursday expressed
doubts about the case against Tafur as he granted him $350,000
bail. Tafur, who has been wanted by Colombian authorities since
September, probably won't be released until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on the information I have now, if he's in jail another
30 days I won't sleep well,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   An extradition hearing for Tafur had been scheduled for Thursday
but was postponed at the request of U.S. prosecutors so the
Colombian government could submit more evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Tafur would be the first fugitive sent to Colombia on drug
charges since the United States and Colombia signed the extradition
treaty in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, in force since 1982, was written in part by Tafur's
father, Donald Rodrigo Tafur, a former senator who was shot to
death in 1992 outside his son's home in Cali, Colombia, apparently
by drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Tafur had been an executive with a drug-eradication
program in Colombia called Plante, which encourages farmers to
cultivate crops other than coca, the plant used to make cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Tafur was seriously injured in a plane crash in the Andes in
1999 and came to the United States last year to recuperate and be
near his mother, who remarried and moved to New Hope, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Tafur enrolled in the environmental law program at Pace
University in White Plains, N.Y., where he is pursuing a master's
degree. His supporters include the Pace law faculty, which
submitted a brief on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a real travesty that someone like Victor could be
yanked out of a car and thrown into jail on basically no
evidence,'' said Ann Powers, a Pace law professor.
</P>
<P>
   The case centers on a payment that Colombian prosecutors say
Tafur made to a front company, E.I. Caribe, to arrange the drug
shipment. A police search of the E.I. Caribe office found checks
from Tafur totaling 560 million pesos, or about $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tafur's lawyers said he was engaging in a legitimate financial
transaction on behalf of his mother, Solita Rosade, who in 1998
received a payment of 560 million pesos from the pension of her
deceased husband. According to Tafur's lawyers, Rosade requested
that the money be converted to U.S. dollars and deposited in a
Swiss bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it ''very ironic,'' Tafur's mother said she planned to
use the $350,000 for Tafur's bail.

<HEADLINE> Kings 130, Warriors 107  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Webber scored 22 points and
Vlade Divac had 15 points and 11 rebounds Thursday night as the
Sacramento Kings rolled past the Golden State Warriors 130-107.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento, seventh in the Western Conference standings,
increased its lead over idle eighth-place Seattle to one game with
four remaining, three on the road against playoff-bound teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings tied their season high for points and snapped a
three-game losing streak, the first time all season the Kings had
dropped three straight at home.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento led by six points after one quarter, stretched the
margin to 17 by halftime and were up by as many as 26 points in the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes had 35 points and 12 rebounds for the Warriors, who
had won two straight. Reserve Sam Jacobson had a career-high 19
points and Jason Caffey added 11.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Anderson and Predrag Stojakovic both had 13 points, Tony
Delk scored 12 and Corliss Williamson added 11 for the Kings, who
made 33 of 46 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento made 9 of 13 shots in the third quarter and continued
going to the free-throw line frequently in building a 91-70 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings opened the third quarter with a 9-2 run, taking a
74-52 lead at the 8:20 mark on a close-range basket by Divac.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento used an up-tempo game to grab a 65-48 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Webber had 13 points and Divac scored 11 as the Kings scored 32
points in both quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' reserves had 24 points in the first half, including
20 in the second quarter, when they owned a 33-22 edge over the
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was Kings coach Rick Adelman's 428th victory, moving him
past Tommy Heinsohn and into 26th place on the career list. ...
Jacobson surpassed his career high in the first half, getting 17
points in 17 minutes. ... The Kings had 11 players score in the
half. ... Kings reserve Jon Barry fouled out in the fourth quarter
after playing just 11 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Arrest made in gunpoint robberies involving children  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two officers on routine patrol unknowingly
arrested a man believed responsible for robberies of women in which
he allegedly pointed a gun at their children's heads.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced that the
officers nabbed the man Wednesday in a Brooklyn subway station
after he allegedly stole a gold chain. The suspect put up quite a
struggle -- for 45 minutes, he held onto the bottom of a parked
train while police tried to talk him into surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   The arresting officers did not immediately recognize the man as
a suspect who terrorized mothers and tots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kept saying to him, 'There's no way to go, you're going to
get yourself hurt,''' said Officer Andrew Huksloot. ''It's not
worth it for a chain. You're going to get yourself electrocuted,''
Huksloot said he told the man.
</P>
<P>
   Once in custody, Detective Ronald Jackson noticed the suspect's
resemblance to a sketch of the man wanted for three recent gunpoint
robberies involving children.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way he tried to elude arrest, ''We knew something
else had to be going on besides just a chain snatch,'' said
Margaret Lynch, the other arresting officer.
</P>
<P>
   Lemar Jackson, 31, of St. Alban's, Queens, was charged with
robbery, reckless endangerment, endangering the welfare of a child
and assault. He faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   One woman identified him as the man who put a gun to her
2-year-old daughter's head last week at a Queens subway station.
Two others did not make positive identifications; but police
insisted they had the right person.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old woman who identified Jackson had described at a
news conference on Monday how the robber threatened her child: ''He
put the gun to her head and told me he would blow her brains out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the woman said in a statement through her lawyer,
Steven Gildin of Melville, that the lineup had left her shaken. The
woman has said she intends to sue the city alleging the subway
station had no security.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was petrified. I am a little relieved that he is behind bars
where he belongs, but me and my daughter will continue to suffer
for a very long time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still can't sleep. I still feel like he is coming at me from
my shadows. My daughter even keeps acting out the horrible scene.
I'm afraid we will never get over this,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown said the robber's
conduct ''is about as low as human behavior can get.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is incomprehensible that anyone -- no matter how desperate --
would put a gun to a child's head and threaten to kill the child in
order to rob the mother,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was convicted in 1994 for robbery and sentenced to up to
seven years in prison, said Tom Grant, Parole Department spokesman.
He was conditionally released in 1998, but jailed again on Dec. 31,
1998 for violating the terms of his release.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Jackson was released from prison, and on March 27, a
warrant was issued because he had not been reporting to his parole
officer, Grant said. Jackson has a criminal history dating back to
1985 for robbery, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of
stolen property charges.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Connects Enemies in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Fearing for his life in
possible Serb attacks, Besi grabbed a toothbrush and a change of
clothes and abandoned his home a year ago to become a refugee in a
neighboring land.
</P>
<P>
   Like many ethnic Albanians, Besi -- a muscular 25-year-old with
cropped blond hair -- begins to cry when he talks about years of
repression, the $20,000 stolen by Serbian border guards when he and
his family fled to Montenegro and widespread attacks on ethnic
Albanians and their property.
</P>
<P>
   While Besi does not count Serbs among his friends, he has begun
to do something unthinkable even a few months ago -- he is drinking
coffee with them.
</P>
<P>
   True, they are only colleagues at his job in a Western
organization based in this ethnically tense city. But he brews up
the sweet and strong beverage for his bitter ethnic enemies. It's a
start.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before it was very difficult,'' says Besi, who wants to be
identified only by the diminutive of his name. ''But now we drink
coffee together, although not outside the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Balkan ritual of coffee drinking was inherited from the
Turks, who ruled Kosovo for 500 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern side of this divided city, ethnic Albanians of
all ages bask in the spring sunshine drinking black coffee and
cappuccino. In the tatty sidewalk bars, they listen to a tinny
rendition of Tina Turner.
</P>
<P>
   They seem oblivious to French and American peacekeepers in
armored personnel carriers who guard a bridge across the Ibar River
-- the site of violent confrontations between the Serbs and ethnic
Albanians since the NATO-led force arrived in June.
</P>
<P>
   While the situation seems under control now, the threat of
renewed fighting is real, especially as summer approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I see that bridge, I go crazy,'' Besi said in fluent
English. ''I am still a refugee because Serbs live in my flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Besi returned to the city -- but not his home -- in July. He found
employment and a good wage at a Western agency that he does not
want identified.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dolce Vita bar in the northern sector of the city, a
handful of well-heeled Serbs are drinking coffee and playing cards.
Others are hanging around outside, keeping a watchful eye on the
bridge and the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The silence of the streets in Kosovska Mitrovica north contrasts
with the muddle, mess and noise of ethnic Albanians and soldiers
going about their lives on the south bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kosovo is a holy land. We lost blood for Kosovo,'' said Dragan
Nikolic, a 20-year-old student. ''It is true that bad things were
done on both sides, but it was war.''

<HEADLINE> S.Carolina Flag Bill Heads To House  </HEADLINE>
By LEIGH STROPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The Republican-controlled House now gets
its shot to settle the bitter fight over the Confederate flag
flying from South Carolina's Statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   A bill to move the flag to another location on the Statehouse
grounds cleared the Democrat-controlled Senate on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a step in the right direction,'' Republican House
Speaker David Wilkins said. ''I think it really is the only viable
alternative to resolve the issue with honor and dignity and
finality this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The House this week passed a bill to create official state
holidays recognizing Martin Luther King Jr. and Confederate
Memorial Day. Six weeks ago, the same bill failed after rancorous
debate that created racial and political rifts.
</P>
<P>
   The flag debate -- expected to begin within a few weeks -- could
be even uglier, said Clemson University political scientist Dave
Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst battles are ahead,'' he said. ''The House is more
partisan. The discussions are going to be an awful lot more
vitriolic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would remove the banner from the dome and place
a similar, square battle flag behind an existing monument honoring
Confederate soldiers. The flag would fly on the north side of the
Statehouse from a pole no taller than 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would remove the Confederate flags hanging in the
House and Senate chambers while protecting monuments, memorials and
buildings erected or named in honor of the Confederacy or civil
rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Some black House members think the flag would still be too
visible. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People also doesn't support the compromise and has no plans to end
an economic boycott of the state that began Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The plan ''adds insult to injury,'' said Nelson Rivers, field
operations director for NAACP and a former official in the South
Carolina conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're in a box,'' countered House Ways and Means Chairman
Bobby Harrell, a Charleston Republican who supports the flag. The
boycott won't mean much without the flag on the dome, he said.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is the only state that flies the Confederate flag
above its Statehouse. Opponents say it is a racist symbol, while
supporters say it represents Southern heritage and honors
Confederate war dead. Only the Legislature can take down the flag,
which has flown since 1962.

<HEADLINE> King's Webber Cited for Driving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Sacramento Kings star Chris Webber has
been cited for reckless driving and teammate Jason Williams could
face a similar charge.
</P>
<P>
   Webber was stopped after Wednesday's home loss to the San
Antonio Spurs, the California Highway Patrol said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A CHP officer said Williams was driving recklessly in the same
area at the same time. Williams was not stopped, but Officer Nick
Salmeron said reckless driving charges might still be sought.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers can erase such citations from their driving records by
attending traffic school.
</P>
<P>
   Webber and Williams each received speeding tickets Jan. 2, after
they were stopped at the same location in Sacramento County.
</P>
<P>
   Webber has had other legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Webber paid a $500 fine after being accused of carrying
marijuana in a carry-on bag at an airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Webber, through his agent, denied any wrongdoing and said the bag
belonged to a female companion.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, a Maryland jury found Webber guilty of failure
to display a driver's license on demand, failure to display a car
registration on demand and willful disobedience of a police
officer. He was fined $560.
</P>
<P>
   After the same traffic stop, he was found innocent of marijuana
possession, driving under the influence of the drug, resisting
arrest and second-degree assault.

   But it's not really Rome in 1800 -- it's Thursday night at The
Bushnell theater, where Bochiccio and 16 other Eastern Connecticut
State University students who broke campus rules have been
''sentenced'' to attend the opera ''Tosca'' in lieu of community
service or other disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   Bochiccio even landed a bit part in the show.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore from Rindge, N.H., and two other students joined
Kirk Peters, associate dean of student affairs at the Willimantic
college, in a crowd scene during Act One of the Puccini opera.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was awesome,'' said Bochiccio, 19. ''I wasn't expecting
anything. I'd do it again-- voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   The students opted for the opera in lieu of working off the
hours given for various minor campus infractions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got caught with beer in the dorm,'' said Bochiccio. ''They
have a lot of things you can do like pick up trash. This seemed
like the best way.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perkins, a sophomore from Beacon Falls, who also had beer
in the dorm, lacked enthusiasm before the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not really into theater,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the 19-year-old, who also played a monk, had a different
outlook after the third act.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was much better than I thought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 others, like Deborah Kitchen, joined the group just to
see the performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved the show,'' said Kitchen, a sophomore from Georgia who
had never been to the opera. ''It's definitely not punishment. It's
a privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   The students seemed intrigued as they watched the Connecticut
Opera from their balcony seats. The romantic drama starring Floria
Tosca as a strong-willed diva trapped in a web of political and
sexual intrigue, proved to be a crowd-pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   Many students chuckled softly at Tosca's jealousy. A few cringed
as Tosca stabbed the police chief, Baron Scarpia, to death. At
least one student shed a tear as Tosca plunged to her death after
learning her revolutionary lover had been executed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very exciting,'' said Larry Drew, who came to Tosca
even though he was not in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Preston freshman attended the Magic Flute last semester
after being busted with beer and discovered a new passion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It inspired me. I got a little culture in me,'' said Drew, the
fourth monk. ''I have a different appreciation for the opera,'' he
said. ''I thought it was just elevator music, but it's really
people singing their hearts out.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters, a former radio and television news producer, created the
new policy. He said his colleagues originally questioned his idea,
saying it wasn't discipline.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the Alternative Restitution Program began in the
fall, university officials are coming around.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's wonderful,'' said Kim Silcox, campus hearing
officer. ''I think it's a great way to expose students to something
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters said he was pleased with Thursday's turnout with more
than twice as many students participating than the four previous
trips. He hopes to make it a monthly excursion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe it didn't change their lives,'' said Peters, ''but they
got a new appreciation for the opera.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: State voters favor Gore to Bush  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush must both
secure the backing of the state's large block of independent voters
and make education a priority to win support in Connecticut,
according to the director of the latest Quinnipiac College
presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, released Thursday, found 48 percent of voters support
Democrat Al Gore, while 39 percent back Bush. The remainder were
either undecided, said they would vote for someone else or would
not vote at all, said poll director Douglas Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   He said the survey showed Gore ''has solidified his lead among
Democrats.'' The vice president handily won last month's
presidential primary over Bill Bradley. The poll was the first
since the March 7 primary and the first that gives the vice
president the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush led an October poll, 52 percent to 36 percent, but by
February, Gore had made up the difference, and each received the
support of 45 percent of those polled.
</P>
<P>
   The random phone survey questioned 950 registered voters from
April 5-10 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said Connecticut voters perceive Gore to be more
competent than Bush in two key issues -- health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the nation's strong economy is helping Gore, and
appears to outweigh any negative associations voters might have
because of his association with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continues to falter in his native state. He was born in New
Haven, while his father attended Yale. The Texas governor narrowly
lost the March 7 primary to Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said survey respondents cited a number of reasons for
disliking Bush, ranging from his knowledge of foreign policy to his
preparedness to be president. Voters also were unable to name one
specific quality they liked about Bush, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also is facing ''an especially big gender gap,'' in
Connecticut, said Schwartz. Gore leads Bush by 18 percentage points
among women, the poll showed. Schwartz said more women typically
vote Democratic, but the margin of difference between the two
parties is usually about 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also surveyed voters in New Jersey and New York and
reported similar findings. New Jersey voters favored Gore 50
percent to 37 percent. New Yorkers backed the vice president 53
percent to 36 percent for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman fared well in poll from both parties,
Schwartz said. Sixty-two percent of Democratic respondents want the
Democrat re-elected and 53 GOP voters favored Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman ran as the Democratic vice presidential nominee, 26
percent of the respondents said they would be more likely to vote
for the ticket, while 10 percent said they would be less likely to
vote Democratic and 61 percent said it would not make a difference,
Schwartz said.

<HEADLINE> Peeler lawyer wants charges dropped in light of witness letter  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A flip-flop by a woman who claimed she
was an eyewitness to the murders of an 8-year-old boy and his
mother has given defense lawyers fodder to request a dismissal of
charges against two brothers accused in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Lee -- the prosecution's star witness -- originally told
police she acted as a lookout and then watched Adrian Peeler shoot
Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke, in their
Bridgeport home on Jan. 7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Lee later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and
agreed to testify against Adrian Peeler and his brother, Russell,
who is accused of masterminding the killings to stop the little boy
from testifying against him in an earlier murder.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter she wrote to her lawyer in December -- after she
cut a deal with prosecutors for a seven-year sentence -- Lee says
she lied about what she told police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that I have told them is lies,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to make this thing right and deep down inside God's
know that I did not have anything to do with the murder.''
</P>
<P>
   She also wrote, ''I can't not live with myself telling a lie on
the Peelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection in Russell Peeler's trial is nearly completed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a day after the letter was made public, Russell
Peeler's lawyers filed a stack of motions asking for dismissal of
the charges, immediate adjournment of the trial, a mistrial and a
continuance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This statement of this witness alters the nature and
complexion of this prosecution so dramatically that the trial may
not proceed forward without court intervention,'' Peeler's lawyers
argue in their motion for a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's lawyers, John Walkley and William Koch, also ask Judge
G. Sarsfield Ford to order that the defense be given access to Lee
immediately so they can get a new statement from her.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's basically admitted that everything she's said to this
point is a lie,'' said Walkley.
</P>
<P>
   Ford rejected the request for an adjournment of the trial, but
said he would reserve a final decision until a full hearing can be
held Monday on all the defense motions.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict would not comment
on Lee's letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jury will have to decide,'' he said, when asked if Lee
will be a credible witness.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to her lawyer, Lee says she hopes to get a lighter
sentence than the seven years prosecutors are expected to
recommend. She has an undisclosed terminal illness.
</P>
<P>
   That letter contradicts three letters Lee wrote to Bridgeport
police detectives at about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In those letters, Lee admitted her role in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what I did was wrong. I get down on my knees every
night and ask God to forgive me for what I have done to the boy and
his mother,'' she said in a letter to Detective Dwayne McBride.
</P>
<P>
   She also mentions her fear of the Peelers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God that my life is still here because the Peelers did
not kill me and that is a blessing from God,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Koch said the Peelers did not threaten Lee to get her to change
her story.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's impossible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been in the federal witness protection program while
waiting to testify against the brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Peeler's lawyer, Patrick Culligan, said he may file
similar motions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Josephine Lee's letter to her attorney certainly undermines
and probably eliminates any probable cause for the state to
continue to prosecute Adrian Peeler and his brother, Russell,''
Culligan said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyer, Richard Reeve, would not comment on the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers face the possibility of the death penalty if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler is already serving a 105-year sentence for the
killing of Rudolph Snead, Clarke's boyfriend. The little boy was to
testify against Peeler in the Snead murder trial. Peeler also is
serving a life sentence on federal drug charges.

<HEADLINE> Teen's grandmother files suit one year after shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The grandmother of Aquan Salmon has filed
a federal lawsuit over the fatal shooting of the black teen-ager by
a white Hartford police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed by Norma Watts in U.S. District Court in
Hartford, claims Officer Robert C. Allan violated the 14-year-old's
civil rights when he shot him to death on April 13, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages, Joseph Moniz,
Watts' attorney, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main goal is to keep this from happening again to anyone
else,'' he said. ''They're seeking to get conditions within the
city to ensure that this won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks enforcement of a 1973 consent decree on the
use of force by Hartford police. Moniz claims the higher standards
and training policies mandated after the city was sued by the
community group La Casa, were ignored in the Salmon shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Had they been followed, this death would not have occurred,''
Moniz said.
</P>
<P>
   La Casa, a coalition of black and Hispanic groups, filed a
motion claiming the city had reneged on the consent decree after
Salmon's death. The group dropped its lawsuit after the city vowed
to revive a review board to investigate police shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Watts' lawsuit names the city of Hartford as well as Allan.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is the product of a department that had certain problems,''
Moniz said.
</P>
<P>
   Allan shot Salmon early in the morning of April 13, 1999 after
several teen-agers, one carrying a lighter shaped like a gun, fled
from a car police had been chasing through the city's north end.
</P>
<P>
   Allan claimed Salmon appeared to be reaching for a weapon.
Special prosecutor, New London State's Attorney Kevin Kane, found
in February that the shooting was justified.
</P>
<P>
   According to his report, Salmon had reached toward his waistband
and was turning toward Allan when the officer fired one shot into
the left side of his back.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon and the other teens had been wanted for an attempted
mugging and pistol-whipping earlier in the night.
</P>
<P>
   Watts has said she believes Allan should be jailed for the
shooting.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Killer Executed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATMORE, Ala. (AP) -- A man who murdered a store owner in 1984 was
executed in the electric chair early Friday after failing to win
another 11th-hour reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lee Tarver Jr., 52, was pronounced dead at 12:11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Strapped into the chair, Tarver talked briefly with his guards,
then stared straight ahead. Twice, he turned to look at his
victim's children, but did not attempt to communicate with them.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the U.S. Supreme Court granted Tarver a temporary
stay of execution to rule on his claim that Alabama's electric
chair is a ''cruel and unusual punishment.'' The court later voted
5-4 not to consider the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Tarver contended that Alabama's ''antiquated'' electric chair
exposed him to a risk of ''excessive burning, disfigurement and ...
pain and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, Tarver shot Russell County store owner
Hugh Kite several times and stole his wallet as Kite was locking
his Cottonton bait shop and grocery for the night. Tarver
maintained his innocence in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Tarver's attorney, Bryan Stevenson of the Montgomery-based Equal
Justice Initiative, also claimed his client was denied a fair trial
because blacks were unfairly excluded from the jury that convicted
him.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Famine Continues  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERRER VALLEY, Ethiopia (AP) -- Nomad Hassan Isman could only
stand and watch while other people's cattle -- thin, but alive --
drank deeply from a mud trough at a rare oasis in eastern Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan, 80, had pushed his family and his cattle for weeks to
reach the Jerrer Valley's muddy watering holes, the only unfailing
water for hundreds of miles around.
</P>
<P>
   The cattle died along the way, one by one, until all were gone
by the time he reached the wells.
</P>
<P>
   By then, it was the turn of his eight children. His 15-year-old
boy died a week ago. Two days ago, it was his 17-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came because of the drought in our area,'' said Hassan, who
has been stranded at the wells for three months. ''There was
absolutely nothing, no grass, no water -- there was no reason to
remain.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past six months, thousands of roaming herders like Hassan
have streamed into the Jerrer Valley, 430 miles southeast of the
Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
   There's no government aid here, nor international relief,
although the U.N. special envoy for the Horn of Africa, Catherine
Bertini, is on a weeklong visit to the region to assess the needs
of the millions threatened by the drought. An estimated 7.7 million
Ethiopians face food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is desperate,'' said Hassan. ''We are all beggars, and
people are dying daily.''
</P>
<P>
   The nomads rely on local people to survive. The scenario
fulfills a fear held by aid agencies: Drought victims overwhelm the
few areas where there is food, water, or both -- straining local
resources to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ''The locals have a problem with these people who come from the
east,'' elder Jama Abraham said. ''We are feeling more pressure
because we have lost our livestock and cannot help. If we could
help, we would, but we can do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Program believes some locals have become so
desperate they are entering refugee camps in the area -- run for
people who escaped fighting in neighboring Somalia -- in search of
food.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst-affected areas is Ethiopia's Somali region,
which includes the Jerrer Valley, where 70 percent of the people
are nomadic herders.
</P>
<P>
   In Addis Ababa on Thursday, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi told
reporters that enough of the 836,800 tons of food that the
government has requested has been pledged to avert disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Meles also said the country's 23-month-old border war with
neighboring Eritrea would not be halted because of the famine.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the government conscripted thousands of local men
for the war effort in June and also took 20,000 sheep and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The eight refugee camps in the region, which provide shelter to
about 166,000 people displaced from neighboring Somalia, receive
regular food from aid organizations while the local Ethiopians in
Jerrer Valley -- 17 miles from a camp, receive nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program says it has yet to fully assess the needs
in the area, and cannot distribute food until it does.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a farmer, but for two years I have done nothing'' because
of the drought, said Mohammed Abdulli, an 80-year-old who tills a
small plot of land nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his three wives died in the last month, Abdulli said; his
5-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son died three days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the people are trying to help each other,'' he said. ''But
there is nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Postal Executives Get $250,000  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Postal Service paid more than $142,000 to
move one of its vice presidents 10 miles and about $106,000 to move
another 30 miles, while both continued to report to work at the
agency's Washington headquarters, a postal spokeswoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives are M. Richard Porras, the chief financial
officer and executive vice president, and John H. Ward, controller
and vice president for finance. Both are advisers to Postmaster
General William J. Henderson and manage the annual budget of more
than $63 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Postal executives moving to new duty assignments usually have to
relocate at least 50 miles to be eligible for a ''relocation
benefit,'' but these two received exceptions after being promoted
in 1998, spokeswoman Judy de Torok said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that it's essential to be able to reward top level
executives,'' she said in an interview. ''We need executives
focused on the priorities and responsibilities of their new jobs
and not concerned with the details of a move.''
</P>
<P>
   The two executives independently negotiated their benefit
packages as a condition of accepting their new positions, de Torok
said. She added that in recent months, several postal officials and
executives had left for better paying jobs in private industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service, a semi-independent part of the government,
does not use taxpayer money to fund its operations.
</P>
<P>
   The executives' benefit packages included $25,000 for each as a
''miscellaneous allowance'' that covers moving fees like new
carpets, curtains or a plumber's bill for hooking up clothes
washers and driers, de Torok said.
</P>
<P>
   Porras' moving benefit included about $12,000 for the
transportation of household goods and storage and about $37,000 for
real estate expenses. Ward's expenses included about $7,000 for
storage and transportation and about $32,000 for real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives said they wanted the relocation benefits
because they were tired of long commutes, The Washington Post
reported in its Friday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Porras moved 10 miles to be closer to a Postal Service training
academy and Washington Dulles International Airport. Ward moved 30
miles and now lives three miles from headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The average relocation of a postal executive costs about
$80,000, de Torok said. The Postal Service moved about 1,200
officials in 1998, with eight officials exempted from the 50-mile
rule.

<HEADLINE> 7 Die in Train Headed for U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By ALEJANDRO RUIZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALENQUE, Mexico (AP) -- For a month, dreams of work, food, homes
and happiness drove 250 Central American migrants on a grueling
journey north toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They stumbled through the rugged mountains of their native lands
and southern Mexico, shivering with hunger, cold, fear and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   When they ran out of money, they got jobs on ranches that paid
$2.50 a day -- enough to buy a few tortillas so they would have the
strength to continue their journey.
</P>
<P>
   But just after crossing the Mexican border Wednesday, their
quest came to a deadly halt.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after climbing into an open train car in a Mexican town
near the Guatemalan border, the car door slammed shut, trapping the
immigrants for more than five hours in temperatures that
immigration officials estimate at more than 122 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Seven died of suffocation and dozens were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all on the edge of death,'' said Ana Deisy Marquez, a
30-year-old El Salvadoran mother of four who attempted the trip
north with her husband, Angel Bustillo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We started screaming, 'We want to get out. We want to get out.
Help us, because we're going to die.' Some became delirious and
others started kicking at people because of the heat in the car,
which was like an oven.''
</P>
<P>
   Salvadoran migrant Jose Ernesto said he and his desperate
companions tried unsuccessfully to beat the doors with axes and
clubs in order to let air into the car, which only had one small
window.
</P>
<P>
   Soon people started to faint. Many believed they would die.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours later, in the Chiapas municipality of Playas de
Catazaja, the dying immigrants were rescued by the most unusual of
saviors: the immigration officials who would later deport them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God they put a car in front of the train to block it,
because if they hadn't we all would have died,'' Marquez said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us in that car felt very close to death,'' said
32-year-old Salvadoran migrant Ramiro Quintero.
</P>
<P>
   When Mexican immigration inspectors opened the train car, two
people had, in fact, died of suffocation, and a third died shortly
after. Two others died at a hospital in Palenque on Wednesday, and
two more on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining migrants were detained in immigration offices
pending deportation to their native countries, immigration
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A separate group of 100 illegal migrants traveling in an open
car of the same train escaped when it stopped. But several of them
later turned themselves in after getting lost and scared,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in an immigration office in this southern Mexican state,
a tearful Marquez recounted the dream that made her decide to take
the risky journey north.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided to go out of need, because of the poverty that we
were experiencing with our four children,'' she said, adding that
she and others spent days and nights endlessly walking, and
suffering from hunger, cold and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's poverty that makes us take these risks,'' added Quintero.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the migrants started their long treks in small groups of
five and 10, joining others they met along the way.
</P>
<P>
   They asked directions from the villagers who also sold them
tortillas and cheese. When their money ran out, they worked on
ranches in Central America and Mexico, said Salvadoran migrant Jose
Ernesto.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, they slept in the mountains. On Wednesday --
exactly a month after their journey began -- a Mexican immigrant
smuggler told them how to get to a train that would take them from
the southern state of Tabasco north to Veracruz state.
</P>
<P>
   From there, some planned to hook up with immigrant smugglers who
could help them get to the United States. Others planned to meet
the smugglers or contact U.S. relatives from the central state of
Puebla. Many of the immigrants already had paid smugglers as much
as $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''This horrible experience killed the illusion'' of going to the
United States, Quintero said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This tragedy left me with a horrible sensation that I can't
describe,'' said 19-year-old Galde Guadalupe Celaya, a migrant from
San Salvador who, five months pregnant, decided to try to reunite
with her family in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a month, I walked many long days and ate very poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the train car, Celaya says she remembers only two things: ''I
lost consciousness and I was worried about the health of the little
one I carry in my womb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was fighting for my little one to give him a better life,
and I was about to lose everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquez said while her initial dream was to escape El Salvador's
poverty and obtain a better life in the United States, ''now I just
thank God that we are alive.''

<HEADLINE> Farming, Global Warming Connected  </HEADLINE>
By LIBBY QUAID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As farm groups gathered on the National Mall
to mark their own version of Earth Day, lawmakers focused on how
farming practices can help prevent global warming.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of scientists from Kansas State University and
other institutions showed simple ways that farming practices soak
up excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere -- which many believe is
responsible for worldwide warming trends.
</P>
<P>
   In one display Thursday, an aluminum tray held tidy rows of
traditionally cultivated corn alongside no-till plantings that are
better for the soil. Crops and other plants absorb carbon both
before harvesting and after, when their residue and roots remain in
the soil.
</P>
<P>
   ''More plants mean more carbon in the soil,'' Kansas State
scientist Chuck Rice said as he held a funnel full of the dark,
dense, rich-looking soil that comes from no-till farming -- planting
a new crop in the stubble of previous crops without cultivating the
land in between -- then picked up a sample of the lighter,
runny-looking soil from traditional tillage practices.
</P>
<P>
   More carbon in the soil, besides keeping greenhouse gases out of
the atmosphere, makes it more fertile and able to retain water
longer, which boosts water quality, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''And you're not using up diesel fuel to plow the soil,'' added
Keith Paustian, a researcher at Colorado State University.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., and Rep. Bob Schaeffer, R-Colo., are
pushing to boost research into so-called carbon sequestration. Even
under the practices used by farmers today, Roberts said, no-till
and abandoned farmland, logged forests and other features are
sucking up as much as 200 million tons of carbon a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''From 1988 to 1992, North American soils, crops, rangeland and
forests took more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than we put
in,'' Roberts told dozens of people gathered for the event.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of conservation practices will be a major part of
the next farm bill, predicted Roberts, an architect of previous
farm laws.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations-sponsored panel predicts that average global
temperatures will rise 2 to 6 degrees in the next 100 years if
current greenhouse gas emissions are not curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts saw firsthand the effects of long-term melting at the
South Pole during a trip with Sen. Ted Stevens, the Alaska
Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. ''It is
warming, there's no question about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kansan and his Senate colleagues are at the heart of a
dispute over what is causing the climate change and what to do
about it. Roberts and other Republicans resist the emissions
reduction pact negotiated in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, with the Clinton
administration's help and support.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts says the Department of Agriculture should be researching
the link between the carbon cycle and such farm practices as
conservation tillage, buffer strips and the Conservation Reserve
Program. The cost of such research projects likely would not exceed
$30 million, the senator's office says.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the issue are environmentalists, who worry
that foes of the Kyoto accord will use the findings to argue that
the United States doesn't need to reduce emissions.

Alabama Killer Executed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATMORE, Ala. (AP) -- A man who murdered a store owner in 1984 was executed in
the electric chair early Friday after failing to win another 11th-hour reprieve.
Robert Lee Tarver Jr., 52, was pronounced dead at 12:11 a.m. Strapped into the
chair, Tarver talked briefly with his guards, then stared straight ahead. Twice,
he turned to look at his victim's children, but did not attempt to communicate
with them. In February, the U.S. Supreme Court granted Tarver a temporary stay
of execution to rule on his claim that Alabama's electric chair is a ''cruel and
unusual punishment.'' The court later voted 5-4 not to consider the issue.

   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's great-uncle defied the government Thursday and
the government blinked, letting its deadline to collect the boy pass and
agreeing to a delay that averts a law-enforcement showdown for now. In Little
Havana, thousands cheered wildly at the news. Attorneys for Elian's Miami
relatives claimed victory after a federal appeals court issued an order blocking
anyone from taking the 6-year-old Cuban boy out of the country. The Justice
Department, though, said it had agreed to a delay of ''three or four days.''

Clinton To Address Indian Concerns

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton promised Thursday night to use the rest
of his time in office and his post-presidential years to do even more to improve
the lives of American Indians. He told Indian donors to the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee that starting next year -- when ''I have more time
to work on fewer things'' -- he would undertake projects relating to economic
development, health care and education. Clinton said the New Market Initiative,
which would encourage investment in economically struggling areas, was an

The measure, which had passed both chambers but in significantly different

Bush Meets Gay Republicans
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush met with a dozen gay Republicans
Thursday as he kept up his courting of support from outside his party's
conservative core. ''I'm a better person for the meeting,'' he declared. The
presumptive GOP presidential nominee assured conservatives his social views were
intact, his opposition to ideas such as gay marriage unshaken by the hourlong
session at his campaign headquarters. The gays he met with, selected by his
campaign, were upbeat. ''The goal was not to change his mind. It was to start a
conversation,'' said Steve Gunderson, a former Republican congressman from
Wisconsin.

Clinton Won't Ask For Pardon

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton heatedly said Thursday ''I'm not

any alleged crimes in the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Whitewater investigation.
But Clinton did not say whether he would accept a pardon if it were offered by
his successor. Republicans immediately pounced on his failure to answer the
question. ''The answer is I have no interest in it. I wouldn't ask for it. I
don't think it would be necessary,'' the president told the convention of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 11, Giants 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Shawn Green had three hits, including his
first home run for Los Angeles as the Dodgers beat San Francisco
11-7 Thursday night to complete a sweep of the Giants' inaugural
home series at Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   The three-game sweep was Los Angeles' first in San Francisco
since April 1981. Earlier Thursday, the Dodgers beat the Giants 6-5
in the completion of a game suspended from the previous night by
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez (1-1) recovered from a poor first outing and
pitched six strong innings for the victory. He gave up three runs
and six hits, struck out three and walked one as the Dodgers won
their fourth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw got the final two outs in the ninth for his fourth
save, and second of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers used five hits, a hit batter and a throwing error to
take a 6-0 lead in the first off Mark Gardner (1-1) to send the
Giants to their fifth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Green and Gary Sheffield had RBI singles, Adrian Beltre a
two-run single, Dave Hansen an RBI double and Chad Kreuter a
run-scoring ground out.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds' two-run homer in the first cut the lead to 6-2, but
Gardner allowed a two-out home run to Green in the second, then
left the with a strained right groin injury. He is listed as
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Benard's first home run of the season cut the deficit to
7-3 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Green singled and scored on Hansen's RBI single off Ben Weber in
the fifth to give the Dodgers an 8-3 lead. They added three more
runs off Weber and Alan Embree in the seventh -- two on Geronimo
Berroa's bases-loaded single and another on Todd Hollandsworth's
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Murray hit his first major league homer for the Giants, a
two-run shot off Onan Masaoka, in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Mirabelli hit a two-run homer off Alan Mills in the ninth
to make it 11-7.
</P>
<P>
   In the completion of the suspended game, Beltre drove in two
runs, 15 hours apart, to lead the Dodgers over the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored three runs in the seventh inning off Weber
(0-1) to erase a one-run deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not to hold leads -- that's frustrating,'' Giants manager Dusty
Baker said. ''We had opportunities. We're not playing bad baseball.
We're just now playing good baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Aurilia homered and drove in three runs for the Giants, who
lost their fourth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams (1-0) pitched 1 2-3 innings of one-hit relief to
earn the victory, and Shaw pitched a scoreless ninth for the save.
</P>
<P>
   ''Terry threw well, and said to me if it rains every other day,
he'll pitch every other day,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Giants have not lost more than five straight games
since the 1996 season. ... Kevin Elster's three-homer game Tuesday
was the first time in baseball history in a player has hit that
many in the opening game of a new ballpark. ... The Dodgers are the
only NL team that has yet to play a home game. ... Gardner's nine
career wins against the Dodgers is his most against any opponent.
He is 9-7 against them. ... Benard singled in the ninth inning of
the suspended game to snap an 0-for-13 slump. ... Giants LHP Shawn
Estes will make a minor league rehab start Monday in Fresno. ...
San Francisco pitchers have allowed 39 runs over the last five
games. Perez's first start was an 11-3 loss in Montreal -- eight
runs, four earned, in 4 2-3 innings. ... Mirabelli's four career
home runs have come against the Dodgers, including two this season.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Public Suspicious of E-Filing  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired nurse Marie Cascio says she may file
her taxes online someday, but like more than a third of Americans
in an Associated Press poll, she's not convinced that it's a good
idea quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think eventually people will be doing it more,'' said the
65-year-old Baltimore resident. ''I think my generation is just
afraid of the Internet. I don't think it's totally secure.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted for The AP by ICR of Media, Pa., found 57
percent say they wouldn't worry about the privacy of their
financial information when filing online, while 36 percent say they
would worry.
</P>
<P>
   Young adults seemed less concerned about the security issue.
With 65 percent of those ages 18 to 34 said they would not worry
about their tax information online, compared with 46 percent of
those 65 and older. One in six of the older Americans said they
simply did not know whether to be worried or not.
</P>
<P>
   The doubters range from people like 71-year-old Jack Hurst of
Los Angeles who says he doesn't know anything about the Internet to
48-year-old Gerhardt Kasper of south Florida who says he knows too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to put it down on paper,'' said Hurst, who is
semi-retired and does not own a computer. ''I don't like to have it
floating around in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasper, manager of a service company who lives in Delray Beach,
Fla., said he isn't convinced that the Internet ''is a secure
platform.'' While he feels the technology isn't fully developed for
secure transmission, he's more worried about human error.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are usually two idiots, one at either end of the line --
the sender and the receiver,'' Kasper said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the number of people filing taxes electronically
is increasing. The Internal Revenue Service says about 30 million,
or one-fourth of tax returns, were filed online last year, and they
expect that to grow by close to 4 million this year, said Steve
Holden, an IRS official who handles electronic tax administration.
In the AP poll, almost one-third of respondents said they expected
to file their tax returns electronically this year, slightly higher
than IRS projections.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still some lingering concerns that are deeply
seated,'' Holden said. ''Not just about e-filing taxes. The
concerns will go down as taxpayers and consumers get more
comfortable with e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 IRS reform law set a goal of 80 percent filing
electronically by 2007, but IRS projections earlier this year said
that only about half of all returns will be filed electronically by
that year.
</P>
<P>
   With the tax deadline approaching Monday, the IRS emphasized
that people who file online have the advantage of getting their
refund in half the time of paper filers and that tax software
catches many errors, making the error rate in online returns far
lower.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the people in the AP poll said they would be more
likely to file returns electronically if it meant they could get
tax refunds quickly, while six of 10 said it would make no
difference. The telephone survey of 1,002 from March 30 to April 5,
had an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   A small but growing number of people are not only filing their
taxes online, but are preparing them through the Internet rather
than on software installed in their desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   It's extremely safe to prepare taxes on desktop software and
then file them electronically, said Robert Sterling, an online
analyst who specializes in financial services.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, it's more of a risk to prepare those tax returns
online, he said, because ''your file is on an Internet-exposed
server, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for weeks or months.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Meighan, vice president of the consumer tax team at Intuit,
a major provider of tax preparation software, said the 1.1 million
tax filers who have already prepared and filed online using the
company's ''Turbotax for the Web'' this year are a testament to the
public's growing comfort with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The online tax industry experienced problems earlier this year
when a programming glitch allowed about two dozen H&AMP;R Block
customers to read other people's financial data. The company said
its system is running fine after repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with online security are more an exception than the
rule, Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They shouldn't be that concerned about it,'' Sterling said.
''It's probably more secure than sending it through the Postal
Service.''

<HEADLINE> D.C. Police Prepare for Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Washington police are waging a battle of wits
with protesters who vow to disrupt meetings of world finance
ministers Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Symbols of the psychological battle were laid out on a
Washington street corner Thursday when Police Chief Charles Ramsey
plunked down on the sidewalk metal and plastic tubes, chains and
chicken wire.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 tubes and other equipment were seized from two
protester vehicles Wednesday night after they were driven from the
Maryland suburbs to the District of Columbia. Ramsey readily
admitted that his officers knew from intelligence operations that
the devices were coming.
</P>
<P>
   From the protester side, the tubes -- dubbed ''lock boxes'' or
''sleeping dragons'' -- represent a new way to keep police from
easily breaking human chain blockades.
</P>
<P>
   Used in protests last December against the World Trade
Organization in Seattle, one demonstrator inserts an arm on each
side and uses a clip to keep the hand inside. The tube is then
wrapped in chicken wire, covered with tar and overlaid with duct
tape. The tape is designed to hide the material underneath, which
in turn is designed to foil any attempt to saw through the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers were happy to show reporters the plain tubes,
but wouldn't describe the covering material. Ramsey and his top
deputies were only too happy to describe the finished device, which
the chief said was ''very effective.'' But Ramsey had yet another
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The department has formed a special unit that includes officers
who are volunteer firefighters. The unit will use equipment that
extricates victims from car wrecks, but police wouldn't be more
specific.
</P>
<P>
   Just yards away from Ramsey, Han Shan, of the Mobilization for
Global Justice, pledged the protests would be nonviolent. He
launched into the demonstrators' now-familiar complaints against
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, the targets of this
week's protests.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters contend the lending institutions impose harsh
repayment penalties on poor countries, prevent spending on social
programs, back projects that destroy the environment and allow
unfair labor practices.
</P>
<P>
   The National Lawyers Guild, a legal group voluntarily helping
the protesters, complained to Attorney General Janet Reno about the
arrests of seven people in the two vehicles carrying the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The area around the World Bank ''resembles an occupied city,''
the group wrote Reno about the heavy police presence in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The police also have been purposely vague about their planned
tactics this weekend. Ramsey wouldn't say whether demonstrators who
blockaded streets would be arrested automatically or allowed to
remain in place -- especially on Sunday, when downtown Washington
traffic is light.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could make thousands (of arrests) but I hope we don't have
to make any,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He warned protesters that ''a lot of these devices are more
dangerous to the individuals than the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have let it be known that they have spent some $1 million
for new helmets, shin guards, gloves and other riot gear and
planned to wear their bulletproof vests.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Assistant Chief Terry Gainer said the chances of
police using tear gas was ''slim and remote,'' but then noted
medical aid stations would be set up to have it flushed from
anyone's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Effective crowd control is more about psychology than brute
force,'' says Robert W. Klotz, a consultant on police crowd control
and a former deputy police chief in Washington. ''There's no
one-size-fits-all method for crowd control.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing for The Washington Post last Sunday, Klotz' theory was
that police must react to patterns of behavior. Most demonstrators
''want a simple show of numbers'' to support their point of view,
he said. Others want to engage in civil disobedience and be
arrested. And some want to do violence and cause injuries, he said,
with each situation requiring its own response.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by The George Washington University, which is near
World Bank headquarters, to close from tonight through Tuesday has
given students the chance to stage their own protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Serve the students, not corporate greed,'' one demonstrator's
sign said.
</P>
<P>
   University spokeswoman Barbara Porter responded, ''We obviously
have a lot of passionate students in this event and we support them
100 percent. But we also have a duty to the safety of all
students.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves $1.83T Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional passage of a $1.83 trillion
budget for next year clears one hurdle for Republicans, but also
signals the start of months of election-year battling with
President Clinton over spending and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   With only a handful of defectors, Republicans pushed their
spending plan through Congress on Thursday. The House approved the
measure by 220-208 and hours later the Senate gave its assent by
50-48.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, which sets Congress' overall tax and spending totals
but leaves details for later, does not need Clinton's signature.
But lawmakers will need his approval for the 13 annual spending
bills for next year they will start writing next month, plus for
any tax legislation they send him.
</P>
<P>
   The budget for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, defines
differences the two parties are certain to spotlight throughout
this year's campaigns for control of the White House and Congress.
Republicans would use much of the surplus from non-Social Security
programs for tax cuts, while Democrats want a smaller tax reduction
and more spending for domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the American Society of Newspaper Editors that the
GOP plan ''is loaded with exploding tax breaks and untenable cuts
in critical investments. It will take us back to an approach that
failed before and will fail again, back to ideas that didn't work
before and won't work now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., said the GOP plan ''puts us on
track for another appropriations train wreck in September,'' using
the technical term for spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were equally scornful of the Democratic approach.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP favors tax cuts, said Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., because ''If we don't do it pretty soon,
there will be no surplus left over to the taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., said the Republican budget plans a
prudent mix of tax cuts, debt reduction and spending on education
and other priorities ''without returning to the bad old days of
spending for today without any eye to the future at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Six Democrats and five Republicans defected in the House. GOP
Sens. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of Vermont,
John McCain of Arizona and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania voted
''no,'' while Sens. William Roth, R-Del., and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   Completion of the budget marked the second straight year
Congress had done so by the April 15 deadline. The date is usually
ignored, but the quick action illustrates how GOP leaders are
determined to adjourn Congress early for re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides would use the $1 trillion in expected Social Security
surpluses over the next five years to reduce the $3.6 trillion
publicly held debt, with the goal of eliminating it by 2013. The
rest of the $5.7 trillion national debt is money the government
owes Social Security and other federal trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists say such a dramatic reduction of the publicly
held debt would press interest rates downward and boost the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would use much of the rest of the surplus for a tax
cut of at least $150 billion and perhaps exceeding $200 billion,
depending on lawmakers' decisions and how much economic growth
occurs over the next few months. Democrats want a smaller tax
reduction, with more money set aside for domestic programs and debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican budget would set aside up to $40 billion over
five years for any new prescription drug benefits that lawmakers
add to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But action is not required, and the money could be used for
other changes, such as easing cuts in Medicare reimbursements to
many hospitals enacted in the 1997 budget-balancing deal.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties say they want to enact a prescription program this
year. Clinton wants it to cover all elderly Americans, while
Republicans want to limit it to lower-income people or those with
extremely high drug bills.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also calls for $311 billion for defense next year, $5
billion more than Clinton wants. And it would spend $289 billion
for domestic programs, about $30 billion less than Clinton seeks.
</P>
<P>
   Included would be increases for education, veterans and
biomedical research, though final decisions will be made in later
spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two-thirds of the budget covers interest payments
on the debt, plus benefits such as Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The measure approved Thursday was a House-Senate compromise of
similar budgets each chamber had passed earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In a symbolic victory for environmentalists, the compromise
dropped nonbinding language assuming that some money would be
raised by allowing oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge.

<HEADLINE> Senate Battles Over Marriage Tax  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a symbolic week of tax votes, senators
are leaving town for a 10-day break without passing a tax cut for
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The House, meanwhile, approved a bill scrapping the entire tax
code by the end of 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Congress kept the focus on taxes during the
final week before the annual income tax filing deadline, which is
midnight Monday this year for most people because the traditional
April 15 date falls on a Saturday. Lawmakers then left for a spring
recess.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are again demonstrating to the American people: 'We are on
your side,''' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   By a 229-187 vote Thursday, the House passed a bill that would
scrap the federal tax code on Dec. 31, 2004, and set up a
commission that would set about finding an unspecified replacement
tax system by July 4, 2004. The measure goes to the Senate, where
it faces an uncertain future at best.
</P>
<P>
   But it gave House Republicans a chance to rail against the
complexity and unfairness of tax laws and against the Internal
Revenue Service, a favorite target especially during the income tax
filing finale.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes it takes something radical to make changes,'' said
the prime sponsor, Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla. ''It's time. We need
to just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   While they didn't defend the current tax code, Democrats claimed
that Republicans want to replace the income tax with a national
sales tax that would hit poorer people the hardest and unwisely
impose a tax on goods and services sold over the Internet,
prescription drugs, clothes and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going to pull something out by its roots, you have
to plant thoughtful seeds to take its place,'' said Rep. Anna
Eshoo, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans came up seven votes short of the 60
needed to cut off debate and proceed to the so-called ''marriage
penalty'' bill. The 53-45 vote forced GOP leaders to shelve the
measure for now, but Democrats support the concept and agreed it
would likely be brought up for debate later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not dead,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. ''All they
wanted was a political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said Democrats brought on the delay by insisting
on political points of their own by trying to offer amendments on
issues not directly related to the tax bill, such as a Medicare
prescription drug benefit and tax credits for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democrats are obstructing this legislation like in-laws
involved in your honeymoon,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the marriage penalty has broad support across the
political spectrum, but Democrats and Republicans disagree on how
to do it and how much of the projected budget surplus it should
consume.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate GOP bill would gradually reduce taxes by $248 billion
over 10 years for married couples at all income levels, removing
the penalty now paid by 25 million two-earner households compared
with single people. The bill would also cut taxes for couples who
receive a bonus because one spouse earns more than the other and
would also permanently ensure that all couples who claim personal
credits, such as the $500 per-child tax credit, don't lose them to
the alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   The House earlier this year passed a 10-year, $182 billion
version and President Clinton has proposed fixing the marriage
penalty for couples who take the standard tax deduction at a cost
of $45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty tax bill is H.R. 6. The bill to eliminate
the IRS is H.R. 4199.

<HEADLINE> New Hepatitis C Clue Found  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists studying why some people recover
from hepatitis C and others become chronically ill have found a
clue that may help predict how things will go for individual
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The difference seems to be that patients whose infection evolves
into many variations of the virus become chronically ill, while
those in whom few changes are seen recover.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding how this works could lead to new ways to fight the
disease, which is a major cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and
kills 8,000 to 10,000 Americans annually.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is something at play in earliest stages of infection
where you can really see the destiny of the patients,'' said Dr.
Patrizia Farci of the University of Caligari in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported in today's issue of the journal
Science.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said ''this research helps to
explain how the virus manages to persist in the body and provides
physicians with a potential way to predict the development of a
chronic infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many viruses, the one that causes hepatitis can change
rapidly, altering the proteins on its surface that the body's
immune system uses to identify it for attack.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of people infected with hepatitis C recover
from the disease, while the rest tend to develop a chronic
infection, Farci explained. In many victims the disease persists
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Farci, who has been doing research at the National Institute of
Health here, said her team studied the changing forms, or
evolution, of the virus in infected patients.
</P>
<P>
   This became evident in the first 10 to 12 weeks after infection,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Her research team theorized that the patients who are able to
recover from the disease have more effective immune responses,
which reduce the genetic diversity of the virus by gradually
eliminating it, one form after another, until it is cleared from
the system.
</P>
<P>
   In patients with a less effective system the virus can evolve
into many different forms, making it even harder for the body to
battle, establishing a chronic infection and in some cases an acute
form of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Army To Battle Corruption  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's army rulers made many
promises when they took power last year, but the one that that had
people dancing in the streets was their pledge to root out
corruption and recover billions of dollars in stolen state wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Army leaders say corruption has leached as much as $30 billion
from Pakistan, three times its annual budget. Billions of dollars
more is outstanding in loans to national banks.
</P>
<P>
   Given the job of sifting through mountains of files and
traveling to Switzerland and Britain for proof of wrongdoing by
former leaders was the army government's chief prosecutor, Farooq
Adam.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a massive job,'' he says, sitting behind a desk cluttered
with files, the vast majority of them marked ''most immediate.''
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is endemic in this nation of 140 million people where
the average income is about $400 a year. The leaders who dominated
the last decade of Pakistani politics -- Nawaz Sharif and Benazir
Bhutto -- both have been implicated in corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
   The army leaders who deposed Sharif in October have filed
several corruption cases against him.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Sharif's family business owes millions of
dollars to banks at home and abroad. Authorities say the former
prime minister has taken hundreds of millions of dollars from the
state through commissions and business deals.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, recently sentenced to life in prison on a hijacking and
terrorism conviction, built a sprawling marble palace outside his
hometown of Lahore. Government documents show he had the public
works department build a road, installed 600 telephone lines and
provided it with uninterrupted power supplies. He purchased dozens
of luxury vehicles and a helicopter -- all with government money.
</P>
<P>
   Adam, a former army major, spent five years in jail for plotting
a coup in the 1970s with fellow officers also frustrated over the
level of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were such innocents then. It was nothing like it is
today,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Adam says the level of corruption now is ''obscene.'' And the
job of tackling it onerous and fraught with difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our directive is to clean out the system as much as possible
to enable a genuine democratic order to develop,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But people are impatient, and the euphoria that greeted the army
takeover has given way to frustration at the slow pace of the
cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want democracy now,'' says Raja Riaz, a storeowner in
Lahore. ''We want the army to get rid of all the corrupt people,
only then can anything change here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Mohammed Amjad, who heads the National Accountability
Bureau, told Pakistan's monthly magazine Newsline that the problem
is twofold: a lack of expertise in investigating white-collar crime
and a cash economy where transactions are conducted without
receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is that we are in a no-win situation. When we go
slowly, which we are deliberately doing, people become impatient,''
said Amjad. ''And if we start arresting people, the same people
turn around and say that we are doing so indiscriminately,
blindly.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups in Pakistan say the National Accountability
Bureau has trampled on basic rights, citing a harsh anti-corruption
law, crafted in large part by Adam, giving the accountability
bureau the authority to arrest and detain a person for 90 days
without charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm the first one to admit that this is a tough law, even
draconian, but in our opinion and given the circumstances we are
confronted with we need this law,'' Adam said.
</P>
<P>
   Proving corruption is a tricky task in Pakistan, where
influence, status and family name often combine to stifle police
investigations, frighten would-be informants and ensure a hasty
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   When a case does reach the court it is generally accompanied by
cries of political victimization.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have gone out of our way and I have personally gone though
hundreds of files and discarded any case I thought was politically
motivated,'' Adam said. ''The fact is we are not here to send any
messages, we are here to try to clean up the system to allow for
genuine democratic rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Pakistan's highest-profile allegations have been leveled
against Ms. Bhutto, who was twice elected prime minister and twice
dismissed on charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive investigations and mountains of documents say Bhutto,
her jailed husband Asif Ali Zardari and other family members and
colleagues stole as much as $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A Pakistani court found Ms. Bhutto and her husband guilty of
taking kickbacks from a Swiss company and its subsidiary and
sentenced them to five years in jail, disqualified them from
politics and ordered them to pay more than $800 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bhutto says the documents in the case were fabricated and
she is appealing. Adam says the evidence is overwhelming and he
expects to win the appeal.

<HEADLINE> Canada Fires Help Pollute U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fires in northwestern Canada caused a jump in
air pollution as far away as Nashville, Tenn., a team of
researchers has discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''For certain periods of time, the northern high-latitude fires
were the biggest source of the carbon monoxide pollution in the
eastern U.S. region we studied,'' said Gerhard Wotawa of the
University of Agricultural Sciences in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Wotawa and Michael Trainer of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's Aeronomy Laboratory in Boulder, Colo.,
studied U.S. air pollution during the summer of 1995. Their
findings are reported in today's issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Canada long has criticized the United States, contending that
pollution from factories in the central and eastern states flows
north.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Environment Minister David Anderson has estimated that
as much as half of Canada's air pollution can be traced to U.S.
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The new study shows that, at least in the summer of 1995,
Canadian forest fires were the largest source of carbon monoxide
and ozone pollution in the eastern U.S., more than 2,000 miles from
the source.
</P>
<P>
   Forest fires often occur naturally in remote high-latitude
areas, usually caused by lightning. During 1995 they burned over 17
million acres in Canada, an area half the size of the state of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Wotawa and Trainer centered their study in Nashville, Tenn.,
collecting data covering several nearby states.
</P>
<P>
   They traced the winds backward and found that high periods of
carbon monoxide in the region occurred in air that had originated
during specific forest fire episodes in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that carbon monoxide levels were nearly
doubled when the plumes of the forest fires passed through the
region. Sometimes, higher ozone concentrations also accompanied the
plumes. The researchers used additional data to show that the
influence reached air quality monitoring stations in Maryland and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The summer of 1995 was one of the hottest on record in the
eastern U.S., and the forest fires added to air pollution levels
that were already quite high.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers added that similar situations were reported in
1981, 1989 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> NATO Seeks More Troops in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO has decided against expanding the size of
its peacekeeping force in Kosovo but has asked member countries for
about 3,500 troops to fill existing and anticipated gaps in the
force.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing whether the peacekeeping force known as the
Kosovo Force, or KFOR, was sized properly for the mission, 10
months after it began, NATO authorities affirmed that the current
number of 39,000 troops was about right, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon said Thursday. That includes about 5,900 American troops.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that NATO might add more forces
because of recent episodes of ethnic violence in the
French-controlled sector of Kosovo and trouble with bands of ethnic
Albanian rebels in the Presevo Valley in southern Yugoslavia, which
borders the American-patrolled sector of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Instead NATO decided that it can manage so long as current and
coming gaps are filled, Bacon said. The NATO analysis said a
Canadian and a Dutch battalion that are about to leave Kosovo
should be replaced, and a French and an Italian battalion that are
in Kosovo on temporary duty also need to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also concluded that a ''swing battalion'' that was supposed
to be in Kosovo as a reserve force -- but which never was deployed --
should be filled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The size of a battalion varies by nation but is generally in the
vicinity of 700 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, NATO has asked member countries to provide five
battalions, or approximately 3,500 troops, although the only
battalion that would add to the total of troops in Kosovo would be
the ''swing battalion.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters were sent this week to NATO capitals asking for
contributions to fill the five battalions. He said it was ''highly
unlikely'' the United States would contribute, since none of the
battalions are earmarked for deployment in the U.S.-controlled
sector of southeastern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Independent of the NATO study on troop requirements, the United
States announced two weeks ago that it intends to send an extra 125
infantry soldiers to conduct long-range reconnaissance in the
Presevo Valley area, as well as 14 tanks and six Paladin artillery
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the reconnaissance company would arrive by the end of
April and the tanks and artillery would arrive at Camp Able Sentry,
in nearby Skopje, Macedonia, in the next few days.

<HEADLINE> Carter May Get Congressional Medal  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It has gone to Frank Sinatra, Rosa Parks, Walt
Disney and Roberto Clemente. But Congress has rarely bestowed the
nation's top civilian award on a president.
</P>
<P>
   Two congressmen introduced a bill Thursday that would add Jimmy
and Rosalynn Carter to the elite club of Congressional Gold Medal
recipients, less than two weeks after the House approved the honor
for Ronald and Nancy Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   If Reagan and Carter are approved, three of the last four former
presidents will be medal recipients; Gerald Ford and his wife,
Betty, received the award last year. Of the previous 37 presidents,
only six were so honored.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't look at it in terms of how many presidents have or
haven't received it,'' said Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga., one of two
co-sponsors of the Carter bill. ''I looked at it in terms of
tremendous contributions the individual has made and is making.
Measured by almost any standard, the Carters are worthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop represents Georgia's 2nd congressional district, where
the Carters still own their Plains home. He and California Democrat
Brad Sherman are the primary co-authors of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawmakers say it's Carter's humanitarian efforts, even more
than his presidential accomplishments, that prompted the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The former president and his wife established the Carter Center
in 1982. In recent years, it has monitored elections in Third World
countries to make sure they're held peacefully and worked to
eradicate little-known diseases that affect some of the world's
poorest people.
</P>
<P>
   The Carters also spend a week each June building homes for
Habitat for Humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to be recognized for their efforts, but I think the
Carters would rather be out there doing things than sitting around
talking about it,'' said Carrie Harmon, spokeswoman for the Carter
Center. She said the Carters haven't been notified about the
pending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other presidents who have received the Congressional
Gold Medal also were honored for their work outside the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington, the first of about 300 recipients of the
award, received his in 1776 for his courage in the revolution.
Although Ulysses S. Grant rarely places high among historians'
rankings of presidents, his leadership in the Civil War earned him
a gold medal in 1863.
</P>
<P>
   Wartime heroics also prompted the award for presidents Andrew
Jackson, Zachary Taylor and William Henry Harrison. And Harry
Truman received it for his lifetime of service.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Bird Johnson received the award, but not her husband,
President Lyndon Johnson. Former Sen. Robert Kennedy also was
honored, but not his brother, President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Gold Medal is often confused with the Medal of
Honor, which is established by the armed forces. Both houses of
Congress must approve a gold medal, and a recipient must either be
living or not deceased for more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among those most recently honored are Mother Teresa, civil
rights pioneer Rosa Parks and Cardinal John O'Connor. An award for
the late Peanuts comic strip producer, Charles Schulz, is pending
in Congress.

<HEADLINE> FCC Turns Slamming To States  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under new rules adopted by the Federal
Communications Commission, state regulators will have the power to
pursue unscrupulous long-distance phone companies that illegally
switch people's service without their permission.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC adopted rules to combat the practice known as slamming
two years ago, but MCI WorldCom challenged the rules in court,
saying it wanted the commission to consider an industry plan to
address the problem. A judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia granted the company's request and issued a
stay to suspend the rules that had only been in place a month.
</P>
<P>
   But industry officials apparently never reached a consensus on a
plan, so the FCC decided Thursday that state regulators,
represented by the National Association of Regulatory Utility
Commissions, could act to enforce rules against slamming.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the FCC has received 80,000 complaints about
the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers feel a real sense of violation when they are
slammed,'' FCC Chairman William Kennard said. ''American consumers
... are entitled to have their long-distance carrier of choice
respected.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom spokeswoman Julie Moore said company officials had
not yet had a chance to review the decision and wouldn't make any
decisions regarding future legal action until they do.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always maintained that the investigation and resolution
of slamming complaints should require an objective decision maker
and standardized rules,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that, should the FCC's rules come to fruition, ''We
hope the states will work together to standardize their
implementation of these rules.''

   NARUC, which represents state regulators, said 35 state
regulatory commissions have volunteered to enforce anti-slamming
rules and more are expected to do so. The FCC will handle cases
where states haven't taken the enforcement role, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the FCC reaffirmed that, when a consumer has
not paid the slamming company, the customer is absolved of paying
for service for up to 30 days after being slammed. When a consumer
has paid the slammer, the company must pay 150 percent of the money
it received from the customer to the authorized carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The authorized carrier will in turn refund 50 percent of the
charges to the customer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The absolution rules and repayment remedies contained in this
order completely take the profit out of slamming,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has fined slammers more than $4.3 million in recent
months and signed consent decrees to prevent future wrongdoing.
Kennard asked his staff to begin compiling a list of the most
egregious offenders and to publicize the company names.

<HEADLINE> House Ups School Safety Spending  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If schools getting money for after-school
centers prefer to spend it on metal detectors and counselors, they
can do just that under a new proposal by House lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   A $2.4 billion federal grants program gives schools the
flexibility they want and need, say Republicans on the House
Education and the Workforce Committee, who approved the legislation
25-21 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats -- who lost several attempts to keep the
school-safety grants from dipping into Clinton administration
favorites such as class-size reduction, school construction and
classroom technology -- give the bill a flunking grade.
</P>
<P>
   ''It (the bill) torpedoes after-school and summer extended
learning programs that boost test scores and reduce crime,'' said
Rep. William L. Clay of Missouri, the top committee Democrat. He
has promised to fight it when all House lawmakers consider the
grants next month as part of its work on the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats oppose the safety-grants plan because it abolishes an
education program aimed specifically to prevent hate crimes and
allows religious organizations offering safety and drug-prevention
programs to hire staff based on church membership.
</P>
<P>
   The measure continues the Gun-Free Schools Act, which requires
schools to punish all students caught with guns.The approaching
anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings often fueled
tensions for the lawmakers examining school safety for the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., failed to get her colleagues to
include trigger locks for guns in the bill, though they accepted
proposals that allow school districts to use grants to promote
child safety locks.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are going to expel students from schools for having
guns, then we should educate children and parents about the
importance of using child safety locks,'' said McCarthy, whose
husband was killed by a gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., whose district includes Littleton,
the site of the 14 killings by two teen gunmen, chastised lawmakers
who he said ''trivialized Columbine'' by using it to push ideas
such as computer grants.
</P>
<P>
   The real deal-breaker for the anti-voucher Clinton
administration was kept out of the bill. The plan by Rep. Pete
Hoekstra, R-Mich., would have allowed some of the money to be given
to parents for private schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., committee chairman, said this latest
round of education lawmaking continues the GOP mission of making
federal grant programs flexible because it ''puts the priority on
children rather than federal regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The education bill is H.R. 4141.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Anthrax Program Ripped  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Twenty-eight months after Defense Secretary
William Cohen announced an ambitious program to immunize all 2.4
million service members against deadly anthrax, only about 420,000
have received the six-shot series.
</P>
<P>
   And supplies of the vaccine could run out as early as July as a
result of persistent problems faced by the nation's only
manufacturer of the vaccine, the General Accounting Office says.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO, an investigatory and auditing branch of Congress,
reported Thursday that the fundamental requirement of the program --
maintaining an adequate supply of vaccine -- has ''not yet been
met.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The optimism at the start of this program was overstated,''
Carole R. Schuster, associate GAO director for national security
preparedness, told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Schuster said that stockpiled supplies of the vaccine are
running low.
</P>
<P>
   Bioport Corp., the Lansing, Mich., drug manufacturer, was shut
down for 17 months for renovations and is not expected to win FDA
approval to produce more vaccine ''until late 2000'' at the
earliest, she said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pentagon insists the vaccine is safe, more than 300
service members have refused the mandatory inoculations, citing
health concerns. Some objectors have been prosecuted and others
have quit.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members told a panel of Pentagon officials they've
been besieged with complaints about the program from service
members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is substantial and justified criticism surrounding this
program,'' said Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. She noted that even Vice
President Al Gore had is expressing second thoughts. Gore has
called for ''a closer look'' into whether mandatory inoculation
should continue for all troops.
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon officials urged Congress not to abandon the
program, claiming it is still necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Lowell Jacoby, director of the Defense Intelligence
Agency, said U.S. forces ''face a growing possibility of exposure
to biological agents in situations over a wide range of
contingencies.''
</P>
<P>
   And Anthrax, almost 100 percent fatal when its spores are
inhaled without immunization, has become ''the leading biological
warfare threat agent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 12 nations have or are developing a biological
warfare capability, including Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, North
Korea, Russia and China, Jacoby said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, ''anthrax is also a potential terrorist weapon
because of its relative ease of production,'' said Jacoby.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials told the committee that no other
pharmaceutical company wants to manufacture the vaccine -- and that
even a crash program to get another supplier could take seven to 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   However, they conceded having misjudged the cost and popularity
of the program and the availability of the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been behind the ball'' in educating the military on
the safety of the vaccine and its necessity, said Deputy Defense
Secretary Rudy deLeon.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., said he supported the
program, although told the Pentagon officials that ''legitimate
questions'' were being raised within the military both on the
safety and the effectiveness of the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Schuster, the GAO official, testified that at the present rate,
supplies of the vaccine could be exhausted by July.
</P>
<P>
   Further, she testified, ''there are some gaps in the research,''
noting that most of the studies on the effect of the vaccine dated
from the 1950s and 1960s.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Ebihara Leads PGA Seniors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) -- Japan's Seiji Ebihara was
surprised to get an invitation to play at the PGA Seniors'
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't expect to shoot under par, and he certainly didn't
envision being atop the leaderboard after the first day.
</P>
<P>
   Ebihara shot a 4-under-par 68 in Thursday's suspended first
round of the PGA Seniors' Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two players were unable to complete the round because of
darkness after the threat of lightning interrupted play twice for a
total of 2 hours, 57 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It had little effect on Ebihara, a 51-year-old regular on the
Japan's Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in only his third event in the United States, Ebihara
had three birdies and a bogey on each nine. One bogey came at the
par-4 8th when he missed the green with his second shot, his first
stroke after the initial rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the course the second time, he sank a putt
of about 6 feet to save par at No. 12. He holed a 25-foot chip from
behind the 16th green for his final birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got here Sunday, played three practice rounds and I never
expected to shoot under par. This is a very difficult golf
course,'' Ebihara said through an interpreter. ''I would like to
play some more tournaments. If not, I will go back to Japan next
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Tewell, playing his first full season on the Senior PGA
Tour, was 4 under through 15 holes on PGA National's Champion
course.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Green, the 1977 U.S. Open winner and 1985 PGA champion,
was a stroke back, along with Gibby Gilbert and Dana Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   Green and Gilbert played bogey-free golf with three birdies.
Quigley, playing for the 87th consecutive week and the 100th
straight tournament in which he has been eligible, made four
birdies and a bogey, all on the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's Christy O'Connor Jr., was 3 under through 12.
</P>
<P>
   Hale Irwin, seeking his fourth victory in the tournament in five
years, and Larry Nelson, the 1987 PGA winner at PGA National,
topped a six-player group at 70.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Allen Doyle was still on the course when
darkness halted play. He was 1 under through 12 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson and Lee Trevino shot 72s, Lanny Wadkins and Gary
Player shot 75s and Bruce Fleisher had a 77.
</P>
<P>
   When 36 holes are completed, likely Saturday morning, the field
will be cut to the low 70 and ties.

<HEADLINE> Terrorism Victims Appeal For Help  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is opposing
legislation to make it easier for victims of terrorism to collect
multimillion court judgments by seizing frozen assets of nations
that sponsored the terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, championed by a group of former hostages and
families of terrorism victims, could ''cause the United States to
violate international obligations'' said Deputy Treasury Secretary
Stuart Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement to a House Judiciary subcommittee,
Eizenstat said Thursday that the bill could subject U.S. property
abroad to possible retaliatory confiscation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton administration has continued to object to every
practical proposal we have made,'' complained former hostage Terry
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, the former chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is attempting to collect a $341 million federal
court award against Iran he received last month.
</P>
<P>
   His is one of a growing number of judgments awarded by U.S.
courts to former hostages and families of terrorism victims under a
1996 law that permits such lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   However, none of the winning plaintiffs has been able to collect
-- largely because the Clinton administration has blocked their
attempts to tap into frozen assets of countries, including those of
Iran and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department ''has obstructed us every step of the
way,'' said Maggie Alejandre Khuly, whose brother, Armando
Alejandre, was one of four pilots killed in February 1996 when
their small planes were shot down by Cuban fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Khuly and other family members won a $187.6 million judgment
against Cuba in December 1997 that they have been unable to
collect.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got hit over the head with a hammer'' by the administration
when attempting to collect a $247 million judgment against Iran,
Stephen Flatow of West Orange, N.J., testified.
</P>
<P>
   Flatow's 20-year-old daughter, Alisa, was killed in a 1995
bombing in Israel while there as a college student.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Anderson was held in Lebanon and Flatow's daughter
killed in Israel, both have accused Iran of sponsoring the
terrorism that led to their ordeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Iranians are still in the terror business and our own
government has the dubious distinction of keeping them in it,''
Flatow testified.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, his wife and daughter won their judgment last month
from U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson after Iran failed
to show up for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson later had Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers served
with papers seeking to obtain $41 million of the overall judgment --
representing compensatory damages -- from a fund containing frozen
Iranian assets.
</P>
<P>
   The fund contains money Iran paid for U.S. arms in the 1970s but
never received.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, currently a journalism professor at Ohio University,
said administration officials seemed sympathetic -- until Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright invited Iran to enter a ''new
relationship'' with the United States last month.
</P>
<P>
   The overture came after Iranian moderates gained seats in
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Phone calls were not returned, meetings were not held,''
Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was held for 2,454 days, the longest of the captives in
Lebanon. He was abducted at gunpoint in March 1985 and released in
December 1991.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a bill that would limit the administration's ability
to block such judgments. It is sponsored by Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., in the House and by Sens. Connie Mack, R-Fla., and Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time to send a strong message to terrorists and their
state sponsors that they cannot get away with murder,'' said
McCollum.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 3485.

<HEADLINE> USDA Offers Conservation Incentive  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration hopes some extra
cash will revive farmers' interest in a land-idling program that's
designed to curb runoff into lakes and streams.
</P>
<P>
   Just over 1 million acres is enrolled through the program, well
short of the administration's goal of reaching 4 million acres by
2002. The Agriculture Department announced Thursday it would offer
signing bonuses and other incentives totaling $350 million to
encourage more producers to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   The program, created in 1996, is restricted to strips of land
along waterways.
</P>
<P>
   ''Higher payments should persuade more landowners to
participate, protecting ever more environmentally sensitive land
along streams, rivers, wetlands and public water supplies,''
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the program has been relatively low because many
farmers didn't feel it paid enough to compensate them for the loss
of crop and pastureland, officials say. The land must be kept out
of production for 10 to 15 years and planted to grass or trees.
Farmers receive an annual payment in return, which averages about
$80 to $120 an acre in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers will be offered an upfront bonus of $100 to $150 an
acre, depending on how long the land is to be idled, and the
Agriculture Department is going to pay more of the cost of planting
cover. USDA also is raising the annual rates for pastureland
enrolled in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may help, but that really remains to be seen whether it's
going to be a sufficient incentive to increase signup,'' said
Rosemarie Watkins of the American Farm Bureau Federation.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the land now enrolled in the program is in four
states: Illinois, Iowa, Montana and South Dakota. The program is
part of the larger Conservation Reserve Program, under which 31.4
million acres of farmland are idled nationwide at a cost of $1.3
billion a year. It's known as the ''continuous signup'' portion of
CRP because farmers can enroll at any time
</P>
<P>
   The incentive money is part of a proposal by the Clinton
administration to increase spending on farm conservation programs
by $2.7 billion over the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Addresses Nation's Editors  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Asked by newspaper editors, President Clinton
turned aside the idea of seeking a pardon for any alleged crime in
the Monica Lewinsky and Whitewater investigations. ''I have no
interest in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did not say unequivocally Thursday that he would
decline a pardon if Vice President Al Gore is elected and offers
it. Republicans seized upon the loophole as proof of Democratic
duplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, Clintonian speak rears its ugly head,'' said
Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson. He called the
matter ''the question of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   During a question-and-answer session at the American Society of
Newspaper Editors annual meeting, Clinton spoke emotionally about
the impact of his affair with Monica Lewinsky -- and the impeachment
that it spawned. He said he did not want a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't ask for it. I don't think it would be necessary,''
the president said. ''I won't be surprised by anything that
happens, but I'm not interested in being pardoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart sharply criticized the
editors for their questions -- limited to four by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are purportedly reasonably intelligent people but I
think it demonstrates just how isolated some newspaper editors are
from the rest of the country,'' Lockhart said. ''They get a chance
to ask the president about anything, any challenges that face
America and ... the best they can come up with is two questions
about impeachment. The country has moved past this. Unfortunately
many major newspaper editors haven't. It may be some reason for
declining circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   In reply, N. Christian Anderson III, ASNE president and
publisher-chief executive officer of The Orange County Register,
expressed regret that the White House limited the number of
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''All four questions were thoughtful and concerned issues that
are on the minds of many Americans represented by newspaper editors
who are much closer to their communities than Mr. Lockhart might
imagine,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   A pardon was a subject Clinton has never directly addressed.
Former White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff told the House
impeachment hearings in 1998 that Clinton would not pardon himself
nor accept a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in what his office said was a reference to Ruff's comment,
repeated that assertion in an appearance before the editors
Wednesday. The GOP's Nicholson accused Gore of distorting events by
saying Clinton had stated his position about possible pardons when
Clinton, in fact, had not.
</P>
<P>
   ''Surprise, surprise, Al Gore is twisting the truth,'' Nicholson
said. ''This is just another example of why Al Gore's credibility
is shot and why he can never be trusted with the presidency of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remains under a legal cloud despite being acquitted of
perjury and obstruction of justice charges by the Senate last year
after his impeachment by the House. Independent Counsel Robert Ray,
who succeeded Kenneth Starr in the investigation of the Whitewater
and Lewinsky cases, has said he is weighing whether to indict
Clinton after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   It clearly irked Clinton to have this embarrassing issue arise
after a speech in which he boasted about the nation's booming
economy and criticized the Republicans' $1.83 trillion budget as
''loaded with exploding tax breaks and untenable cuts in critical
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the Whitewater investigation ''a lie and a fraud from
the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has written the full story yet,'' he said, adding, ''I
can imagine why you wouldn't, particularly given the way a lot of
this has been covered.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've paid quite a lot,'' Clinton said. ''I struggled very hard
to save my relationship with my wife and my daughter. ... I made a
terrible mistake of which I am deeply regretful. But I think that
the average, ordinary person reviewing the wreckage left in that
would say that I paid for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ended with a curt ''Next question'' -- only to be asked
whether he would devote a section of his presidential library to
the impeachment saga.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have to deal with it, it's an important part of it,''
Clinton said. ''But I have a slightly different take on it than
many of you do, or at least in the Washington media does. ... I am
proud of what we did there because I think we saved the
Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not ashamed of the fact that they impeached me,'' the
president said. ''That was their (Republicans') decision, not mine.
And it was wrong. As a matter of law, the Constitution and history,
it was wrong. And I am glad I didn't quit.''

<HEADLINE> LPGA Course Yields Low Scores  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Calif. (AP) -- A course that typically frustrates many
golfers was a bit more forgiving in the opening round of the Longs
Drugs Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Co-leaders Cindy Figg-Currier and Rachel Hetherington shot
6-under-par 66s at Twelve Bridges Golf Club to lead the tournament
by one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when Juli Inkster won with an 8-under total, only 10
golfers broke par over four rounds. Being pushed back two weeks on
the LPGA schedule has made the course drier and the weather more
agreeable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had heard they had good weather here and you can tell
because the course and the greens are in great shape,''
Hetherington said. ''The fairways are terrific and so are the
greens.''
</P>
<P>
   A tricky wind that gusted to 22 mph in the afternoon made the
course more difficult. There were 21 golfers who broke par, most of
them benefiting from morning tee times. Rain the night before
softened the greens and the winds were only a minor factor early
on.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greens were rolling nice in the morning, but they can get
quick,'' Figg-Currier said. ''I expected to play in a downpour. We
got a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Figg-Currier, who was also tied for the first-round lead a year
ago after shooting a 68, played in the first group of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Following a par at No. 1, Figg-Currier birdied the next three
holes. She finished with seven birdies and a lone bogey on No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Teeing off about two hours later, Hetherington also birdied Nos.
2 through 4. The Australian-born Hetherington caught Figg-Currier
with the last of six birdies at No. 16, making an eight-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   One shot behind the leaders was Michelle Bell, who had to take
the last three years off due to a serious problem with her immune
system. In the first morning group off the back nine, Bell had six
birdies. Her only bogey came when she landed in the lip of a bunker
on No. 16 and two-putted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The course played a lot longer than it did in the pro-am and
practice rounds,'' Bell said. ''The advantage was that the greens
held. You could really fire at the pins.''
</P>
<P>
   In a group at 69 were Brandie Burton, Jill McGill, Cristie Kerr,
Mhairi McKay and Carin Koch, who finished second in the 1998 Longs
Drugs Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Juli Inkster and Se Ri Pak both shot 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam rallied after playing the front side 1 over.
She recorded her first birdie at No. 10 and rolled in a 25-foot
putt on the par-5 12th for an eagle. She finished with a 71,
getting her round going after she and her caddy scared a wild
turkey off the 10th green.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a lucky turkey, I wish I hadn't scared it away,'' said
Sorenstam, who made a long birdie after the turkey departed.
</P>
<P>
   Divots: Colleen Walker injured her hand and dropped out of the
tournament after playing eight holes. ... Two Hall of Fame golfers
struggled: Pat Bradley had a 76 and Patty Sheehan shot a 77.

<HEADLINE> Players Battle Cold at Harbour Town  </HEADLINE>
By PETE IACOBELLI, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -- Dan Forsman faced his toughest
critics at home. So Harbour Town was no problem.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old, who hasn't won since the 1992 Buick Open, had
to listen to his 10-year-old son, Thomas, ask him, ''Dad, are you
ever going to win again?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as he prepared to leave his home in Provo, Utah, for the
MCI Classic, Forsman said his wife, Trudy, sensed her husband was
torn about the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife kept saying, 'Gee, why are you going? You sound like
you're kind of indecisive about going?''' Forsman said Thursday.
''And I said I really feel like I need to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Good decision.
</P>
<P>
   Forsman had a 5-under-par 66 to hold a one-shot lead over Edward
Fryatt and Sean Murphy after the first round. Forsman said he
remembered how much he enjoyed the seaside setting, narrow fairways
and true greens of Harbour Town Golf Links.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the confidence, the 'C' word and I'm talking
confidence,'' Forsman said. ''That's really the essence of what
happened out there for me today.''
</P>
<P>
   Masters champion Vijay Singh and everyone who chased him through
Augusta National's azaleas last week couldn't keep up with Forsman
in the cold, windy conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, second last week, had an eagle and birdie through his
first five holes, but couldn't gain any more shots to end at 68.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III, a Harbour master with four MCI victories, was
tied with Forsman on the 18th hole. However, he sailed his approach
into the marsh bordering the green and took a double-bogey 6 for a
68.
</P>
<P>
   Things were just as unkind to others who fought for the green
jacket a week ago. Tom Lehman took double bogey on his final hole
for a 70, while Loren Roberts and Carlos Franco shot 73s.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe David Duval, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson were the smart
ones. They didn't show up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was difficult out there, no question about it,'' said
Singh, who had a 70. ''But I was happy with the way I hit the ball,
kept myself focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Herron joined Els and Love at three under.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Beem, one of those uninvited to the Masters despite winning
last year's Kemper Open, was tied with Frank Nobilo at 69.
</P>
<P>
   Forsman may have been the luckiest one on the course. He started
early when it was merely overcast instead of the frigid wind that
Love, Lehman and Els faced coming in.
</P>
<P>
   After opening with a bogey, he birdied Nos. 4-7 and missed putts
within 15 feet on 8 and 9. He landed a sand wedge within 8 feet for
his final birdie on No. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Forsman saved par on 18, known for its red-and-white striped
lighthouse in the background, with a testy 6-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stepped up and knocked this thing right in the heart,'' said
Forsman, who last led a tournament in 1998 when he lost to Duval at
the Disney event in Orlando, Fla. ''And I tell you what, it was a
great feeling to shoot five under at Harbour Town.''

<HEADLINE> Amateur Coach Indicted for Fraud  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG HORST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- An amateur basketball coach has been
charged with fraud in a scheme that involved some of the nation's
top high school players and four major college programs.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-count indictment accuses Myron Piggie, of Kansas City, of
defrauding UCLA, Duke, Missouri and Oklahoma State because the
players' amateur status was compromised by accepting money while in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie was charged with paying the players more than $30,000
between April 4, 1996, and Oct. 7, 1999, and expecting to receive
part of their professional salaries and endorsement income in
return. He also is accused of conspiring with sports agents to
determine the future professional value of the players.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment was returned Wednesday and unsealed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about $50, a pair of shoes and a prom corsage,''
U.S. Attorney Stephen Hill said. ''This was significant money.''
</P>
<P>
   Piggie paid JaRon Rush of UCLA $17,000; Kareem Rush of Missouri
$2,300; Corey Maggette of Duke $2,000; Andre Williams of Oklahoma
State $250; and Korleone Young $14,000, according to the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Young, from Wichita, Kan., did not play college basketball,
going straight to the NBA draft. JaRon Rush and Kareem Rush are
brothers who played at Kansas City's Pembroke Hill High School.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie also was accused of helping JaRon Rush lease a car on the
condition that he not accept a basketball scholarship from Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   He was also accused of contacting sports agents with the help of
George Raveling, a Nike consultant and former coach at Iowa and
Southern California. Raveling, who testified before the grand jury,
was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   One of the agents, Jerome Stanley of Los Angeles, made four
payments of $50 each to JaRon Rush in a parking lot on the UCLA
campus, the indictment alleged. Stanley also was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Hill took care to point out that Piggie was the only one charged
and said the indictment should not be seen as an indication of
widespread corruption in amateur sports.
</P>
<P>
   The schools, their conferences and the NCAA were defrauded
because they were denied the services of the players while they
were suspended and because the players illegally obtained
scholarships worth $99,127.80, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The players got the money in cash, sometimes in Nike shoe boxes,
and were told to keep the payments a secret, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a part of the scheme that defendant developed cover
stories for the players to explain the payments in the event the
NCAA learned of their existence,'' the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The players, some of whom testified before the grand jury, will
not be charged because they cooperated and suffered enough by being
suspended by their schools, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rush brothers and Williams were suspended by their schools
for varying periods. Those cases have since been resolved by the
NCAA with the Rush brothers each missing nine games and Williams
five. Maggette was never declared ineligible in his one season at
Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA was furnished with a copy of the indictment, but did
not participate in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA had not seen the indictment and declined comment,
spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie, 39, was being held without bond until a detention
hearing Monday. He could face up to 49 years in prison without
parole and up to $1.85 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The charges included mail fraud, wire fraud, failure to file a
federal income tax return and interstate transport of fraudulently
obtained funds. He also was charged with illegal possession of a
firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie used the access he gained to the players to receive a
$425,000 consulting contract and $159,866 in other compensation
from Nike, the indictment said. It also said he was given $184,435
from Kansas City booster Tom Grant. Nike and Grant were not
charged.
</P>
<P>
   The payments to the players were made throughout the school year
because of Piggie's need to keep them under his control, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie coached the Children's Mercy Hospital 76'ers, an amateur
summer league basketball team in Kansas City, which participated in
various summer league and Amateur Athletic Union competitions for
boys 11-18. Piggie also coached the team after it became known as
the Kansas City Rebels.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon To Eye Gulf Illness Study  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has agreed to review a study that
could help answer why thousands of military personnel who served
during the Gulf War have unexplained illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulane University Medical School study found high levels of
antibodies to squalene -- a naturally occurring molecule used in
experimental vaccines -- in a large percentage of sick veterans
vaccinated for service in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials dismiss the study as flawed and say none of
the vaccines administered during the Gulf War contained squalene.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to congressional pressure, the Defense
Department late last month asked the Armed Forces Epidemiological
Board to review the study. The National Academy of Sciences'
Institute of Medicine also is reviewing the research and assessing
what, if any role squalene may play in Gulf illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''All known, testable hypotheses concerning illnesses among Gulf
War veterans have been or are being pursued,'' Sue Bailey, the
assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, told Rep. Jack
Metcalf, R-Wash., in a letter last month.
</P>
<P>
   Squalene is a cholesterol-builder in humans and also is found in
vegetable oils, shark liver oil, cosmetics and various health
supplements. The Defense Department and National Institutes of
Health in the late 1980s began researching the use of squalene in
vaccines in an effort to make vaccines more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Defense officials told the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, that they considered -- but decided
against -- using vaccines with squalene during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulane study, published in the February issue of
Experimental and Molecular Pathology, found that all but two of 38
sick veterans who served in the Gulf and received at least one
vaccination had elevated squalene antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Another six sick veterans who were vaccinated but did not deploy
to the Gulf produced similar results, according to the study, which
was blinded, meaning the researchers did not know the source of
blood samples.
</P>
<P>
   Non-blinded portions of the study found 59 of 86 Gulf War-era
veterans, civilian employees and military contractors tested
positive for squalene antibodies, although it was not known how
many of those were vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups, including the general public and sick non-veterans
with symptoms similar to Gulf illnesses, rarely tested positive for
the antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulane study offered no conclusions as to whether Gulf War
vaccines contained squalene, what might have produced the squalene
antibodies or what -- if any -- role the antibodies played in the
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the research ''sets off alarm bells'' that should prompt
more investigation into Gulf War vaccines and the safety of
vaccines that contain squalene, said Pam Asa, an immunologist from
Memphis, Tenn., and the lead researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. Garry, a study author and immunologist at Tulane, said
the results may not point to vaccines containing squalene but that
veterans could have produced the antibodies as the result of
receiving so many vaccines at one time, or from some other organism
in a vaccine that may mimic squalene.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials question the study methods, saying
researchers did not verify the validity of their antibody test
before they began using it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because I question the method of the test, I have to question
all of the findings,'' said Lt. Col. John Grabenstein, deputy
director of the military's anthrax vaccine immunization program.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julius Cruse, editor and chief of the journal that published
the study, defended the study, saying it was peer reviewed by 10 to
12 clinicians.
</P>
<P>
   Ten members of Congress, led by Metcalf, want the Pentagon to
consider using the Tulane test on other veterans, saying it could
help answer questions about Gulf illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says an estimated 90,000 troops who served in the
Gulf War complain of illnesses such as fatigue, skin rashes,
headaches and muscle and joint pain. Defense officials have not
ruled out pesticides, stress and pyridostigmine bromide, an
experimental drug given to troops to protect against the nerve
agent soman, as possible contributors to some of the illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Meyer Happy To Be Back at Boston  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL, AP Track Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Running 26 miles, 385 yards in a foreign country,
even in a field of about 18,000, can seem like a lonely experience.
Not for Elana Meyer in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old South African relishes running the Boston
Marathon, and Monday, in her fourth appearance in the prestigious
race, she will be among the top women's contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boston is my favorite big race,'' said Meyer, the third-place
finisher in 1994 and the runner-up in 1995 and 1997. ''When I came
here in 1994, it was my first marathon, so it's special to be back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know what to expect in '94, but the whole experience
was great. So many people along the course cheering makes it
special. It helps a lot, from start to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer was so invigorated by the crowds that she ran 2 hours, 25
minutes, 15 seconds -- still her career best.
</P>
<P>
   Extra special for Meyer were the South Africans sprinkled along
the course from the little starting town of Hopkinton to the finish
line in the Back Bay section of Boston, urging her and making her
feel at home by waving their national flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes, I hear them shouting my homeland,'' she said.
''There are even some Afrikaneers. I can also hear them calling my
name. Yes, I have even met some of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last time I was here, me and Colleen De Reuck (also of
South Africa) were running alongside Fatuma Roba (of Ethiopia) and
there was some guy running with us with a South African flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston is not the only place where South Africans gather for
marathons. Last year, when Meyer ran in the London Marathon, there
were about 10,000 South Africans lining the route, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're not running in your home country, it's always nice
to get support,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer is popular wherever she runs because of her engaging,
peppy personality and her consistently strong performances. In
addition to her three top three finishes at Boston, she has
finished third at the 1998 and 1999 Chicago Marathons, fifth at the
1999 London Marathon and fifth at the 1997 Tokyo Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   She has had even greater success at shorter distances.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, she was the Olympic silver medalist at 10,000 meters.
In 1994, she ran a world-best 15:10 for 5 kilometers at Providence,
R.I., and won the Tufts 10K in 31:39. In 1997, she won the Kyoto
City Half-Marathon in 67:36 and the Cooper River 10K in 31:19. In
1998, she was runner-up at the World Half-Marathon Championships in
68:32. Last year she won the Kyoto Half-Marathon in 67:37 and
Atlanta's Peachtree 10K at 31:34, and this year, she won the Tokyo
Half-Marathon in 67:33 and the Sendai Half-Marathon in 69:04.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer missed the 1998 Boston race because of an inflammation of
the lower back, and was disappointed at having to withdraw at the
last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Boston has lifted her spirits and hopefully she
will be able to lower her time, and perhaps end Roba's three-race
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in good shape,'' Meyer said. ''I'll be very happy if I can
run my best race. Hopefully this will be my time to dip under
2:25.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking 2:25 might not even be good enough to win. Roba has run
2:23:21 and 2:23:25 the past two years, after making her Boston
debut in 1997 in 2:26:23.
</P>
<P>
   ''She knows the course very well,'' Meyer said of Roba. ''It
will be very hard to beat her. Anything shorter than a marathon I
can beat her. But in Boston, she has run some very good races.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, she can't keep winning Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Boston Marathon is such a great race with a lot of
history. I would like to win it. It will be good preparation for
the Olympic marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   In each of her previous lead-ups to Boston, Meyer trained in
Colorado Springs, Colo., with De Reuck and a group of other
runners. This time, she decided to train at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather is nice there this time of year,'' she said.
''It's a perfect place to train. It's better training at home with
your training partners and near your roots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you lose focus when you're away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   The spectators, especially the South Africans, at the Boston
Marathon Monday will not let Meyer lose focus or forget her roots.
They'll be there rooting for her, as usual.

<HEADLINE> Top QB Prospect Is Low-Key  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Chad Pennington, expected to be the
first quarterback selected, is taking a low-key approach to
Saturday's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   No dining out at New York's finest restaurants. More like
hanging out with his family in Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being a Heisman Trophy finalist and throwing for 4,000
yards and 38 touchdowns last season, the Marshall quarterback isn't
getting the red-carpet attention QBs Tim Couch and Peyton Manning
received as the overall No. 1 picks in the two previous years.
</P>
<P>
   No, Pennington will be a lower selection in the first round, so
he plans to watch television with his parents -- with his cell phone
in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will mean everything to me, because they've been at my side
my whole life,'' Pennington said Thursday. ''There's only one time
you experience this change from college to the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Not getting the same attention as Couch and Manning doesn't mean
Pennington isn't wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The team that appears the most interested -- the San Francisco
49ers with the 16th pick -- also is the team Pennington mentions the
most.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a quarterback, you couldn't go to a better place because of
the offensive history. Steve Young. Joe Montana, and the type of
receivers they always have,'' he said. ''It would be a fun place to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers need help at quarterback even if Steve Young returns
for his 16th pro season. Young suffered a concussion in October and
sat out the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Steelers, with the eighth overall pick, also have
looked at Pennington. The Steelers haven't had a quarterback play
effectively since Kordell Stewart's first season as a starter in
1997. But the club is expected to go for help at wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Denver was thought to be interested in Pennington, but traded
away the 10th pick to Baltimore on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington led Marshall to a 13-0 record and top 10 ranking last
season. The academic All-America and former Rhodes scholar
candidate is known as much for his intelligence as his arm.
</P>
<P>
   He impressed scouts during interviews at the NFL combine. And
Carolina's George Seifert, who coached Pennington at the Senior
Bowl in January, even compared his leadership to that of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have called Pennington, who threw 24 touchdown passes to
Randy Moss in 1997 alone, the best available among an ordinary crop
of quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think versatility is my strong point. I think whoever picks
me will be pleased,'' Pennington said. ''I'm not a cocky guy. I'm
confident in my abilities and I take pride in being a team guy, a
team leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennington has received tips from the Indianapolis Colts'
Manning, Detroit's Charlie Batch and Chicago's Cade McNown about
getting acclimated to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest thing they tell me is to have fun and enjoy it,
because you're playing the game that you love,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Pennington, Marshall's Rogers Beckett is perhaps the
only other Thundering Herd player with a good shot at being
drafted. He's listed as high as the second-best safety available.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just hope somebody is willing to take that chance,'' Beckett
said.

<HEADLINE> American League Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals didn't need another game-ending home run
to win. Carlos Beltran's ninth-inning single was good enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who won their last three games on ''walk-off''
homers, kept up their string of last at-bat wins when Beltran's
single gave them a 6-5 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all about attitude,'' manager Tony Muser said of the
Royals' start, which included a 6-1 opening homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys grew up a lot last year,'' Muser said. ''They were
relaxed and methodical in spring training and focused on areas that
needed work. Now they are playing together as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who blew a 5-0 lead before rallying in the bottom of
the ninth, got game-ending homers the past three days from Johnny
Damon, Mark Johnson and Rey Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it's early, but the feeling we have in this clubhouse
is very special,'' said Mike Sweeney, who hit his league-leading
sixth home run in the first inning. ''The crowd sticks around, even
when we get down. It's an exciting time for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games, it was New York 5, Texas 1; Tampa Bay 6, the
White Sox 5 in 12 innings; Boston 4, Minnesota 3; and Detroit 2,
Seattle 0.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, whose three-run, ninth-inning homer gave Kansas City a
7-6 win Wednesday over Baltimore, led off the ninth with a single
off B.J. Ryan (1-1).
</P>
<P>
   Damon followed with a sacrifice bunt and Carlos Febles walked.
Beltran followed with a single that dropped just in front of left
fielder B.J. Surhoff, whose throw to the plate wasn't in time to
catch Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played some good baseball, and we played some bad
baseball,'' Orioles manager Mike Hargrove said. ''Realistically, we
probably should have won two out of three. But Kansas City is a
good ballclub, and hot right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken went 0-for-4, striking out twice -- including a called
third strike that ended Baltimore's four-run eighth inning -- and
remained four hits short of 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore tied it on Mike Bordick's single off closer Ricky
Bottalico (2-0) in the ninth, after Jeff Suppan matched a career
high with eight strikeouts over seven-plus innings for Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
Yankees 5, Rangers 1
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada hit a tiebreaking triple with the bases loaded and
Orlando Hernandez (2-0) shut down Texas on two singles for eight
innings.
</P>
<P>
   New York made it a rough homecoming for Kenny Rogers (1-2), who
gave up eight hits in Texas' first complete game this year. Back at
Yankee Stadium for the first time since pitching in pinstripes in
1997, he walked two in the sixth to set up Posada's hit.
</P>
<P>
Devil Rays 6, White Sox 5, 12 innings
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn's RBI single with two outs in the bottom of the 12th
helped Tampa Bay snap a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's line drive to left field off Tanyon Sturtze (0-1) drove
in Kevin Stocker from second base. The bullpen held the White Sox
scoreless over the last seven innings. Jim Mecir (2-0) got the
win.
</P>
<P>
Red Sox 4, Twins 3
</P>
<P>
   Wilton Veras drew a bases-loaded walk to break an eighth-inning
tie and Boston rallied to win at home.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wells (0-1) loaded the bases in the eighth, but was helped
when Denny Hocking threw out Nomar Garciaparra at the plate on a
fly ball to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Guardardo came in and walked Jason Varitek and Veras to
score the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wakefield (1-0) got the win and Derek Lowe pitched the ninth
for his second save.
</P>
<P>
Tigers 2, Mariners 0
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez, making his first home start for Detroit, hit an
RBI double to break up a scoreless tie in the eighth inning.
Gonzalez, who hadn't started since the opener last week in Oakland
because of a right hamstring strain, went 2-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Halter drew a leadoff walk off Arthur Rhodes (0-1) in the
eighth before Gonzalez scored him easily with a drive up the
right-field gap.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Brocail (1-1) pitched one scoreless inning and Todd Jones
got his third save.

<HEADLINE> Clinton cancels plans to chair Arab event, civil rights reportpostponed  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Hillary Rodham Clinton scrapped plans to headline a
charity dinner for an Arab-American group because Israelis were not
on the guest list.
</P>
<P>
   And a federal civil rights panel postponed discussion of a
report said to criticize Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's New York City
Police Department amid news that the panel's chairwoman had
contributed to the first lady's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights denied any connection.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop Giuliani from denouncing the probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't take much to figure out this is a political
operation,'' Giuliani said Thursday after a campaign stop on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Newsday reported the panel's chairwoman Mary Frances Berry
contributed $250 last year to Clinton and another $300 to the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which has pledged support
to her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   Berry defended her donation.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have a right to make campaign contributions to anyone
they please,'' Berry said Thursday. She said she would continue to
participate in the commission's discussion of the NYPD.
</P>
<P>
   ''It (the report) is about Giuliani's office, not Giuliani. It's
about the police department in New York. It's not about Hillary
Clinton and it's not about the senatorial campaign,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's spokesman David Aronson said it was unclear
when the draft report would be discussed and declined to explain
the delay. The report had been scheduled for discussion today.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member commission is preparing a report on the NYPD
that several sources say is expected to be highly critical and
could call for the appointment of a federal monitor to oversee the
department. The commission began its probe into the police force
last year in the wake of the shooting of Amadou Diallo and the
torture of Abner Louima at the hands of New York City cops.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing held by the commission in New York City last May,
Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir defended the police
force. But the Rev. Al Sharpton and others described the NYPD as
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Six members of the commission were appointed by Democrats and
two by Republicans. The panel has no enforcement powers but can
make recommendations to the president, Congress and federal
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first lady canceled plans to headline a charity
dinner for an Arab-American group because representatives from the
Israeli Embassy were not invited. Several Arab states do not
recognize the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under these circumstances, Mrs. Clinton will no longer be able
to serve as honorary chair of the Mosaic Foundation event,'' a
statement from the first lady's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mosaic Foundation is made up of the wives of Arab
ambassadors to the U.S. who raise money for charity. This year's
dinner on May 3 is to benefit Save the Children. Clinton has served
as honorary chairwoman for the dinner for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Kim Serafin called Clinton's
decision to back out ''a classic Clinton flip-flop.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously she's pandering for the Jewish vote,'' Serafin said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is courting New York's large Jewish population in her
bid for the U.S. Senate against Giuliani. She strained her
relationship with some Jews last year after a visit to the West
Bank. There, Clinton embraced Soha Arafat after the wife of Yasser
Arafat accused Israelis of using poison gas on Palestinian women
and children. The first lady distanced herself from Mrs. Arafat's
remarks the next day.

<HEADLINE> House Objects to FCC Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Warning of a babble of interfering voices, the
House has moved to put restrictions on a Federal Communications
Commission ruling that would have opened the nation's radio
airwaves to hundreds of tiny low-power stations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FCC wanted to add everything but the kitchen sink into the
nation's FM radio spectrum, creating significant interference with
existing radio stations and services,'' said Rep. Michael Oxley,
R-Ohio, the chief sponsor of the bill that passed 274-110 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But both the White House and the FCC objected strongly to the
legislation. The White House said the FCC could resolve
interference issues and the new ruling, by encouraging local
microradios, ''would provide a voice for the voiceless, thereby
contributing to improved community ties and information.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has yet to be taken up by the Senate, responds
to an FCC ruling last January making room for hundreds of new local
stations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would keep current interference standards in place,
thus reducing but not eliminating the number of new entrants in the
market, while allowing demonstration programs in nine locales to
see what happens when those standards are relaxed to levels sought
by the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling has put the FCC, a federal regulatory agency, at odds
with the commercial broadcasting industry. ''I don't know what's
fuzzier, the static from low power FM or the FCC's thinking on the
issue,'' National Association of Broadcasters head Edward Fritts
said this week at an industry convention.
</P>
<P>
   But FCC Chairman William Kennard, in a statement, said the FCC
has set minimum separation rules for low power stations that more
than protect existing broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Special interests triumphed over community interests today,''
he said, predicting that the bill would eliminate more than 80
percent of the potential low power FM stations in hundreds of
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce
telecommunications subcommittee, accused the FCC of doing its own
lobbying against the bill, and said he had asked the Justice
Department to investigate whether the federal agency had violated
the law in trying to defeat the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that FCC staff acted appropriately and within
the bounds of the law,'' said FCC spokesperson Linda Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the original version of the Oxley bill would
have totally repealed the FCC ruling, and they had compromised by
allowing the FCC to go forward with some new licensing while
testing the more relaxed standards.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Thomas Barrett, D-Wis., and Bobby Rush, D-Ill., proposed
an amendment that would have allowed the FCC to go ahead with the
new rules after a six-month test unless Congress specifically
prohibited them, but it was defeated 245-142.
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday also passed, by 375-37, a bill authorizing
$1.25 billion in loan guarantees to help satellite companies and
other TV providers bring local TV stations to rural and small
market communities.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall the president signed into law a measure giving
satellite companies the right to add local TV stations to their
programming. But while satellite carriers have begun providing that
service to larger markets, they say they have no plans to extend
local TV service to less populated areas, about 30 percent of the
nation, because it is not economically feasible.

<HEADLINE> House Republicans Break $1M Mark  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At least four House Republicans threatened
with the loss of their seats this fall have already raised more
than $1 million for their re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list is Rep. Jim Rogan, a California
Republican who is among the Democrats' top targets this fall. He
has taken in almost $4 million through March 31 and had almost $1
million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Congressional Committee released the
fund-raising figures in advance of Saturday's deadline for
reporting them to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''These record-breaking fund-raising figures clearly show that
Americans support the progress Republicans have made on issues
important to our families,'' NRCC spokeswoman Marit Babin said.
''People have responded to our message of reducing the marriage tax
penalty, returning local control of education and restoring
character and morality in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan was one of the House managers who presented the case for
impeaching President Clinton to the Senate. He had $965,000 in his
account as of March 31, compared with $255,356 at the same time two
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Rogan spent $1.3 million on his campaign, which he won
with 51 percent of the vote. This year, he faces a strong
challenger, state Sen. Adam Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   The other House Republicans who have broken through the
million-dollar mark include Reps. Anne Northup and Ernie Fletcher
of Kentucky and Heather Wilson of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Clay Shaw of Florida, facing a strong challenge from state
Rep. Elaine Bloom, had $1.3 million in the bank as of March 31 --
more than twice as much as the $530,127 cash on hand he had two
years earlier. Despite Bloom's candidacy, NRCC Chairman Tom Davis
of Virginia said he expected Shaw to win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats, while declining to release campaign finance
figures for most of their candidates, did tout the success of their
candidate for the Virginia seat being vacated by retiring
Democratic Rep. Owen Pickett. Lawyer Jody Wagner raised $337,000
during the first three months of 2000, compared with $264,000 for
GOP state Sen. Edward Ed Schrock, Democratic officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a huge deal,'' Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee spokesman John Del Cecato said. ''She has really stunned
a lot of people with how successful she's been. Her fund-raising
strength shows how much support she has in the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Cecato also cited former Rep. Jane Harman, trying to reclaim
the California congressional seat she gave up to run for governor
in 1998. Harman raised $863,000 during the first three months of
the year, compared with $820,000 for Republican incumbent Steve
Kuykendall, according to figures supplied by both parties. Harman
also had almost twice as much money in the bank, $700,000 versus
$370,000 for Kuykendall.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached on Health Appeals  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients denied care by their HMOs could
appeal the decisions to an independent review panel under a
tentative agreement reached by House and Senate negotiators working
on legislation to give patients more say about their health care.
</P>
<P>
   While a few key aspects of the appeals process have yet to be
worked out, members of a House-Senate committee said Thursday they
had agreed in principal that patients could have their disputes
heard by independent medical experts who would have the final word
on whether treatments or services should be provided.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've made an awful lot of progress,'' said Ohio Rep.
John Boehner, a Republican committee member. The bipartisan group
has been working for more than a month to combine House- and
Senate-passed versions of a bill giving Americans more rights when
dealing with managed care organizations and other health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, review panels would be hired by health
plans according to a set of standards developed by the government
that would prohibit conflicts of interest between the panel and the
health plan and bar health plans from selecting reviewers that have
been promised incentives that would lead them to make biased
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides said health plans could contract with university
medical schools that would appoint doctors to consider appeals
according to their expertise. Cancer specialists would hear appeals
of cancer treatment decisions, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The review panels would have two central duties. They would
decide whether patient disputes were eligible for the appeals
process and send appeals that were approved to be reviewed by
medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   No agreement had yet been reached on standards that reviewers
would follow in deciding whether disputes could be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a way to go,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said services that are specifically not covered under
health plan contracts, such as cosmetic surgery, could not be
appealed. But if a patient's doctor thinks a treatment is medically
necessary even though the plan says it won't cover it, patients
could appeal to a review panel.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most important aspects of the agreement, lawmakers
have agreed that review panels are not bound by what the health
panel has defined as ''medically necessary'' treatments. They are
free to make an independent assessment of patients' cases based on
scientific studies and clinical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans covered by managed care organizations are
concerned that, in their quest to keep costs down, HMOs are wrongly
denying care and turn down patients who take their complaints to
review boards controlled by HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican who chairs the
committee, called the appeals process ''a very significant
provision'' that would let patients in ''every employer-sponsored
plan in the country'' have the right to an external review.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's work is far from over. Still to be decided is
how many Americans will be covered by the federal protections and
whether patients will be allowed to sue health plans if they are
not satisfied with the outcome of the appeals process.

<HEADLINE> Program To Up Newsroom Minorities  </HEADLINE>
By DARLENE SUPERVILLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new education and training center and
encouragement for high school reporting are some of the steps major
journalism organizations hope will improve newsroom diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Forum announced Thursday its commitment of $5
million to an ''aggressive national effort,'' including a $1
million partnership with the American Society of Newspaper Editors
and the Associated Press Managing Editors to recruit minorities for
the newspaper business.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ASNE said it will use a $500,000 grant from
the Miami-based John S. and James L. Knight Foundation to develop a
program to stoke interest in careers in the industry by renewing
and encouraging interest in journalism among high school students.
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives are in response to statistics showing a
negligible increase in the percentage of minority journalists. They
were announced during the newspaper editors' annual conference
here.
</P>
<P>
   ''What has been going on has not worked,'' said Charles L.
Overby, chairman and chief executive officer of The Freedom Forum,
a foundation devoted to a free press. ''We have got to look for and
embrace radically new ideas ... because the traditional approaches
have not worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper editors' association reported this week that the
number of minority journalists working at daily newspapers
increased in the past year by one-third of 1 percentage point, to
11.9 percent, according to its annual newsroom employment survey.
</P>
<P>
   But while the overall number of minority journalists increased,
the percentage of blacks in newspaper newsrooms dropped slightly,
the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities make up about 12 percent of newsrooms but more than
28 percent of the U.S. population -- a disparity that has remained
unchanged from the mid-1970s, when they filled 4 percent of the
staff at newspapers and made up 19 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   N. Christian Anderson III, ASNE president and publisher of The
Orange County Register, said the emphasis on journalism in high
schools could be of help to smaller newspapers who are ''really
desperate for people and ... particularly desperate for people of
color.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to partnering with ASNE and APME, the Freedom
Forum's plans include:
</P>
<P>
   -- A state-of-the-art journalism education and training center at
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., to aid the professional
development of minority journalists. It will seek students from
community colleges, schools without journalism programs and people
interested in switching careers. Under development, the institute
is expected to begin operating late next year.
</P>
<P>
   -- Other partnerships to create programs aimed at improving
newsroom diversity.
</P>
<P>
   -- Funding four ''diversity fellows'' to visit colleges,
universities and junior colleges with high minority enrollments to
find talented recruits for careers in print journalism.
</P>
<P>
   -- Expansion of its Chips Quinn Scholars program, a year-round
training program of paid internships and scholarships for minority
college students pursuing journalism careers.

<HEADLINE> Logjam Broken on African Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of delay and tough negotiations,
legislation extending new trade benefits to African, Central
American and Caribbean nations finally appears headed for
enactment.
</P>
<P>
   Top House and Senate leaders, hoping to send off the
Clinton-administration-backed bill before tackling an even more
contentious China trade package, reached tentative agreement
Thursday night on a proposed compromise.
</P>
<P>
   According to participants, House leaders agreed to a Senate
proposal to give Caribbean and Central American nations many of the
same duty-free benefits to be extended to sub-Saharan African
nations.
</P>
<P>
   And House negotiators, in turn, agreed to some Senate
restrictions on apparel imports designed to protect the
hard-pressed U.S. textile industry.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., hailed the acceptance of
''the parameters of an agreement'' after the deal was worked out in
a private meeting among top House and Senate leaders in the office
of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said he hoped for a vote ''as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert spokesman John Feehery said the speaker hoped the
compromise measure could be brought up after Congress returns from
its spring recess later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The speaker believes this is a good deal for the American
consumer,'' Feehery said.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise was also endorsed by Rep. Charles Rangel of New
York, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee,
which has jurisdiction over trade legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good tentative agreement,'' Rangel spokesman Dan Maffei
said. ''Congressman Rangel was confident that what was outlined
will pass both houses.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed the House and Senate last year in
significantly different forms, has been subject to intense
negotiations since November.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative deal must next be approved formally by negotiators
from each chamber. But with the bipartisan blessing of both the
Republican and Democratic leaders, this was not viewed as a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some details of the deal were sketchy, but those close to the
negotiations said House leaders agreed to accept a more expansive
Senate version in terms of countries covered.
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed bill only dealt with the 48 countries of
sub-Saharan Africa. The Senate bill -- and now the compromise --
covers these nations, plus 24 Caribbean and Central American
nations as well.
</P>
<P>
   In another compromise, House leaders agreed to go along with a
cap on the volume of goods to receive duty-free treatment, while
Senate leaders agreed to lower restrictions than in the original
Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders also agreed to drop a Senate-passed requirement
that African-assembled apparel use U.S. fabric and thread, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the poorest countries in Africa would be eligible
for duty-free treatment in U.S. markets with no restrictions for
four years, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts manufactured in Caribbean and Central American
countries would be subject to some restrictions not applied to
other apparel, however, in a nod to U.S. textile manufacturers,
said congressional officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made the Africa bill a top trade priority.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and congressional leaders hoped to
handle the measure before taking up an even more contentious trade
bill later in the spring, extending permanent trade benefits to
China to help ease the way for China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The Africa-Caribbean-Central American legislation would lower or
eliminate tariffs and quotas on products from the regions covered
as well as marking it easier for U.S. businesses to invest.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been opposed by senators from textile
states, who contended it would harm America's garment industry, and
by labor and environmental groups that said it failed to set
standards for protecting workers and the environment.

<HEADLINE> NHL Playoffs Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Jaromir Jagr has good reason to doubt the importance
of home ice
in Pittsburgh's quirky playoff series with Washington.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''Home-ice advantage doesn't mean anything. We proved that
tonight,'' the Pittsburgh star said Thursday night after the
Penguins' 7-0 victory in Washington, the Capitals' worst playoff
loss ever.
</P>
<P>
   Because of scheduling problems in Pittsburgh, the seventh-seeded
Penguins will be home for Games 2 and 3 in the Eastern Conference
first-round series. Usually, the higher-seeded team is home for the
first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's victory came two days after Washington coach Ron
Wilson said he would be willing to play all seven games in
Pittsburgh and would ''go in there and beat 'em anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't sit well with the Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was up on the bulletin board,'' Pittsburgh right wing
Matthew Barnaby said. ''It definitely made us angry. You want to be
taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other Eastern Conference openers Thursday, Philadelphia
beat Buffalo 3-2 and New Jersey edged Florida 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Conference, defending Stanley Cup champion Dallas
beat Edmonton 3-0 to take a 2-0 series lead. In openers, Detroit
beat Los Angeles 2-0 and Colorado defeated Phoenix 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the only game tonight, Buffalo is at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh, the only team to win on the road in the first two
days of the playoffs, scored on three of its first four shots
against goalie Olaf Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   Janne Laukkanen had two goals and Robert Lang, Martin Straka,
Jiri Slegr, Jan Hrdina and Tyler Wright also scored. Jagr, the NHL
scoring leader, had four assists.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was about the most embarrassing effort of the season,''
Washington's Terry Yake said. ''We got outplayed in every aspect of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven-goal deficit was the biggest in 138 playoff games for
the Capitals. They've lost by six goals three times, including a
7-1 loss to Pittsburgh in 1995. Pittsburgh was a goal shy of
matching its biggest playoff victory, an 8-0 rout of Minnesota in
1991 that clinched the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh has won four of its last five playoff series against
Washington, but the Capitals won the opener each time.
</P>
<P>
   ''One game doesn't a series make,'' Penguins coach Herb Brooks
said. ''But it's a good start.''
EASTERN CONFERENCE:
Flyers 3, Sabres 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Philadelphia, rookie Simon Gagne scored with 14:27 left and
Brian Boucher, the rookie goalie making his first playoff start,
made 18 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Jones and Daymond Langkow gave Philadelphia a 2-0 lead in
the first period, a rare early edge against goalie Dominik Hasek.
Buffalo's Stu Barnes and Miroslav Satan scored in the second.
Devils 4, Panthers 3:
</P>
<P>
   At East Rutherford, N.J., Scott Stevens, Petr Sykora and Sergei
Brylin scored in the first 15:28 as New Jersey opened a three-goal
lead and held off Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Scott Gomez also scored and Martin Brodeur made 20 saves.
Peter Worrell, Mike Sillinger and Rob Niedermayer scored for the
Panthers. Pavel Bure, the NHL goal leader with 58, was limited to
an assist.
WESTERN CONFERENCE:
Stars 3, Oilers 0:
</P>
<P>
   At Dallas, Brett Hull had a goal and an assist and Ed Belfour
made 17 saves for his eighth playoff shutout as the Stars beat
Edmonton for the second straight night.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Muller and Scott Thornton also scored for Dallas,
continuing an early playoff trend of production from surprising
players. Hull is the only one of Dallas' top five scorers with a
goal in the two games.
Red Wings 2, Kings 0:
</P>
<P>
   At Detroit, Chris Osgood made 19 saves for his seventh playoff
shutout and Vyacheslav Kozlov and Sergei Fedorov scored goals.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlov scored at 1:43 of the second period on a shot that hit
Los Angeles defenseman Jere Karalahti in the back and caromed into
the net past goalie Stephane Fiset. Fedorov scored into an empty
net with 12.8 seconds remaining.
Avalanche 6, Coyotes 3:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Elian Drama Back in Court  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- In a remarkable turn of events, Elian Gonzalez's
relatives dared the federal government to take him by force and won
a court reprieve that keeps the 6-year-old boy in the United States
-- at least for a few more days.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives defied the government's order to make Elian
available Thursday for a flight to Washington and a reunion with
his father. In a last-minute plea for their cause, they distributed
a home video in which Elian tells his father he does not want to
return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were expected to provoke a showdown. But a federal
appeals court temporarily blocked anyone from taking Elian out of
the country until it decides whether to hear the relatives' claims.
A government response to the order was due today.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the Justice Department informally agreed not
to transfer custody of Elian to his father for three or four days.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our miracle happened!'' shouted Mercedes Franco, 59, one of
the thousands of protesters in Little Havana. ''That boy is a
miracle. I feel like screaming everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people had crowded the narrow streets around
Elian's great-uncle's house expecting to block federal agents from
taking the boy. Their joy spilled into the rest of the
neighborhood, with drivers clogging traffic, blasting salsa music
and waving Cuban flags into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno appeared to be speeding the case to
its conclusion by meeting for 2{ hours Wednesday with Elian and his
relatives and then issuing the flight ultimatum. But when it became
clear that the family would not heed the deadline, Reno said she
would respond in a ''reasonable, measured way.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the authority to take action,'' said Reno, who still
is criticized for how the government dealt with the Branch
Davidians in 1993. ''But responsible authority means not only
knowing when to take action, but how and when to take that
action.''
</P>
<P>
   The family said Reno's order was unacceptable because they want
a reunion with Juan Miguel Gonzalez in which they would not have to
relinquish custody of Elian. The father has said he will only meet
with the relatives once Elian is back in his care.
</P>
<P>
   For Juan Miguel, who came to Washington on April 7 in hopes of
bringing his son back to Cuba, the latest delay prolonged his
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said he would not feel safe coming to Miami to pick
Elian up, given the political passions rumbling here. The father
made an obscene gesture Thursday to a small group of Cuban-American
protesters who heckled him in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Elian appeared on TV around the country Thursday, speaking in
Spanish on a home video given to the Spanish-language network
Univision. Animatedly addressing his father, he says: ''I don't
want to go to Cuba. ... I want to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel's attorney, Gregory Craig, said the Miami relatives'
actions Thursday ''emotionally damaged and exploited this most
wonderful little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued by two fishermen while clinging to an inner
tube in the Florida Straits on Thanksgiving Day. His mother and 10
other people fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have cared for him ever since and have been
fighting in court for an asylum hearing. The Clinton administration
has ordered Elian back to his father, saying only he can speak for
the boy on immigration matters. The Cuban government has called for
Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   Government sources have said the Justice Department is prepared
to send U.S. marshals and immigration agents into the house to
remove Elian. But on Thursday, the government blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ''A second miracle is happening in the case of Elian,'' said
Raul Gonzalez, a 72-year-old accountant who lives in the
neighborhood. ''It seems that God is guiding us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many said they believed the showdown was merely delayed,
not prevented.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very happy because we might get some justice,'' said
Ofelia Perez, 72, who came to America from Cuba in 1966. ''But we
can't let our guard down.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Exile Heads Join Elian Vigil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- While protesters filled the streets outside Elian
Gonzalez's house to wait for the government's next move, relatives
and Cuban exile leaders kept their own vigil inside, gathered
around a big-screen television.
</P>
<P>
   Only the guest of honor, his feet blackened from playing
barefoot in the back yard, seemed oblivious to the tension
Thursday. Before a federal appeals court issued a stay at least
temporarily putting off Elian's transfer to his father, almost
everyone in the house was teary-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Many people smoked and talked on cell phones. In the kitchen,
the only quiet room in the house, Elian's great-aunt Angela baked
chicken, cooked rice and fried meat in a pan.
</P>
<P>
   The peek into the life of the Gonzalez family came on an
extraordinary day, with the family defying a federal order to
relinquish custody of Elian and daring the government to remove the
boy by force. It was provided by a pool reporter allowed into the
home.
</P>
<P>
   While the family watched the news nervously, Elian hovered
around his cousin Marisleysis, sitting in her lap and playfully
putting his finger in her ear while she sat on a leather love seat.
</P>
<P>
   When Elian's home video was played, in which he tells his father
he doesn't want to return to Cuba, everyone clapped and cheered.
Elian stood in the center and smiled, watching himself on the giant
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the city's Cuban leaders were there: Jose Basulto of the
Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue, for example, along with
several priests and pastors. Actor Andy Garcia and singer Gloria
Estefan came by, as did Donaldo Dalrymple, one of the fishermen who
rescued Elian last fall.
</P>
<P>
   When Attorney General Janet Reno appeared on TV, the living room
went silent. Great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez occasionally lifted his
eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders. Marisleysis jeered when Reno
mentioned her name.
</P>
<P>
   There was Elian paraphernalia around the house -- and lots of it:
framed newspaper articles, a stuffed toy dolphin, artwork people
have given him, a card from his Miami classmates.
</P>
<P>
   When the stay was issued, everyone broke into celebration, with
hugs and handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Manuel Salabarria high-fived Lazaro Gonzalez and
exclaimed, ''I love you!'' After a woman congratulated Lazaro, he
responded: ''Justice must prevail.''

<HEADLINE> Ruling in Elian Case Obscured  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The judge whose order means that Elian Gonzalez will remain in
the United States for a while longer left a major question
unanswered: What was his reasoning for agreeing that the boy's
great-uncle had raised a ''serious legal question'' about Elian's
proposed return to Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   Hints of Judge J.L. Edmonson's reasoning can be gleaned from
successful arguments filed with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals by a lawyer for Elian's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer claimed the boy would be psychologically abused in
Cuba, and that sending him back now would end the case prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once outside the borders of the United States and firmly
within the clutches of Cuba's totalitarian government, any
appellate treatment of this case will become an illusion,''
attorney Kendall Coffey wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He said Elian would be indoctrinated, exploited and forced to
hear government denunciations of his mother, who drowned while
trying to bring him to the United States last November.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the case of Walter Polovchak, the 12-year-old Soviet
defector who defied his parents and won the right to stay in the
United States two decades ago, Coffey said a child of any age who
wants to stay in this country is entitled to a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The stay issued Thursday by Edmonson, a 1986 appointee of
President Reagan, will remain in effect until a three-judge panel
of the appeals court can review the case.
</P>
<P>
   Injunctions, which preserve the status quo while a case is on
appeal, are normally considered initially by three-judge appellate
panels. A single judge, however, can issue a brief stay in an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Requirements for injunctions vary among courts.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonson said he primarily considered two factors: whether the
suit had a likelihood of ultimate success, and whether Elian would
suffer ''irreparable injury'' by being taken out of the country
before the case ended.
</P>
<P>
   To issue a temporary injunction, Edmonson said, he did not have
to be convinced of the suit's probable success, only that ''a
serious legal question is involved and ... that the balance of
equities weighs heavily in favor of granting the stay.''
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, Elian, represented by his great-uncle,
''probably has demonstrated that he is entitled'' to the
injunction, wrote Edmonson.
</P>
<P>
   The losing side in the case could seek a rehearing before the
full 12-member appeals court, which covers Florida, Georgia and
Alabama. A final appeal could be made to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle,
claiming to represent the boy's interests and seeking an asylum
hearing for him.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore upheld the
decision to return the boy to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
citing the federal government's power over immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court scheduled a hearing May 11 to review Moore's
ruling. But with the U.S. government pressing for Elian to return
immediately to his father's custody, Lazaro Gonzalez asked the
court to keep the boy in the United States until the court case
ended.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Exiles Support Elian in N.J.  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) -- More than 1,200 miles north of Miami,
the nation's second-largest Cuban community is backing protesters
who plan to resist government efforts to take Elian Gonzalez from
his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to take him, they'll take him by force,'' said
Rafael Rodriguez, sipping espresso at a cafeteria Thursday while
watching Spanish language television coverage of the saga. ''All
Cubans, we are together.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans called Attorney General Janet Reno ''a sick
woman,'' President Clinton a traitor and compared the government's
plan to take Elian from Miami to Anne Frank's capture by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would not be killed immediately, but he would be subjected
to brainwashing'' once he is returned to Cuba, said Sergio Alonzo.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old Manny Hernandez said he thought Elian and his
father should both stay in the United States, honoring the wishes
of Elian's dead mother that the 6-year-old stay here.
</P>
<P>
   If that can't happen, he said, ''They should fight as long as
possible to keep him.''
</P>
<P>
   Many said they doubted the sincerity of Elian's father, saying
he is being controlled by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no father in Cuba. The only father is the
government,'' Alonzo said. ''Castro is his father.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 150,000 Cuban-Americans -- less than one-third of
Miami's Cuban population -- live in Hudson County, especially in
Union City, West New York and North Bergen, gritty, working-class
cities lined up side by side across the Hudson River from New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Rodriguez is credited with creating the community,
arriving in the late 1940s from Fomento, Cuba. Cubans began to
dominate towns that once provided blue-collar manufacturing jobs
for Germans and Italians, he said, taking jobs in northern New
Jersey's embroidery industry, opening restaurants and clothing
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Their numbers have diminished in the cities as many moved to the
suburbs. Union City now has a 25 percent Cuban population, but
Cuban political organizations are based here, many Cubans come here
to shop and thousands crowd the streets each year for an annual
parade.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the 6-year-old boy is evoking the same emotions and
painful memories of immigration and abuses in Cuba. Leaders said
Cuban exiles in New Jersey would have supported Elian as forcefully
as protesters in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''The community here is as united and as militant,'' said
Remberto Perez, regional director of the Cuban American National
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Abel Hernandez Jr., 35, wasn't so sure, saying the Cuban
population in New Jersey is older, more spread out and has fewer
stories of treacherous trips to America.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have that power, that feeling,'' said Hernandez.
''There's some people (in Miami) who have gone on rafts and stuff
like that.''

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Confident About Runoff  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Sitting under a portrait of a 19th century
Peruvian navy admiral who died rather than surrender his ship,
President Alberto Fujimori shows the same determination to see the
course through to victory.
</P>
<P>
   In his first interview since Sunday's election, which sent him
into a second-round showdown against Alejandro Toledo, Fujimori
exuded confidence, saying he had no doubt he would defeat his
upstart rival.
</P>
<P>
   At ease and self-assured, Fujimori seemed not to hear the
unflattering chants of protesters who were demonstrating Thursday
night outside the National Palace in the Plaza de Armas.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will always find me calm and tranquil,'' he said. ''I have
not gone out and made triumphant declarations.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was pleased with the results of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm satisfied with the final tally, which gave me 49.9 percent
after 10 years governing a country with complicated problems,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president fell just shy of the majority he needed to avoid a
runoff. But a three-day delay by election officials in producing
the final returns raised suspicions of vote fraud and set off
massive street protests by Toledo supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said the government had no intention of sabotaging
Toledo's campaign during the runoff, despite concerns by
international monitors about smear attacks and dirty tricks against
Fujimori's election opponents during the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The bespectacled, 61-year-old Fujimori joked about being blamed
when anything goes wrong, and said it has become a habit for
opponents to point to him or his military intelligence allies for
''every problem that Peru has.''
</P>
<P>
   But he turned serious when he discussed his opponent. He called
Toledo, a U.S.-trained economist, an irresponsible populist for his
promises to cut taxes and raise wages and a demagogue who has
frightened Peruvians with his fiery rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   He said Toledo's spending promises would cause a deficit
equivalent to 10 percent of the gross domestic product and hurl
Peru back into the economic chaos of the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be unmanageable,'' Fujimori said.
</P>
<P>
   When Fujimori took office in 1990, inflation reached 7,750
percent. He quickly imposed harsh austerity measures that doused
the inflationary fires. Last year inflation was 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But only half the Peruvians in the labor force have steady work,
and Toledo has cut into Fujimori's support among the poor with
promises to create hundreds of thousands of jobs by reducing taxes
to boost business investment. He also has pledged large pay
increases for police, teachers and other government workers.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori also criticized Toledo, 54, for firing up large crowds
of protesters, calling them ''mobs'' that he could barely control.
</P>
<P>
   For three days after Sunday's election, Toledo's supporters
demonstrated by the tens of thousands in Peru's major cities.
Toledo, a former World Bank official who grew up in poverty, warned
that the mostly peaceful marches and rallies could turn violent if
Fujimori claimed victory in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ''His management of masses is worrisome,'' Fujimori said. ''He
has created a climate of uncertainty, of anxiety, of fear, in the
last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori also rejected any comparisons between Toledo's campaign
to unseat him and his own upset win over famed novelist Mario
Vargas Llosa in 1990, when Fujimori was a little-known university
rector.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is very different,'' he said. ''In this case the
candidate is the president, who can show results, while the writer
Mario Vargas Llosa had only proposals to show.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday's election, Fujimori has said little while allowing
Toledo to take to the streets to lead huge rallies against him.
</P>
<P>
   Their approaches reflect very different leadership styles.
Toledo appears to be impetuous and passionate, quick to fire up
large rallies. Fujimori, known for his patience and cunning, bides
his time until he finds the right moment to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori showed the same patient style in his handling of his
last big crisis, when leftist rebels seized hundreds of hostages at
the Japanese ambassador's house in December 1996. After a
four-month siege his commandoes rescued all the hostages but one,
who died, and killed all 14 rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's steel-fisted leader said he was confident of winning the
runoff, but true to his reputation for secrecy, refused to reveal
his strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he could be certain of defeating Toledo, he grinned
and said: ''That is like asking me if I am going to get the
hostages out.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Nuke Program Said Intact  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The financial problems facing USEC Inc., the
country's only provider of enriched uranium, will not jeopardize a
key nuclear nonproliferation program with Russia, or threaten the
domestic uranium industry, the company's president insists.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers at a congressional hearing Thursday said they were
far from assured that USEC would not move to close one of its two
enrichment plants or take the steps necessary to comply with the
Russia deal if it conflicts with the company's financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   The company was created in 1998 when the government decided to
sell its uranium enrichment enterprise in a public stock offering.
It provides uranium fuel for civilian power plants, accounting for
about a third of the worldwide market.
</P>
<P>
   But its profits have been declining sharply because of a slump
in the uranium market and USEC's increasing costs at the aging
enrichment plants in Paducah, Ky., and Piketon, Ohio. The company
also has said it is losing millions of dollars as U.S. agent for
the uranium agreement with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   USEC president William ''Nick'' Timbers told a House Commerce
subcommittee that the company is meeting its obligations in buying
Russia's diluted weapons-grade uranium under a key U.S.-Russia
nonproliferation agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And he denied allegations that USEC has been dumping uranium on
the market, helping to depress prices. He said USEC had promised to
limit uranium sales ''and we have lived up to those commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   However, other industry representatives testified that USEC's
marketing strategies are threatening the U.S. uranium industry.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stout, representing the Uranium Producers of America,
accused USEC of ''uncontrolled dumping'' of uranium it had obtained
from the government as part of 1998 privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Another industry witness, James Graham, president of ConverDyn,
a uranium processing company, said USEC's ''aggressive selling ...
to generate cash'' has threatened to drive his company out of
business. This has been possible, he said, because of the large
amount of uranium USEC obtained from the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people are concerned that the long-term viability (of the
U.S. domestic uranium industry) is in danger. That's our primary
concern,'' said Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., whose districts includes
USEC's Paducah plant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it was
reexamining USEC's operating licenses because of the company's
financial difficulties, especially the recent downgrading or USEC's
credit rating to below investment grade levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've asked USEC to submit financial data to us to show that
they can continue to provide enrichment services. We have not made
any determination on the matter,'' NRC Chairman Richard Meserve
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Meserve ruled out closing any of the plants, even if the
financial data suggests a problem. Instead of lifting the license,
he said, ''we would report the matter to Congress and it would be
up to Congress to decide how to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Timbers, testifying at the House hearing, said the company's
financial difficulties stem from ''a triple whammy of fewer sales,
reduced revenues and greatly increased costs.'' Nevertheless, he
said ''everything is on the table'' in its search for ways to cut
costs. The company already has announced the planned layoff of 850
workers this summer at its two plants.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that USEC last fall had unsuccessfully sought a $200
million bailout from the government, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich.,
said when Lee Iacocca came to Washington, asking for money for
ailing Chrysler in the 1970s, he was earning a symbolic $1 a year
as the carmaker's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Timbers earned $1.2 million in salary and bonuses last year and
$151,000 from dividends on stock given to him as part of the
government sale. He also has negotiated a $3.6 million ''golden
parachute'' should he leave the company.
</P>
<P>
   Would he consider taking a pay cut, Rep. Richard Burr, R-N.C.,
asked Timbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''My salary has not been discussed in that context,'' replied
Timbers, adding that all but his $600,000 a year base salary is
linked to company performance and is at risk.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Toledo Vows Market Economy  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- For most of his Peruvian supporters, Alejandro
Toledo dresses in casual shirts and jeans, promising jobs and
education in messages garnished with measured doses of street
slang.
</P>
<P>
   For bankers and international lenders, the
economist-turned-candidate dons a suit and tie and eloquently
describes, in educated Spanish and near-perfect English, how he
will toe a tough fiscal line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to have a market-based economy but with a human
face,'' he told The Associated Press before Sunday's election.
''You don't have to be afraid of those words: human face. That's
what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the style Toledo has assumed to deliver that
message, it has propelled the 54-year-old former World Bank
official into position to possibly end President Alberto Fujimori's
10-year presidency in a runoff election.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has described his opponent as an undisciplined,
free-spender who would plunge Peru back into the economic chaos of
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't slowed down Toledo, who has gained a measure of
respect from foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, one of the world's largest investment banks, has
said it does not believe Toledo would ''engage in irresponsible
macroeconomic policy if elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has also faced barbs from Fujimori's supporters that he
is a phony, an actor who changes persona in accord with whatever
audience he faces.
</P>
<P>
   But pollster Manuel Torrado said Peru's poor majority does not
find anything unpresidential in chameleon-like behavior.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, Fujimori has deftly maintained a ''man of the
people'' image with regular jaunts into the nation's interior,
wearing a poncho when he is in the high Andes and an ankle-length
''cushma'' -- a cotton robe worn by several different Amazon tribes
-- when he is in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peruvians are used to that kind of metamorphosis because of
Fujimori,'' Torrado said.
</P>
<P>
   Born a bricklayer's son, Toledo says he shined shoes as a
youngster to help make ends meet. He went on to earn two graduate
degrees and a doctorate from Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has never held public office. He took less than 4 percent
of the vote in 1995, when Fujimori won a landslide re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But in this race, riddled with reports of government abuses and
accusations of fraud, Toledo has managed to cut deep into
Fujimori's bedrock support among the poor, capitalizing on a harsh
two-year recession.
</P>
<P>
   He promises to raise salaries of teachers, police and public
employees and to create at least 400,000 jobs by lowering taxes to
boost business investment. The message has a strong appeal in a
country where only half the labor force has steady work.

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Probe Ex-CIA Officer Case  </HEADLINE>
By C. BRYSON HULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A Justice Department investigation will be
launched in the 1993 arms-dealing case involving former CIA officer
Edwin P. Wilson, government attorneys say.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure came Thursday in the department's response to a
motion by Wilson to hold 17 current and former CIA and Justice
officials in contempt of court for allegedly hiding evidence that
would have helped his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''The allegations of this case have been referred to (the Office
of Professional Responsibility), which will conduct a thorough
investigation,'' a footnote near the end of the government's
eight-page motion said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice spokesman Myron Marlin said the department will not
begin looking into the matter until a court appeal by Wilson, 71,
is settled.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who was sentenced to 52 years in prison, is appealing
his federal conviction for illegally shipping 20 tons of plastic
explosives to Libya from Houston's Intercontinental Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson alleges prosecutors introduced into evidence a crucial
affidavit by then-CIA Executive Director Charles A. Briggs that
they knew was false.
</P>
<P>
   Now in a federal prison in Pennsylvania, Wilson contends the
affidavit swore he ''was neither asked or requested, directly or
indirectly, to provide any services, directly or indirectly, to the
CIA,'' after his 1971 retirement, except for one Libya-related
assignment for which he was paid $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nearly 800 pages of once-classified documents are
papers showing Wilson was asked to perform several dozen services
for the CIA, including acquiring an anti-tank weapon for an agency
operation and helping relocate a Laotian general who was a valuable
CIA source.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department on Thursday argued that no one
intentionally misled the judge and jury and that only someone who
was in the courtroom could have committed contempt. Of the 17, lead
prosecutor Theodore Greenberg was the only one in the courtroom
during the trial, and nothing he did constituted contempt, Justice
Department lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's attorney, David Adler, was skeptical that the OPR
investigation will lead to sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's anything that the government is incapable of doing,
it's investigating itself. OPR's record of investigating abuses by
the Justice Department is abysmal,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Disappointed couple sues Publisher's Clearing House  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORWICH, Conn. (AP) -- A disappointed couple who said they
dressed up and waited for the ''Prize Patrol'' on Super Bowl Sunday
is suing Publisher's Clearing House, claiming the mail order
company went too far in its efforts to sell them magazines.
</P>
<P>
   James and Cynthia Harnage of Norwich filed their lawsuit in
Norwich Superior Court this week, alleging the New York company
sent them repeated notices that they had won a $21 million ''Super
Prize'' in the company's sweepstakes. Their lawsuit claims fraud,
breach of contract and says the couple suffered emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to $21 million in damages, the Harnages asked for a
restraining order preventing the national company from sending
similar mailings to other unsuspecting victims. A court date has
not been set.
</P>
<P>
   The Harnages are the first Connecticut residents to sue the
company under the new federal Deceptive Mail Prevention and
Enforcement Act, Christopher L. Irving, director of consumer
affairs for Publisher's Clearing House, told The Norwich Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   Irving dismissed the suit as ''frivolous.'' He said the
company's practices have been challenged in court before and there
is nothing illegal about them.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said their ordeal began when they received a
''Document of Title'' purporting to be ''Official Correspondence''
from the publishing company. It stated ''Congratulations! Your
Recent Entry Was a Winner!'' and went on to say they were
''Approved for $21 million!''
</P>
<P>
   The Harnages said they were longtime subscribers to the clearing
house but had never received this type of correspondence. After
receiving several other notifications, they said they were
convinced they would receive the prize money on Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting to receive a knock on their door Jan. 20, they said
got all dressed up and waited. The knock never came.
</P>
<P>
   James Harnage, who was on worker's compensation at the time and
is now an unemployed retail manager, said the family spent money
they didn't have around Christmas anticipating the award.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they didn't show up, for six or seven weeks afterward I
felt useless,'' Harnage told The Bulletin. ''I felt like a fool for
being gullible enough to fall for it. I had thoughts of killing
myself. I think other people in my position might have done rash
things.''

	   MIAMI (AP) -- In a remarkable turn of events, Elian Gonzalez's relatives
dared the federal government to take him by force and won a court reprieve that
keeps the 6-year-old boy in the United States -- at least for a few more days.
The relatives defied the government's order to make Elian available Thursday for
a flight to Washington and a reunion with his father. In a last-minute plea for
their cause, they distributed a home video in which Elian tells his father he
does not want to return to Cuba.

in the electric chair early Friday after failing to win another 11th-hour

into the chair, Tarver talked briefly with his guards, then stared straight
ahead. Twice, he turned to look at his victim's children, but did not attempt to
communicate with them. In February, the U.S. Supreme Court granted Tarver a
temporary stay of execution to rule on his claim that Alabama's electric chair
is a "cruel and unusual punishment." The court later voted 5-4 not to consider
the issue.

presumptive GOP presidential nominee assured conservatives his social views were
intact, his opposition to ideas such as gay marriage unshaken by the hourlong

<HEADLINE> Report: EPA failing to protect children farmworkers frompesticides  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Children working on farms are not adequately
protected by the federal government from exposure to potentially
dangerous pesticides, according to a report by the nonpartisan
investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office report concluded that children in
farm fields ''are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of
pesticides and are not adequately protected from pesticide
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   The report released Thursday said the Environmental Protection
Agency's Worker Protection Standard is not enforced consistently
and treats children as adults.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when the EPA measures the amount of time that
should elapse before workers are allowed back into the fields after
pesticides are sprayed, it uses a body weight of 154 pounds - well
over the weight of a small child, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., requested the GAO probe along with
Reps. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.
But in a written response to the GAO, Marcia Mulkey, director of
pesticide programs, said EPA was reviewing its worker protection
standards. She said the agency agreed in concept with the report's
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Mull, executive director of the Association of Farmworker
Opportunity Programs, called the report's findings troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Department of Labor has found children as young as six
working in agriculture. We know that children far younger than that
are accompanying their parents into the field,'' she said. ''The
health of hundreds of thousands of children is at great risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Children age 13 and under may perform agricultural work with
parental permission and certain other restrictions, under
Department of Labor guidelines. While it is difficult to measure
exactly how many child workers there are at any one time, a Rutgers
University study in 1998 estimated that 290,000 children --
two-thirds of them 15 years or younger -- were working unlawfully in
America in 1997. The study analyzed census and other data.
</P>
<P>
   According to the EPA guidelines, the 154-pound benchmark can be
used to protect children 12 years old and up because ''their bodies
have less surface area and they perform less work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mull said that failed to take into account that children
''tend to roll right around in the dirt and plants'' more than
adults, increasing their exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The report called on the EPA to back up their claim that the
current standards are adequate for children ages 12 and up. Noting
that children under age 12 are even more vulnerable to pesticide
exposure, it recommended the EPA create separate standards for
them.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report said children under age 12 are at increased risk
because their internal organs are maturing, they fail to wear
clothing that protects them from exposure and they are involved in
more contact with plants and soil.
</P>
<P>
   The report also urged the EPA to expand its database on
pesticide-related illnesses and to improve the distribution of that
information, saying there was a general lack of reliable
information. It also recommended more consistent enforcement of
existing worker standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect EPA to implement these recommendations and report to
us on their progress,'' Waxman said.

<HEADLINE> Big Apple Is Big Winner in Fed Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York City and Los Angeles were the cities
that received the most federal funds last year, the government
says.
</P>
<P>
   The two urban areas got more federal dollars than 41 states.
</P>
<P>
   New York, the nation's most populated city with about 7.4
million residents, drew $44.2 billion in federal funding in fiscal
1999, according to data released today by the Census Bureau.
California's Los Angeles County was next among counties and
county-equivalent areas, as termed by the Census Bureau, at $43.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the federal government distributed $1.5 trillion in
funding in fiscal 1999, a 4 percent increase from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   About 48 percent, or $735 billion, went for three programs:
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The money covers items such
as domestic benefits, subsidies, grants, goods and services, and
salaries and wages.
</P>
<P>
   Federal direct payments to individuals for retirement and
disability in 1999 reached $523 billion, a 3.2 percent increase
over 1998, with Social Security alone totaling $415 billion, a 3.1
percent increase. Medicare payments were down 0.4 percent to $209
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department domestic spending, which includes payroll,
defense contracts and grants, and military pensions, totaled $237
billion in 1999, a 4.9 percent increase over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Among states, California received the most federal money, $166
billion, followed by New York at $102 billion and Texas at $98
billion.
</P>
<P>
   New York City and Los Angeles County, though, did not top the
list when it came to per capita spending: Fairfax City, Va., was
first at $101,192; New York City was 769th at $5,952, and Los
Angeles County was 1,653rd at $4,659.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fairfax City is immediately close to Washington, D.C. They are
heavily impacted with federal employees, so that means a lot of
defense and non-defense contracts, and the costs of salaries,''
said Gerard Keffer, chief of the Census Bureau's Federal Programs
Branch.

<HEADLINE> Metallica Files Copyright Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By RON HARRIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Heavy metal rock band Metallica has accused
three universities and the makers of a popular Internet music
sharing software of copyright infringement and racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit contends San Mateo, Calif.-based Napster
Inc., the University of Southern California, Yale University and
Indiana University encouraged users of Napster software to trade
copyrighted material without the band's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take our craft -- whether it be the music, the lyrics, or
the photos and artwork very seriously, as do most artists,''
Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich said in a statement on the Elektra
Records Web site. ''It is therefore sickening to know that our art
is being traded like a commodity rather than the art that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Napster software program allows Internet users to search for
and download music directly from each others' computer hard drives.
The music is stored in a digital format known as MP3.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica alleges the universities allowed free trade of
copyrighted songs to flourish by failing to block access to the
Napster sharing program, thereby violating the federal Racketeering
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based band filed the lawsuit in U.S. District
Court in Los Angeles on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regret that the band's management saw fit to issue a press
release -- and to file a lawsuit -- without even attempting to
contact Napster,'' said Eileen Richardson, the company's chief
executive officer. ''But if these people insist on turning it over
to lawyers, we'll defend the case on that turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster also has been sued by the Recording Industry Association
of America in federal court in San Francisco. The trade group,
which represents major recording labels, alleged copyright
infringement by Napster and is seeking $100,000 for each song
traded using Napster software.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Yale and USC were not immediately returned. A spokesman
for Indiana University said lawyers for the university had not seen
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven universities are known to have blocked access to
Napster because its use by students downloading audio files have
slowed their computer networks to a crawl.

<HEADLINE> Dog destroyed by judge's order but man on bench getting bit  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- It's the dream of every citizen startled by
a dog galloping amok: ridding the planet of the annoying mutt.
</P>
<P>
   But now a judge, who, allegedly without a hearing and no
witnesses other than himself, ordered the destruction of his
neighbor's 12-year-old beagle ''Baby'' because he saw it one day
running loose, is being accused of abusing that power.
</P>
<P>
   The state Commission on Judicial Conduct on Thursday recommended
removing Thomas R. Buckley from serving as justice in the town and
village courts of Dannemora, near Plattsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Baby's case was one of nine instances of alleged misconduct by
Buckley that were cited by the eleven-member panel. Buckley was
also accused of swearing at defendants and denying them fundamental
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''This record portrays a biased judge who routinely denies
defendants their fundamental rights and ignores proper criminal
procedure,'' the commission ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, 73, a retired phone worker, has been justice of
Dannemora's Town Court since 1987, and an acting Village Court
justice since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's ruling included an account of the judge writing
in his docket that he charged and forgave one defendant without the
accused ever being aware of the charge. He is also accused of more
than once refusing to recuse himself on cases with which he was
personally involved.
</P>
<P>
   Among the charges against Buckley:
</P>
<P>
   --In 1997, the judge allegedly misinformed a person heading to
jail of the day a tuberculosis test was given. The test was
mandatory for the person's entry to the jail. The court record says
that when the defendant explained why he had not reported for the
test, Buckley said he was not taking ''the (expletive) blame'' and
sent him to jail without bail.
</P>
<P>
   --Responding to one complaint, Buckley allegedly told the
commission there was something about a defendant that reminded him
of ''gypsy contractors'' so that he gave the accuser in the
harassment case, who was an acquaintance of the judge, more
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   --In one case, Buckley told the commission that he wanted to keep
a probate in jail for his own benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't want to know what I think'' of the ruling, Buckley
said Thursday when contacted at home. When told that his removal
was recommended, he said he agreed with the commission on that
determination and would not appeal to the state's highest court,
the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's all I can say that you can put in the paper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley added that he is considering resigning. If the
commission's ruling ousting him from the bench goes into force,
Buckley would be prohibited from ever holding judicial office again
in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Buckley's judicial fate, it comes too late for Baby,
who was killed last year after the judge's order.
</P>

   ''It was either that, or go to jail for her'' the dog's owner,
Mark Bordeau, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bordeau said that Buckley added insult to injury by his language
in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know any stupid ass that would go to jail over a
dog,'' the judge is quoted as saying in the commission's ruling.

<HEADLINE> Social Life Helps Prevent Dementia  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elderly people who live alone, have no friends or have a bad
relationship with their children are 60 percent more likely to
develop dementia than those whose social contacts are more
satisfying, a new study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Stockholm Gerontology Research Center at
Karolinska Institute in Sweden, whose study is published this week
in The Lancet medical journal, found that the more socially
isolated old folks were, the more likely they were to develop the
brain condition.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Suzman of the U.S. National Institute of Aging called
the research an intriguing and important extension of recent
findings that social engagement and close relationships are
powerfully associated with general health and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very good start, a very good first study,'' he said,
adding that he will remain skeptical that there is a real
protective effect of a social life until further research confirms
the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Dementia is a component of diseases such as Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe that by 2050, the ranks of the elderly, which
will include the Baby Boomers, will swell by at least 10 times what
it is today.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Dementia) is already a large problem, but it's going to
become an enormous problem unless there are ways to intervene,''
Suzman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish researchers asked 1,200 people aged 75 or older
whether they lived alone and had no friends to speak of, and
whether they had a unsatisfying relationship with their children.
</P>
<P>
   A bad relationship with their children was not defined by how
often they saw them or spoke to them, but by the quality of the
rapport.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists then monitored them for three years to see who
developed dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The people whose lives were lacking in all three areas were
considered to have a poor social network, while those who had two
of the factors were considered to have a limited social network.
</P>
<P>
   Those two groups together had a 60 percent higher chance of
developing dementia than their counterparts who had only one
negative aspect or an extensive social network.
</P>
<P>
   When each factor was taken separately, those who lived alone
were 50 percent more likely to develop dementia, as were those who
were friendless.
</P>
<P>
   A poor relationship with their children doubled the subjects'
chances of becoming demented.
</P>
<P>
   ''Particularly alarming is the indication that risks are higher
among those having unsatisfactory contact with children than among
those having no children at all,'' said Lisa Berkman of Harvard
University's School of Public Health in a critique of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman added that the sense of belonging and worthiness that
social ties bring may be an important buffer against the onset of
dementia. A diversity of relationships is critical and having one
strong bond is not enough, she hypothesized.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the study, about 176 people had developed dementia
and 300 others had died.
</P>
<P>
   Suzman said it remains unclear why social ties might protect the
elderly from dementia. He said it could be that social engagement
uses the cognitive functions of the brain, keeping it active.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might be that social networks buffer them from stress,''
Suzman said, adding that high cumulative levels of stress increase
the risk of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The study could not tell whether mild, undiagnosed brain decline
could have prompted the people to withdraw socially.
</P>
<P>
   It also could not show how long ago those leading isolated lives
had become cut off, which would make it difficult to predict
whether intervention later in life would do any good.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Spin Off Visteon  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE, AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will spin off its Visteon parts
unit to its shareholders, creating the world's second-largest
automotive supplier. It also plans to give its shareholders up to
$10 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The company said today that current Ford shareholders would get
100 percent of the shares in a newly independent Visteon Corp. That
transaction will take place this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe independence for Visteon will result in it being a
stronger competitor and is in the best long-term interest of both
Visteon employees and Ford Motor Company shareholders,'' Ford
chairman William Clay Ford Jr. said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second biggest automaker also announced a plan to
give its stockholders $20 per share or an equal value of new Ford
common stock. The cash payouts would be limited to $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company had been pressured to use its $11.5 billion cash
reserve for a stock buyback or other move to reward investors and
improve its stock price, which has been lagging in the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Scott Merlis with Wasserstein Perella Securities said
the reward for stockholders was much larger than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact Ford is willing to distribute $10 billion in cash to
its shareholders -- that's one of the best value enhancement
programs in the industrial world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's move to make Visteon independent follows General Motors
Corp.'s spin off of its Delphi parts unit last year, creating the
world's largest auto parts company.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that the parts companies will be stronger by
competing for business outside of their parent companies --
something they could not do well unless they're independent. The
automakers benefit by increasing competition -- thereby reducing
costs -- for parts.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said its shareholders would receive Visteon stock based on
the number of Ford shares they own and the total number of Ford
shares outstanding when the deal is completed. The exact ratio of
Visteon shares per Ford share has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Visteon has about 81,000 employees in 130 countries. It had
revenues of $19.4 billion and earnings of $735 million in 1999,
ranking behind Delphi and ahead of the auto parts division of
Robert Bosch GmbH of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year, Ford has made several moves toward pushing
Visteon out of the nest. Ford appointed Peter Pestillo, its
longtime head of labor relations, as the parts unit chairman and
CEO last fall. A Visteon separation was the central point in
negotiations with the United Auto Workers last fall.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Visteon salaried workers were told that paychecks
dated April 15 would be the first to sport the Visteon orange logo.
</P>
<P>
   Under the UAW contract, about 23,500 workers at Visteon will
remain Ford employees for life -- with Ford paychecks and pensions --
when Visteon becomes independent. Those workers also will be free
to transfer back and forth between Ford and Visteon.
</P>
<P>
   New workers at a separate Visteon would be covered by an
agreement that mirrors the one the UAW has with Ford; that
arrangement will continue for two contracts after the new deal
between the union and Ford expires.

   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's lower house of Parliament approved a bill
Friday meant to slash unemployment benefits despite growing
joblessness blamed on the prolonged economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits would be cut by more than 20 percent under the bill,
and premiums would be raised.
</P>
<P>
   Starting April 1, 2001, workers would pay 1.2 percent of wages
into the fund, up from 0.8 percent, said Yuichiro Ono, a lower
house official in charge of labor issues.
</P>
<P>
   The bill goes on to the less powerful upper house, but even if
it were to be rejected there, the lower house could implement it
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions to the unemployment insurance plan are compulsory.
Benefits payments last from 90 to 180 days. Those whose jobs were
lost in bankruptcy or restructuring get an additional 150 days.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's unemployment insurance program is facing difficulties
because of rising joblessness during the worst economic slump since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate rose to a record 4.9 percent in February.
The number of jobless people totaled 3.27 million, up 4.5 percent
from the same month a year ago.

   Consumer Prices Surge in March
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices jumped 0.7 percent in March,
the biggest gain in almost a year, led by sharp increases in
gasoline and other energy prices. The big advance reported today in
the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, the most closely
watched inflation gauge, was a worse showing than the 0.5 percent
rise many analysts were anticipating. The surge stemmed from a 4.9
percent increase in energy prices, the largest since last April.
Outside the volatile energy and food categories, the ''core'' rate
of inflation rose 0.4 percent, the strongest pace in five years.
The core rate rose twice as fast as many analysts were expecting.
The government said rising prices for housing, transportation and
household furnishings accounted for most of the increase.
</P>
<P>
   Business Inventories Rise 0.5 Percent
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department reported this morning
that business inventories rose 0.5 percent in February, following a
0.5 percent increase in January.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial Production Report Due
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve reports on industrial
production for March at 9:15 a.m. EDT today. Industrial production
at the nation's factories, utilities and mines rose at a
slower-than-expected pace in February as the output of cars,
carpeting and appliances fell after posting strong gains the month
before. The Federal Reserve reported that production increased by
0.3 percent in February, weaker than the 0.5 percent gain many
analysts were forecasting. That followed a big 1.1 percent leap in
production in January.

   Secret Code in Microsoft Software
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. engineers included a secret
password in Internet software that could be used to gain illegal
access to hundreds of thousands of Web sites, The Wall Street
Journal reported today. The rogue computer code was discovered in a
three-year-old piece of software by two security experts, the
newspaper said. Contained within the code is a derisive comment
aimed at a Microsoft rival: ''Netscape engineers are weenies!''
Steve Lipner, who manages the company's security-response center,
described such a backdoor password as ''absolutely against our
policy'' and a firing offense for the as-yet unidentified
employees.

   Iomega's Earnings up, Sales Down
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Iomega Corp.'s first-quarter profits
increased more than 50-fold, as cheaper operating costs for the
company's mainstay Zip computer storage drives more than offset a
decline in sales. The company earned $31.7 million, or 12 cents a
share, compared to $569,000, or zero cents per share, a year ago.
Those figures don't include a $20.1 million, one-time boost as the
company decreased funds set aside for taxes. Including those funds,
Iomega's net income for the first quarter of 2000 was $51.8
million, or 19 cents a share. The results blew past Wall Street's
expectations, which were pegged at just 4 cents a share, according
to First Call/Thomson Financial.

   BP Amoco, Arco Merger Approved
</P>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- More than a year after BP Amoco PLC
started its takeover of Atlantic Richfield Co., the path is finally
clear. The Federal Trade Commission voted yesterday to step out of
the way of the $27.6 billion deal after BP Amoco agreed to sell all
of Arco's Alaska assets to satisfy anti-competitive concerns. BP
Amoco has a tentative agreement to sell the Alaska holdings -- oil
and gas interests, tankers, pipelines and exploration rights -- to
Phillips Petroleum Co. for $7 billion. That sale must be completed
within 30 days. BP Amoco said it expects to complete its purchase
of Arco next Tuesday.

   Japan Says Economy Is Improving
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan today upgraded its assessment of the two main
pillars of private demand -- personal spending and capital
investment -- and said the economy is improving at a ''moderate
pace.'' In its monthly report for April, the Economic Planning
Agency cited signs of ''more buoyant'' corporate activity, and said
the economy is moving ''toward a sustainable recovery.'' The agency
said investment in plants and equipment is improving, primarily in
the manufacturing sector. In addition, the report suggested
personal spending may be close to turning a corner.

   Japan Corporate Bankruptcies Surge
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Corporate bankruptcies in Japan surged 39.9 percent
in March from a year earlier, marking the fifth consecutive
increase, a private credit research company said today. Most of the
1,770 bankruptcies hit smaller firms. All but 54 of them were
capitalized under 50 million yen, or $467,000, Teikoku Databank
said. Liabilities left behind by the insolvent companies last month
fell 46.4 percent from February to $6.04 billion, it said. For the
fiscal year ended March 31, the number of bankruptcies fell 3.5
percent to 16,887 from the previous fiscal year. Liabilities in the
latest reporting year totaled $105.24 billion, down 25.8 percent.

   Nasdaq Falls Another 92; Dow Drops 200
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell broadly yesterday after a spike in
wholesale inflation and some mixed reports on corporate earnings
rekindled the nervousness that has pervaded Wall Street all week.
Technology stocks, under mounting stress over their high
valuations, gave up a fragile advance and tumbled for a fourth
straight session. The Nasdaq composite index fell 92.85 to close at

rose as much as 145 points earlier in the session before collapsing
in the final hour of trading. The Dow plummeted 201.58 to close at
10,923.55, its steepest point drop since March 7. The Standard &AMP;

<HEADLINE> Continental plane lands safely after reporting landing gearproblem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A Continental Airlines jetliner returned
safely to Newark International Airport this morning after the pilot
reported a landing gear problem.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1141 left Newark for Atlanta at 6:45 a.m. carrying 116
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later the pilot declared an emergency and reported
he was turning back because the nose gear would not retract
properly, said Continental spokeswoman Michele Treacy.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot dumped fuel before returning to the airport, said
Steve Coleman, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency crews stood by as the MD-80 aircraft touched down
without incident at about 8:30.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Erica Conaty, 28, of New York, said passengers assumed
crash positions with their arms crossed on the seats in front of
them, but said the landing was very smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was extremely calm, and the flight attendants kept everyone
calm,'' she said. ''The captain did a perfect job.''
</P>
<P>
   After landing, the aircraft was towed to the terminal, and
passengers were put aboard other flights.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply lower Friday as inflation
jitters extended Wall Street's selling spree.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 141.54, or 3.8 percent, at
3,535.24 in the opening minutes of trading, dropping deeper into
bear market territory. It already had plunged 769 points, or 17
percent, in the first four days of this week. With the latest
decline, the technology focused average is off almost 30 percent
from its March 10 record of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   A bear market occurs when there is a sustained drop of more than
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 250.45, or 2.3 percent
at 10,673.10 in the early going. The blue-chip index is down a more
modest 9 percent from its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop in
high-tech stocks is a growing sense that investors pushed those
issues too far last year, when the Nasdaq rose an unprecedented 86
percent. The frenzy for technology stocks gave many young, unproven
companies market values they did not yet deserve, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   A government report Friday morning of an unexpectedly strong
rise in consumer prices in March added to Wall Street's unease.
</P>
<P>
   The figures rekindled worries that the Federal Reserve not only
would raise interest rates again, but might be even more aggressive
in trying to cool down the economy. The Fed has raised rates five
times since June, in each case with a quarter-point boost in
borrowing charges. Now there are worries the Fed's next move might
be a half-point increase.

<HEADLINE> Teens Sentenced To Attend Opera  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Dressed as a monk in a floor-length brown
robe, Kevin Bochiccio celebrates the momentary defeat of Napoleon's
forces at Rome, 1800.
</P>
<P>
   It's Thursday night at The Bushnell theater, where Bochiccio and
16 other Eastern Connecticut State University students who broke
campus rules have been ''sentenced'' to attend the opera ''Tosca''
instead of community service or other disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   Bochiccio even landed a bit part in the show.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore from Rindge, N.H., and two other students joined
Kirk Peters, associate dean of student affairs at the Willimantic
college, in a crowd scene during Act One of the Puccini opera.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was awesome,'' said Bochiccio, 19. ''I wasn't expecting
anything. I'd do it again -- voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   The students opted for the opera instead of working off the
hours given for various minor campus infractions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got caught with beer in the dorm,'' said Bochiccio. ''They
have a lot of things you can do like pick up trash. This seemed
like the best way.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Perkins, a sophomore from Beacon Falls, who also had beer
in the dorm, lacked enthusiasm before the show. But the
19-year-old, who also played a monk, had a different outlook after
Act 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was much better than I thought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 others, like Deborah Kitchen, joined the group just to
see the performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved the show,'' said Kitchen, a sophomore from Georgia who
had never been to the opera. ''It's definitely not punishment. It's
a privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar sentences have been meted out all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Alexandria, La., it was punishment by country music. Two men
who pleaded guilty to violating a noise ordinance last month were
ordered to attend a three-hour music appreciation session focused
on their least favorite genre -- country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to put them in a room without a window because I'm
afraid they'd jump,'' Judge Tom Yeager joked.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Lupton, Colo., noise scofflaws -- most of whom get in
trouble for playing their stereos too loud -- gather once a month,
on a weekend night, to listen to court-selected songs.
</P>
<P>
   The offenders are mostly young, so there is a heavy dose of
lounge music, including Wayne Newton and Dean Martin, plus some
Navajo flute music, bagpipes and John Denver songs.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the students seemed intrigued as they watched the
Connecticut Opera from their balcony seats. The romantic drama
about a strong-willed diva named Floria Tosca trapped in a web of
political and sexual intrigue proved to be a crowd-pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   Many students chuckled softly at Tosca's jealousy. A few cringed
as Tosca stabbed the police chief, Baron Scarpia, to death. At
least one student shed a tear as Tosca jumped to her death after
learning her revolutionary lover had been executed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very exciting,'' said Larry Drew, who came to Tosca
even though he was not in trouble. The Preston freshman attended
''The Magic Flute'' last semester after being busted with beer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It inspired me. I got a little culture in me,'' said Drew, the
fourth monk. ''I have a different appreciation for the opera.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was just elevator music, but it's really people
singing their hearts out.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters, a former radio and television news producer, created the
new policy. He said his colleagues originally questioned his idea,
saying it wasn't discipline.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the Alternative Restitution Program began in the
fall, university officials are coming around.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a great way to expose students to something
new,'' said Kim Silcox, campus hearing officer.
</P>
<P>
   Peters said he was pleased with Thursday's turnout, with more
than twice as many students participating than the four previous
trips. He hopes to make it a monthly excursion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe it didn't change their lives,'' said Peters, ''but they
got a new appreciation for the opera.''

<HEADLINE> Playboy Trying Another Casino Club  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Playboy Enterprises Inc., whose British casino
gambling licenses were revoked in the early 1980s, has signed a
letter of intent with Ladbroke Casinos Ltd. to develop a London
gaming club.
</P>
<P>
   The Playboy Casino Club will offer casino gaming, dining
facilities and a bar, the company said Thursday. The complex will
also feature a separate nightclub and retail space. Several West
End locations are currently under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed London casino would be operated by a joint venture
company, in which Ladbroke will own an 80.1 percent interest with
Playboy initially owning 19.9 percent, with an option to increase
to 49 percent. In addition, the joint venture will enter into a
trademark licensing agreement under which Playboy will receive a
licensing fee.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy spokesman Bill Farley says the joint venture is subject
to approvals from the Gaming Board of Great Britain and the
appropriate licensing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   If the government approves, Ladbroke will transfer one of its
gaming licenses to the joint venture, with a Playboy Club opening
in London in 18 to 24 months, Farley said.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy casinos, including the Playboy Club on Park Lane, were a
mainstay of London's party scene in the 1960s and remained open
until 1981, when their gambling licenses were revoked because of
violations of British gaming regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy chairman and CEO Christie Hefner said the company's
marketing expertise will combine with Ladbroke's extensive
operating experience. Ladbroke Casinos is a division of Ladbroke
Group PLC, a British hotel and gambling company with gaming
operations in Britain, Egypt and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based Playboy Enterprises publishes Playboy magazine,
operates two television networks and distributes programming via
home video and DVD globally. The company also operates Playboy.com
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy posted losses in fiscal 1999 of $5.3 million on revenue
of $347.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Spin Off Visteon Parts Unit  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE, AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will spin off its Visteon parts
unit to its shareholders, creating the world's second-largest
automotive supplier. It also plans to give its shareholders up to
$10 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The company said today that current Ford shareholders would get
100 percent of the shares in a newly independent Visteon Corp. That
transaction will take place this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe independence for Visteon will result in it being a
stronger competitor and is in the best long-term interest of both
Visteon employees and Ford Motor Company shareholders,'' Ford
chairman William Clay Ford Jr. said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second biggest automaker also announced a plan to
give its stockholders $20 per share or an equal value of new Ford
common stock. The cash payouts would be limited to $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company had been pressured to use its $11.5 billion cash
reserve for a stock buyback or other move to reward investors and
improve its stock price, which has been lagging in the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Scott Merlis with Wasserstein Perella Securities said
the reward for stockholders was much larger than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact Ford is willing to distribute $10 billion in cash to
its shareholders -- that's one of the best value enhancement
programs in the industrial world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Ford was up 2
percent, or $1.18} a share at $55.62{.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's move to make Visteon independent follows General Motors
Corp.'s spin off of its Delphi parts unit last year, creating the
world's largest auto parts company.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that the parts companies will be stronger by
competing for business outside of their parent companies --
something they could not do well unless they're independent. The
automakers benefit by increasing competition -- thereby reducing
costs -- for parts.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said its shareholders would receive Visteon stock based on
the number of Ford shares they own and the total number of Ford
shares outstanding when the deal is completed. The exact ratio of
Visteon shares per Ford share has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Visteon has about 81,000 employees in 130 countries. It had
revenues of $19.4 billion and earnings of $735 million in 1999,
ranking behind Delphi and ahead of the auto parts division of
Robert Bosch GmbH of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year, Ford has made several moves toward pushing
Visteon out of the nest. Ford appointed Peter Pestillo, its
longtime head of labor relations, as the parts unit chairman and
CEO last fall. A Visteon separation was the central point in
negotiations with the United Auto Workers last fall.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Visteon salaried workers were told that paychecks
dated April 15 would be the first to sport the Visteon orange logo.
</P>
<P>
   Under the UAW contract, about 23,500 workers at Visteon will
remain Ford employees for life -- with Ford paychecks and pensions --
when Visteon becomes independent. Those workers also will be free
to transfer back and forth between Ford and Visteon.
</P>
<P>
   New workers at a separate Visteon would be covered by an
agreement that mirrors the one the UAW has with Ford; that
arrangement will continue for two contracts after the new deal
between the union and Ford expires.

jitters extended Wall Street's selling spree.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down as much as 161 points in the
opening minutes of trading before recovering some lost ground. It
was down 76.61, or 2.1 percent, at 3,600.17 at midmorning, dropping
deeper into bear-market territory.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-focused index already plunged 769 points, or 17
percent, in the first four days of this week, and it is now at its
lowest level since early December. With the latest decline, the
Nasdaq is off almost 30 percent from its March 10 record of
5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   A bear market occurs when there is a sustained drop of more than
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 218.18 points at
10,705.37. It had been down even more earlier. The blue-chip index
is down a more modest 9 percent from its Jan. 14 record of
11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market barometer, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index,
was off 20.41 at 1,420.10.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop in
high-tech stocks is a growing sense that investors pushed those
issues too far last year, when the Nasdaq rose an unprecedented 86
percent. The frenzy for technology stocks gave many young, unproven
companies market values they did not yet deserve, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   A government report Friday morning of an unexpectedly strong
rise in consumer prices in March added to Wall Street's unease.
</P>
<P>
   The figures rekindled worries that the Federal Reserve not only
would raise interest rates again, but might be even more aggressive
in trying to cool down the economy. The Fed has raised rates five
times since June, in each case with a quarter-point boost in
borrowing charges. Now there are worries the Fed's next move might
be a half-point increase.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates slow the expansion of business by making
it more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest losers this morning, Emulex was off 28 5/16 at
54| on dismal results for its third fiscal quarter. And JDS
Uniphase was down 5 13/64 at 87 7/64.
</P>
<P>
   There were some gainers, however. Sun Microsystems was up 2} at
80{ as investors responded to its favorable earnings report late
Thursday. And Ford Motor was up 1 at 55 7/16 after the company said
it would spin off its Visteon auto parts unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks was off 11.64 at
477.58.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues led advancing issues by more than a 3-to-1
margin. Volume was 148.9 million shares vs. 148 million shares the
same time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Markets overseas also were broadly lower: Japan's Nikkei stock
average fell 0.45 percent. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX
index was down 2.58 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 2.77
percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 3.07 percent.

<HEADLINE> Postal Men Get $250,000 for Moves  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Postal Service paid more than $142,000 to
move one of its vice presidents 10 miles and about $106,000 to move
another 30 miles, while both continued to report to work at the
agency's Washington headquarters, a postal spokeswoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives are M. Richard Porras, the chief financial
officer and executive vice president, and John H. Ward, controller
and vice president for finance. Both are advisers to Postmaster
General William J. Henderson and manage the annual budget of more
than $63 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Postal executives moving to new duty assignments usually have to
relocate at least 50 miles to be eligible for a ''relocation
benefit,'' but these two received exceptions after being promoted
in 1998, spokeswoman Judy de Torok said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that it's essential to be able to reward top level
executives,'' she said in an interview. ''We need executives
focused on the priorities and responsibilities of their new jobs
and not concerned with the details of a move.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson issued a statement defending the action.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision to provide benefits was reviewed at the time
from both a legal and ethical standpoint, and was found to be
consistent with our policies, which establish benefit programs
comparable with those in the private sector,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Henderson added that the agency's inspector general
will review the policy at the request of Rep. John McHugh, R-N.Y.,
chairman of the House Government Reform post office subcommittee
</P>
<P>
   The two executives independently negotiated their benefit
packages as a condition of accepting their new positions, de Torok
said. She added that in recent months, several postal officials and
executives had left for better paying jobs in private industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service, a semi-independent part of the government,
does not use taxpayer money to fund its operations.
</P>
<P>
   The executives' benefit packages included $25,000 for each as a
''miscellaneous allowance'' that covers moving fees like new
carpets, curtains or a plumber's bill for hooking up clothes
washers and driers, de Torok said.
</P>
<P>
   Porras' moving benefit included about $12,000 for the
transportation of household goods and storage and about $37,000 for
real estate expenses. Ward's expenses included about $7,000 for
storage and transportation and about $32,000 for real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives said they wanted the relocation benefits
because they were tired of long commutes, The Washington Post
reported in its Friday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Porras moved 10 miles to be closer to a Postal Service training
academy and Washington Dulles International Airport. Ward moved 30
miles and now lives three miles from headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The average relocation of a postal executive costs about
$80,000, de Torok said. The Postal Service moved about 1,200
officials in 1998, with eight officials exempted from the 50-mile
rule.

<HEADLINE> Precede WASHINGTON  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODBURY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton today proposed
using at least $750 billion of the federal budget surplus over the
next 10 years to eliminate the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech this morning to more than 1,300 business and civic
leaders on Long Island, Clinton said that if the federal government
dedicates 40 percent of its budget surplus to reducing the debt,
the United States would be in the black in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   She told the Long Island Association that if she's elected to
the Senate, her top priority would be the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything else we want to do -- from health care and research,
for education for public schools and higher education, or the
environment -- everything else we want to do depends on us making
the right decisions about where we go with the economy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She opposes proposals for across-the-board tax cuts currently
being promoted by the Republican leadership in Congress. Clinton
said she would reject ''any risky tax plan that would bust a hole
in that budget and put our prosperity at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, she scrapped plans to headline a charity dinner for
an Arab-American group because representatives from the Israeli
Embassy were not invited. Several Arab states do not recognize the
state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Mosaic Foundation is made up of the wives of Arab
ambassadors to the United States who raise money for charity. This
year's dinner on May 3 is to benefit Save the Children. Clinton has
served as honorary chairwoman for the dinner for the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Kim Serafin called her decision to
back out ''a classic Clinton flip-flop.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is courting New York's large Jewish population in her
bid for the U.S. Senate against Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a federal civil rights panel postponed discussion of
a report said to criticize Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's New York City
Police Department amid news that the panel's chairwoman had
contributed to the first lady's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights denied any connection.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop Giuliani from denouncing the probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't take much to figure out this is a political
operation,'' Giuliani said Thursday after a campaign stop on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Newsday reported the panel's chairwoman, Mary Frances Berry,
contributed $250 last year to Clinton and another $300 to the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which has pledged support
to her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   Berry defended her donation.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have a right to make campaign contributions to anyone
they please,'' Berry said Thursday. She said she would continue to
participate in the commission's discussion of the NYPD.
</P>
<P>
   ''It (the report) is about Giuliani's office, not Giuliani. It's
about the police department in New York. It's not about Hillary
Clinton and it's not about the senatorial campaign,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's spokesman, David Aronson, said it was unclear
when the draft report would be discussed and declined to explain
the delay. The report had been scheduled for discussion today.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member commission is preparing a report on the NYPD
that is expected to be highly critical and could call for the
appointment of a federal monitor to oversee the department. The
commission began its probe into the police force last year in the
wake of the shooting of Amadou Diallo and the torture of Abner
Louima at the hands of New York City cops.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing held by the commission in New York City last May,
Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir defended the police
force. But the Rev. Al Sharpton and others described the NYPD as
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Six members of the commission were appointed by Democrats and
two by Republicans. The panel has no enforcement powers but can
make recommendations to the president, Congress and federal
agencies.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans June Germany Summit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will travel to Germany in
June for a summit on ''third way'' politics, part of a larger
European trip.
</P>
<P>
   Others invited for the June 2-3 summit are leaders from
Argentina, Brazil, Britain, Chile, France, Israel, Italy, South
Africa, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The session, convened by German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
deals with ''progressive governance,'' also called third-way
governance, an alternative to the traditional liberal/conservative
approaches. It continues discussions that began in Florence, Italy,
in November.
</P>
<P>
   The White House confirmed Thursday that Clinton would attend the
summit as part of a longer European trip. The German government
announced the visit Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While abroad, Clinton also will pick up the prestigious
Charlemagne prize in Aachen and take part in a European Union
summit in Lisbon, Portugal, on May 30-June 1. From Germany, Clinton
is expected to go to Moscow to meet with new Russian President
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting including Clinton had originally been scheduled for
May in Berlin, but was postponed after British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said he couldn't make it because of elections for London
mayor.

   Nasdaq Down 124; Dow Down 207
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply lower this morning as
inflation jitters extended Wall Street's selling spree. Just before
11 a.m. EDT, the Nasdaq composite index was off 124.66 at 3.552.12.
It had been down as much as 161 points earlier in the session. The
technology-focused index already plunged 769 points, or 17 percent,
in the first four days of this week, and it is now at its lowest
level since early December. The Dow Jones industrial average was
down 207.94 at 10,715.61. Analysts say the most fundamental reason
for the drop in high-tech stocks is a growing sense that investors
pushed those issues too far last year, when the Nasdaq rose an

many young, unproven companies market values they did not yet

   Consumer Prices Surge in March
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices jumped 0.7 percent in March,
the biggest gain in almost a year, and above the 0.5 percent many
analysts had expected. The Labor Department reported the rise was
fueled by sharp increases in gasoline and other energy prices.
Outside the volatile energy and food categories, the ''core'' rate
of inflation rose 0.4 percent, the strongest pace in five years.
The core rate rose twice as fast as many analysts were expecting.
The government said rising prices for housing, transportation and
household furnishings accounted for most of the increase.
</P>
<P>
   Business Inventories Rise 0.5 Percent
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department reported today that
business inventories rose 0.5 percent in February, following a 0.5
percent increase in January.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial Production Up 0.3 Pct.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve said today that industrial
production at the nation's factories, utilities and mines rose 0.3
percent in March, as expected, a fresh sign that the manufacturing
sector is on solid footing. Operating capacity, meanwhile, edged
down to 81.4 percent, well below levels associated with a pickup in
inflation.

access to hundreds of thousands of Web sites, The Wall Street
Journal reported today. The rogue computer code was discovered in a
three-year-old piece of software by two security experts, the
newspaper said. Contained within the code is a derisive comment
aimed at a Microsoft rival: ''Netscape engineers are weenies!''
Steve Lipner, who manages Microsoft's security-response center,
described such a backdoor password as ''absolutely against our
policy'' and a firing offense for the as-yet unidentified
employees.

   Iomega's Earnings Up, Sales Down
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Iomega Corp.'s first-quarter profits
increased more than 50-fold, as cheaper operating costs for the
company's mainstay Zip computer storage drives more than offset a
decline in sales. The company earned $31.7 million, or 12 cents a
share, compared to $569,000, or zero cents per share, a year ago.
Those figures don't include a $20.1 million, one-time boost as the
company decreased funds set aside for taxes. Including those funds,
Iomega's net income for the first quarter of 2000 was $51.8
million, or 19 cents a share. The results blew past Wall Street's
expectations, which were pegged at just 4 cents a share, according
to First Call/Thomson Financial.

   BP Amoco, Arco Merger Approved

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- More than a year after BP Amoco PLC
started its takeover of Atlantic Richfield Co., the path is finally
clear. The Federal Trade Commission voted yesterday to step out of
the way of the $27.6 billion deal after BP Amoco agreed to sell all
of Arco's Alaska assets to satisfy anti-competitive concerns. BP
Amoco has a tentative agreement to sell the Alaska holdings -- oil
and gas interests, tankers, pipelines and exploration rights -- to
Phillips Petroleum Co. for $7 billion. That sale must be completed
within 30 days. BP Amoco said it expects to complete its purchase
of Arco on Tuesday.

shareholders would get 100 percent of the shares in a newly
independent Visteon Corp. That transaction will take place this
summer. ''We believe independence for Visteon will result in it
being a stronger competitor and is in the best long-term interest

   Japan Says Economy Is Improving
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan today upgraded its assessment of the two main
pillars of private demand -- personal spending and capital
investment -- and said the economy is improving at a ''moderate
pace.'' In its monthly report for April, the Economic Planning
Agency cited signs of ''more buoyant'' corporate activity, and said
the economy is moving ''toward a sustainable recovery.'' The agency
said investment in plants and equipment is improving, primarily in
the manufacturing sector. In addition, the report suggested
personal spending may be close to turning a corner.

   Japan Corporate Bankruptcies Surge
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Corporate bankruptcies in Japan surged 39.9 percent
in March from a year earlier, marking the fifth consecutive
increase, a private credit research company said today. Most of the
1,770 bankruptcies hit smaller firms. All but 54 of them were
capitalized under 50 million yen, or $467,000, Teikoku Databank
said. Liabilities left behind by the insolvent companies last month
fell 46.4 percent from February to $6.04 billion, it said. For the
fiscal year ended March 31, the number of bankruptcies fell 3.5
percent to 16,887 from the previous fiscal year. Liabilities in the
latest reporting year totaled $105.24 billion, down 25.8 percent.

black in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   She told the Long Island Association that if she's elected to
the Senate, her top priority would be the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything else we want to do -- from health care and research,
for education for public schools and higher education, or the
environment -- everything else we want to do depends on us making
the right decisions about where we go with the economy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She opposes proposals for across-the-board tax cuts currently
being promoted by the Republican leadership in Congress. Clinton
said she would reject ''any risky tax plan that would bust a hole
in that budget and put our prosperity at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, she scrapped plans to headline a charity dinner for
an Arab-American group because representatives from the Israeli
Embassy were not invited. Several Arab states do not recognize the
state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Mosaic Foundation is made up of the wives of Arab
ambassadors to the United States who raise money for charity. This
year's dinner on May 3 is to benefit Save the Children. Clinton has
served as honorary chairwoman for the dinner for the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Kim Serafin called her decision to
back out ''a classic Clinton flip-flop.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is courting New York's large Jewish population in her
bid for the U.S. Senate against Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a federal civil rights panel postponed discussion of
a report said to criticize Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's New York City
Police Department amid news that the panel's chairwoman had
contributed to the first lady's Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights denied any connection.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop Giuliani from denouncing the probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't take much to figure out this is a political
operation,'' Giuliani said Thursday after a campaign stop on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Newsday reported the panel's chairwoman, Mary Frances Berry,
contributed $250 last year to Clinton and another $300 to the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which has pledged support
to her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   Berry defended her donation.
</P>
<P>
   ''People have a right to make campaign contributions to anyone
they please,'' Berry said Thursday. She said she would continue to
participate in the commission's discussion of the NYPD.
</P>
<P>
   ''It (the report) is about Giuliani's office, not Giuliani. It's
about the police department in New York. It's not about Hillary
Clinton and it's not about the senatorial campaign,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's spokesman, David Aronson, said it was unclear
when the draft report would be discussed and declined to explain
the delay. The report had been scheduled for discussion today.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member commission is preparing a report on the NYPD
that is expected to be highly critical and could call for the
appointment of a federal monitor to oversee the department. The
commission began its probe into the police force last year in the
wake of the shooting of Amadou Diallo and the torture of Abner
Louima at the hands of New York City cops.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing held by the commission in New York City last May,
Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir defended the police
force. But the Rev. Al Sharpton and others described the NYPD as
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Six members of the commission were appointed by Democrats and
two by Republicans. The panel has no enforcement powers but can
make recommendations to the president, Congress and federal
agencies.

<HEADLINE> Miller Office Workers Back Strike  </HEADLINE>
By TODD RICHMOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Office workers at Miller Brewing Co.'s
corporate headquarters have authorized their union to call a strike
if contract talks fail.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 employees voted Thursday on a strike issue for the
first time in 20 years and 97 percent agreed to let their
bargaining agents schedule a walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Office &AMP; Professional Employees International Union, Local 35,
said there was no immediate strike date. It represents about 200
workers in the corporate headquarters and brewery such as
accounting clerks, payroll specialists and schedulers.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people took a real stance,'' union business manager Judy
Burnick said. ''They want to send a strong message to the company
that they won't accept a concessionary contract. These employees
are prepared to strike. That's a big step when you haven't had a
strike vote in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders and Miller officials are to resume discussions
April 19 with a federal mediator. Miller is optimistic about a
settlement, company spokeswoman Dianne Markut said. Miller is the
nation's second biggest brewer after Anheuser-Busch Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have talked since February when a three-year
contract expired. The latest contract extension expires April 29.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in health-care premiums and wage increases tied to
merit have been at the center of discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's proposal calls for increasing family health-care costs
by nearly $100 a month, Burnick said, while office workers at
Miller breweries in North Carolina and Texas pay $16 a month for
family coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are also frustrated with a clause that provides wage
increases on a merit basis. That plan allows only three to four
employees to earn top performer status, the union said. Union
negotiators want a straight 3.5 percent increase instead.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled once again today as already
nervous investors reacted to worse-than-expected inflation news.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, deeply entrenched in bear territory,
was off 146.37 at 3,530.41 in late morning trading, near its lows
of the session.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-focused index already plunged 769 points, or 17
percent, in the first four days of this week, and it is now at its
lowest level since early December. With the latest decline, the
Nasdaq is off almost 30 percent from its March 10 record high close
of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   A bear market occurs when there is a sustained drop of more than
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 241.45 at 10,682.10.
The blue-chip index is down a more modest 9 percent from its Jan.
14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market barometer, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index,
was off 23.39 at 1,417.12.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop in
high-tech stocks is a growing sense that investors pushed those
issues too far last year, when the Nasdaq rose an unprecedented 86
percent. The frenzy for technology stocks gave many young, unproven
companies market values they did not yet deserve, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   A government report Friday morning of an unexpectedly strong
rise in consumer prices in March added to Wall Street's unease.
</P>
<P>
   The figures rekindled worries that the Federal Reserve not only
would raise interest rates again, but might be even more aggressive
in trying to cool down the economy. The Fed has raised rates five
times since June, in each case with a quarter-point boost in
borrowing charges. Now there are worries the Fed's next move might
be a half-point increase.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates slow the expansion of business by making
it more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe that this portends a pick up inflation, but
feel that some people on the Street will think it does,'' said
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist for Merrill Lynch. ''We caution
that today's CPI figure may have a negative market impact if it is
not outweighed by other factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest losers this morning, Emulex was off 37 15/16
at 45 on dismal results for its third fiscal quarter. And JDS
Uniphase was down 5 at 87 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   There were some gainers, however. Sun Microsystems was up 4
15/16 at 82 11/16 as investors responded to its favorable earnings
report late Thursday. And Lucent was up 1 15/16 at 55\.

475.89.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Won't Ask For Pardon  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton heatedly said Thursday ''I'm
not ashamed'' about being impeached and ''I'm not interested'' in
being pardoned for any alleged crimes in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal and Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did not say whether he would accept a pardon if it
were offered by his successor. Republicans immediately pounced on
his failure to answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   ''The answer is I have no interest in it. I wouldn't ask for it.
I don't think it would be necessary,'' the president told the
convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. ''I am
prepared to stand before any bar of justice I have to stand
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance brought forth his most emotional outpouring
yet about the impact of the sex-and-lies Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've paid quite a lot,'' he said. ''I struggled very hard to
save my relationship with my wife and my daughter.... I made a
terrible mistake of which I am deeply regretful. But I think that
the average, ordinary person reviewing the wreckage left in that
would say that I paid for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was obviously irritated that the pardon and impeachment
issues arose in a question-and-answer session after he spoke to
editors about the Republicans' $1.83 trillion budget. He boasted
about the nation's booming economy and criticized the GOP budget as
''loaded with exploding tax breaks and untenable cuts in critical
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   After his address, the first question was whether Clinton would
request or accept a pardon. It was a subject Clinton has never
directly addressed, although his former lawyer Charles F.C. Ruff,
told the House impeachment hearings in 1998 that the president
would not pardon himself nor accept a pardon. Vice President Al
Gore, in what his office said was a reference to Ruff's comment,
repeated that assertion in an appearance before the editors
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton remains under a legal cloud despite being acquitted of
perjury and obstruction of justice charges by the Senate last year
after his impeachment by the House. Independent Counsel Robert Ray,
who succeeded Kenneth Starr in the investigation of the Whitewater
and Lewinsky cases, has said he has hired additional prosecutors
and was considering whether to indict Clinton after he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
   The president angrily called the Whitewater investigation ''a
lie and a fraud from the beginning'' and railed that ''no one has
written the full story yet.'' He snapped at the audience, ''I can
imagine why you wouldn't, particularly, given the way a lot of this
has been covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ended his answer with a curt command: ''Next question.''
He promptly was asked if his presidential library would have a wing
to deal with impeachment saga of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll have to deal with it, it's an important part of it,''
Clinton said. But he then said, ''I am proud of what we did there
because I think we saved the Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed his impeachment battle as part of a struggle
against the Republican crusade that began with the GOP takeover of
the House in 1994 and led to the government shutdown in 1995. ''We
beat back the Contract on America (the GOP agenda). Then we had to
beat it in the impeachment issue,'' Clinton said. ''Then we had to
beat it when I vetoed the (GOP) tax cut last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said voters rendered their verdict when they re-elected
him in 1996 and boosted the Democrats' strength in the House in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''But as a political matter, you have no idea -- I'm not ashamed
of the fact that they impeached me,'' the president said. ''That
was their decision, not mine. And it was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a matter of law, the Constitution and history, it was
wrong,'' Clinton continued. ''And I am glad I didn't quit and I'm
glad we fought it. And the American people stuck with me, and I am
profoundly grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   He called his impeachment ''one of the major chapters in my
defeat of the revolution'' led by former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich. He said Gingrich's agenda ''would have taken this country
in a very different direction than it's going today and also would
have changed the Constitution forever, in a way that would have
been very destructive to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart sharply criticized the
editors for their questions -- limited to four by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are purportedly reasonably intelligent people but I
think it demonstrates just how isolated some newspaper editors are
from the rest of the country,'' Lockhart said. ''They get a chance
to ask the president about anything, any challenges that face
America and ... the best they can come up with is two questions
about impeachment. The country has moved past this. Unfortunately
many major newspaper editors haven't. It may be some reason for
declining circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   In reply, N. Christian Anderson III, ASNE president and
publisher-chief executive officer of The Orange County Register,
expressed regret that the White House limited the number of
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''All four questions were thoughtful and concerned issues that
are on the minds of many Americans represented by newspaper editors
who are much closer to their communities than Mr. Lockhart might
imagine,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson seized on
Clinton's pardon answer, noting the president merely said he would
not ask for nor want a pardon. ''Perhaps the question of the year
is whether or not he will accept a pardon,'' he said. ''Once again,
Clintonian speak rears its ugly head.''

<HEADLINE> BMW Receives Rival Offer for Rover  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Automaker BMW said Friday it has received
a rival offer for its ailing British subsidiary Rover from a group
led by a onetime Rover executive but gave few details on the bid.
</P>
<P>
   BMW said it had received a letter outlining the new proposal
from a group that includes John Towers, a former Rover CEO who left
the company in 1996. The luxury German carmaker said it would
review the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, BMW announced its plan to sell the money-losing
Rover to Alchemy, a group of British venture capitalists. No price
was ever announced, leading to speculation that BMW was either
giving Rover away or actually paying Alchemy to take the British
automaker off its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Alchemy plans to buy Rover's main Longbridge plant in central
England and turn it into a niche producer of sports cars under the
name MG Car Co. Alchemy has no experience with car manufacturing,
however, and significant job losses are anticipated by the unions.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Towers means BMW must now consider the new offer
against the rival bid from Alchemy. BMW said it was leading
parallel negotiations with both Alchemy and Towers.
</P>
<P>
   Towers has hinted that he would make a bid that would keep Rover
as a volume car producer, contradicting Alchemy's plans to slim
down production.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before Towers launched his bid, British Trade Secretary
Stephen Byers said Towers' plan ''offers a better prospect than
perhaps anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He believes that by working together with the work force there
is a real chance of a far better prospect for the future than is
being offered by Alchemy,'' Byers told the British Broadcasting
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A union leader welcomed the new bid by Towers, who was at Rover
for eight years and is now chief executive of components company
Concentric.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are pleased that this bid has been tabled and we hope it
will be considered as a serious alternative,'' said Roger Lyons,
general secretary of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Britain announced a $3.2 million aid package Friday
to help companies that supply goods to Rover survive the
automaker's proposed sale.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go toward support, advice and training for the
firms most affected by the move.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Friday as inflation jitters
extended Wall Street's selling spree.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index had plunged 229.85, or 6.3 percent,
at 3,446.93 at late morning, dropping deeper into bear-market
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq already had plunged 769 points, or 17 percent, in the
first four days of this week. With the latest decline, the
technology-focused average is off almost 32 percent from its March
10 record of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   A bear market is considered a sustained drop of more than 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 303.81, or 2.8
percent, at 10,619.74 at late morning. The blue-chip index was down
a more modest 9.4 percent from its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop in
high-tech stocks is a growing sense that investors pushed those
issues too far last year, when the Nasdaq rose an unprecedented 86
percent. The frenzy for technology stocks gave many young, unproven
companies market values they did not yet deserve, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   A government report Friday morning of an unexpectedly strong
rise in consumer prices in March added to Wall Street's unease.
</P>
<P>
   The figures rekindled worries that the Federal Reserve not only
would raise interest rates again, but might be even more aggressive
in trying to cool down the economy. The Fed has raised rates five
times since June, in each case with a quarter-point boost in
borrowing charges. Now there are worries by investors that the
Fed's next move might be a half-point increase.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few bright spots in the market Friday were Sun
Microsystems, which issued a strong earnings report after the close
of trading Thursday, and Ford, which said Friday it was giving up
to $10 billion in cash to shareholders.

<HEADLINE> German Bank To Review Failed Merger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Bank has scheduled a special
supervisory board meeting next week to discuss the consequences of
its failed merger with Dresdner Bank, a company spokesman said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche spokesman Walter Schumacher confirmed a report by the
Die Welt newspaper that supervisory board chairman Hilmar Kopper
called the meeting at the request of board member Margret
Moenig-Raane, the head of HBV administrative workers union. The
meeting is set for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also reported that another board member, Gerhard
Renner of the DAG office employees union, has criticized how
Deutsche Bank head Rolf Breuer handled the planned merger.
</P>
<P>
   ''His conduct in the past weeks does not indicate leadership
qualities,'' the report quoted Renner as saying, although he
stopped short of demanding that Breuer step down.
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism from many, Breuer has said he is sticking to
his job of making Deutsche Bank a successful international
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Dresdner Bank pulled out of the planned merger April 5, accusing
Deutsche Bank of violating the terms of their month-old agreement
by trying to sell Dresdner's money-making investment banking arm,
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Dresdner's Chairman Bernhard Walter had announced the next day
he would step down to take responsibility for the failed merger.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Dresdner said it has no plans to spin off its
investment bank, but will give Dresdner Kleinwort Benson more
management autonomy to guarantee ''a flat and efficient leadership
structure.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks took a beating today, sending the Nasdaq
composite index and Dow Jones industrials plunging more than 300
points each, as already nervous investors were further upset by to
worse-than-expected inflation news.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, deeply entrenched in bear territory, was off 291.56
at 3,385.22 in midday trading after falling as much as 301.67.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-focused index already plunged 769 points, or 17
percent, in the first four days of this week, and it is now at its
lowest level since early December. With the latest decline, the
Nasdaq is off more than 32 percent from its March 10 record high
close of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   A bear market occurs when there is a sustained drop of more than
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 362.68 at 10,560.87.
The blue-chip index is down almost 10 percent from its Jan. 14
record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market barometer, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index,
was off 57.67 at 1,382.84.

<P>
   ''It was a momentum market on the way up, it is a momentum

Bruce Steinberg, chief economist for Merrill Lynch. ''We caution
that today's CPI figure may have a negative market impact if it is
not outweighed by other factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest losers this morning, Emulex was off 37 45/64

problems shifting to new products. The value of LML Payment Systems
was cut in half, down 14} at 14}.

<HEADLINE> CDC Panel Suggests More Flu Shots  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- An advisory panel at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention recommended Friday that people 50 and older,
instead of just those 65 and older, receive annual flu shots.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said it was recommending the age change because 24
percent to 32 percent of people ages 50-65 have at least one
chronic health condition that places them at high risk of
hospitalization and death if they get the flu.
</P>
<P>
   But only about 40 percent of people 50-64 with chronic
conditions got flu vaccinations in 1997, and fewer than one-third
in that age range without such health problems were vaccinated that
year, according to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 Americans die from the flu each year.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's recommendations are usually adopted by the CDC,
and most doctors generally follow CDC guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also said that large-scale vaccination programs,
such as those held at corporations and community centers, should be
held in mid-October or later to reduce the chance that vaccine will
not be available.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers may not have an abundant supply available until
later in the fall, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The government says flu vaccination is the most effective method
of preventing the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The panel noted some good news in its report -- among those 65
and older, vaccination levels increased from 33 percent in 1989 to
63 percent in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Judge blocks NYC welfare contracts  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge blocked the city from awarding more than
$100 million in welfare-to-work contracts to a company with ties to
a former adviser to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice William Davis agreed with City
Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who said the contract approval process had
been ''corrupted.'' The judge said Hevesi does not have to follow
city law and register, or give final approval to, two contracts
worth $104 million to Maximus of McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Maximus was hired to help move thousands of welfare recipients
into employment, job training or treatment under the Giuliani
administration's plan to overhaul the city's welfare program.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Hevesi refused to register 17 workfare contracts to
Maximus and other companies worth about $469 million, saying they
were not awarded through a competitive bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts had been awarded through a procedure allowed in
some cases as an alternative to sealed bids, if the mayor approves.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi accused Giuliani of corrupting the process ''to provide
public benefits for his political cronies.'' He was referring to
Richard Schwartz, a former mayoral adviser and architect of the
welfare-to-work programs. His company, Opportunity America, a
subcontractor of Maximus, stood to get about 30 percent of the $104
million, Hevesi said.
</P>
<P>
   Because city law requires the comptroller to register a contract
if the mayor approves them, Hevesi registered 15 contracts ''under
protest'' but refused to register the other two involving 80,000
welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani sued over the issue, but the judge said Hevesi has
broad powers over city finances and is charged with ensuring
compliance with rules for procuring contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ''His objections should be considered, especially where, as
here, there is compelling evidence that the contracting process has
been corrupted,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Maximus and welfare officials had met as early as four
months before the city asked for contract proposals. The judge also
said Maximus denied to city officials that another company helped
prepare its proposal, and denied being investigated for crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Davis noted that Opportunity America had helped prepare the
contracts and that Maximus was the subject of a federal
investigation involving its attempts to get a contract from West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But David Mastran, chief executive officer of Maximus, said
company officials ''believe that the contracting process was fair,
open and competitive. Maximus did not have a competitive advantage
over others vying for the same contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi said he was ''gratified by the judge's decision, which
confirms our finding that the contract process was corrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about workfare, which I support,'' he said. ''This
is about a corrupt process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Kahn, the lawyer who argued the city's case, promised
an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that the decision was incorrect, that the
contracting process was proper and legal and carefully designed to
move thousands of welfare recipients into meaningful jobs,'' Kahn
said.

<HEADLINE> 'Roswell' Gets New Time Slot  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Once upon a time there was a critically
acclaimed television show, an ahead-of-its-time teen angst drama
called ''My So-Called Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Low ratings killed it. Then its writer gave birth to an adult
version -- ''Relativity.'' It suffered the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows were forerunners of this season's spate of teen and
adult dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jason Katims, who brought those two intelligent shows to
television, is at it again, with ''Roswell'' -- a ''My So-Called
Life''-meets-''The X-Files'' drama based on the ''Roswell High''
book series by Melinda Metz about the fabled 1947 spaceship crash
in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: One of the most fun and well-written shows about
teen-agers on television this season is in danger of being cut from
the WB's lineup. Now it's being aired Mondays in a new time slot (9
p.m. EDT) against Fox's ''Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Come on, WB. There are at least five reasons to renew it.
</P>
<P>
   Reason 1: The team of Katims and ''X-Files'' veteran David
Nutter.
</P>
<P>
   The two have put together a show that proves that teens are
indeed an alien breed -- long-suffering, confusing, a bit hysterical
yet resilient. Katims and Nutter also have threaded an intelligent
alien conspiracy through the show, using a proven formula popular
with ''X-Files'' audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ''With 'Roswell,' we can tell a story about people trying to
find who they are in this world with life-and-death stakes, stories
that have a largeness,'' Katims said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a recent episode one of the three teen aliens
(played by 22-year-old newcomer Brendan Fehr) is beaten by his
alcoholic foster father -- a real bad guy -- who keeps him around for
the monthly check. Between a rock and no place, the teen makes a
choice that frees him from the beatings but leaves him out in the
cold -- literally. From there, it's all about making the right
choices and living with the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the bad guy gets it in the end from a mysterious
alien shape-shifter.
</P>
<P>
   Reason 2: Executive producer Jonathan Frakes.
</P>
<P>
   A ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' veteran, Frakes knows
something about compelling sci-fi, not to mention first-season
ratings struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had listened to everybody that first season on 'Next
Generation,' it wouldn't have survived,'' he said. ''The key to
both shows -- 'Next Generation' and 'Roswell' -- is that although
both deal with outer space and aliens, the shows are really about
relationships -- loyalty, friendship, commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Reason 3: The cast.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Behr, 26, and Shiri Appleby, 21, star as out-of-this-world
soul mates, supported by a strong ensemble with Fehr, Majandra
Delfino, 19, Katherine Heigl, 21, and Colin Hanks, 22.
</P>
<P>
   If they seem a little young, they have the adult supervision of
the often underrated William Sadler (''Shawshank Redemption'').
</P>
<P>
   Like the characters they play, the ''Roswell'' actors know they
are in it together, for better or worse. They've been seen, sans
Sadler, around town bowling, going to dinner and, at least in one
case, doing karaoke together (''Pretty cheesy, but fun,'' says
Behr).
</P>
<P>
   Heigl (''My Father, the Hero'') says part of the reason the
chemistry works on the show is the off-screen chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a dynamic there that extends beyond the set,'' she
said. ''It's not often you get to work with a bunch of people you
really like. They are really good at what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Frakes publicly compares this cast to that of the ''Next
Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When we first started 'Next Generation,' the only person in
the cast anyone had heard of was LeVar Burton,'' Frakes recalled.
''The cast of 'Roswell' reminds me a lot of us when we were first
starting out on 'Next Generation' -- excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reason 4: The fans.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Nielsen ratings and look to the target audience, the ones
who have helped establish ''Roswell'' as a cult favorite on the
Internet with more than 100 Web sites referring to the show (two
dozen popping up last month alone), praising everything from the
cast's out-of-this-world good looks to the supposed alien
conspiracy in our midst.
</P>
<P>
   Reason 5: ''Roswell'' is simply better than most anything else
in prime-time these days. Especially those millionaire shows.
</P>
<P>
   So WB, what's the final answer?
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in television ....
</P>
<P>
   JONI TRIBUTE: She sat smoking a cigarette and eating a banana as
fellow musicians paid homage. Joni Mitchell took a relaxed attitude
toward what she described as the ''surreal'' experience of TNT's
''All-Star Tribute to Joni Mitchell.'' It premieres Sunday at 9
p.m. EDT. Elton John, James Taylor, k.d. lang, Wynonna, Diana
Krall, Cassandra Wilson and Sweet Honey in the Rock were among the
artists who performed Mitchell songs. Elton John, who pounded out
''Free Man in Paris'' on the piano, said playing a Joni Mitchell
song while the author watched was more intimidating than playing
for the queen of England. Mitchell caps the tribute with her own
performance, singing ''Both Sides Now'' with a full orchestra.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Cops Plan Protest Strategies  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Washington police are waging a battle of wits
with protesters who promise to disrupt meetings of world finance
ministers Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Symbols of the psychological battle were laid out on a
Washington street corner Thursday when Police Chief Charles Ramsey
plunked down on the sidewalk metal and plastic tubes, chains and
chicken wire.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 tubes and other equipment were seized from two
protester vehicles Wednesday night after they were driven from the
Maryland suburbs to the District of Columbia. Ramsey readily
admitted that his officers knew from intelligence operations that
the devices were coming.
</P>
<P>
   From the protester side, the tubes -- dubbed ''lock boxes'' or
''sleeping dragons'' -- represent a new way to keep police from
easily breaking human chain blockades.
</P>
<P>
   Used in protests last December against the World Trade
Organization in Seattle, one demonstrator inserts an arm on each
side and uses a clip to keep the hand inside. The tube is then
wrapped in chicken wire, covered with tar and overlaid with duct
tape. The tape is designed to hide the material underneath, which
in turn is designed to foil any attempt to saw through the tube.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers were happy to show reporters the plain tubes,
but wouldn't describe the covering material. Ramsey and his top
deputies were only too happy to describe the finished device, which
the chief said was ''very effective.'' But Ramsey had yet another
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The department has formed a special unit that includes officers
who are volunteer firefighters. The unit will use equipment that
extricates victims from car wrecks, but police wouldn't be more
specific.
</P>
<P>
   Just yards away from Ramsey, Han Shan, of the Mobilization for
Global Justice, pledged the protests would be nonviolent. He
launched into the demonstrators' now-familiar complaints against
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, the targets of this
week's protests.
</P>
<P>
   Police faced another disruption today.
</P>
<P>
   Driving a rented dump truck festooned with signs ''World Bank:
Meat Stinks,'' a man dressed in a cow costume dumped four tons of
manure on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the World Bank. The truck
pulled over to the shoulder of the avenue, which remains open to
traffic, and dumped the load just outside security barricades
surrounding the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Police quickly removed the signs from the truck and arrested the
driver and his passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters contend the lending institutions impose harsh
repayment penalties on poor countries, prevent spending on social
programs, back projects that destroy the environment and allow
unfair labor practices.
</P>
<P>
   The National Lawyers Guild, a legal group voluntarily helping
the protesters, complained to Attorney General Janet Reno about the
arrests of seven people in the two vehicles carrying the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The area around the World Bank ''resembles an occupied city,''
the group wrote Reno about the heavy police presence in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The police also have been purposely vague about their planned
tactics this weekend. Ramsey wouldn't say whether demonstrators who
blockaded streets would be arrested automatically or allowed to
remain in place -- especially on Sunday, when downtown Washington
traffic is light.
</P>

   ''We could make thousands (of arrests) but I hope we don't have
to make any,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He warned protesters that ''a lot of these devices are more
dangerous to the individuals than the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have let it be known that they have spent some $1 million
for new helmets, shin guards, gloves and other riot gear and
planned to wear their bulletproof vests.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Assistant Chief Terry Gainer said the chances of
police using tear gas was ''slim and remote,'' but then noted
medical aid stations would be set up to have it flushed from
anyone's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Effective crowd control is more about psychology than brute
force,'' says Robert W. Klotz, a consultant on police crowd control
and a former deputy police chief in Washington. ''There's no
one-size-fits-all method for crowd control.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing for The Washington Post last Sunday, Klotz' theory was
that police must react to patterns of behavior. Most demonstrators
''want a simple show of numbers'' to support their point of view,
he said. Others want to engage in civil disobedience and be
arrested. And some want to do violence and cause injuries, he said,
with each situation requiring its own response.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by The George Washington University, which is near
World Bank headquarters, to close from tonight through Tuesday has
given students the chance to stage their own protest.

<HEADLINE> CDC Panel Backs More Flu Shots  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- An advisory panel at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention recommended Friday that people 50 and older,
instead of just those 65 and older, receive annual flu shots.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said it was recommending the age change because 24
percent to 32 percent of people ages 50-65 have at least one
chronic health condition that places them at high risk of
hospitalization and death if they get the flu.
</P>
<P>
   But only about 40 percent of people 50-64 with chronic
conditions got flu vaccinations in 1997, and fewer than one-third
in that age range without such health problems were vaccinated that
year, according to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 Americans die from the flu each year.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's recommendations are usually adopted by the CDC,
and most doctors generally follow CDC guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also said that large-scale vaccination programs,
such as those held at corporations and community centers, should be
held in mid-October or later to reduce the chance that vaccine will
not be available.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers may not have an abundant supply available until
later in the fall, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   The government says flu vaccination is the most effective method
of preventing the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The panel noted some good news in its report -- among those 65
and older, vaccination levels increased from 33 percent in 1989 to
63 percent in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Team Formed To Warn on Steroids  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Medical researchers are trying to find a way
to warn young people and body builders that steroids are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The newest effort will involve a combination of the Internet,
post cards and alert bulletins, the National Institute on Drug
Abuse announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The institute has set up an Internet site at
www.steroidabuse.org and said it will distribute 250,000 copies of
a Community Drug Alert Bulletin and 150,000 copies of an updated
report about anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Also, 500,000 postcards with messages about the harmful effects
of steroids are being distributed during April in nearly a thousand
locations nationwide, including gyms, movie theaters, shopping
malls, bookstores, restaurants and clubs.
</P>
<P>
   NIDA said use of steroids has increased from 2 percent of
10th-graders in 1998 to 2.7 percent last year and that studies show
fewer people are worried about their long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about body image and athletic performance may be
leading teens, as well as adult men and women, to use steroids, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Anabolic steroids is the common name for synthetic substances
related to testosterone, the male sex hormone. While these drugs
have medical uses, such as treating delayed puberty and some types
of impotence, their use can also cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   According to NIDA, the abuse of anabolic steroids can reduce
sperm production, shrink the testicles, and cause impotence and
irreversible breast enlargement in boys and men. Girls and women
can develop more masculine characteristics such as deepening of the
voice and excessive body hair.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, abuse of anabolic steroids can stunt bone growth in
adolescents and damage the heart, liver and kidneys, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Institute in the public education effort are the
National Collegiate Athletic Association, American College of
Sports Medicine, American Academy of Pediatrics, National
Association of School Nurses, National Federation of High Schools,
International Students in Action and Dr. Drew Pinsky, host of MTV's
''Loveline'' and drDrew.com.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 360; Nasdaq Down 243  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plummeted Friday as inflation jitters
extended Wall Street's selling spree.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index had tumbled 243.32, or 6.6 percent,
at 3,434.46 by afternoon, dropping deeper into bear-market
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq already had plunged 769 points, or 17 percent, in the
first four days of this week. With the latest decline, the
technology-focused average was off 32 percent from its March 10
record of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   A bear market is considered a sustained drop of more than 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 360.59, or 3.3
percent, at 10,562.96 by early afternoon. The blue-chip index was
down a more modest 10 percent from its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop in
high-tech stocks is a growing sense that investors pushed those
issues too far last year, when the Nasdaq rose an unprecedented 86
percent. The frenzy for technology stocks gave many young, unproven
companies market values they did not yet deserve, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a momentum market on the way up; it is a momentum
market on the way down,'' said Nick Sargen, an investment
strategist for J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   A government report Friday morning of an unexpectedly strong
rise in consumer prices in March added to Wall Street's unease.
</P>
<P>
   The figures rekindled worries that the Federal Reserve not only
would raise interest rates again, but might be more aggressive in
trying to cool down the economy. The Fed has raised rates five
times since June, each time by a quarter-point in borrowing
charges. Now, some investors fear a half-point increase.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few bright spots in the market Friday was Sun
Microsystems, which issued a strong earnings report after
Thursday's trading session.
</P>
<P>
   Markets overseas also were broadly lower: Japan's Nikkei stock
average fell about 0.5 percent before trading began on Wall Street.
In Europe, where trading ended as Wall Street shares were tumbling,
key indexes fell 2.8 percent in Britain, 3.2 percent in France and
3.1 percent in Germany.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Arthritis Drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A third new drug for people suffering from the
pain of arthritis has been approved by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has approved
meloxicam tablets for the treatment of osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Meloxicam will be marketed under the name Mobic by Boehringer
Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals and Abbott Laboratories and is expected
to be available in early May. The wholesale price is expected to be
$1.98 per tablet and dosage is once a day.
</P>
<P>
   Mobic is the third new arthritis drug approved in the last two
years, joining Celebrex and Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and
other pills to relieve pain. But these can cause ulcers, stomach
bleeding and other side effects, especially in long-term users.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical trials Mobic had a low instance of gastrointestinal
side effects, the manufacturer said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices plunged today, pulling the Dow
Jones industrials and Nasdaq composite index down hundreds of
points as investors responded to new inflation reports with furious
selling.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading, the Dow was down 449.94 at 10,473.61,
near its lowest levels of the day. The blue-chip index is down
almost 11 percent from its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq tumbled as much as 301 points before recovering some
of the lost ground. By midafternoon, it was down 236.06, or by 6.4
percent, at 3,413.72, dropping deeper into bear-market territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq already had plunged 769 points, or 17 percent, in the

   Shares of Schwab were off 5 9/16 at 42 11/16, while Morgan

<HEADLINE> Detroit Cops Probe Serial Killings  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr., Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Police worldwide are trying to match a suburban
Detroit man's account of at least 16 slayings since the early 1990s
to information they have about unsolved murders in their cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the investigation keeps going on, bodies keep popping up.
The numbers keep increasing,'' Detroit Police Officer Octaveious
Miles said Thursday. ''There is a similar pattern that ties them
all together that creates a trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators warned that John Eric Armstrong, a
26-year-old husband and father, may be exaggerating. Though Detroit
police say they have physical evidence linking him to the deaths of
five prostitutes, agencies elsewhere have been unable to tie him to
any unsolved slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are gaps in his timeline that we are concerned about,''
Detroit police Cmdr. Dennis Richardson told the Detroit Free Press.
''However, nothing outside of Michigan has been confirmed yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, of Dearborn Heights, was arraigned today on five
charges of murder and three attempted murders of Detroit-area
prostitutes. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   District Court Magistrate Irma J. Chenevert-Bragg entered
innocent pleas for Armstrong as he hung his head, trying to avoid
TV cameras lining the courtroom wall. He was ordered held without
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is suspected in at least 11 other slayings since 1992:
three in the Seattle area, including the lone male victim, two in
Hawaii, two in Hong Kong and one each in North Carolina, Virginia,
Thailand and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Armstrong spent eight years as a crewman aboard the
USS Nimitz, going from port to port strangling women. He may also
be linked to the deaths of several prostitutes in Japan, Korea and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, he told us he either killed, or tried to kill,
every prostitute he'd ever had sex with,'' Assistant Police Chief
Marvin Winkler told The Detroit News. ''He expressed remorse
several times, and was crying like a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   However, police in Newport News, Va., said Thursday they have
not yet found any connection between Armstrong and any unsolved
murders in the area based on when the Nimitz was there.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was arrested early Wednesday in an area of Detroit
frequented by prostitutes, whom he seemed to target in particular,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began when police found the bodies of three
strangled prostitutes in a Detroit railroad yard on Monday. They
had been placed there over the past month.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know when you find three bodies at different states of
being decomposed ... you know it is the same person. The scene kind
of talks to you,'' Winkler said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy began investigating after receiving a call from the
FBI, Navy Lt. Cmdr. Larry Thomas said. The Navy was trying to
confirm the suspect's identity and whether he had been enlisted.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong moved eight months ago to Dearborn Heights and has
worked for the past month at Detroit Metropolitan Airport as an
aircraft refueler.
</P>
<P>
   Police said he asked for help and was cooperating with their
investigation. He was answering questions without a lawyer present,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared lucid, although a psychological exam likely will
follow arraignment, Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Robert
Agacinski said.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist, investigators realized Armstrong had called in the
report of a body found in the Rouge River Jan. 2, Dearborn Heights
police Lt. Gary Tomkiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong told police he spotted the body of 39-year-old Wendy
Jordan while he was leaning over a bridge to vomit, Tomkiewicz
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was unusual circumstances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler said the first slaying that police think is linked to
Armstrong occurred in 1992 in North Carolina. Police in Armstrong's
hometown of New Bern, N.C., said he has no criminal record there.

<HEADLINE> Europe Stocks Lower on U.S. Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- European stocks fell Friday after the release of
stronger-than-expected American consumer price data pulled down
U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies fell
10.82 points, or 2.8 percent, to 374.13, while the Dow Jones Stoxx
50 Index fell 156.8 points to 4,795.0.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. stocks fell after an economic report indicated that
consumer inflation jumped higher than expected last month. The news
helped keep the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index firmly in
bear-market territory -- it is now off more than 30 percent from its
March 10 high.
</P>
<P>
   Pan-European technology index Easdaq lost 5.0 percent, while the
London-based TechMARK and Frankfurt's Neuer Markt had similar
losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in
countries that joined the single currency, ended down 12.46 points
at 418.33. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was down 147.1 points
at 5,034.3.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Lawson, technology analyst for Teather and Greenwood, said
that although the global technology slide was a much-needed reality
check, ''the growth that underpins these companies hasn't
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicts a bumpy ride before the Nasdaq corrects, as wary
investors sell into any recovery.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Milan, Europe's key bourses ended lower as
both U.S. technology and blue-chip stocks fell on data that showed
the consumer price index grew at the fastest rate in five years
during March.
</P>
<P>
   London's FTSE-100 Share Index fell 2.8 percent, to 6,178.1, with
technology, telecom and media stocks falling furthest.
</P>
<P>
   Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index fell 3.1 percent to 7,214.83, with
losses across the board, and Siemens and SAP the heaviest losers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Study Delves Into Gulf War Illness  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A study has found a possible link between
antibodies to a natural molecule used in experimental vaccines and
unexplained illnesses afflicting thousands of military personnel
who served in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulane University Medical School study found high levels of
antibodies to squalene in a large percentage of sick veterans
vaccinated for Gulf War service.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials dismiss the study as flawed and say none of
the vaccines administered during the Gulf War contained squalene.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to congressional pressure, the Defense
Department late last month asked the Armed Forces Epidemiological
Board to review the study. The National Academy of Sciences'
Institute of Medicine also is reviewing the research and assessing
what, if any role squalene may play in Gulf illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''All known, testable hypotheses concerning illnesses among Gulf
War veterans have been or are being pursued,'' Sue Bailey, the
assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, told Rep. Jack
Metcalf, R-Wash., in a letter last month.
</P>
<P>
   Squalene is a cholesterol-builder in humans and also is found in
vegetable oils, shark liver oil, cosmetics and various health
supplements. The Defense Department and National Institutes of
Health in the late 1980s began researching the use of squalene in
vaccines in an effort to make vaccines more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Defense officials told the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, that they considered -- but decided
against -- using vaccines with squalene during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulane study, published in the February issue of
Experimental and Molecular Pathology, found that all but two of 38
sick veterans who served in the Gulf and received at least one
vaccination had elevated squalene antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Another six sick veterans who were vaccinated but did not go to
the Gulf produced similar results, according to the study. Those
results were blinded, meaning the researchers did not know the
source of blood samples.
</P>
<P>
   Non-blinded portions of the study found 59 of 86 Gulf War-era
veterans, civilian employees and military contractors tested
positive for squalene antibodies, although it was not known how
many of those were vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups, including the general public and sick non-veterans
with symptoms similar to Gulf illnesses, rarely tested positive for
the antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulane study offered no conclusions as to whether Gulf War
vaccines contained squalene, what might have produced the squalene
antibodies or what -- if any -- role the antibodies played in the
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the research ''sets off alarm bells'' that should prompt
more investigation into Gulf War vaccines and the safety of
vaccines that contain squalene, said Pam Asa, an immunologist from
Memphis, Tenn., and the lead researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. Garry, a study author and immunologist at Tulane, said
the results may not point to vaccines containing squalene but that
veterans could have produced the antibodies as the result of
receiving so many vaccines at one time, or from some other organism
in a vaccine that may mimic squalene.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials question the study methods, saying
researchers did not verify the validity of their antibody test
before they began using it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because I question the method of the test, I have to question
all of the findings,'' said Lt. Col. John Grabenstein, deputy
director of the military's anthrax vaccine immunization program.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julius Cruse, editor and chief of the journal that published
the study, defended the study, saying it was peer reviewed by 10 to
12 clinicians.
</P>
<P>
   Ten members of Congress, led by Metcalf, want the Pentagon to
consider using the Tulane test on other veterans, saying it could
help answer questions about Gulf illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon says an estimated 90,000 troops who served in the
Gulf War complain of illnesses such as fatigue, skin rashes,
headaches and muscle and joint pain. Defense officials have not
ruled out pesticides, stress and pyridostigmine bromide, an
experimental drug given to troops to protect against the nerve
agent soman, as possible contributors to some of the illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Seniors To Help Refill Labor Supply  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   They'll be managing offices in Chicago, leading tours in Utah,
bagging groceries in San Diego and flipping burgers in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement-age Americans, newly freed from earnings limits
imposed by Social Security, will soon be putting in longer hours,
much to the glee of retailers, restaurants, vacation spots and
other employers stressed out because of worker shortages.
</P>
<P>
   While the newly employed seniors won't immediately reshape the
work force, economists say they could help curb inflation by
increasing the labor supply.
</P>
<P>
   Employers say their high-quality work ethic will be a good
influence on others.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're very dependable. They work real well with our younger
people, and they're really customer service-oriented,'' says Karen
Poppe, human resource director at Wall Drug, a big Western-style
restaurant, museum and tourist haven in South Dakota. The repeal of
the earnings limit ''will enable them to work more, and we'll hire
more because more are willing to come to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced by the tightest labor market in memory, Congress last
month voted unanimously to repeal Depression-era legislation in
which people ages 65 to 69 lost $1 in Social Security benefits for
every $3 in wages above an annual limit of $17,000. President
Clinton signed it April 7.
</P>
<P>
   The law, retroactive to Jan. 1, immediately affects about
800,000 Social Security recipients who are working and another
100,000 who haven't sought benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the beginning of a longer-term trend of older
workers as baby boomers close in on retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 13 percent of those age 65 or older work, according
to the American Association of Retired People, but most baby
boomers have indicated in recent surveys that they intend to work
at least part time at that age.
</P>
<P>
   Experts see several effects of freeing the 65-to-69 age group to
work without penalties.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, states with the largest percentages of seniors and
the most tourist jobs may reap the biggest rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional retirement havens of Florida and Arizona may see
more white-collar and technology jobs as telecommuting gives older
professionals more opportunities, says John Challenger, chief
executive of Chicago-based Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an
executive-level employment firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're moving into an era when technology is going to be a
tremendous boon for people over 60,'' Challenger says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, inflationary pressures should decline as employers
have a larger job pool to choose from. Productivity should rise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't look for a dramatic impact,'' says Murray Weidenbaum,
director of the Center for the Study of American Business at
Washington University in St. Louis. ''But I would expect the result
would be more production, more employment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Policy Innovation, a Dallas-based think tank,
estimates that abolishing the earnings limit will add $19.5 billion
to the gross domestic product by 2008. By 2010, workers would be
paying enough in extra taxes to offset the extra money Social
Security will pay out.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't a cure for the nation's labor woes, by any means.
But for part-time and season opportunities, it'll help bring senior
citizens back into the work force,'' says Charles Tews, head of
Tews Co. Staffing in Winter Park, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Tews plans to renew recruiting efforts at senior citizen centers
for his temporary-employment agency; because of the earnings limit,
he didn't have much luck there in the past. Already, his agency has
fielded a number of applications and inquiries since the limit was
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's, the nation's largest restaurant chain, already
employs about 26,000 people over age 55. Most of its restaurants
are independent franchises, so officials said they couldn't
estimate how much that number might increase now.
</P>
<P>
   But company spokesman Walt Riker suggested that their working
hours are almost certain to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the past, seniors (between 65 and 69) would work behind the
counter almost with one eye on the calendar'' to make sure they
didn't work enough shifts to draw the Social Security penalty, he
said. ''Now, they can work as long as they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Lee, 66, a longtime social worker and health educator,
says the repeal won't erase hiring discrimination against the
elderly, but reflects a growing realization that at 65 people are
''not just ready for the retirement home.''
</P>
<P>
   She had already decided it was worth paying a price for the
privilege of working and being productive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have retired several times, and come back to work every
time,'' says Lee, program coordinator for the federal Retired
Senior Volunteer Program in Cleveland. ''This time I'm going to
work until I drop -- and now I won't have to pay the penalty for
it.''

<HEADLINE> What Is Squalene?  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Squalene is a natural molecule that government and
private
researchers have tested in vaccines to make them more effective.
The Food and Drug Administration has not approved any vaccines
containing squalene for use in the United States.
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLUAD, a flu vaccine containing squalene, has been approved in
Italy and is being considered for approval in all of Europe. Chiron
Corp., based in Emeryville, Calif., has distributed 500,000 doses
of FLUAD in Italy and has evaluated 18,500 people who took the
adjuvant containing squalene in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have found it to be safe,'' said Dr. Andrea Langenberg,
senior director of clinical development for Chiron.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Asa, an immunologist from Memphis, Tenn., said animal
studies show adjuvants with squalene can induce autoimmune diseases
-- where the immune system attacks itself -- such as arthritis and an
animal version of multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials say no Gulf War vaccines contained squalene.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, said
in a March 1999 report requested by Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash.,
that ''we cannot say definitively'' whether Gulf War veterans were
given vaccines with squalene.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said Defense officials did not have documentation on the
process and results of vaccine decision-making. Some officials
involved in the decision no longer work for the Pentagon, declined
to be interviewed or could not be located, the GAO said.

   NASD Vote Backs For-Profit Spinoff
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The National Association of Securities Dealers
said today that its members overwhelmingly approved a plan to spin
off part of the NASD's computerized Nasdaq Stock Market as a
for-profit company. An NASD spokesman said 3,423 members, or 84
percent of those who cast ballots, voted in favor of the plan,
while 652 voted against it. A number of firms abstained. The
announcement came a day after the leader of a group of small
brokerage firms filed a lawsuit in New York, claiming the proposal
is unfair to small NASD members. A judge yesterday rejected the
request to block today's announcement. But another hearing is
scheduled for Monday to resolve the larger issues raised in the
suit, including the request for a preliminary injunction to block
the sale.

   Consumer Prices Surge in March
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices jumped 0.7 percent in March,
the biggest gain in almost a year, and above the 0.5 percent many
analysts had expected. The Labor Department reported the rise was
fueled by sharp increases in gasoline and other energy prices.
Outside the volatile energy and food categories, the ''core'' rate
of inflation rose 0.4 percent, the strongest pace in five years.
The core rate rose twice as fast as many analysts were expecting.
The government said rising prices for housing, transportation and
household furnishings accounted for most of the increase.

   Microsoft Admits Code in Software
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. today said that a security flaw
in its Internet software, reportedly thought to have been
deliberately placed there by company engineers, was simply the
result of old software code. Scott Culp, a manager for Microsoft's
security response team, said the company discovered that the
5-year-old piece of code inadvertently gave certain users access to
multiple Web site pages housed on the same server computer.
However, Culp denied reports that the hole was deliberately placed
there by Microsoft employees. Culp told The Associated Press that
the only deliberate act by Microsoft engineers was substituting
certain file names with the phrase, ''Netscape engineers are
weenies!'' -- a reference to Microsoft's arch-rival for Internet
software. The Wall Street Journal reported today that the security
hole appeared to be a deliberate ''back door'' which could
potentially give users access to sensitive information.

million or more, while smaller ones offer cars and vacations. ''The
main reason I got on the Internet was to enter sweeps,'' said
Michelle Sharp, a secretary in Galesburg, Ill. ''As long as you

BMW said it had received a letter outlining the new proposal from a
group that includes John Towers, a former Rover CEO who left the

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Arthritis Drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A third new drug for people suffering from the
pain of arthritis has been approved by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has approved
meloxicam tablets for the treatment of osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Meloxicam will be marketed under the name Mobic by Boehringer
Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals and Abbott Laboratories and is expected
to be available in early May. The wholesale price was expected to
be $1.98 per tablet and dosage is once a day.
</P>
<P>
   Mobic is the third new arthritis drug approved in the last two
years, joining Celebrex and Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and
other pills to relieve pain. But these can cause ulcers, stomach
bleeding and other side effects, especially in long-term users.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical trials Mobic had a low instance of gastrointestinal
side effects, the manufacturer said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Sinks 546; Nasdaq Tumbles 287  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plummeted in heavy trading Friday -- with
the Dow industrials at one point sinking 546 points -- as inflation
jitters extended Wall Street's selling spree.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 201 points on
Thursday, tumbled an additional 511.99, or 4.7 percent, to
10,411.56 by late afternoon. That left the blue-chip index down 11
percent from its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index tumbled 287.01, or by 7.8 percent, to
3,389.77 by late afternoon, dropping deeper into bear-market
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq already had plunged 769 points, or 17 percent, in the
first four days of this week. With the latest decline, the
technology-focused average was off 32 percent from its March 10
record of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   A bear market is considered a sustained drop of more than 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop in
high-tech stocks is a growing sense that investors pushed those
issues too far last year, when the Nasdaq rose an unprecedented 86
percent. The frenzy for technology stocks gave many young, unproven
companies market values they did not yet deserve, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a momentum market on the way up; it is a momentum
market on the way down,'' said Nick Sargen, an investment
strategist for J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   A government report Friday morning of an unexpectedly strong
rise in consumer prices in March added to Wall Street's unease.
</P>
<P>
   The figures rekindled worries that the Federal Reserve not only
would raise interest rates again, but might be more aggressive in
trying to cool down the economy. The Fed has raised rates five
times since June, each time by a quarter-point in borrowing
charges. Now, some investors fear a half-point increase.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few bright spots in the market Friday were Gateway and
Sun Microsystems, which both issued strong earnings reports after
Thursday's trading session. Gateway was up $1.62{ at $52.75 on the
NYSE at late afternoon and Sun was up 43} cents at $78.18} on the
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Markets overseas also were broadly lower: Japan's Nikkei stock
average fell about 0.5 percent before trading began on Wall Street.
In Europe, where trading ended as Wall Street shares were tumbling,
key indexes fell 2.8 percent in Britain, 3.2 percent in France and
3.1 percent in Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices plunged today, pulling the Dow
Jones industrials and Nasdaq composite index down hundreds of
points as investors responded to new inflation reports with furious
selling.
</P>
<P>
   In the last hour of trading, the Dow was down 564.42 at
10,359.13, its lowest levels of the day. The blue-chip index is
down almost 12 percent from its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, firmly entrenched in bear-market territory, tumbled
323.28 points, or almost 9 percent, to 3,353.50.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq already had plunged 769 points, or 17 percent, in the
first four days of this week. With the latest decline, the
technology-focused average was off 34 percent from its March 10
record of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   The losses engulfed brokerage companies, many of which saw their
shares slide 10 percent or more. Transportation stocks and
technology stocks also took it on the chin.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop in
high-tech stocks is a growing sense that investors pushed those
issues too far last year, when the Nasdaq rose an unprecedented 86
percent. The frenzy for technology stocks gave many young, unproven
companies market values they did not yet deserve, analysts say.

trying to cool down the economy. The Fed has raised rates five
times since June, each time by a quarter-point in borrowing
charges. Now, some investors fear a half-point increase.
</P>
<P>
   The market volatility has forced several companies to postpone
their initial public stock offerings as well as plans for mergers
and acquisitions. That hurts investment banks and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Schwab were off 6 9/16 at 41 11/16, while Morgan
Stanley's stock was down 7 13/16 at 67 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates also curb borrowing, which squeezes bank
profits. Hence, Chase Manhattan's shares dropped 7[ at 77].
</P>
<P>
   Even a few of the bright spots had dimmed by the afternoon. Sun
Microsystems, which issued a strong earnings report after
Thursday's trading session, was off ] at 77].
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 69.66 points at
1,370.85. The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks fell 31.48
at 457.74.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues led advancing issues by a 5-to-1 margin. Volume
totaled 976.9 million shares vs. 826.5 million the same time
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Internet company offering Hillary Clinton doormats  </HEADLINE>
With AM-NY--NY Senate
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Announcing that ''she's been a doormat,'' a
new Web site is offering the real thing emblazoned with a likeness
of Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and catchy phrases such
as ''I've always been a Yankee fan.''
</P>
<P>
   For $19.95, the site offers the ''Hillary Doormat'' which is
described as ''America's favorite place to wipe its political
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is running for a Senate seat from New York against New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   A selection of ''Hillaryisms'' can be ordered on the doormats,
including ''It's all a vast Right Wing Conspiracy!'' and ''Read my
lips -- No New Interns!''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site's address is: hillarydoormat.com.
</P>
<P>
   The doormat-marketing company is headed by Jazz Perazic-Gipe, a
former college basketball star who played one season with the New
York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   She told the New York Post that the idea came to her when she
was playing a pickup basketball game with friends. When talk turned
to the first lady, Perazic-Gipe blurted out, ''That woman's a
doormat,'' the Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is a Rudy fan,'' Perazic-Gipe spokesman Patrick Biss said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson declined to comment
about the new Web site.
</P>
<P>
   While such merchandise may appeal to critics of the first lady,
supporters can buy T-shirts, caps and coffee mugs adorned with
''Hillary'' logos at the first lady's officially licensed site:
hillarystuff.com.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Activist Turner Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. (AP) -- Albert Turner Sr., a civil rights activist
who led the mule wagon that carried the body of Martin Luther King
Jr. at his funeral, died while awaiting surgery for abdominal
bleeding, a relative said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Turner said his 64-year-old brother was being prepared
for an operation to remove part of his colon when his heart stopped
Thursday afternoon. Doctors at Selma Baptist Hospital were unable
to revive him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took everybody by surprise because he was in real good
spirits,'' said Turner. ''Nobody thought this was
life-threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner was Alabama field secretary for the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference in 1965, when he helped lead the aborted
Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march that was blocked by
stick-swinging state troopers. The day came to be known as ''Bloody
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Selma attorney J.L. Chestnut said it was fitting that Turner led
the wagon carrying King's body in 1968 as the nation watched the
slain civil rights leader's funeral procession in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wagon showed King's connection with the poor people,''
said Chestnut. ''Al was selected to carry that wagon because he was
King's point man during the entire civil rights struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, Turner was among a group of civil rights
workers put on trial on federal charges of voter fraud in west
Alabama, where activists claimed Republicans were trying to
diminish black voting. Turner was found innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was no accident that the government indicted both Albert
and his wife on charges of voter fraud, and that the government
lost both times,'' Chestnut said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had said Turner, wife Evelyn and a third defendant
had altered absentee ballots collected from rural blacks in order
to get more votes for candidates they backed. Turner and his
codefendants said they changed ballots only when voters, many of
them elderly and poorly educated, asked them to, which is legal.
</P>
<P>
   Turner also served on the Perry County Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was smart, and he knew how to get people to support his
ideas,'' said fellow commissioner Charles LeCroy. ''He will be
greatly missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner lived in Marion all his life and traced his ancestry back
to slaves who worked cotton on plantations there. He said last year
that racial differences had faded in the town.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in Marion have a lot of get-up about them,'' Turner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They like to be out front about things,'' he said. ''People
here get along.''
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete, Turner's brother said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Won't Check Female General  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Defense Department's inspector general
decided Friday there are no grounds to formally investigate a
misconduct allegation against the Army's highest-ranking female
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation, made last week by a retired Army officer whose
identity has not been made public, had added a further twist to the
already tangled affair involving Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy. She
caused a stir by accusing a fellow general of sexual harassment.
The Army is investigating her charge.
</P>
<P>
   When the unidentified retired officer sent an e-mail to the
Defense Department inspector general's office last Friday he
claimed to have knowledge of ''personal misconduct'' on Kennedy's
part. The nature of the alleged misconduct has not been made
public. At the time, officials said it appeared to have little
substance. The inspector general's office, nonetheless, was
obligated by law to see whether a formal probe was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''The answer is no,'' a senior defense official said Friday,
speaking on condition he not be identified. ''There is nothing
there on which to base an investigation. Case closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Army officials have declined to comment on the Kennedy case,
citing privacy concerns and a policy of not discussing
investigations by the inspector general until they are completed.
The Army has not even confirmed for the record that Kennedy filed a
complaint or that the Army inspector general is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kennedy nor the officer she accused of sexually
harassing her in 1996, Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith, has responded to
media requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with knowledge of the case said this week it appeared
the Army inspector general would need at least several more days,
if not weeks, to finish interviewing people and complete a report
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy accused Smith of inappropriate touching during a visit
in her Pentagon office. It is unclear whether she told any of her
superiors about the incident at the time, but last fall she made it
known after the Army announced in August that Smith would be the
Army's next deputy inspector general. In that post, he would be
responsible for investigating misconduct including behavior such as
that of which he stands accused.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is single. Smith is married.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith was announced as the next deputy inspector
general of the Army on Aug. 27, he never assumed the position. His
status has been on official ''hold'' since last November, according
to Army personnel records.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is the Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence and
one of only three female three-star generals in the military. She
is due to retire in June.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Fall on Wet Outlook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices finished lower
in trading Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade after an early
rally sparked by weather concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean futures prices were higher in early trading, but backed
away from gains on forecasts of weekend rain in the Midwest,
followed by more showers next week.
</P>
<P>
   Early gains were in response to 30- and 90-day National Weather
Service forecasts which call for higher-than-nomal temperatures and
lower-than-normal rainfall in the soybean crop-growing region.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat futures prices followed soybean prices lower on the
expectation that the hard red winter wheat crop will get a good
drenching, which should help crop development.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the forecasts of rain next week, the sell-off of
corn futures was due to fears losses on the New York Stock Exchange
would trigger liquidation of commodities holdings to cover
positions in other markets.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery was 2 cents lower at $2.55} a bushel; May
corn was 1\ cents lower at $2.26\ a bushel; May oats were unchanged
at $1.23{ a bushel; May soybeans were 5} cents lower at $5.32{ a
bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle and pork futures prices were mixed in trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Strong wholesale pork prices gave a lift to hog futures prices.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle were .10 cent lower at 69.35 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle were .02 cent lower at 84.60 cents a pound; June lean
hogs were .12 cent higher at 75.17 cents a pound; May pork bellies
were .15 cent higher at 96.65 cents a pound.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- At 75, Paul Newman says he wakes up surprised

   ''I'm at that age when you really start thinking about what the

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Comedian Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man was charged with trying to extort money
from ''Family Feud'' host Louie Anderson by threatening to reveal
the comedian allegedly asked him for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Gordon, 31, of Mesa, Ariz., and a second man, Matthew
Auten, were arrested Tuesday after Gordon allegedly picked up a
$250,000 cashier's check from an FBI agent posing as Anderson's
assistant, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon alleged that Anderson once asked him to come home with
him and urged the comedian to pay money ''so your secrets don't get
out and blow your future.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's lawyer told federal authorities earlier this month
that Gordon received nearly $100,000 from Anderson but demanded
another $250,000, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, the voice of the Fox animated children's show ''Life
With Louie,'' paid at first because he was afraid the story would
hurt his career, the court papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Nathanson, a publicist representing Anderson, said in a
statement that being ''a target of criminal activity is an
unfortunate and increasingly common byproduct of celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Auten remained in custody Friday.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plummeted in heavy trading Friday -- with
the Dow industrials sinking more than 600 points -- as inflation
jitters extended Wall Street's selling spree.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 201 points on

10,308.33 by late afternoon. That left the blue-chip index down 12
percent from its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98. If the loss holds
through closing, it be the largest point drop ever for Wall
Street's best-known indicator.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index tumbled 358.17, or by 9.0 percent, to
3,318.61 by late afternoon, dropping deeper into bear-market
territory. That also would be a record point drop.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq already had plunged 769 points, or 17 percent, in the
first four days of this week. With the latest decline, the
technology-focused average was off 34 percent from its March 10

</P>
<P>
   A bear market is considered a sustained drop of more than 20

</P>
<P>
   Trading volume exceeded 2 billion shares on the Nasdaq Stock

<HEADLINE> Protection Agent's Dog Is Hanged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEND, Ore. (AP) -- A German shepherd belonging to one of Oregon's
top animal-protection agents was found shot and hanged from a tree.
</P>
<P>
   The dog, named Donner, belonged to Kimball Lewis, director of
the Humane Society of Central Oregon. The dog was killed Tuesday
night or early Wednesday. Lewis found the dog hanging by its neck
from a juniper at his rural home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever did this, it was very personal. They knew how to do
the very worst to Kimball,'' said Mary Blackburn, a friend and
former colleague.
</P>
<P>
   The reward offered for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of the person who killed the 7-year-old pet has reached
$20,000, including an anonymous $10,000 donation and $5,000 from
the Humane Society of the United States, based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''This kind of travesty won't be tolerated,'' said Byron Maas,
president of the Humane Society of Central Oregon board of
directors. ''There's been a huge, huge community outcry.''

   Maas said the local chapter of the Humane Society has become
much more aggressive in pursuing animal abuse and neglect cases
since Lewis arrived last June. Many people in Bend have speculated
that his dog was killed in retaliation or as intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has confiscated cats, dogs and horses and has investigated
a number of major cases.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, described by Gov. John Kitzhaber as ''a tireless worker
for animal welfare,'' used to take his dog to work.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues said Lewis was devastated by the loss of
his beloved dog. Lewis has not been at work or taken calls. In a
comment made to an online publication in Bend, Lewis said he needed
time to consider whether he wanted to stay in the field.

<HEADLINE> UN: Get Food To Ethiopia Quick  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- The lives of millions of starving
Ethiopians can be saved if international donors respond quickly to
new requests for food aid, the U.N. special envoy to the Horn of
Africa said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Bertini, who is also head of the U.N. World Food
Program, said more relief food than originally estimated is needed
to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe as the number of people
threatened by a drought-induced food shortage increased.
</P>
<P>
   ''More and more people are at risk because the rains have not
come,'' Bertini told a news conference. ''We will be coming back in
the next few weeks with additional requests. We do not know how
much more will be requested, it needs to be further assessed ...
but I expect it will be more than 100,000 tons.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Millions of lives can be saved if the international community
can come forward with contributions quickly and generously,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Ethiopian government made a formal appeal for
836,800 tons of emergency food aid to assist an estimated 7.7
million people. The World Food Program agreed to call for pledges
amounting to 250,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Bertini said the original assessment was carried out in
November. But the failure of the annual short rains means that the
original food estimate needs to be revised upward.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva on Friday, the World Health Organization appealed for
$6.5 million to provide medical help in Ethiopia for the next three
months. Spokesman Valery Abramov said both drugs and more medical
personnel are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that diarrheal diseases represent the biggest
threat, as well as respiratory diseases, measles, meningitis and
possibly cholera,'' Abramov said.
</P>
<P>
   In Addis Ababa, Bertini said she was generally pleased with her
discussions Thursday with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi but remained
concerned that he ruled out the use of two ports in neighboring
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Landlocked Ethiopia is embroiled in a 23-month border war with
Eritrea. The war has prevented aid agencies from shipping in
sorghum, wheat, maize and cooking oil via the Red Sea ports of
Assab and Massawa. Before the conflict broke out in May 1998, 75
percent of Ethiopia's relief food needs came in through Assab.
</P>
<P>
   Now aid groups are forced to use the port of Djibouti in the
Gulf of Aden and Berbera on the northern Somali coast. Up to
120,000 tons of grain a month are expected to land in port in the
coming months. Some experts think Djibouti and Berbera won't be
able to cope with the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Bertini is on a weeklong tour of the Horn of Africa that will
also take her to Eritrea, Djibouti and Kenya. In those nations and
Somalia, millions of people also are suffering from drought and
food shortages.

<HEADLINE> Princeton grad student finds most distant object ever discovered  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- A Princeton University graduate
astrophysics student has discovered what scientists claim is the
oldest, most distant object ever seen by a human being.
</P>
<P>
   Xiaohui Fan, a graduate student from Beijing, found a quasar
that is 12 billion light years from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery gives scientists a better glimpse of what the
universe was like in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're zooming in to the time when the galaxies were very young
and the light first appeared in the universe after the Big Bang,''
Fan said, referring to the explosion generally thought to have
resulted in the creation of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists were equally excited.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because it is so exceptionally luminous, it provides a
wonderful opportunity to study the universe when the galaxies that
we see today were young,'' said Robert Lupton a Princeton
researcher and astronomer with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, an
international team of scientists trying to map out half of the
northern sky.
</P>
<P>
   The $80 million, five-year project is expected to collect data
on hundreds of millions of galaxies, stars, quasars and other
celestial objects.
</P>
<P>
   Because it took 12 billion years for the light from the quasar,
an emission of light from matter pouring into a massive black hole
at the center of the galaxy, scientists saw the object as it
existed when the universe was less than a billion years old. The
universe is thought to be about 13 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Redshift 5.8 Quasar'' appears as a red speck of dust in
the constellation Sextans.
</P>
<P>
   Fan and three other scientists made the discovery in April in
Hawaii at the Keck Telescope, the world's largest, using data
collected in March from a telescope at Apache Point, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   It surpassed the previous record-holder for the most distant
known celestial object, a galaxy discovered last year by
researchers in Hawaii and Cambridge, England.

<HEADLINE> Dow Tumbles 703; Nasdaq Sinks 410  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plummeted in heavy trading Friday -- with
the Dow industrials sinking more than 700 points for the first time
ever -- as inflation jitters extended Wall Street's selling spree.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 201 points on
Thursday, tumbled an additional 703.72, or 6.4 percent, to
10,219.83 near the close of trading. That was far above the
previous record one-day drop of 554.26 points of Oct. 27, 1997, but
was far from a record decline in percentage terms.
</P>
<P>
   The slide Friday left the blue-chip index down almost 13 percent
from its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index tumbled 410.39, or by 11 percent, to
3,266.39 near the close, dropping deeper into bear-market
territory. That also would be a record point drop, easily
surpassing the 349.15 of April 3 and near the record percentage
decline of 11.35 percent of Oct. 19, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq already had plunged 769 points, or 17 percent, in the
first four days of this week. With the latest decline, the
technology-focused average was off 35 percent from its March 10
record of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   A bear market is considered a sustained drop of more than 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume exceeded 2 billion shares on the Nasdaq Stock
Market and surpassed 1 billion shares on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop in
high-tech stocks is a growing sense that investors pushed those
issues too far last year, when the Nasdaq rose an unprecedented 86
percent. The frenzy for technology stocks gave many young, unproven
companies market values they did not yet deserve, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a momentum market on the way up; it is a momentum
market on the way down,'' said Nick Sargen, an investment
strategist for J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   A government report Friday morning of an unexpectedly strong
rise in consumer prices in March added to Wall Street's unease.
</P>
<P>
   The figures rekindled worries that the Federal Reserve not only
would raise interest rates again, but might be more aggressive in
trying to cool down the economy. The Fed has raised rates five
times since June, each time by a quarter-point in borrowing
charges. Now, some investors fear a half-point increase.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few bright spots in the market Friday were Gateway and
Sun Microsystems, which both issued strong earnings reports after
Thursday's trading session. Gateway was up $1.62{ at $52.75 on the
NYSE at late afternoon and Sun was up 43} cents at $78.18} on the
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Markets overseas also were broadly lower: Japan's Nikkei stock
average fell about 0.5 percent before trading began on Wall Street.
In Europe, where trading ended as Wall Street shares were tumbling,
key indexes fell 2.8 percent in Britain, 3.2 percent in France and
3.1 percent in Germany.

By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices plunged today, pulling the Dow
Jones industrials and Nasdaq composite index down hundreds of
points as investors responded to new inflation reports with furious
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the close of trading, the Dow was down 717.44 at
10,206.26, its lowest levels of the day and by far its biggest
one-day point drop in record. The blue-chip index is down 12
percent from its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, firmly entrenched in bear-market territory, tumbled
401.69 points, or more than 9 percent, to 3,275.09.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq already had plunged 769 points, or 17 percent, in the
first four days of this week. With the latest decline, the
technology-focused average was off 34 percent from its March 10
record of 5,048.62.
</P>
<P>
   The losses engulfed brokerage companies, many of which saw their
shares slide 10 percent or more. Transportation stocks and
technology stocks also took it on the chin.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the most fundamental reason for the drop in
high-tech stocks is a growing sense that investors pushed those
issues too far last year, when the Nasdaq rose an unprecedented 86
percent. The frenzy for technology stocks gave many young, unproven

trying to cool down the economy. The Fed has raised rates five
times since June, each time by a quarter-point in borrowing
charges. Now, some investors fear a half-point increase.
</P>
<P>
   The market volatility has forced several companies to postpone
their initial public stock offerings as well as plans for mergers
and acquisitions. That hurts investment banks and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Schwab were off 6 9/16 at 41 11/16, while Morgan
Stanley's stock was down 7 13/16 at 67 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates also curb borrowing, which squeezes bank
profits. Hence, Chase Manhattan's shares dropped 7[ at 77].
</P>
<P>
   Even a few of the bright spots had dimmed by the afternoon. Sun
Microsystems, which issued a strong earnings report after
Thursday's trading session, was off ] at 77].
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 81.73 points at
1,358.78. The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks fell 38.14
at 451.08.

<HEADLINE> Newman Says One More Film Only  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- From actor-racer Paul Newman, the message is
catch me while you can on the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'm going to try to do one more film as a swan song
and then get out,'' the 75-year-old actor said during his
appearance Wednesday on ''Late Show With David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman has made similar statements to other reporters, including
those aired this week on AP Network News.
</P>
<P>
   ''At some point you've gotta get out of this,'' Newman said in
the radio interview. ''You've got to really retire and I don't want
to retire on my knees. I've been retiring now every year for 15
years, so at some point you gotta make it stick or people won't
believe you. I'd love to do one really memorable film to go out
on.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the comments as part of the promotion for his latest
film, ''Where the Money Is,'' which was opening Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oscar-winning actor and food company
executive/philanthropist said he has no plans to give up car
racing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite suffering bruised ribs when his car crashed into a tire
barrier at the Daytona International Speedway in January, Newman
told Letterman, ''As long as my pulse holds up, I think I'll
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he feels safer driving at Daytona than on a freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Newman is president of Newman's Own Foundation, which gives
millions of dollars to charities each year from proceeds of his
food line.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-eyed legend, who has starred in more than three dozen
films since his debut in the 1954 film ''The Silver Chalice,''
plays a likable bank robber in his latest film, which co-stars
Linda Fiorentino.
</P>
<P>
   Newman says in Esquire's May issue that he wakes up surprised
every day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm at that age when you really start thinking about what the
end is going to be like and how gracefully you're gonna do that,''
he said. ''If I would have to say I was preoccupied with anything,
it would be that; just wondering how graceful that exit is gonna
be.''

<HEADLINE> Carnegie Hall Rocks for Rainforest  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Carnegie Hall was rocked alive -- to keep the
rainforest from dying.
</P>
<P>
   Sting, Elton John, Billy Joel and James Taylor made music
Thursday in tune with a seasoned audience that could pay $2.5
million in tickets -- all to save more wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   And Stevie Wonder appeared just in time for a final star chorus
of ''Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year's 10th annual Carnegie Hall event was mostly
brassy and sassy, a three-hour stream of oldies steeped in Motown
memories and strobes.
</P>
<P>
   Gladys Knight, minus the Pips, and ''The Impressions'' -- four
fellows in yellow minus the late songwriter Curtis Mayfield --
delivered some smoldering urban soul. Tom Jones belted out James
Brown's '60s throwback ''It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was a tip to our time: Ricky Martin, gyrating his way
through ''Light My Fire.'' For once, he didn't quite set the crowd
aflame; they greeted him with subdued enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hum-along night at the classical hall, turned steamy by
a capacity audience of 1,800 bodies clapping and dancing in their
seats. They even whistled along, led by Joel singing Otis Redding's
''Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely do Carnegie's venerable walls shake with the music.
</P>
<P>
   They did on this night -- to the deep, vibrant band of some of
the greatest backup artists, whose beat had the audience rising up
to the occasion, quite literally.
</P>
<P>
   This annual occasion goes back a dozen years, when Sting and his
wife, Trudie Styler, met an indigenous chief in Brazil's Amazon
region, where rainforests are being destroyed by multinational
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the trees are bulldozed, a way of life is destroyed,''
Styler told an audience decked in everything from worn-out jeans
and folksy tassels to drop-dead designer couture.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion fun was also the order onstage. With Martin in a tux and
Knight in a bare-shouldered gown, John stuck out in a white suit
and shocking pink shoes. Sting whimsically introduced his fellow
Englishman as ''my boyfriend Elton John,'' who twirled a voodoo
stick while turning on a gravelly echo of Screamin' Jay Hawkins for
''I Put a Spell on You.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, bright-colored Afro-style wigs flew from a few
stars' heads into arms fluttering above the $2,000 front seats.
</P>
<P>
   And Styler delivered the message that goes with the money: The
foundation will fund natives of Guyana to study law so they can
fight their own battle to save their land.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to know how to help themselves,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Gonzalez, Wife Attend Prayer Service  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE PFLEGER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Juan Miguel Gonzalez sought the tranquility of
a church Friday, escaping for a short time the turmoil swirling
around him in his battle to be reunited with his son Elian.
</P>
<P>
   First at the Washington National Cathedral, and then at the
United Methodist Building, Gonzalez joined his wife Nersy
Carmenante and others in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was good for Juan Miguel and his wife to have an experience
that's peaceful,'' said Joan Brown Campbell, a former official of
the National Council of Churches who accompanied them.
</P>
<P>
   At the cathedral, the chief mission church of the Episcopal
Diocese of Washington, the Gonzalez family was given a tour and a
chance to pray. They said the Lord's Prayer in Spanish, Campbell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Translator Daphne Gereg said Gonzalez told her that he ''wanted
to his son home as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez met later with about 50 representatives of various
religions at the United Methodist Building across the street from
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Fassett, general secretary of the general board of church
and society of the United Methodist Church, said the meeting was
intended to ''express the concern of the religious community and to
underscore our need to articulate humanitarian values and try to
lift the conversation above the issues of clashing ideologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassett says he prayed with Gonzalez and the other religious
representatives, seeking ''guidance for America, for us, for
clarity of vision for people of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Churches and Society of the United Methodist Church
is collecting funds to pay for the services of Gonzalez's attorney,
Gregory Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said Elian, the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of
an international custody battle, has been baptized as a Catholic.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Man Reaches North Pole  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Adventurer Ola Skinnarmo became the
first Swede to reach the North Pole on Friday, completing the ski
trek from a northern Russian island in 48 days -- a week earlier
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of my feet is aching, I'm sore between my legs and I smell
awfully bad, but I'm extremely happy,'' Skinnarmo told the Swedish
news agency TT via satellite telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Skinnarmo and partner Goeran Kropp left Novaya Zemlya on Feb. 27
for the 625-mile trek. Kropp, suffering from a frostbitten thumb,
was picked up by a rescue helicopter after skiing halfway.
</P>
<P>
   Skinnarmo skied so fast -- he covered between 13 to 15 miles on
Friday -- that he'll have to wait a week before the welcome
committee consisting of his relatives, sponsors and others arrive.
On Sunday, Skinnarmo will be flown to a Russian base on the 89th
parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Skinnarmo's other feats include expeditions to Svalbard,
Greenland and the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
   American Robert Peary was the first to reach the North Pole in
1909. Since then Japanese, Norwegian and Russian expeditions have
set foot on the North Pole, but no Swedes have succeeded.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plummeted in heavy trading Friday -- with
the Dow industrials down a record 616 points and the Nasdaq
composite index also taking a record fall of 356 points -- as
inflation jitters extended Wall Street's selling spree.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 201 points on
Thursday, at one point tumbled an additional 722 points before
coming back somewhat in the final minutes. Wall Street's best-known
indicator closed down 616.23, or 5.6 percent, at 10,307.32,
according to preliminary figures. That surpassed the previous
record one-day drop of 554.26 points of Oct. 27, 1997, but was far
from a record decline in percentage terms.
</P>
<P>
   The slide Friday left the blue-chip index down 12 percent from
its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index tumbled 356.74, or by 9.7 percent, to
3,320.04 at the close, according to early calculations, dropping
deeper into bear-market territory. That surpassed the previous
record, a 349.15-point slide of April 3 and was the second-biggest
daily percentage decline after the 11.35 percent of Oct. 19, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq already had plunged 769 points, or 17 percent, in the
first four days of this week. With the latest decline, the
technology-focused average was off 34 percent from its March 10
record of 5,048.62.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Family Farm Occupied  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHINHOYI, Zimbabwe (AP) -- At the ominous sound of distant
drumbeats, Glynis Purkiss' gentle smile disappears in a wave of
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 days her white family's farm has been occupied
by black squatters demanding, at the very least, a good chunk of
land for themselves. The squatters' drumming has been a
near-constant, vibrating reminder of the fight over white-owned
farms simmering throughout Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll certainly be pushed off rather than go. It's worth
fighting for,'' the 38-year-old former nurse said from the safety
of the gated homestead inside her family's 7,400-acre farm.
</P>
<P>
   In this agriculture-dependent country of 13 million where 4,000
white farmers own one-third of the productive farmland, thousands
of squatters have occupied more than 900 white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   The High Court on Thursday backed the farmers and ordered
authorities to remove the squatters. But President Robert Mugabe,
who has backed the squatters, refused to follow earlier court
rulings to remove them. And police did not appear to be making any
moves Friday, though there were scattered reports of some squatters
preparing to leave farms on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's government has argued that police action against the
squatters -- many of whom are armed with clubs, knives, spears and
guns -- could trigger a civil war. Opposition politicians say Mugabe
instigated the occupations as a distraction from the unemployment
and inflation crippling the country as it prepares for
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   After the court Thursday ruling, Vice President Joseph Msika
appealed for the squatters to leave. But squatters may have gotten
a different signal from Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a summit in Cuba, Mugabe continued to sound a
defiant tone despite international criticism. He again threatened
to use a new constitutional amendment to seize white-owned land
without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to assure you that the land will be acquired, sanctions
or no sanctions,'' he said in Havana on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The takeovers continued Friday. White farmers said squatters
invaded at least five more white-owned properties.
</P>
<P>
   Some squatters say they are frustrated because government plans
to buy some of white-owned land and redistribute it to landless
blacks have foundered since Zimbabwe gained independence from
Britain in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been 20 years now since independence, but there is no
change,'' said Juma Madariki, a 34-year-old squatter sitting
outside the gate to Purkiss' house. ''At least I should get
something to better myself.''
</P>
<P>
   If history is any guide, land reform is not the key to
prosperity for impoverished Zimbabweans. Many of the more than
70,000 families that have been given repossessed land in the past
have had little money to buy seeds and tools and have become
subsistence farmers. Others have simply abandoned the farms.
</P>
<P>
   Land inequity is not even the real problem, Madariki said. It is
simply a symbol highlighting Zimbabweans' economic despair.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are sufferers, really we are sufferers,'' he said.
''Poverty is our motto.''
</P>
<P>
   All the unrest has perplexed Purkiss and her husband, Arthur,
43. Arthur Purkiss traditionally enjoyed good relations with his
black neighbors and is well-liked, even by Madariki and the other
squatters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not even politically minded,'' Glynis Purkiss said.
''We've just been dragged into all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Purkiss' father bought their hilly farm as uninhabited
bushland in 1952. Now, with about 600 arable acres, it is mostly
used to breed cattle and raise game for hunters to stalk.
</P>
<P>
   When squatters began occupying farms across the country at the
end of February, the Purkiss farm 100 miles west of the capital,
Harare, was spared at first.	   Then, on April 3, a group came to his gate and
demanded Purkiss
sign over his land.
</P>
<P>
   He refused, and the squatters took up camp just outside the
gate, screaming and threatening him for two days until police
forced them to move further from the house. But they periodically
returned to yell at the family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been trying to keep it cool, but it's difficult when they
are thrashing at the gate and calling you all sorts of names,''
Arthur Purkiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Worried for the safety of her 11-year-old daughter, Kelly, and
13-year-old son, Sean, Glynis Purkiss stays awake in her living
room late into the night until she feels confident the squatters
are sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the squatters have begun surveying the land and
putting down pegs to mark the areas they plan to farm.
</P>
<P>
   The occupation has placed strains on the farm's 40 laborers.
Some sympathize with the occupiers but question their methods.
</P>
<P>
   The squatters ''are our neighbors,'' said Lawrence Chimika, 36,
the farm's black foreman. ''To be on the side of Mr. Purkiss would
be a problem, but to be on the side of the veterans would be a
problem as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The squatters have portrayed themselves as veterans of
Zimbabwe's independence war who are merely seeking economic
justice. But many are far too young to have fought in the battles
that ended two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   A 28-year-old squatter on the Purkiss farm who identified
himself as Comrade D. Kufakutamba said he and the others were
trying to be reasonable and did not want all the farmer's land.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Mr. Purkiss gives us 10 acres, then that is that, and we
will go and work those 10 acres and the rest will stay with him,''
said Kufakutamba, who smelled strongly of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he seemed less willing to compromise: ''The land
belongs to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pressure, the Purkisses feel they have no choice but
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have anywhere to go, we don't have anything else,''
Glynis Purkiss said. ''We've put it all in this farm.''

<HEADLINE> Bill OK'd To Study Undersea Energy  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress approved money to study an energy
source buried under the sea and the arctic permafrost that has the
potential solve many of the earth's energy problems or cause the
earth irreparable damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday voted by voice to authorize $47.5 million
over five years for the Department of Energy to study methane
hydrates, ice-like crystals of methane with the energy potential
equal to more than twice that of all other fossil fuels combined.
</P>
<P>
   The House earlier this month passed the bill, which now goes to
the president, who is expected to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, who wrote the Senate bill, said
methane hydrates were a staggering resource: ''As our nation's
energy resources dwindle and our reliance on imported energy
increases, we cannot afford to miss this important opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If only 1 percent of the methane hydrate resource could be
made recoverable, the United States could more than double its
domestic natural gas resource base,'' the House sponsor, Rep. Mike
Doyle, D-Pa., said earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kripowicz, who deals with fossil fuels for the Energy
Department, told the House Science Committee's energy and
environment panel last year that the natural gas potential of
hydrates approaches 400 million trillion cubic feet, 80,000 times
the world's current known natural gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
   There is no existing technology to make extraction commercially
viable, and scientists have warned that the methane, if allowed to
escape its subterranean deposits, could destablize sea bottoms and
accelerate greenhouse gas accumulations.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists writing in the journal Science last November
theorized that the release of frozen methane from the ocean 55
million years ago was responsible for an abrupt warming of the
Earth that had a devastating effect on deep-sea life.
</P>
<P>
   The bill directs the Energy secretary, working with the
secretaries of Interior, Defense and Commerce, to study both
methane hydrates as an energy source and the technologies needed
for safe, efficient development.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy secretary would have the authority to award grants
and enter into cooperative agreements with universities and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 1753.

<HEADLINE> Dow Tumbles 616; Nasdaq Sinks 361  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials and Nasdaq composite
index both suffered record one-day point drops Friday as a new
inflation report sparked furious selling that turned into panic as
the session wore on.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow plunged 616.23 points, or 5.6 percent to 10,307.32,
according to preliminary numbers. At its lowest point, it was off
722 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq dropped 361.58, or 10 percent, to 3,315.20.
</P>
<P>
   A government report Friday morning of an unexpectedly strong
rise in consumer prices in March intensified a sense of easiness
that has pulled stock prices lower all week. The figures rekindled
worries that the Federal Reserve not only would raise interest
rates again at its upcoming policy-making meetings, but might be
more aggressive in trying to cool down the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Sargen, an investment strategist for J.P. Morgan, said he
expects the Fed to raise interest rates at its meetings in May and
June.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk is the U.S. economy does not slow enough and the Fed
has to raise rates in the second half of the year, in spite of the
election. That is not priced into the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the inflation figures took their toll across the market,
high-tech stocks continued to fall amid the growing sense that
investors pushed those issues too far last year, when the Nasdaq
rose an unprecedented 86 percent. The frenzy for technology stocks
gave many young, unproven companies market values they did not yet
deserve, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a momentum market on the way up; it is a momentum
market on the way down,'' Sargen said.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the selling were margin calls, in which investors are
required to sell stocks they have bought using borrowed money, and
plain-old panic.
</P>
<P>
   The day capped one of the worst weeks in Wall Street history,
with the Nasdaq falling 25 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial
average slid 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The market frenzy did not go unnoticed by Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   ''During a financial crisis, risk aversion rises dramatically,
and deliberate trading strategies are replaced by rising
fear-induced disengagement from market activity,'' Greenspan said
today.
</P>
<P>
   The losses engulfed brokerage companies, many of which saw their
shares slide 10 percent or more. Transportation stocks and
technology stocks also took it on the chin.
</P>
<P>
   The market volatility has forced several companies to postpone
their initial public stock offerings as well as plans for mergers
and acquisitions. That hurts investment banks and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Even a few of the bright spots had dimmed by the afternoon. Sun
Microsystems, which issued a strong earnings report after
Thursday's trading session, closed down.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
fell 84.08 to 1,356.43.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 2,672 down, 434 up and 339 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.25 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.03
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 35.60 to
453.62.
</P>
<P>
   Markets overseas also were broadly lower: Japan's Nikkei stock
average fell 0.45 percent. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX
index was down 3.14 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 2.81
percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 3.17 percent.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Military Discusses Election  </HEADLINE>
By SUZAN FRASER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Brushing aside concerns from the European
Union, Turkey's all-powerful military said Friday it was
''unthinkable'' that the generals will not have a say in who will
serve as the country's next president.
</P>
<P>
   The military's statement came as Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
met with his coalition partners Friday to discuss possible
candidates for president.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit failed to win support in parliament for the re-election
of President Suleyman Demirel, who has the military's support.
Demirel's term ends May 16, and Ecevit must come up with a
candidate by April 26.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's parliament votes for the president, who is largely a
figurehead but can serve as a behind-the-scenes power broker,
especially in times of crisis. The president is elected to a
seven-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The military's statement Friday came in response to newspaper
reports that military officials wanted to keep out of the
elections. The statement was made despite calls from the EU, which
Turkey aspires to join, to curtail the generals' influence on
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which has seized power three times since the 1960s
and dominates Turkish politics, said it was ''unthinkable for the
Turkish Armed Forces not to have an opinion'' on presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Armed Forces has certain thoughts on the principles and
desired qualities of, for example, the person who will be
president,'' the statement said. ''Such thoughts are conveyed to
parties concerned when deemed necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's staunchly secular generals are likely to insist on a
president who backs their drive to fight Islamic political groups
and who is not tainted by corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit hopes that the coalition's three members can reach quick
agreement on the presidency to avoid infighting as the government
struggles to push forward an ambitious, IMF-backed program to fight
inflation. The coalition must also concentrate on reforming
Turkey's laws to prepare for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit refused to disclose the results of his Friday meeting but
said he would also hold talks with opposition parties. No clear
candidates have emerged so far, although several names have been
suggested, including ex-ministers and retired generals.

<HEADLINE> USAID Settles Age Complaint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Agency for International Development
has agreed to a tentative $5.5 million settlement in a lawsuit
brought by former workers claiming age discrimination, the agency
confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign service officers who sued USAID were laid off by the
agency in a 1996 work force reduction. They contended older workers
were unfairly targeted, pointing out that all but one of the 97
employees put out of work were over age 40 and two out of three
were over age 50.
</P>
<P>
   Federal age discrimination laws protect people over age 40 from
unequal treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge for the U.S. District Court of the District of
Columbia gave tentative approval of the settlement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal receives final court approval following a May
hearing, the government would pay $3.5 million for lost wages and
benefits and $2 million for attorneys' fees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 37 plaintiffs, about 50 more older workers
who were laid off by USAID around the same time will share the
money.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement would also guarantee the older workers advance
notice of short-term USAID contract work becoming available during
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   USAID officials said the agreement is intended to avoid a costly
legal battle and is not an admission by the agency of wrongdoing or
violation of law.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Jews May Be Pawns of Power  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran (AP) -- Thirteen Iranian Jews on trial for espionage
may be caught in the power struggle between reformists and
hard-liners in Iran's government.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal allies of President Mohammad Khatami are trying to move
toward better ties with the United States and the West. But
religious hard-liners, who control certain government sectors such
as the judiciary, want to preserve the anti-Western spirit of the
1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the trial will affect Khatami because convictions
and heavy sentences are likely to provoke an international backlash
and set back his reforms -- precisely what the hard-liners want.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way this case is moving, and the manner in which it is
being dealt with, appears to be either part of the power struggle
between the two factions or is influenced by it,'' said Saeed
Laylaz, a journalist for several Tehran newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   A long, drawn-out trial that ends with acquittals could also
have an impact on the president. His opening up to the West would
be delayed as the United States and other countries wait for the
verdict before improving ties.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has warned that the conduct and outcome of the
trial could affect the thaw in relations that began when Khatami
was elected president in 1997. France and Germany have called for a
fair trial, and European diplomats arrived at the courthouse
Thursday in the southern city of Shiraz for the start of the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   After 90 minutes, the trial was adjourned to May 1 to give
defense counsel more time to prepare. But that was enough to raise
questions about the fairness of the proceedings, which were closed
to the public for national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Provincial judiciary chief Hossein Ali Amiri told reporters
Thursday that four of the defendants had confessed and that Judge
Sadeq Nourani had ruled the confessions admissible.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Amiri was referring to confessions made
in court Thursday or previously. Iranian media reported last fall
that suspects in the case had confessed but did not say what they
had confessed to. Defense lawyer Esmail Naseri said Thursday there
had been no confessions in court.
</P>
<P>
   Naseri said any pretrial confessions were ''irrelevant'' and
inadmissible because they had not been made in the presence of a
defense counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge may not accept his view. The Jews are being tried
in a revolutionary court where the judge is also the prosecutor. He
investigates the case and hands down the sentence and verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Iranian officials had said the 13 Jews faced charges
of spying for Israel and the United States. Both countries have
denied any links to the accused.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the judiciary said in a statement that the 13 face
charges of spying for Israel alone.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the defendants face long prison terms or the death
penalty. In the event of a conviction, only Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, can grant a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei is a hard-liner and an opponent of ties with the West.
His authority supersedes that of Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, conservative allies of the Khamenei have repeatedly
tried to thwart Khatami's reform program by using banning liberal
newspapers, arresting editors and impeaching an interior minister
deemed too reformist.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Asia Trip Sparked Violence  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday his recent trip to
South Asia was the impetus for a massacre of ''40 perfectly
innocent people'' in the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure they were murdered because I was there,'' Clinton
said during a fund-raising luncheon for Rep. Cynthia McKinney,
D-Ga. ''Those people lost their lives because I went to India and
to Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton visited nuclear rivals India and Pakistan last month,
but dashed Pakistan's hopes of mediating in their decades-old,
border dispute over the ethnically divided Kashmir region.
</P>
<P>
   Police said militants massacred at least 35 people in the Sikh
village of Chatti Singhpora on March 20, as Clinton began his
weeklong trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed outrage over the Sikh killings at the time.
But he said he would not be ''dragged'' into the Kashmir dispute by
acts of violence, and would not intervene unless both countries
asked.
</P>
<P>
   India rejects international intervention, while Pakistan wants
the United Nations or other countries to mediate.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands of
Hindus have been driven from their homes during a 10-year
separatist insurgency in Kashmir. The March massacre was the first
time Sikhs were targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Indian police have blamed two Pakistan-based militant groups.
Militants and Pakistan's government denied involvement, and instead
accused India's security forces of committing the murders to
besmirch the separatist movement during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   The president's remarks Friday came during one of his frequent
musings about the pall on modern life cast by ancient ethnic and
religious hatreds.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who don't want their turmoil to be eased used my trip
there as a pretext to highlight the difficulties,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not lay specific blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody -- we don't know who -- killed 40 perfectly innocent
people,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Teen-ager Suspected in Fla. Blaze  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- A 17-year-old burning trash on his family's
property is suspected of starting a fire that burned more than
15,000 acres this week.
</P>
<P>
   Florida agriculture investigators have determined the cause of
the fire was a trash fire that got out of control when an aerosol
can in the trash exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The giant fire was nearly contained Friday morning. Firefighters
were celebrating a heavy drenching of rain that began Thursday
afternoon and was expected to continue throughout the weekend.

   ''We couldn't ask for better timing,'' said Gerry LaCavera, a
spokesman for the Florida Division of Forestry. ''I've heard some
say that yesterday in an hour we got a month's worth of rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not identify the teen-ager suspected in the
fire, but said he was cooperative in the investigation. The state
attorney's office in Collier County will decide if any charges
should be filed.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager was questioned by a Florida Department of
Agriculture investigator and released.

<HEADLINE> Whistlers Meet in N.C. Convention  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISBURG, N.C. (AP) -- Whistle a happy tune, whistle the blues,
whistle a passage from Beethoven -- it doesn't matter what at the
27th annual International Whistlers Convention, just pucker your
lips and blow.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, you don't even have to blow.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some whistlers who whistle entirely by whistling in.
No air goes out,'' said Allen deHart, the convention founder and
assistant to the president at Louisburg College, where the
competition began Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Winners will be announced Saturday in the adult, teen, child and
''allied arts'' divisions, the last for people who whistle with
their fingers or practice ventriloquism.
</P>
<P>
   Kilgour Shives, 84, of Vancouver, Canada, attending for the
seventh time, prefers to whistle a capella rather than with a taped
musical accompaniment as he must do at the competition, but likes
the challenge anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I get enjoyment when people hear me whistle,'' Shives said. He
planned to compete with opera accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshiharu Takamoku came from Osaka, Japan, to compete. He spoke
little English but whistled clearly and handed out laminated cards
announcing the Japan Whistlers Association.
</P>
<P>
   One judge, Barry Rector of Vancouver, said whistling isn't as
popular a commercial art as it was 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whistlers that had a talent were hired by the rich and famous
to come whistle in their parlors,'' Rector said during a break
Thursday in a whistling class, where 20 or so students brushed up
on their vibrato and were counseled to keep a glass of water and
lip balm handy.
</P>
<P>
   The contest began in 1974 when the local arts festival held a
singing competition and Darrell Williams of Durham asked to whistle
his selection. He was the first whistling competition winner. He
returned the next year, bringing five or six other whistlers with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Once there were hundreds of contestants, but this year there
will be between 60 and 100 finalists; serious whistlers submitted
tapes in advance and some were eliminated. Still, if people show up
wanting to whistle, they can.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to have more whistlers because our standards were
lower,'' deHart said. ''We now have more professional whistlers,
but we never turn anybody down even though we have had some very
poor whistlers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The professional whistlers are egotistical and jealous, and
they say, 'Why do you let these whistlers in?' We say because art
should be free.''

<HEADLINE> OSCE Plans Chechnya Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe will launch a medical assistance program in Chechnya, the
group's chairwoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Benita Ferrero-Waldner, who is also Austria's foreign minister,
said the OSCE plans to open a headquarters in the village of
Znamenskoye in northern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Koshman, Russian President Vladimir Putin's envoy in
Chechnya, said Russia welcomes the OSCE. He said the organization
has been less critical of alleged human rights abuses than the
Council of Europe, which has suspended Russia's voting rights and
called for an international inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has bristled at foreign criticism of its campaign in
Chechnya, saying the fighting is an internal affair not requiring
mediation of the type the OSCE provided during the previous war in
1994-6.
</P>
<P>
   During her one-day trip to the breakaway region, Ferrero-Waldner
visited Znamenskoye and brought donations of medical supplies and
children's toys to residents, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero-Waldner toured a hospital and newly opened school and
looked at a building the OSCE may use as a Chechen headquarters,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television news showed her smiling and walking gingerly
along a mud-clogged street, surrounded by heavily armed guards and
armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero-Waldner said Friday she supports an independent but
national investigation into rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Violations of human rights, which took place on both the
Russian and Chechen sides, should be investigated in an independent
national forum,'' Russia's RTR television quoted her as saying in
Russian translation.

<HEADLINE> Bavaria Said To Have E. German Files  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- State officials in Bavaria obtained about
500 highly sensitive East German secret police files on
high-ranking West German officials shortly after the Berlin Wall
fell, a weekly magazine reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Renegade communist agents were promised jobs and cash to steal
the files, Focus magazine reported. It said the files contained
sensitive information dating back decades on West German
politicians and government employees, including current German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and President Johannes Rau.
</P>
<P>
   The state Interior Ministry confirmed Friday that an undisclosed
amount of information was obtained from the East German secret
police, known as Stasi, but said most of the material was
immediately destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to appear in next week's issue but released to other
media early, Focus said CIA agents also took part in the program,
called ''Eunova,'' which lasted three months.
</P>
<P>
   The Munich-based magazine said the files were turned over the
Bavarian state Office for the Protection of the Constitution in
early 1990 -- after the Wall fell but before German unification that
October.
</P>
<P>
   It said copies were made of the files, which included telephone
conversations with precise details that Stasi agents obtained from
eavesdropping, before the originals were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Focus said Schroeder was monitored as early as 1978, when he
headed the youth wing of the Social Democratic party, and that he
was declared of special intelligence interest starting in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Rau's telephone conversations were monitored by the former East
German trade office located in Duesseldorf, the state capital of
North-Rhine Westphalia state where he was then governor, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Interior Ministry confirmed that Bavaria received
dossiers on residents of West Germany that the East had gotten
using ''eavesdropping measures.'' But the statement went on to say
that the papers, ''in so far as they did not deal with the security
of affected persons, were ... on March 29, 1990, destroyed without
delay and without analysis and without copies made of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministry statement said officials only made copies of
so-called ''target control cards,'' which revealed the names,
telephone numbers, and addresses of individuals and institutions,
but not information from eavesdropping on those targets.

<HEADLINE> Anwar Supporters Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By RANJAN ROY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Several opposition leaders were
arrested Friday and riot police, some toting machine guns, were
deployed here as authorities stepped up an apparent crackdown ahead
of a protest to support jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   At least three officials of the opposition National Justice
Party were arrested before dawn Friday. Police said they had orders
to arrest four other rally organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's planned rally in Kuala Lumpur, the capital, is to
mark the first anniversary of Anwar's conviction and six-year
prison sentence on charges of abuse of power. Anwar, a former
deputy prime minister, says the charges were trumped up to end his
chances of becoming prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The rally is expected to start at the city's main mosque and
culminate in a march to the king's palace to demand an end to Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's rule.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the protest must be blocked to prevent
violence. Police have warned of stern treatment, including arrest
and prosecution, for protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that the government will not create a confrontation.
We hope they will be open-minded enough,'' said Tian Chua, vice
president of the opposition National Justice Party. He is among
those wanted by police.
</P>
<P>
   A magistrate's court on Friday ordered senior Justice Party
official Ruslan Kassim jailed for a week for investigation. His
party colleagues, Mohamed Ezam Nor and Gobalan Krishnan, were
arrested, the national news agency Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time someone has been detained for
instigating protests that have yet to occur,'' said Ruslan's
lawyer, Sankara Nair.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir has ruled Malaysia for 18 years. His critics say he is
trying to crush dissent and intimidate his opponents with a huge
show of force.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, dozens of blue police trucks lined up in a downtown
square and a truck fitted with a water cannon, used in the past to
spray chemicals on protesters, was parked nearby. Police armed with
machine guns patrolled nearby commuter train stations and shopping
malls.
</P>
<P>
   Activists said police erected roadblocks on highways to prevent
people from joining the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir sacked Anwar in September 1998 and later ordered his
arrest. Huge protests followed the arrest, and Mahathir's United
Malays National Organization party lost a chunk of support to the
opposition during national elections this past November.
</P>
<P>
   The government began curbing anti-government newspapers earlier
this year and prosecuted several opposition figures on sedition
charges. Last month, authorities announced a blanket ban on public
rallies.

<HEADLINE> GOPs Named To Head Victory 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore and two members
of Congress will co-chair a national fund-raising arm of the
Republican Party that will help candidates campaign, the party said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore and U.S. Reps. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., and Henry
Bonilla, R-Texas, will head the Republican National Committee's
Victory 2000 effort. They join Fred Meyer, appointed chairman of
the organization on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's GOP presidential campaign was influential in
selecting leaders of Victory 2000, said RNC spokesman Mike Collins,
as the presumptive nominee essentially takes over party operations.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore and Texas Gov. Bush are close. Gilmore headed his
primary campaign in Virginia, where Bush easily defeated Sen. John
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, Dunn and Gilmore will appear on behalf of GOP campaigns
and, on occasion, as surrogates for Bush, according to the RNC.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they will do as chairmen of Victory 2000 is help
Republicans all across this country win in elections ... from the
county commissions in the courthouses to the White House and
everything in between,'' Collins said.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rig Count Up 12 to 809  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and
natural gas in the United States increased this week by 12 to 809.
</P>
<P>
   Of the rigs running nationwide, 192 were exploring for oil, 616
were looking for gas and one was listed as miscellaneous, Baker
Hughes Inc. reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since
1944. The tally peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height
of the oil boom but set several record lows last year, bottoming
out at 498 on April 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, Texas gained eight
rigs, Louisiana and Oklahoma two each and New Mexico one.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska and Wyoming lost two rigs each. California's count
remained unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Italian Campaigning Closes Early  </HEADLINE>
By PETER W. MAYER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Campaigning for regional elections officially closed
Friday, two days before a vote largely seen as a test for Italy's
premier and his conservative rival ahead of next year's
parliamentary balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Some 42 million eligible voters -- roughly 75 percent of the
country's population -- will vote in 15 regions Sunday for regional
presidents and legislatures. Regional governments play a large role
in running local transport and health systems.
</P>
<P>
   The voters, however, have focused more on the acrimonious
exchanges between Premier Massimo D'Alema, head of a center-left
coalition government since October 1998, and media magnate Silvio
Berlusconi, whose center-right alliance includes former
neo-fascists and the autonomy-seeking Northern League movement.
</P>
<P>
   Their chances of winning the next premiership hinge on their
coalitions' showing in the regional elections. Parliamentary
elections will be held next March.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi has demanded that D'Alema step down if the
center-left fares poorly in Sunday's elections. The media tycoon
mounted a multimillion dollar campaign, including a nine-day cruise
on a luxury liner he leased for $1.25 million to canvass support
for the center-right candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi has repeatedly criticized D'Alema's inclusion of
hardline communists in the governing coalition and suggested the
premier may be an unreformed communist.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema has in turn criticized the center-right's links to the
Northern League and its volatile leader Umberto Bossi.
</P>
<P>
   Bossi has toned down only recently calls for northern Italy's
secession. His party's strong anti-immigration stance has led to
comparisons to policies of Austria's far-right leader Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema also denounced Berlusconi's posh cruise as ''arrogant
display of wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   The center-left coalition won nine of the 20 regions in 1995
elections and won another two in 1999 when center-right coalitions
collapsed in the southern Campania and Calabria regions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, D'Alema was widely praised for his management during
the Kosovo war, but constant strains among the coalition partners
forced him to temporarily resign at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi, whose business includes three TV networks,
magazines, and film, advertising and real estate interests, served
as premier for eight months in early 1992 until his coalition,
which included Bossi's movement, unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has 20 regions. The five not holding elections on Sunday
scheduled balloting for other times.

<HEADLINE> NU, ConEd shareholders approve merger  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Shareholders of Northeast Utilities and
Consolidated Edison Inc. on Friday swiftly approved the companies'
proposed $3.5 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which would create one of the largest electric
companies in the country, could save $1.5 billion in operating
expenses over 10 years, the companies have said. Officials have not
said how those savings might affect the cost of heating and
lighting homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would have more than 6.4 million electric
and gas customers throughout New England and New York.
</P>
<P>
   NU shareholders met in Hartford, while Con Ed shareholders
convened in New York. The deal still must be approved by state and
federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, announced in October, NU investors could
exchange each of their shares for $25 in cash or Con Ed stock. Con
Ed would also pay an additional $1 a share if the two working
reactors at NU's troubled Millstone nuclear power plant in
Connecticut were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Michael G. Morris, NU president, has said he is confident there
will be offers for the Millstone units, despite a history of
problems. All three Millstone reactors were shut down several years
ago due to safety concerns. In the past year, Millstone 2 and 3
gained federal approval to restart. Millstone 1 is being
decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger has met criticism from environmentalists
seeking the shutdown of the Millstone reactors and Connecticut
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal. Blumenthal maintains the deal
could mean higher rates, lower quality service and job losses --
issues he says have not been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This merger as currently planned is a disastrous disservice to
the people of Connecticut,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will appear Monday before the state Department of
Public Utilities to argue against the deal.
</P>
<P>
   NU, based in Berlin, is the largest electric utility in New
England with more than $4 billion in annual revenue and more than
1.7 million customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Rhode Island, New York and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed, headquartered in New York, has more than 3.3 million
electric customers and 1.4 million natural gas customers. The
company has generated more than $7 billion in annual revenues in
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed employs about 14,000 people in New York and northern New
Jersey. NU has about 9,000 workers in Connecticut, Massachusetts
and New Hampshire. Eugene R. McGrath, chairman, president and chief
executive officer of Con Ed, has said no layoffs are planned. But
he has said there would be gradual job cuts through attrition,
reduced hiring and other measures.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath is set to continue as chairman and chief executive
officer; Morris would be president of the new company.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Imposed on N.Korea, Iran  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States imposed new sanctions Friday
against Iran and North Korea for ''knowingly engaging in the export
of military technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions will have no impact, at least over the short term,
because of existing sanctions against both countries. In making the
announcement, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin would not
say where the technology was exported, but North Korea is believed
to have had dealings in such materials with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other countries interested in preventing
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction have banded under the
Missile Technology Control Regime to try to discourage exports of
such technology.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin would not specify what types of equipment Iran and North
Korea exported but said the materials were subject to MTCR
controls. He called the violations ''major.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the breaches were ''Category 1'' offenses, the most
serious breach under the MTCR rules. Category 1 items include
complete missile systems, major subsystems, rocket stages or
guidance systems, production facilities for MTCR-class missiles or
technology associated with such missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said an MTCR-class missile is capable of delivering a
1,100-pound payload of 186 miles or more. An example is the Scud,
used by Iraq against Saudi Arabia and Israel during the Persian
Gulf War. One struck a U.S. Army barracks and killed 29 soldiers
and wounding 99.
</P>
<P>
   The new penalties are for a North Korean entity, the Changgwang
Sinyong Corp. of North Korea; and four Iranian entities: the
Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics, the Aerospace
Industries Organization, the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group and the
Sanam Industrial Group.
</P>
<P>
   Under law, penalties required for Category I violations deny to
sanctioned entities, at least for two years, new U.S. government
contracts and individual export licenses for items that are under
government controls.
</P>
<P>
   In North Korea's case, sanctions are applied not just to the
particular corporation but also to all activities of the North
Korean government related to MTCR items. In Iran's case, only the
four named entities are sanctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said although the United States does not trade with the
North Korean entities now, ''addressing the causes that have led to
these sanctions are an additional hurdle that must cleared if we
are to improve economic and trade relations.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Iran, he said the new sanctions will not affect the
recent easing of U.S. imports on such items as caviar, pistachios
and carpets. This is because none of the sanctioned companies
produce these products, Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dissolves Restraining Order  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HOLMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A judge dissolved a restraining order
Friday that had barred The Associated Press from publishing details
about a state-funded agricultural loan program.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Suzanne Covington said there was no
constitutional reason to keep secret public documents that had been
given to the AP by the Texas Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Covington said the AP and its reporter, Chris Williams, did
nothing improper in obtaining the information for news stories.
Williams requested the documents under the state open records law.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were financial documents showing the details of a
$360,000 loan between Permian Sea Shrimp and Seafood Ltd. and the
First National Bank of Monahans.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Agricultural Finance Authority, part of the
Agriculture Department, guaranteed 80 percent of the loan after
reviewing the information later provided to the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Permian raises shrimp in West Texas in Pecos County, about 200
miles northwest of San Antonio, using salty water pumped from
aquifers. It has been current on its loan payments.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Margaret Cooper issued a temporary
restraining order April 5 preventing the AP from publishing
information about the loan guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp farmer Bart Reid and the First National Bank of Monahans
argued the Agriculture Department wrongly released trade secrets to
the AP.

<HEADLINE> NASD Vote Backs For-Profit Spinoff  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Members of the National Association of
Securities Dealers have overwhelmingly approved a plan to spin off
part of the NASD's computerized Nasdaq Stock Market as a for-profit
company.
</P>
<P>
   Voting began a month ago and the results were announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An NASD spokesman said 3,423 members, or 84 percent of those who
cast ballots, voted in favor of the plan, while 652 voted against
it. A number of firms abstained.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD intends to sell about a 78 percent stake in the Nasdaq
to a group of Nasdaq market participants that includes NASD member
broker-dealer firms, large institutional investors such as pension
and mutual fund companies, and a handful of large Nasdaq listed
companies. The sale is expected to raise about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The voting results were announced a day after the leader of a
group of small brokerage firms filed a lawsuit in New York,
claiming the proposal is unfair to small NASD members.
</P>
<P>
   A judge rejected on Thursday a request to block Friday's
announcement. But another hearing is scheduled for Monday to
resolve the larger issues raised in the suit, including the request
for a preliminary injunction to block the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Knight, an NASD vice president and chief legal officer,
called the suit ''baseless'' in a statement released Thursday after
the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   A group called the Independent Broker-Dealer Association has
become increasingly vocal with charges that the plan favors large
Wall Street members, however.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeking to block the plan was filed by IBDA president
Alan Davidson, an NASD board member and owner of Zeus Securities in
Smithtown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson declined to be interviewed Friday by The Associated
Press. But in a series of news releases issued recently, Davidson
has charged that the spinoff proposal is flawed because small NASD
firms weren't given enough information to cast informed votes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Davidson has charged that large member firms
received ''preferential treatment'' by the NASD in terms of the
Nasdaq shares that will be divided among all the member firms as
part of the spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   NASD officials have said the restructuring is necessary to help
keep the computerized Nasdaq stock market competitive with upstart
electronic trading exchanges, known as electronic communications
networks, or ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange is also weighing a reorganization
through the sale of shares to the public, which could happen later
this year.

<HEADLINE> Major Anti-Milosevic Rally Held  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Waving flags and chanting ''Slobo go
away,'' more than 100,000 opponents of Slobodan Milosevic demanded
elections and an end to oppression Friday in one of the largest
protests to date against the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators streamed into central Belgrade's Republic Square,
defying warnings by Milosevic's allies to stay away and evading
police checkpoints in a bold attempt to join forces against the
strongman's grip on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had enough of terror of Europe's last dictator,''
opposition leader Vladan Batic shouted into a microphone. The crowd
roared: ''Slobo Saddam,'' referring to the Iraqi strongman.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was the biggest opposition gathering in Belgrade
since last August and the first since the traditionally squabbling
opposition came together in January to sign a joint declaration
aimed at pushing Milosevic aside.
</P>
<P>
   In the most visible show of reconciliation, Vuk Draskovic and
Zoran Djindjic, the two opposition leaders whose political and
personal rivalry has plagued the anti-Milosevic effort, reluctantly
shook hands at the speaker's stage.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said,
''This large demonstration shows again that the Serbian people are
fed up with the repressive and undemocratic regime President
Milosevic has inflicted upon them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly the Serbian people have voiced their outrage today
about Milosevic's desperate attempt to silence his legitimate
critics,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is internationally isolated and impoverished a year after
NATO bombed the country to stop Milosevic's repression of ethnic
Albanians in the southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has ignored opposition demands for early elections,
apparently fearing he could lose them. The government has been
cracking down on free media, opposition leaders and their
supporters since the 78-day NATO air war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why are we here?'' Draskovic asked. ''Because the life we are
leading is no longer a life, because we are being killed, beaten,
arrested. Because we live in misery, humiliation and sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's ruling Socialists and his political allies warned
Friday the gathering was aimed at destabilizing Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to keep people at home, the state held a television
film festival, showing pirated copies of James Bond's ''The World
Is Not Enough'' and the Oscar-winning ''American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension built throughout the day, beginning as police bused
reinforcements to the capital. Riot police took up positions inside
key government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Police patrols staked out toll booths leading into the city,
turning back buses bringing opposition supporters to the capital.
Demonstrators were undeterred, setting out to walk the remaining
miles, streaming through the suburbs, jamming streets and bridges,
waving flags and carrying posters.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to undermine media coverage, authorities withheld
passports and detained a group of foreign journalists at Belgrade's
airport for a night, preventing them from entering the country to
cover the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Live coverage of the rally on the leading nongovernment
television station, Studio B, was jammed. It could not be seen in
several parts of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   After walking for almost 24 hours from Novi Sad, a city 50 miles
northwest of Belgrade, a hundred students from the anti-government
group Otpor, or Resistance, appeared at the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once Milosevic is toppled, we'll walk to Australia. No
problem,'' said one of the students, who identified himself as
Veso.
</P>
<P>
   Student leader Vladimir Pavlov demanded that the opposition
leaders pledge to stay united to ''fight as one against the
regime.''

<HEADLINE> Council Takes Blame For Rwanda  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Shamed by its inaction, the Security
Council accepted responsibility Friday for having failed to stop
Rwanda's 1994 genocide and vowed to do more to prevent another
slaughter of innocents.
</P>
<P>
   In their first formal response to a critical report of the U.N.
role in the genocide, ambassadors acknowledged the expose's key
findings: that world governments lacked the political will to stop
the massacre of half a million people and deprived the U.N.
peacekeeping mission in Rwanda of the resources needed to save
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I doubt any in this chamber can look back at that time without
remorse and a great deal of sadness at the failure to help the
people of Rwanda in their time of need,'' said Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who presided over an open meeting of the
council.
</P>
<P>
   The brutality ''made a mockery, once again, of the pledge 'never
again,''' he said, referring to the promise made after the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   While no formal statement or resolution was adopted, each of the
15 council members spoke, acknowledging the U.N. failures and
vowing to do more, particularly with the new U.N. mission in
Rwanda's neighbor, Congo.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 500,000 people, most of them minority Tutsis, were
killed in the Hutu-sponsored genocide that began after the April 6,
1994 downing of the Rwandan president's plane.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations had a 2,500-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission
in the country at the time, but governments pulled out all but a
few hundred Tunisian and Ghanian troops after 10 Belgian
peacekeepers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was head of U.N. peacekeeping
operations at the time and was singled out in the December report
for having failed to pass on warnings about the impending genocide.
He commissioned the report last year and said he fully accepted its
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Several ambassadors applauded Annan's willingness to subject
himself and the United Nations to the scrutiny of an independent
inquiry. And they welcomed his recent decision to appoint a panel
to recommend ways to improve U.N. peacekeeping operations. The
panel will draw on the findings from the Rwandan report and another
self-critical analysis of the massacre of Muslims at the
U.N.-protected enclave of Srebrenica during the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the ambassadors at the council meeting were first
briefed by former Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, who
chaired the report panel. He outlined its findings and the lessons
the Security Council could learn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mobilize the political will to provide the troops that the
United Nations needs at short notice,'' Carlsson told them. ''And
show the same determination to exercise your responsibility for
international law, peace and security -- wherever the crisis and
whatever the continent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda's U.N. ambassador, Joseph Mutaboba, said the council
could do more beyond pledging to prevent another bloodbath. He
called for a ''mini-Marshall Plan'' to help Rwanda rebuild itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is possible to shock the world again, but by doing
something dramatically positive, at last,'' Mutaboba said. ''It's
never to late to make things right.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the pending U.N. peacekeeping operation in the Congo,
Axworthy announced that council members had asked U.S. Ambassador
Richard Holbrooke to head a team of ambassadors to go to the Congo
early next month. The team will assess the status of the peace
process and prospects for the deployment of U.N. observers to
monitor a fragile cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Girls Charged in Murder Plot  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Two seventh-grade girls were charged with scheming
to bludgeon three rivals with a bag of batteries and slash their
throats in the latest in a recent string of schoolyard murder plots
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged plot was thwarted when officials found the bag and
pencil boxes full of knives and razor blades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nowadays you have to take every threat seriously,'' said North
Lauderdale police spokesman Roy Liddichott. ''They certainly had
the means by which to carry out their threat. Would they have?
Luckily we never found out.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrests come the same week that three Indiana first-graders
were suspended for allegedly plotting to kill a classmate.
Investigators said they even drew a crude map of where the slaying
was to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Levin, director of the Brudnick Center on Violence at
Northeastern University in Massachusetts, said Friday that media
attention to school shootings and other violent acts has
increasingly led to copycat plots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many children have a rich fantasy life which includes violence
-- the difference is now they are drawing their fantasies from
national news reports,'' he said. ''They've gone from playing cops
and robbers to scenes from Columbine High.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, police in North Lauderdale arrested the girls, ages
12 and 13, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. The girls
had planned to silence their victims by shoving batteries down
their throats, police said.
</P>
<P>
   School officials initially didn't think the threat was serious
but later found the batteries and razor blades, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Indiana case, the three girls had planned to shoot a
7-year-old classmate at their school, but also discussed killing
her with a butcher knife or hanging her, police said. The three
students were suspended Wednesday, a day after a parent alerted
school officials of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   In Chimacum, Wash., two middle-school students face charges for
an alleged plot in March to shoot their classmates, teachers and
administrators. Court papers described them as unhappy with how
they were treated by other students and staff.
</P>
<P>
   A 17-year-old boy in West Palm Beach pleaded guilty in March to
asking classmates to help him carry out a Columbine-style attack on
his high school. Derik Lehman was sentenced to five years'
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Butterworth, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles, said
the challenge for schools and police is differentiating between
empty words and serious threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was in school, the saying was 'Sticks and stones can
break your bones but words can never hurt you,''' he said. ''That
has changed.''

<HEADLINE> Elian Case Tough for Kids To Process  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MEADOWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Crystal Agnew understands it. After
all, what kid would walk away from trips to Disney World, a puppy,
a rabbit named Esperanza and, to top it all off, a swimming pool?
Not her, she knows.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Crystal, 15, doesn't really believe 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez has any business deciding whether he should stay in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's only a little boy. I don't think he understands what is
going on,'' said Crystal, an eighth-grader at Conniston Community
Middle School 90 miles north of Miami. ''It's like a big playground
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In schools across the country, children Elian's age and older
are just as inundated as the rest of America with the saga
unfolding in South Florida. Like adults, they struggle to figure
out how one child became a national obsession. And, like adults,
they don't share the same opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he has enough brains to choose if he wants to go back
to his dad,'' said Shane Buck, 15, of Plainview, Neb., enjoying a
day off from school at the Westroads Mall in Omaha. Of one thing,
he's sure: ''I don't think it should be a national matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston's Roxbury section at the Maurice J. Tobin School, 68
percent of students are Hispanic, though none are Cuban. On Friday
afternoon, eighth-grader Thomas Brown -- in baggy jeans and striped
T-shirt -- said his social-studies class has spent time talking
about Elian. Though he didn't think the boy was old enough for an
independent decision, Thomas said he was ambivalent about what
should happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's confusing for him. He's got his father telling him one
thing, and the rest of the family telling him something else,''
said Thomas, 14. ''If that was me, I wouldn't want outside persons,
or the government, trying to make decisions for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Beniquez, 12, another honor-roll student at the Tobin
school, agreed. ''Everybody's in his business,'' the sixth-grader
said. ''He's too little to decide for himself. Everybody's, like,
deciding for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Erin Finlayson was shopping at a mall in Lubbock,
Texas. She said she's been watching coverage while getting ready
for school. ''I think the U.S. would be a lot safer,'' she said.
''Cuba doesn't have anything for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   At West Palm Beach's Conniston school, many children, including
13-year-old Albert Pavon, whose parents came to the United States
from Cuba in the early 1980s, have strong opinions about the Elian
situation. They all agree the boy should be granted citizenship.
And the father?
</P>
<P>
   ''If he really wants his kid, he should stay here with him,''
said 14-year-old Jessica Rosario. ''He should be glad for his son --
that he is now free from Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica has changed her mind since Elian first arrived. At
first, like her mother, she believed Elian should be returned to
Cuba. No more.
</P>
<P>
   ''God had a reason for him to be here,'' said the tall, Hispanic
girl. ''His mom died bringing him here. He lived through the two
days in the water and stuff. He should be allowed to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   One theme kept coming up: the attention. After 4{ months, many
students said they were overwhelmed by the media attention and are
ready for a resolution. Thomas Brown, the Boston student, certainly
is.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we first heard about it, on the front page of newspapers,
that's all you'd see,'' Thomas said. ''After a while, you just
don't care no more.''

<HEADLINE> No apologies from State Police superintendent on reform timeline  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The head of the New Jersey State Police said
Friday anyone who thinks an overhaul of the department can be
accomplished quickly lives in a ''dream world.''
</P>
<P>
   Col. Carson Dunbar was speaking with members of the state's
Black Ministers Council, which is holding a weeklong planning
session here. Dunbar laid out the reforms he's made so far but told
critics he would not be bullied into making more changes any more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar staunchly defended his promotion of 300 troopers and
repeatedly told the ministers that he will maintain his timetable
for improving a division tainted by charges of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar has ordered cameras installed in patrol cars, issued a
zero-tolerance policy for discrimination and harassment and is
restructuring the internal affairs unit.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to have every state trooper read a report by the
attorney general's office that accused their ranks of targeting
minority motorists for drug prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But for him to have rebuilt the State Police in the five months
since he was appointed is unrealistic, Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they expect everything to be resolved in a short period of
time, they live in a dream world. I do not,'' Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting Dunbar said that any hasty changes would lead
to more problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bad management decisions end up with bad results,'' Dunbar
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers group has led criticism of the State Police since
an April 1998 shooting of four unarmed minority motorists on the
New Jersey Turnpike. Since then, the group's executive director,
the Rev. Reginald Jackson, and others have challenged Dunbar on his
handling of the racial profiling allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Jackson said Dunbar was wrong to promote troopers
before he revised the system. Dunbar said he had to be fair and he
would not withhold a promotion based solely on suspicions that a
trooper engaged in racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not be goaded into acting without proof,'' Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   He invited the ministers to see for themselves the effect of his
changes and asked them to participate in a continuing review of
State Police operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I challenge you to travel the Turnpike today,'' Dunbar said,
telling the ministers that they would not see minorities being
routinely stopped along the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent also had a promise for troopers who did
target minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those few who have also caused problems in the past also know
this is a new day,'' Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. praised Dunbar's work and
said he supports the time he is taking to make the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to last, in order to make people's lives better, the
process has to be done right,'' said Farmer, adding that New Jersey
has done more ''than any other state or the federal government to
prohibit the practice of racial profiling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Stanley Justice said this was the first time many in
the group had met Dunbar. Ministers liked his answers, but they
expect him to follow through with actions, Justice said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will give him the fact that he hasn't been here long
enough,'' Justice said. ''After a while that will not be an
excuse.''

<HEADLINE> TV Group Boosts Tribune Earnings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Tribune Co., the parent company of the Chicago
Tribune and the Chicago Cubs, reported an 18 percent increase in
first quarter earnings from operations, driven by continued growth
in its television group.
</P>
<P>
   For the first three months of 2000, Tribune's earnings from
operations rose to $85.5 million, or 32 cents a share, from $72.7
million, or 27 cents a share, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The results reported Friday matched Wall Street expectations,
according to a survey of analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial.
Tribune shares fell 31\ cents to $37.56\ in trading at 4:30 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings from operations exclude non-operating items in both
periods. With those items, Tribune's net income fell to $71.2
million, or 26 cents a share, from $343.3 million, or $1.30 a
share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Non-operating items in the latest quarter reduced earnings per
share by 6 cents mainly due to an adjustment in the valuation of
Tribune's derivatives securities. Non-operating items swelled last
year's earnings by $1.03 a share due to an increase in the
valuation of derivatives and Tribune's sale of WGNX-TV in Atlanta
and shares of America Online common stock.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the quarter increased 9 percent to $782.4 million
from $719.8 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Profits at Tribune's broadcasting and entertainment division
rose 33 percent in the quarter to $84 million. The company
attributes the gain primarily to growth at its WB affiliates and at
its flagship WGN superstation. The division's revenues rose 18
percent to $311.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune publishing division's profits edged up to $109
million from $108 million. Revenues rose 3 percent to $397 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company reports advertising revenues at its newspapers,
including the Orlando Sentinel, increased, while revenues from
classified ads were flat. Newsprint and ink expenses fell 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune Co. last month agreed to acquire Los Angeles-based Times
Mirror Co. in a $6 billion deal that will create the nation's
third-largest newspaper company.
</P>
<P>
   Diversified operations of the new company will include 22
television stations and Internet news sites that will attract 3.4
million visits a month.

<HEADLINE> Killings, Threats Rise in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The human rights situation in Colombia has
deteriorated significantly in the past year, with killings, death
threats and kidnappings all on the rise, U.N. High Commissioner for
Human Rights Mary Robinson said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the allegations have implicated paramilitary
groups, who allegedly operate with the support or acquiescence of
the Colombian military, Robinson told the 53-nation U.N. Human
Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The report, part of an annual review of countries, was likely to
fuel the criticism about a proposed $1.7 billion U.S.
anti-narcotics aid package for Colombia that would massively
increase Washington's support for the country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana was in London and Washington
this week lobbying for the U.S. aid and nearly $2 billion more from
European donors to back his Plan Colombia for fighting narcotics in
the Andean nation.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worry the U.S. portion of the aid, which would finance a
Colombian military strike into rebel-held jungles where poor
peasants grow drug crops, could aggravate a troubling panorama in
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a huge concern about the humanitarian effects that
action might generate,'' said the U.N. human rights director in
Colombia, Anders Kompass, releasing Robinson's report
simultaneously in Bogota on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson noted complaints that members of the armed forces and
police were responsible for human rights abuses, and urged that
''deep concern over the widespread impunity'' for such violations
be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   To put an end to paramilitary activity, she urged the government
to take ''stringent measures,'' including the arrest, trial and
punishment of ''those who, by whatever means, participate in or
support paramilitary groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Decades of violence in Colombia involving government troops,
drug gangs, left-wing guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries have
displaced more than 1.5 million people and killed tens of
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's report said 1,836 people were killed in massacres
last year, an increase of 36 percent on 1998. It said 402 massacres
were reported, a rise of nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rights office ''has received reports indicating that members
of the military forces participate directly in the organization of
new paramilitary groups and in disseminating threats,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson highlighted the plight of Colombia's internally
displaced people.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. refugee agency estimates that violence by armed groups
has driven at least 800,000 people from their homes since 1996.
Almost all have remained in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Some 123,000 people were displaced in the first six months of
last year alone, it says.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Surge in March  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices surged in March, reflecting
higher costs for everything from gasoline to housing. The
unexpectely bad news on inflation triggered the worst one-day point
drop in Wall Street history.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report prompted investors, already suffering a dismal
week, to unload stocks feverishly. The selling turned into a panic
as the session wore on.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow plunged 617.78 points, or 5.7 percent, at 10,305.77, its
lowest level in a month. At its lowest point Friday, the index was
off 722 points. The Nasdaq dropped 355.49 points, or by 9.7
percent, to 3,321.29, its lowest finish since Nov. 17, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling to investors and economists: the core rate of
inflation, which ignores volatile food and energy prices, jumped by
the largest amount in five years.
</P>
<P>
   On a wild day on Wall Street, Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan renewed a warning that while technological improvements
have helped investors manage risk better, the nation's financial
markets are not immune to a sudden loss of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the general human experience that when confronted with
uncertainty, whether in financial markets or in any other aspect of
life, disengagement is the normal protective reaction,'' Greenspan
said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, asked about Wall Street's
dramatic slide in an appearance on CNN, said: ''We're watching
developments in the markets, as we always do.'' But Summers
stressed that the fundamentals of the U.S economy remain sound.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index, the most closely watched inflation
gauge, shot up 0.7 percent last month, the biggest spike in close
to a year, which followed a sizable 0.5 percent increase in
February, the Labor Department said.
</P>
<P>
   While the overall figure surprised economists and investors, it
was the 0.4 percent increase in the core rate of inflation,
reflecting fairly widespread price increases, that really stunned
them. The core rate took its biggest leap in five years, a rise
twice as fast as many analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fed has been worried that inflation would accelerate but
had not seen evidence of a 'smoking gun.' ... It's fair to say that
the gun has smoked,'' First Union economist David Orr said of the
core rate.
</P>
<P>
   Higher prices for housing, clothing, airline fares, medical care
and other items all contributed to the jump in the core rate, which
had risen by a mild 0.2 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hallmark of the report is that price increases are so
broad-based. Prices for everything from apparel to sporting events
are rising more quickly. It indicates that we will see stronger
inflation numbers as we make our way though the year,'' said Mark
Zandi, an economist with RFA Dismal Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation report raises the odds that the Federal Reserve
might boost interest rates by half a percentage point when
policy-makers meet May 16, economists said. Still, many believe the
Fed will stick with its steady-as-she-goes approach and boost rates
by a quarter of a point.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report was a significant surprise,'' said Ken Mayland,
economist with ClearView Economics. ''It certainly is going to
raise eyebrows at the Fed. In previous meetings, the Fed has talked
about increasing interest rates at a faster pace. Certainly the
core inflation number is something that is going to cause them to
give even more consideration to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has raised rates five times since June 30, each
a quarter of a point, to slow the red-hot economy and keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   A huge 4.9 percent increase in energy costs, the largest since
last April, helped catapult overall consumer prices in March.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices rose 11.1 percent and natural gas went up 1.9
percent, both increases the largest since September. However, fuel
oil prices, which posted a record increase in February, fell in
March by 14.2 percent, the biggest decline in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Production limits by oil-producing nations largely accounted for
the rise in overall energy costs. Crude oil prices hit $34 a barrel
in early March, the latest in a series of nine-year highs that have
sent gasoline prices soaring. Given that oil prices have fallen
since then, economists believe the April CPI report should show
lower energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by oil-producing countries to boost production should
eventually provide additional relief.
</P>
<P>
   Of more concern to economists, though, were increases in other
prices that they did not believe were linked to higher energy
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Housing costs, a big chunk of the total CPI, rose 0.4 percent
reflecting low supply and strong demand, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing prices rose 0.3 percent, and medical care costs grew by
0.5 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   In other reports, industrial production rose 0.3 percent in
March, as expected, a fresh sign that the manufacturing sector is
on solid footing. Business inventories grew by 0.5 percent in
February.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross OKs Formula on Israel  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The international Red Cross announced today that
it had worked out a formula that could clear the way for the
admittance of its Israeli counterpart after a 51-year wait.
</P>
<P>
   In two days of talks, Israel and the American Red Cross accepted
a proposal to include Magen David Adom's red star of David as an
emblem within a new neutral shape that could be used instead of the
red cross or the red crescent, Red Cross officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Israel and the U.S. government, which took part in
negotiations, voiced reservations before deciding to go along with
a test of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to frame the star of David in a new emblem --
probably a red diamond. The diamond could also be used as a frame
for national emblems of other societies.
</P>
<P>
   The sizes of the diamond and the star of David still have to be
worked out, as do details on how the symbols would be used to
protect military medical workers on the battlefield, Red Cross
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss-run ICRC, mandated to aid war victims on all sides
under the Geneva conventions, wants to avoid a ''proliferation of
emblems'' because it is already alarmed by disrespect for the red
cross and red crescent in some conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are witnessing a historic moment,'' said Muhammed al-Hadid,
the president of the Jordanian Red Crescent.
</P>
<P>
   Other key Red Cross officials said the Israeli society could be
admitted by the end of the year pending approval of the new symbol.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., who began pressing
for recognition of Magen David Adon 20 years ago, welcomed the
announcement. He said it marks an important shift in long-standing
Red Cross policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to commend the American Red Cross for their persistence
and their commitment to seeking recognition for MDA,'' Gejdenson
said in a statement
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal drew a lukewarm response from the American Red
Cross. Spokesman Chris Thomas said his organization has ''serious
doubts'' that the process outlined today will succeed by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   He said the American Red Cross will hold ICRC President Jakob
Kellenberger to a promise it said he made to members of Congress
and the U.S. administration last week that the ICRC would invoke a
''safety net'' to admit MDA by the end of the year, regardless of
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the president of Magen David Adom, Dr. Moshe
Mellul, said his organization has not yet received the Red Cross
proposal for a diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our position is that our symbol should be accepted as it is,''
he told The Associated Press. But the governing body will discuss a
different proposal if it is submitted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Kazakstan and possibly Eritrea, which wish to
respect the sensitivities of both Christians and Muslims, the cross
and crescent could be used together in the new emblem.
</P>
<P>
   The red crescent, which uses a symbol in Islam, was first used
in the 19th century by the Ottoman Empire to protect medical
workers in combat.
</P>
<P>
   It will still be up to a full session of the Red Cross movement,
which includes 188 countries, to ratify the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the emblem has been a key obstacle to the MDA's
joining the federation since 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross will continue to withhold $5 million in
basic dues from the international federation over the dispute,
Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the American society in the discussions was
Lawrence Eagleburger, the former U.S. secretary of state, who
pushed the working group to clear obstacles to MDA's admittance.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending the meeting were representatives of the U.S. and
Israeli governments, but MDA did not send a representative.

<HEADLINE> Officials Denouce VA Nurse  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A nurse bungled the care of at least six
patients -- including two who died -- but is still working at a
Veterans Affairs hospital in Phoenix, according to a VA report that
was sent to the White House and Congress this week.
</P>
<P>
   VA investigators said nurse anesthetist David T. Polner removed
breathing tubes too early and made other errors in the care of the
six patients between 1993 and 1999. The VA concluded that Polner's
actions did not kill the two patients who died, although reviewers
cited problems with incomplete records in both cases and said no
other cause could be found for one man's death.
</P>
<P>
   Polner did not return phone messages seeking comment Friday. But
John Fears, director of the Carl Hayden VA Medical Center, said in
an interview Friday that Polner is not a threat to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''David Polner is a good nurse anesthetist,'' Fears said. ''The
things he was accused of are really normal complications that occur
in anesthesiology ... He's been very closely monitored and they
can't find any problem at all with the way he practices
anesthesiology.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal watchdog agency criticized the VA for not having
policies to discipline or fire workers who give poor care to sick
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that it is a matter of common sense that the VA
should consider removing the patient care responsibilities of a
staff member whose actions have been found ... to be associated
with a high rate of patient mortality,'' Elaine Kaplan of the U.S.
Office of Special Counsel wrote to President Clinton and Congress
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Stump, an Arizona Republican who chairs the House
Veterans' Affairs Committee, said he, too, was concerned about the
lack of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very disturbed and concerned by these findings, and I am
going to be monitoring the VA's corrective actions closely,'' Stump
said in a statement. ''Arizona's veterans should be able to count
on the best possible care at the VA.''
</P>
<P>
   The VA report said hospital officials claimed they were unaware
of any problems in the anesthesiology unit until investigators
showed up in March 1999, responding to a staff doctor's complaint.
On Friday, Fears said hospital officials first investigated Polner
in 1997 because of an anonymous complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went back and pulled every case in which he had been
involved, and found that his error rate was no different than
anyone else's,'' Fears said. ''We have been doing review after
review for four years and we've only been able to find these few
cases in which there was a regrettable bad outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The VA probe looked at only 14 patients, nine of whom were
anesthetized by Polner. Among the nine were the six whose care, the
VA investigators said, was substandard. Other nurses told the
investigators that Polner's patients had ''more breathing
problems'' than any of the other five nurse anesthetists working at
the hospital, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues also described Polner as ''brusque, intimidating,
moody and volatile'' and said he insulted veterans, the report
said. Fears said Polner had gotten counseling and his behavior had
improved.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone does their job well, I can't fire them if someone
doesn't like their personality,'' Fears said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an anesthesiologist at the hospital says he was
demoted, threatened with a suspension and falsely accused of
wrongdoing after complaining about Polner to his supervisors and
federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not only a huge injustice, but a public wrong that's
been committed here,'' said Brian Christensen, a lawyer for the
anesthesiologist turned whistleblower, Dr. Winston Liao.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen said hospital officials have required Liao to
undergo five psychiatric evaluations in recent months. He said four
showed Liao was mentally healthy and the results from the fifth are
pending. Liao was transferred from performing anesthesiology to
doing physicals for prospective employees, Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's still getting shafted,'' said Christensen, of Wichita,
Kan. ''He's still employed by the VA and they're putting him
through hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears said Liao is not being punished for his criticism. Fears
called Liao's case ''a very difficult personnel situation to
handle'' and said Liao had admitted to taking records out of the
hospital and locking them in his car trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen said Liao locked them in his car briefly to avoid
leaving them on an unsecured desk. The records never left the
hospital grounds, Christensen said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks Elian Handover  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With relative calm returning to the streets of
Little Havana, the Elian Gonzalez case shifted Friday to the
courts, where his Miami family invoked the U.N. human rights
charter to try to keep him here and the government demanded he be
turned over to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives, who have lost their custody case in a Florida
family court and are appealing a federal court decision, opened an
attack on a new legal front.
</P>
<P>
   They argued in federal court in Washington that Elian should be
barred from leaving the country until the U.S. government can
certify that his human rights wouldn't be violated if he returned
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, ''Elian would face the risk of being persecuted for
having sought asylum in the United States,'' lawyers for his
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez said in papers filed Thursday. A judge
set a hearing on the request for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. government responded in Atlanta to the
federal court injunction granted Thursday that prevents Elian from
leaving the country for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   The government argued that Lazaro Gonzalez should receive no
help from the appeals court until he surrenders the 6-year-old boy
to his father. Going a step further, the government asked the court
to order Lazaro to hand Elian over.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the government filed its papers, the court moved
swiftly -- ordering the family to respond by 9 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction served to defuse the crisis on Thursday, when
Elian's Miami relatives ignored a government deadline to hand over
the boy. Thousands of people had massed outside Lazaro Gonzalez's
home, threatening to defy any attempt by the government to enforce
its will and seize Elian. When the injunction came down, the
Justice Department agreed not to take action to reunite Elian with
his father for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, only about 100 Cuban-American protesters continued
their vigil in a soaking rain. Many huddled under blue tarps and
sang religious songs. Elian and his 21-year-old cousin,
Marisleysis, came to the front door and waved to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowing the federal government, they're going to start putting
some incredible pressure on that family,'' said one of the
protesters, Fausto Diaz, a 34-year-old businessman. ''I hope the
government doesn't go batter down the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's court filing also revealed that Elian's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, has agreed that if he is given custody of
Elian, he will stay in the United States until the appeals court
rules on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The father spent his ninth day in America without Elian, who
remained in his great-uncle's house in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued by fishermen while clinging to an inner tube
in the ocean on Thanksgiving. His mother and 10 other people
fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have cared for him ever since and have been
fighting in court for an asylum hearing. The Clinton administration
has ordered Elian back to his father, saying only he can speak for
the boy on immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   In their court filing in Washington, the Miami relatives said
that Elian, if returned to Cuba, would be indoctrinated to believe
his mother, her boyfriend and his family in Florida were ''traitors
to the revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   They asked that the U.S. government to be barred from deporting
Elian unless the State Department can certify that Cuba is in
compliance with the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights and that the
country is ''no longer engaged in systematic, gross violations of
human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   They cited evidence that Juan Miguel Gonzalez was under pressure
from the Cuban government to demand Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers countered by saying immigration
officials found nothing to suggest Elian that would be at risk of
torture or persecution if returned to his father, or that his
father had been coerced by the Cuban government.

</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that it is a matter of common sense that the VA
should consider removing the patient care responsibilities of a
staff member whose actions have been found ... to be associated
with a high rate of patient mortality,'' Elaine Kaplan of the U.S.
Office of Special Counsel wrote to President Clinton and Congress
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Stump, an Arizona Republican who chairs the House
Veterans' Affairs Committee, said he, too, was concerned about the
lack of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very disturbed and concerned by these findings, and I am
going to be monitoring the VA's corrective actions closely,'' Stump
said in a statement. ''Arizona's veterans should be able to count
on the best possible care at the VA.''
</P>
<P>
   The VA report said hospital officials claimed they were unaware
of any problems in the anesthesiology unit until investigators
showed up in March 1999, responding to a staff doctor's complaint.
On Friday, Fears said hospital officials first investigated Polner
in 1997 because of an anonymous complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went back and pulled every case in which he had been
involved, and found that his error rate was no different than
anyone else's,'' Fears said. ''We have been doing review after
review for four years and we've only been able to find these few
cases in which there was a regrettable bad outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The VA probe looked at only 14 patients, nine of whom were
anesthetized by Polner. Among the nine were the six whose care, the
VA investigators said, was substandard. Other nurses told the
investigators that Polner's patients had ''more breathing
problems'' than any of the other five nurse anesthetists working at
the hospital, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues also described Polner as ''brusque, intimidating,
moody and volatile'' and said he insulted veterans, the report
said. Fears said Polner had gotten counseling and his behavior had
improved.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone does their job well, I can't fire them if someone
doesn't like their personality,'' Fears said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an anesthesiologist at the hospital says he was
demoted, threatened with a suspension and falsely accused of
wrongdoing after complaining about Polner to his supervisors and
federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not only a huge injustice, but a public wrong that's
been committed here,'' said Brian Christensen, a lawyer for the
anesthesiologist turned whistleblower, Dr. Winston Liao.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen said hospital officials have required Liao to
undergo five psychiatric evaluations in recent months. He said four
showed Liao was mentally healthy and the results from the fifth are
pending. Liao was transferred from performing anesthesiology to
doing physicals for prospective employees, Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's still getting shafted,'' said Christensen, of Wichita,
Kan. ''He's still employed by the VA and they're putting him
through hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears said Liao is not being punished for his criticism. Fears
called Liao's case ''a very difficult personnel situation to
handle'' and said Liao had admitted to taking records out of the
hospital and locking them in his car trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen said Liao locked them in his car briefly to avoid
leaving them on an unsecured desk. The records never left the
hospital grounds, Christensen said.

<HEADLINE> Tentative Africa Trade Deal Praised  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional leaders welcomed a tentative
agreement on legislation extending new trade benefits to African,
Central American and Caribbean nations Friday and suggested final
action could come next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement marks a significant milestone for a strong and
meaningful trade mechanism in the African and Caribbean Basin
areas,'' House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer,
R-Texas, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A monthslong logjam on the bill, a top Clinton administration
trade initiative, was broken Thursday night as leaders from the
House and the Senate met to hammer out a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Although some staff work remained, leaders characterized the
agreement as a major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the legislation would boost investment,
economic growth and job creation in these countries and improve the
competitive position of the U.S. textile industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will help promote economic reform, reduce poverty and
broaden participation in the benefits of the global economy,''
Clinton said in a statement. ''I urge Congress to complete the
remaining work on the bill rapidly so that final approval can occur
during the first week after its Easter recess.''
</P>
<P>
   According to participants, House leaders agreed to a Senate
proposal to give Caribbean and Central American nations many of the
same duty-free benefits to be extended to sub-Saharan African
nations.
</P>
<P>
   And House negotiators, in turn, agreed to some Senate
restrictions on apparel imports designed to protect the
hard-pressed U.S. textile industry.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said he hoped for final
House and Senate votes on the measure ''as soon as possible,''
suggesting it might come up soon after Congress returns from a
two-week spring recess that began on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
participated in the evening talks that produced the tentative
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Lott on Friday said that winning final approval of the bill
would be ''a major achievement ... It will help Africa and help the
Caribbean and help America.''
</P>
<P>
   Some details were sketchy, but those close to the negotiations
said House leaders agreed to accept a more-expansive Senate version
in terms of countries covered.
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed bill only dealt with the 48 countries of
sub-Saharan Africa. The Senate bill -- and now the compromise --
covers these nations, plus 24 Caribbean and Central American
nations as well.
</P>
<P>
   In another compromise, House leaders agreed to go along with a
cap on the volume of apparel shipments to receive duty-free
treatment, while Senate leaders agreed to lower restrictions than
in the original Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders also agreed to drop a Senate-passed requirement
that African-assembled apparel use U.S. fabric and thread, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the poorest countries in Africa would be eligible
for duty-free treatment in U.S. markets with no restrictions for
four years.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts manufactured in Caribbean and Central American
countries would be subject to some restrictions not applied to
other apparel, however, in a nod to U.S. textile manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something we have really wanted to accomplish for
sometime,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told
reporters. He called the tentative agreement ''good news for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and congressional leaders hoped to
handle the measure before taking up an even more contentious trade
bill later in the spring, extending permanent trade benefits to
China to help ease the way for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Rare Argentine Files Found in Vault  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE MELIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Rare intelligence files dating to
the past military dictatorship have been found in a musty bank
vault, shedding new light on the regime's crackdown on leftist
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The cache of yellowing papers was found by Interior Ministry
workers cleaning the vault of a now-defunct state development bank
in Buenos Aires, La Nacion newspaper reported Friday. The ministry
has offices there.
</P>
<P>
   The dusty archive includes old intelligence reports on left-wing
groups and suspected opponents of authoritarian rule during the
so-called ''Dirty War.''
</P>
<P>
   La Nacion called it a rare find, noting many documents from the
1976-83 dictatorship are presumed to have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Lautaro Garcia Batallan, an Interior Minister subsecretary, said
Friday the documents provide revealing insights into the past
regime and are of national interest. They will be made public once
they have been inspected and organized, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an issue that that touches everyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The files report on activities of leftist groups and
individuals, moves to censor the media, and tactics for opposing
human rights groups, which had pressured for information on the
whereabouts of the missing, Garcia Batallan said.
</P>
<P>
   They also include letters from the International Red Cross
appealing for better conditions for those detained and documents on
counteracting what military authorities considered a ''smear
campaign'' against their rule.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say at least 9,000 people disappeared during the
''Dirty War.'' Human rights groups put the figure as high as 30,000
missing or killed.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Friday, national news agencies reported that
documents had been uncovered regarding 88 unidentified bodies
buried in a cemetery outside Buenos Aires between 1976 and 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Noticias Argentinas said the municipality of Lomas de Zamora had
turned the information over to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the Dirty War victims remains a sensitive issue in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   In Buenos Aires, a former army chief, Gen. Jorge Livera Rovere,
was ordered detained Friday by a federal judge probing the alleged
kidnapping of children born to dissidents in captivity, the news
agency Diarios y Noticias reported.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights group charge the military organized a systematic
plan for the illegal adoption of more than 200 children born to
dissidents held during the military's seven-year campaign against
leftists and political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 former officers, including the regime's first
president, Jorge Videla, have been detained or held under house
arrest.

<HEADLINE> Clintons' Investment Income Up  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investment income earned by President Clinton
and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has nearly tripled since
1997, but their overall income is down largely due to a drop in
royalties from Mrs. Clinton's book, according to tax returns
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons reported adjusted gross income of $416,039 for
1999, down about $88,000 from the year before. That still placed
them in the top 2 percent income bracket, a group that pays 40
percent of all U.S. income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The first couple paid $92,104 in income taxes and could have
claimed a refund of $2,278, but they decided instead to apply that
to next year's tax bill. The average taxes paid by all taxpayers in
their income group was just over $71,000 in 1997, the most recent
year complete IRS statistics are available.
</P>
<P>
   Their earnings included Clinton's salary as president of
$200,000, which is set by law, and $185,857 in capital gains,
dividend and interest income mainly from their blind trust managed
by Pell Rudman Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
   The capital gains income of $179,849 last year compares with
$65,028 in 1997, mirroring the gains earned by millions of other
investors during the stock market's boom. The Clintons' blind trust
did a little better in 1998, earning $200,318.
</P>
<P>
   Royalties from Mrs. Clinton's 1996 book, ''It Takes A Village,''
amounted to $20,214 last year, down from almost $282,000 in 1997
and $74,289 in 1998. A White House statement said the book's
earnings were donated to ''charities across the country that
support children and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Also given to charity was $12,000 from the Henry G. Freeman Jr.
Pin Money Fund, established in Freeman's 1912 will as income for
whoever is the spouse of the president. All told, the Clintons made
$39,200 in charitable contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Like about a third of all Americans, the Clintons claimed
itemized deductions, a total of $81,358.
</P>
<P>
   As new owners of a home in Chappaqua, N.Y. -- Mrs. Clinton's base
for her New York run for the Senate -- the Clintons claimed $31,931
in deductions for state and local income taxes and for real estate
taxes. They also claimed a home mortgage deduction of $10,714.
</P>
<P>
   Like about half of all taxpayers, the Clintons used a
professional preparer to do their taxes, a certified public
accountant in Rockville, Md., who charged them $5,625 in 1998 for
the service.

<HEADLINE> USDA Claims Civil Rights Progress  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A year after settling a discrimination lawsuit
with black farmers, the Agriculture Department says it has made
strides in improving its treatment of minority producers and
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''From hiring practices to program outreach to accountability
and disciplinary action, we have taken strong steps to ensure that
all USDA employees and customers are treated with the fairness,
dignity, and respect that they deserve,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman says in the preface to a report to be released later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The department has fired 13 workers and disciplined 81 others
over the past two years for discrimination against farmers or
minority USDA employees.
</P>
<P>
   USDA won court approval a year ago Friday for the settlement of
a lawsuit filed on behalf of black farmers who claimed that they
had been systematically discriminated against for years when they
applied for loans and subsidy programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some 18,000 farmers filed claims under the settlement. Some
7,329 cases have been approved so far, and payments of $50,000 each
have been made to 3,594 of those, according to the report. Another
4,742 claims have been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the settlement, farmers who can show some
evidence of discrimination are entitled to $50,000 each and have
outstanding loans forgiven. An additional $12,500 is being sent to
the Internal Revenue Service in the name of each farmer to cover
the federal income taxes that he or she would owe on the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Another 142 farmers who believe they have stronger evidence of
discrimination are seeking higher levels of damages.
</P>
<P>
   The department now is being sued by American Indian farmers and
also has been battling several discrimination complaints filed by
groups of minority employees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the settlement, black farmers say the department still
has not rooted out the discrimination in the department, especially
in its county offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing you can credit the Agriculture Department for
is ... the fact that they admitted something happened and had the
guts to look at this. That's the only progress we've made,'' John
Boyd Jr., president of the National Black Farmers Association, said
in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A top-level official in the department should have been removed
as a signal to the rest of the department, which has 84,000
employees, that discrimination would not be tolerated, Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   USDA's inspector general has been critical of record keeping and
management in the department's civil rights office.
</P>
<P>
   Besides settling the lawsuit, the department has increased its
lending to women and minorities and boosted their representation on
the state and county committees that oversee its programs,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Some 107 of the 224 state committee members were minorities and
women as of last year, up from 75 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under Secretary Glickman's leadership, we have turned the tide
on this issue. While there's still more work to do our efforts are
having a real impact,'' said spokeswoman Mary Beth Schultheis.

<HEADLINE> United Artists Faces Debt Problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- United Artists Theater Co. is being
blocked from paying $12.3 million in debt this week in a dispute
between its creditors, the company's president said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arthur Anderson and Co., the independent accounting
firm that reviewed the company's accounts, is raising questions
about the company's viability.
</P>
<P>
   ''UATC has suffered recurring losses from operations and may not
generate sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as
they become due, which raises substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern,'' Arthur Anderson officials said in
a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The $12.3 million debt due this week is part of the
Englewood-based company's $440 million line of credit. Senior
creditors, led by Bank of America Corp., on Wednesday blocked
United Artists from making a $12.3 million payment to subordinated
creditors that is due Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senior creditors don't want any of the money going to
subordinated creditors,'' said Kurt Hall, president of UATC. The
closely-held company owns more than 2,000 movie theater screens in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   United Artists has been hurt by a glut of movie houses and
expensive leases at bad theaters, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said leases on older theaters that don't have such features
as stadium seating and digital sound are a huge drag on the
company's balance sheet. The company has already said it might
declare bankruptcy to get rid of some of the expensive leases.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not considering bankruptcy right now,'' Hall said. ''It
is a strategy that may be employed to expedite getting rid of some
of these leases. We have a lot of bad deals that we have to get out
of with our landlords. We've done a good job of getting out of some
leases. But using the court process may be one way of getting out
of certain leases.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Solomon, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said the
banks have been working with United Artists for more than a year
and likely will not continue to be lenient.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one in the bank group will throw good money after bad,''
Solomon said. ''The banks are in control here. The situation will
get worse before it gets better.''

<HEADLINE> Freddie Mac Backs Minority Families  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Freddie Mac says it will try to help stimulate
minority home ownership by buying up to $1 billion in mortgage
loans made to minority families over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Mac said Friday it will purchase loans made through Bank
of America and minority-owned lenders in selected locations. It
also has pledged to provide $1 million to support the home
ownership project.
</P>
<P>
   ''Freddie Mac's mission is to make the dream of decent,
accessible housing a reality,'' Freddie Mac's chairman and chief
executive Leland C. Brendsel said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is a joint effort with the Rev. Jesse Jackson's
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, officials said, and is an extension of the
coalition's effort to stimulate corporate investment in
minority-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based Rainbow/PUSH's partnership with Freddie Mac is
designed to help ''tear down the barriers blocking minority
families from the most significant financial opportunity facing
most American families: home ownership,'' Jackson said in a
prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Mac is a stockholder-owned corporation chartered by
Congress to increase the supply of funds that commercial banks and
other mortgage lenders can make available to home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Jackson urged shareholders to withdraw investments from
Freddie Mac amid a $15 million race-discrimination lawsuit filed by
a former executive.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said
it would require Freddie Mac and another housing finance company,
Fannie Mae, to finance more mortgages for low- and moderate-income
families. The move will boost their total to $2.4 trillion in such
mortgages over 10 years, HUD said.

<HEADLINE> Chavez's Rival Gaining In Race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The former army officer who helped
Hugo Chavez stage his famed 1992 coup attempt and is now seeking to
unseat the Venezuelan leader in May's presidential election is
closing in on his rival, according to an opinion poll published
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidate Francisco Arias would receive 41 percent
of the vote if elections were held today, while Chavez would
receive 45 percent, said a poll by the private Venezuelan firm
Mercanalisis.
</P>
<P>
   The group surveyed 1,000 people in seven major cities across the
country, Mercanalisis' Paul Villasmil told The Associated Press.
The poll, which was conducted between March 21 and April 6, has a
margin of error of 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The survey comes as tensions over the upcoming presidential
elections intensified this week with opposition politicians,
Catholic Church leaders and retired military officials calling on
national election officials to move quickly to ensure fair
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The National Election Council has come under fire after Arias
and opposition leaders said fair elections may not be possible
because Chavez's political movement hand-picked the electoral
council's members.
</P>
<P>
   This latest poll shows Arias making strong gains in his bid to
unseat his one-time comrade. A poll in March showed an 11 point
difference between the two candidates. Arias split with Chavez
saying the president abandoned the goals of their failed coup.
</P>
<P>
   Many Venezuelans believe Arias has a chance to unseat the
charismatic Chavez because he is not associated with the
traditional political parties that Chavez's political coalition has
decimated since he became president over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   A new constitution pushed through by Chavez last year requires
new elections for most public offices, including the presidency,
congress, governorships and local councils.

<HEADLINE> Transplant Bill Decision Delayed  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Backers of compromise legislation setting
rules for the nation's transplant system failed to move their bill
through the Senate before Congress left town for spring break.
</P>
<P>
   But its chief sponsors, Sens. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., say they'll try again when the Senate returns in
late April.
</P>
<P>
   The bill just passed out of committee on Wednesday, but
supporters had hoped to move it quickly using a process that
requires all members of the Senate to go along. Leaders in both
parties were willing to move it through quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one senator, Democrat Russ Feingold of Wisconsin,
objected, reflecting the views of his state's governor and
transplant hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's hoping to still work on a compromise,'' said
Feingold spokeswoman Laura Grund.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation attempts to balance power between the Department
of Health and Human Services and the private contractor that runs
the nation's transplant system, who have been battling over who
should have final say over transplant policy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Frist-Kennedy bill, a panel of medical experts would
have final say over how the nation distributes scarce organs to
thousands of waiting patients.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation does not address the substance of the argument:
whether organs should be offered first to patients who live near
the donor, as in the current system, or go to the sickest patients
first, even if they live elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it sets up a mediation system to settle disputes between
HHS and the transplant network. An outside panel of experts would
have the power to make final decisions on policy, based on legal
principles.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-member panel will be comprised of seven people nominated
by HHS, by the transplant network and by the independent Institute
of Medicine. The network and the IOM will each nominate 12 people
and the HHS secretary will choose from among their lists.
</P>
<P>
   But Feingold and others from Wisconsin object to allowing HHS to
choose the members representing the transplant community, even if
they are picked from a list.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy spokesman Jim Manley said the bill has sufficient
support to pass the Senate and to overcome any attempt to keep it
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if it passes, it must be reconciled with the House,
where lawmakers passed a bill giving the private transplant network
sole power over policy.

<HEADLINE> Group Claims Irish Police Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A dissident republican group
claimed responsibility on Friday for a failed mortar attack on a
Northern Ireland border police base.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt in the abortive attack Wednesday, but the device
near some houses.
</P>
<P>
   The Continuity IRA, a splinter group opposed to the province's
1998 peace accord, used a recognized code word in a call to a
Belfast newsroom to claim responsibility for the attack -- a single
mortar shell that was fired at the police station at Rosslea,
County Fermanagh, but fell 150 yards short of its target.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth failed attack on a security installation since
Feb. 11, when Britain suspended Northern Ireland's new
power-sharing government to avoid a walkout by the pro-British
Ulster Unionist Party over the Irish Republican Army's refusal to
disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Bombers have since attacked military bases in Londonderry and
nearby Ballykelly. Police also said they found a primed rocket
launcher and stopped an attack at a Dungannon military base.
</P>
<P>
   Fermanagh is an area where the Continuity IRA has carried out a
series of attacks in recent years. Another splinter group, which
calls itself the Real IRA and was responsible for the 1998 Omagh
bombing that killed 29 people has been responsible for a series of
other attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The groups are among several that emerged to the IRA-allied Sinn
Fein party's decision to participate in the peace process with
pro-British Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments and Protestant and Catholic
parties to the peace agreement have continued to meet and discuss
solutions to the disarmament problem that has brought the process
to a standstill.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Presses For Arrests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRIBOURG, Switzerland (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic must not be allowed to continue evading international
justice and his arrest is a priority, the top U.N. war crimes
prosecutor said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the University of Fribourg, Carla del Ponte also
said she will press NATO-led forces in Bosnia to arrest former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic because ''it will be
impossible for a lasting peace to be achieved in
Bosnia-Herzegovina'' unless he is tried.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was indicted in connection with last year's atrocities
against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Prosecutors then said his
indictment could later be broadened to include events in Croatia
and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I deplore the fact that, 10 months after the publication of
his indictment, he is still in power, evading international
justice,'' del Ponte said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This situation must not continue and we must not relax our
efforts to persuade and convince.''
</P>
<P>
   She also stressed that she wants to see the arrest of Bosnian
Serb wartime military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-led troops in Bosnia have been reluctant to go after
Karadzic and Mladic, fearing retribution from Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's arrest of Momcilo Krajisnik, once Karadzic's closest
aide, is a ''significant sign of what can be done,'' del Ponte
said.
</P>
<P>
   The former Swiss federal prosecutor was appointed last fall as
the chief prosecutor of the U.N. war crimes tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia, based in the Dutch capital, The Hague.

<HEADLINE> Apologies for Columbine Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The parents of one of the teen-age
gunmen responsible for the shooting spree at Columbine High School
apologized Friday to victims of last year's massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no words to convey how sorry we are for the pain
that has been brought upon the community as a result of our son's
actions,'' Thomas and Susan Klebold said in a statement. ''The pain
of others compounds our own as we struggle to live without the son
we cherished.''
</P>
<P>
   The Klebolds' son, Dylan, and classmate Eric Harris killed 12
students and a teacher, and wounded dozens more at the school April
20 before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Both gunmen's families had issued an apology shortly after the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Michalik, whose son, Richard Castaldo, remains paralyzed
from wounds suffered in the attack, said she was touched by the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a parent, it makes me really sorry for what they've gone
through. I don't think they had a clue what their son was doing,''
she said. ''It doesn't mean I'm not angry at their son. But it's a
nice gesture. My heart goes out to them.''
</P>
<P>
   This most recent expression of remorse from the Klebolds came as
the anniversary of the massacre approaches and as anxiety mounts
for students, teachers and victims' families. They plan a private
assembly at the school Thursday, followed by a public service in a
nearby park.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Ireland, whose dramatic rescue from a library window of the
school was televised, has mixed feelings about the upcoming
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a tough time. But I'm going to hit it
straight on and get through it,'' he said. ''On that day, the
support of my friends and family will make the difference.''

<HEADLINE> Ridge: Change GOP Abortion Plank  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Though he supports abortion rights,
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge won't fight to eliminate strict
anti-abortion language from the party's platform when his state
plays host to the Republican National Convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, often mentioned as a possible running mate for George W.
Bush, believes the party would appear more inclusive if the
platform were changed, but he also feels such an effort would have
little chance of success and would only divide Republicans, said
spokesman Tim Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor has said repeatedly we have to keep our eye on
the ball,'' Reeves said Friday. ''That means helping Governor Bush
to get elected and there's nothing his opponents would like to see
more than to see the party expend its energy and resources fighting
over the abortion plank.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, Bush's strongest rival in the Republican
primaries, also was in Pennsylvania Friday and talking about
inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to make some efforts, along with Governor Ridge
and our candidate, to make sure that we have a platform that is
inclusive, that we send the message that the Republican Party is a
large party that practices the politics of addition and not
division,'' said McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   As for the anti-abortion plank, he said he favors exceptions in
cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of a mother.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting to eliminate the plank would be useless, Reeves said,
especially since Bush ''supports retention of the language, the
people on the platform committee support retention of the
language.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has said he personally would allow abortions
when needed to save a woman's life or to end pregnancies caused by
rape or incest, but he does not want to change the platform.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign said he views the abortion plank as ''an
important statement of pro-life principles'' and realizes ''that
there are a lot of different people with a lot of different views
on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican convention four years ago, nominee Bob Dole
failed in an attempt to soften the platform after a bitter battle.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who will have his first post-primary meeting with Bush
on May 9, said he was sure he would be supporting Bush in the
election ''but I really do feel we need to discuss some issues.''

<HEADLINE> Conservative Court Handling Elian  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal appeals court handling the Elian
Gonzalez case is viewed as somewhat conservative, but with a mix of
liberal and conservative judges.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is ''a little to the
right of center,'' said Bruce Rogow, a law professor at Nova
Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and a frequent
litigator before the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not timid,'' Rogow said, but added, ''they are not
ideologues... They are very respectful of federal power.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit court plans to hear arguments May 11 on an
appeal by Elian's Miami relatives of a federal judge's ruling last
month that upheld Attorney General Janet Reno's decision to return
the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, wants to seek asylum on
Elian's behalf and argues in a separate court proceeding that
returning him to Cuba would violate the United Nations human rights
charter.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, appeals court Judge J.L. Edmondson issued an
emergency order barring Elian from being returned to Cuba until the
11th Circuit case is resolved. The federal government has asked the
court to lift that order, and a three-judge panel is expected to
decide soon whether it will do so.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit court -- covering Alabama, Georgia and Florida --
was created in 1980 when those three states were split off from the
5th Circuit court, which now includes Texas, Louisiana and
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The old six-state 5th Circuit court was known in previous
decades for issuing powerful civil rights rulings and for
protecting individual rights.
</P>
<P>
   Since its creation, the 11th Circuit court has moved in a more
conservative direction, said Randall Berg, executive director of
the Florida Justice Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the court voted 10-2 to allow student-led prayer at
a public high school graduation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court upheld an 11th Circuit court ruling in 1996 in
a landmark ruling that gave new life to the Constitution's 11th
Amendment, which protects states from being sued against their
will.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the justices reversed the appeals court in ruling
that educators can be sued under a federal anti-bias law for
failing to stop student-on-student sexual harassment. The 11th
Circuit court had said the federal law never applied to such
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Rogow said much depends on which three-judge panel is chosen to
hear a case, but that overall, ''they are a court that most
criminal defense lawyers view as pro-government.''
</P>
<P>
   In hearing the Gonzalez case, he said the court likely would
''take a quizzical view toward all of this madness and wonder why
it's all gotten so far out of hand.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Issues Dialysis Product Warning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration issued an
urgent warning Friday that an unapproved product being used to keep
lines open in some dialysis units can be deadly if infused into
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said it had one report of a death in which a patient
suffered cardiac arrest shortly after triCitrasol was injected full
strength into a permanent blood access catheter.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said rapid and excessive infusion of citrate
solutions can cause fatal heart rhythm disruptions, seizures and
bleeding due to loss of blood calcium.
</P>
<P>
   TriCitrasol is a 46.7 percent solution of sodium citrate. The
FDA said it is urging hospital pharmacies and dialysis units to use
a 4 percent citrate solution of citrate.
</P>
<P>
   TriCitrasol, is packaged in individual 30 milliliter glass vials
sold individually and in hemodialysis units, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   It is made by Cytosol Laboratories in Braintree, Mass., and
distributed by Medcomp of Harleysville, Pa., which are voluntarily
recalling the product, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 Medcomp kits and trays containing triCitrasol were
distributed nationwide and in Canada and Puerto Rico, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said that because there are other uses for triCitrasol
it is working with the company to see that it remains available.

<HEADLINE> Ford Enhances Stock Program  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE, AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is rewarding its stockholders with
some of the profits of a booming auto industry, offering to pay
them up to $20 in cash or additional stock for each share they own.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also announced Friday that, as expected, that it will spin
off the newly independent Visteon auto parts company to its
shareholders. Both events will take place this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new stock program, Ford plans to exchange its
shareholders' stock at market price, then give them back new shares
valued at $20 less. The shareholders can then choose to take the
$20 difference in cash or in more shares of Ford common stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Dearborn-based company said it would cap the cash portion of
the share program at $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The fairly radical stock move surprised Wall Street. Rating
services Moody's Investors Service and Standard &AMP; Poor's both
lowered their long-term debt ratings on Ford Motor Co. and its Ford
Motor Credit Co. unit, citing worries about how it would affect
Ford's liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the plan was a bold to increase the value of
Ford's stock, which has lagged in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Ford fell $3.06\ to $51.37{ on a tumultuous day of
trading on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $56.
Ford is well off its 52-week high of $67.87{, but has risen
steadily since hitting its 52-week low of $40.25 last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a major step in saying to the investing public 'We
truly believe our stock is undervalued relative to our profits,' ''
said David Sowerby, a portfolio manager with Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co.
in Bloomfield Hills.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 31, Ford had $24 billion in cash or marketable
securities and was carrying $12 billion in debt. Ford officials
said the deal will leave it with plenty of cash to survive any
downturns in the U.S. auto industry or to pay for acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the move will be similar to a stock split,
reducing the per-share price as more shares are issued. But Ford
believes the shares will climb in price.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. said all of the Ford family
members will take their payments in extra shares, and top
executives are expected to do so as well. The company expects 40
percent of the shares to take the additional cash, with 60 percent
taking the extra stock.
</P>
<P>
   ''These pioneering actions will allow us to immediately reward
our shareholders and accelerate our transformation into a leading
consumer-focused company,'' Ford CEO Jac Nasser said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ford had been under pressure to offer some sort of stock buyback
program to reward investors after the company's stock hit the
recent 52-week low. General Motors Corp. has offered such a program
by using the tracking stock of Hughes Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the size of the deal was an impressive bet
that Ford should have a higher market value.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact Ford is willing to distribute $10 billion in cash to
its shareholders -- that's one of the best value enhancement
programs in the industrial world,'' said analyst Scott F. Merlis
with Wasserstein Perella Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's move to make Visteon independent follows General Motors
Corp.'s spin off of its Delphi parts unit last year, creating the
world's largest auto parts company.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that the parts companies will be stronger by
competing for business outside of their parent companies --
something they could not do well unless they're independent. The
automakers benefit by increasing competition -- thereby reducing
costs -- for parts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe independence for Visteon will result in it being a
stronger competitor and is in the best long-term interest of both
Visteon employees and Ford Motor Company shareholders,'' Ford Jr.
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said its shareholders would receive Visteon stock based on
the number of Ford shares they own and the total number of Ford
shares outstanding when the deal is completed. The exact ratio of
Visteon shares per Ford share has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Visteon has about 81,000 employees in 130 countries. It had
revenues of $19.4 billion and earnings of $735 million in 1999,
ranking behind Delphi and ahead of the auto parts division of
Robert Bosch GmbH of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Ford has made several moves toward pushing
Visteon out of the nest. Ford appointed Peter Pestillo, its
longtime head of labor relations, as the parts unit chairman and
CEO last fall. A Visteon separation was the central point in
negotiations with the United Auto Workers last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Under the UAW contract, about 23,500 workers at Visteon will
remain Ford employees for life -- with Ford paychecks and pensions --
when Visteon becomes independent. Those workers also will be free
to transfer back and forth between Ford and Visteon.

<HEADLINE> President of CBOT Steps Down  </HEADLINE>
By HERBERT G. McCANN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A year after beating back an attempt to oust him,
Thomas Donovan resigned Friday as president of the Chicago Board of
Trade after 18 years at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange's board will meet Tuesday to decide who will
replace him on an interim basis, according to an exchange
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   No reason was given for Donovan's resignation, although he has
been under fire in recent months from members who felt he was slow
to move toward electronic trading.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued after the close of trading, Donovan said:
''It has been an honor and a privilege to lead a world-class
institution like the Chicago Board of Trade for nearly 20 years and
to help shape its destiny. ... I leave the CBOT well-positioned to
meet the challenges of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, 62, came to the Board of Trade in 1979 as executive
vice president and took over the top job in August 1982.
</P>
<P>
   During Donovan's tenure, the CBOT has seen its dominant position
challenged by exchanges that do not employ the auction-style,
open-outcry trading method in use here for 152 years.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, which trades futures and options on agricultural
and financial products, lost its title as the world's No. 1 futures
market last year to the all-electronic Eurex in Frankfurt, Germany.
Last month, both the Chicago Board Options Exchange, an offshoot of
the Board of Trade, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange posted
higher volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan was criticized for a deal that will list Board of Trade
products on Eurex's trading system later this year. Critics contend
the Eurex system is not the most technically advanced trading
platform available.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the 27-member board of directors of the Board of
Trade gave Donovan a vote of confidence in his battle with chairman
David P. Brennan, who had mounted an effort to oust him as
president. Brennan had expressed unhappiness with Donovan's
management style, but was more conciliatory Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most recently, Tom has spent tremendous energy and time
preparing the Board of Trade for the restructuring which will
create new opportunities and new alliances for all our members and
our employees throughout the world,'' Brennan said of Donovan's
resignation. ''We wish him Godspeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, CBOT directors approved a plan to divide the
exchange into two for-profit companies, one focused exclusively on
electronic trading of futures contracts. That provoked a dispute
over trading rights with the CBOE, the world's leading options
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The two exchanges have since entered into talks to merge.

<HEADLINE> CBS' 'Early Show' Hits Ratings Low  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The news keeps getting worse for CBS' struggling
''Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after getting a bad first quarter ratings report -- and a
spate of embarrassing publicity to go with it -- the morning news
show sank to its lowest viewership levels yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Early Show'' with Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson had an
average of 2.2 million viewers last week, its smallest audience
since debuting to much fanfare in November.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spent a reported $30 million to build a new studio that
looks out over Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, enticed former ''Today''
show host Gumbel back to morning television, and revamped and
renamed its old morning news show.
</P>
<P>
   Yet viewership for ''The Early Show'' last week was 22 percent
lower than the audience the show it replaced had a year ago,
according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   The three network morning shows all had a smaller audience last
week than during the first three months of the year, since
viewership tends to drop in the spring and summer months. But both
NBC's ''Today'' show and ABC's ''Good Morning America'' are running
ahead of last year's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The frontrunning ''Today'' had 5.9 million viewers last week, a
6 percent increase over 1999, and the surging ''Good Morning
America'' had 4.6 million, up 20 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite published reports that some CBS affiliates are getting
anxious about the poor performance of ''The Early Show,'' a CBS
spokeswoman said Friday the network remained strongly behind it and
no major changes were planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The feeling at CBS News is the broadcast is journalistically
strong,'' spokeswoman Sandra Genelius said. ''Bryant and Jane are
developing a nice chemistry. We knew from the start that this
broadcast would take time to see a significant uptick in the
ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first three months of 2000, ratings for ''The Early
Show'' were 14 percent below its predecessor the year before, and
below what the network promised its advertisers would be delivered.
That means CBS had to give money back to advertisers or compensate
them with free commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel has also been buffeted with bad publicity, particularly
in the New York area, stemming from a nasty divorce case.

whether hog farmers want to continue paying the fees that fund the
''other white meat'' advertising program for pork.

   It will be the first referendum on the pork program since it was
created 14 years ago. Opponents of the $48 million program, which
pays for research as well as advertising, say it has done little to
stimulate pork consumption and mostly benefits meat processors and
large, corporate farms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to have extreme concerns that non-producers will
participate in the vote and effect the future of the program,''
said Craig Jarolimek, president of the National Pork Producers
Council, which opposed holding the referendum.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise Modestly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose modestly Friday as stock
markets reeled and traders looked to park their money in safer
government-backed securities.
</P>
<P>
   But the marginal increase in bond prices suggested investors
remain cautious about Treasurys, which have seen their own
volatility in recent months. Increasingly, bond buyers have been
moving toward top-rated corporate securities and so-called agency
bonds, such as the securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/16, or
$1.87{ per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, fell to 5.78 percent from 5.79 percent late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There were bigger gains in shorter maturities.
</P>
<P>
   The flight to bonds resulted from Wall Street's selling spree as
the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index
both suffered their worst one-day point declines Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks sank as a new government report of a bigger-than-expected
rise in consumer prices added to investor unease. Gains for bonds
were held back in part because of inflation jitters.
</P>
<P>
   Higher inflation could force the Federal Reserve to keep raising
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates and high inflation both reduce the value
of investments that pay a fixed return, such as bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds initially fell on the Labor Department report that
consumer prices shot up 0.7 percent last month, the biggest spike
in close to a year. Even more alarming to traders was a 0.4 percent
increase in the core rate of inflation, the biggest leap in five
years for the inflation measure that excludes volatile energy and
food prices.
</P>
<P>
   But bonds rebounded as the selloff in stocks accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader bond market, short-term notes were up 7/32 point,
while intermediate notes rose ] to 13/32 point, reported Bridge
Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.76 percent as the
discount fell 0.03 percentage point from Thursday to 5.61 percent.
Six-month yields were 5.96 percent, and the discount fell 0.09
percentage point to 5.72 percent. One-year yields were 6.02 percent
as the discount fell 0.08 percentage point to 5.72 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, rose to 6.12{ percent from 6.00 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 1/32 at 95 11/16. The average yield to
maturity was 5.93 percent, up from 5.92 percent on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Health Affected by Embargo  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba has overcome a costly U.S. trade embargo to
provide its citizens one of the world's best health systems,
dispatch medical teams to impoverished nations and train thousands
of Third World doctors, Cuba's public health minister said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing themes of Third World poverty and health that
dominated the Group of 77 summit in Havana this week, Carlos Dotres
said Cuba would do more despite the embargo's constraints, which he
said have cost Cuba's health sector more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult for us'' to provide free health care to
Cuba's 11 million people and to train foreign doctors and health
professionals, also at no cost, Dotres said.
</P>
<P>
   American trade sanctions against Cuba took effect in 1962, one
year after the United States cut diplomatic relations with the
island nation.
</P>
<P>
   Rules limiting U.S. medical exports to Cuba were eased last
year. There have been several proposals to fully lift restrictions
on food and medical sales, but they have failed to gain full
congressional approval. The first American trade show in communist
Cuba in four decades was held in January.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government says it licensed $19 million worth of
American medical sales to Cuba in 1998 and $26 million worth in the
first half of 1999. It also says more private donations of medicine
and humanitarian aid come from the United States than any other
country, totaling $472 million in fiscal year 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Dotres acknowledged the limited sales -- but maintained that,
because the embargo blocks Cuba's access to credits and bank
transactions, ''the financial dynamics don't exist'' to expand
trade and support Cuba's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that hurts tourism, sugar sales, impacts funds for
medicines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dotres noted that 10,000 people graduate from Cuban health
schools each year, Cubans' life expectancy of 75 years is one of
the world's highest and Cuba's infant mortality rate is 6 per 1,000
births, compared to 7 in the United States and 32 in Latin America
and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   At the Group of 77 summit, Cuba called for joint production of
medicines among lesser-developed nations, Dotres said.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, he added, Cuba would introduce an ''important
group of medicines'' to combat AIDS, while research on an AIDS
vaccine could produce results within several years.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,500 Cuban doctors are working abroad, from Gambia to
Haiti, Dotres said. They've responded to numerous natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   To allow underdeveloped countries to sustain their own health
networks, Cuba is hosting 5,000 foreign students at its medical
schools, Dotres said.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage company operators admit falsifying papers  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Two former partners in mortgage companies
admitted in court Friday that they falsified papers in real estate
transactions worth up to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgages were granted by Walsh Securities Inc., a company
linked to a statewide ''land flip'' scam involving hundreds of
rundown, overvalued properties.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Hyman and Anthony Vispisiano told U.S. District Judge
Alfred M. Wolin that a Walsh principal, Betty Ann Demola, was aware
they prepared false documents in mortgage applications for loans
granted by Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Demola is the sister of Walsh president Robert C. Walsh and vice
president James Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   A former Walsh Securities employee who pleaded guilty last year
also implicated the Walshes and their sister in wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh Securities, of Parsippany, has maintained it was cheated
in the deals, and has sued 18 businesses and individuals, including
some of the five real estate appraisers who have pleaded guilty in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is on hold while the criminal cases are pending.
Company attorney Michael Chertoff said Friday the company looks
forward to getting its day in court, and said it finds
''regrettable'' the ''dribbling out'' of pleas.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman, 41, of Manalapan, and Vispisiano, 38, who had lived in
Millstone and now lives in Estill, S.C., have agreed to cooperate
with the continuing federal investigation, in which 11 people have
now pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Each pleaded guilty to a single conspiracy charge.
</P>
<P>
   Vispisiano, who prosecutors currently believe was responsible
for $5 million to $10 million in losses, faces about three years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman, responsible for $2.5 million to $5 million in losses,
faces about 2{ years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing was scheduled for July 10, but is likely to be
postponed as the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-90s, they operated several Springfield-based
companies, including Target Mortgage Inc., a mortgage banking
company, and Heygo Inc., which bought and sold residential
property. Vispisiano also headed BAM Investments Inc. and Deerfield
Properties Inc., real estate companies in Millstone.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, they made downpayments for buyers who could not
afford to make the outlay, but made it appear that the money was
from the actual buyers, they admitted. After closing, the money was
returned to them by lawyers for buyers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Their transactions involved about 100 properties in Essex and
Union counties that sold for $50,000 to $100,000, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other properties involved in flip schemes were in Asbury Park,
Belmar, Long Branch and Neptune, all in Monmouth County; as well as
Paterson, Piscataway and Plainfield, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the schemes involved prearranged sales in which homes
were purchased at a low price and resold quickly at an inflated
price. The higher price was used to obtain a loan, which was used
to buy the property as well as for other purposes, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have pleaded guilty is Gary Grieser, president
of Capital Assets Property &AMP; Investment Co. in Red Bank, one of
several companies linked to suspicious land deals.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have declined to estimate how much money was lost
through the deals, but apparently think that one of the main
victims was Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. of Greenwich, Conn.,
which provided funds to Walsh Securities.

<HEADLINE> Bush Breaks $80 Million Mark  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush has broken the $80 million mark
in his Republican presidential campaign, adding to his own
fund-raising record while replenishing his war chest after an
expensive primary effort.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign raised around $7 million between March 1 and April
6, spokesman Scott McClellan said Friday, three-quarters of the
goal of $10 million by the end of April. Bush's total for the
campaign is now more than $81 million.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign expects to raise an additional $550,000 next week
with events in North Carolina and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   It also has stepped up its online fund raising, sending
solicitations via e-mail. Through March 31, the campaign had raised
$1.6 million online.
</P>
<P>
   Even after reaching the $10 million goal, Bush campaign
officials said they would continue to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made it plain from the beginning that we will raise the
resources to promote the governor's agenda,'' spokesman Ari
Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy primary spending to defeat Arizona Sen. John McCain had
depleted the Texas governor's $70 million. The campaign spent a
record $63.3 million through Feb. 29, leaving Bush with about $7.5
million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Al
Gore, had around $10 million to spend as of the end of February.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore are next scheduled to report their
fund-raising figures to the Federal Election Commission on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not accepting taxpayer funds for his campaign and
therefore can spend as much as he can raise.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is receiving federal funds, so he can spend no more than
$40.5 million, plus legal and accounting expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates will accept federal funding for the general
election, meaning they cannot raise additional money for their
campaigns after this summer's nominating conventions. Bush and Gore
will collect $67.6 million each in federal money after becoming
their parties' standardbearers.

<HEADLINE> Dow Tumbles 617; Nasdaq Sinks 355  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation watched agape Friday as the stock
market suffered a history-making collapse that shook professional
and armchair investors alike.
</P>
<P>
   Already weary from days of heavy selling, investors panicked
after the government released a surprisingly bad inflation report.
As prices tumbled, many who bought stocks with borrowed money were
forced to sell to repay loans, accelerating the downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 617.78 points, or 5.6
percent to 10,305.77 -- by far its biggest one-day point drop ever.
At its lowest point, the Dow was off 722 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, home to the technology stocks whose
popularity has evaporated, dropped 355.49, or almost 10 percent, to
3,321.29.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a semi-panic, almost a full cascading deterioration,''
said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist for State Street Global
Advisors. ''The real question have we reached the nadir of
emotion?''
</P>
<P>
   David Hummel, a 23-year-old computer engineer, has seen the
$12,000 tax refund he invested three weeks ago cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bears aren't just growling, they're roaming the streets.
I'm just glad I don't have a wife I have to explain this to,'' said
Hummel as he stared at the flashing stock quotes of the Nasdaq
Marketsite in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the worst weeks in U.S. market history.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq fell a record 1,125.16 points, or 25.3 percent, also
a record. The Dow shed 805.71 points. The 7.3 percent drop was the
fifth biggest since the start of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   New York Stock Exchange composite volume totaled 1.57 billion
shares, heavy but not a record.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff decimated several sectors, including computer
software and semiconductors, brokerage companies, banks and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crazy, just crazy,'' said one trader, smoking outside the New
York Stock Exchange who wouldn't give his name.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger for the collapse was pulled in Washington, where the
Labor Department said consumer prices surged more than expected in
March, reflecting higher costs for everything from gasoline to
housing.
</P>
<P>
   The figures rekindled worries that the Federal Reserve not only
would raise interest rates again, but might be more aggressive in
trying to cool down the economy in order to remove the threat of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates five times since June, each time by a
quarter-point in borrowing charges. Now, many investors fear a
half-point increase as early as May.
</P>
<P>
   Even that may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk is the U.S. economy does not slow enough and the Fed
has to raise rates in the second half of the year, in spite of the
election. That is not priced into the market,'' said Nick Sargen,
an investment strategist for J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates raise corporate costs and hurt profits.
Banks are particularly vulnerable as borrowing declines. On Friday,
Chase Manhattan's shares slid 5| to 78~, and FleetBoston fell 3\ to
34.
</P>
<P>
   The market volatility also has caused several companies to
postpone stock offerings and mergers and acquisitions. And that is
hurting investment banks and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers dove 17] to 75{ while Charles Schwab fell 8} to
39{,
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, a measure of the broader stock
market, fell 85.78 points, or 6 percent, to 1,354.73.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000, which charts small companies, also racked up
its largest one-day point loss in history, blowing by the
28.15-point loss of Aug. 31, 1998. On a percentage basis, the
Russell 2000's decline was its fifth sharpest ever.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few bright spots. WHX Corp. rose 2\ to 25\. And AO
Smith, an autoparts supplier, rose 1 9/16 to 20 11/16 on a robust
earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   And some investors, inured to the market's whacky gyrations,
seem unfazed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a long-term investor. I don't sell when it goes down. I
hold,'' said Eric Li, IT systems analyst, New Haven, Conn. ''I
mean, you have to sit there through the volatility. As a long-term
(investor) you sit through the highs and the lows.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the question on the minds of many professional and
armchair investors was what will happen on Monday?
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find any consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next week could be extremely rough,'' said Gary Kaltbaum,
chief technical analyst at J.W. Genesis Securities in Boca Raton,
Fla. ''I'd like to believe that we've now had the panic selloff
that will allow the market to move higher. But every support that
we crashed through this week could become resistance going up.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the markets closed off their lows of the day,
which could be a positive sign for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP;
Sons, was among the hopeful
</P>
<P>
   ''Corrections are designed to work off excesses and create
opportunities,'' he said. ''I've been telling people to get their
wish list together. It's the best time to buy stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Take your pick.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With 5 Strangulations  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr., Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A former sailor fought back tears Friday during
his arraignment on charges he strangled five prostitutes as police
worldwide tried to match his account of at least 11 other slayings
to information they have about unsolved murders in their cities.
</P>
<P>
   John Eric Armstrong, 26, of Dearborn Heights, was arraigned on
five counts of premeditated first-degree murder and three counts of
assault with intent to murder. Innocent pleas were entered on his
behalf, and he was ordered held without bond.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters how he felt, Armstrong whispered: ''So bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Armstrong is suspected in at least 11 other slayings
since 1992: three in the Seattle area, including a lone male
victim, two in Hawaii, two in Hong Kong and one each in North
Carolina, Virginia, Thailand and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who from 1993 to 1999 was a Navy refueler aboard the
USS Nimitz, may have killed while the ship was in port around the
world, police said. He could also be linked to the deaths of
several prostitutes in Japan, Korea and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once he began to talk, he was freely giving very intimate
details about the case,'' said Detective James Hines of Wayne
County Sheriff's Office. ''His demeanor was shifting quite often
from being calm to irritable to sometimes sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Armstrong told them he killed because he hated
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators warned that Armstrong, a husband and father,
may be exaggerating. Though police say they have physical evidence
linking him to the deaths of five Detroit-area prostitutes,
agencies elsewhere said they have been unable to tie him to any
unsolved slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are gaps in his timeline that we are concerned about,''
police Cmdr. Dennis Richardson told the Detroit Free Press.
''However, nothing outside of Michigan has been confirmed yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Sgt. Arlie Lovier, who has been interviewing Armstrong
since Wednesday, said officials haven't ruled out any leads that
Armstrong has given them. He said Detroit police have been
contacted by law enforcement agencies all over the world, and
investigators from different agencies have converged on Detroit to
work the case.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service arrived
in Detroit on Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Don Johnson said Armstrong agreed to talk to
investigators -- without a lawyer -- since his arrest. ''It's been
bothering him for a very long time,'' he said. ''When we first
started interviewing him, he said he just wanted help.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a prostitute told police she had been assaulted and
gave a description of the suspect and his vehicle. On Monday,
investigators found the bodies of three strangled prostitutes in a
railroad yard.
</P>
<P>
   The first body had been placed in the area four weeks ago, the
second three weeks ago and the third on Monday, police Chief Benny
Napoleon said.
</P>
<P>
   After the bodies were found, two other prostitutes went to
police and said they had been attacked. They identified Armstrong
as the attacker, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The body of a fifth prostitute linked to Armstrong was found
last year, Napoleon said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong moved eight months ago to Dearborn Heights and has
worked for the past month at Detroit Metropolitan Airport as an
aircraft refueler.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Gets Sarcastic  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Every so often Friday, such as when the day's
loss by the Dow Jones industrial average reached 700 points for the
first time in history, a hint of sarcasm surfaced on the floor of
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from the normal bustle of traders rushing about, it
was striking how calm and peaceful a stock market could be during a
record-setting plunge like Friday's.
</P>
<P>
   Since steep declines typically mean more work for those working
the floor, the relative hush that settled over the NYSE wasn't so
surprising. There's little time to fret or gab, or do much of
anything other than trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crazy, just crazy,'' said one trader, shaking his head as he
rushed back into the exchange from a cigarette break less than an
hour before the closing bell on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, as the Dow's loss crossed the 700 point level, a
smattering of sarcastic applause rose from the muffled chaos of the
trading floor. Then, as the Dow began rebounding in the final
minutes, a few mockingly chanted ''Rally!''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to work. In fact, it seemed like the market
stayed open for an extra 15 minutes as the frazzled traders
continued to scurry around, processing the closing crush of orders.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust finally settled, the Dow was off 617.78 points at
10,305.77, easily eclipsing the previous biggest one-day point drop
of 554.26, set back on Oct. 27, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index also rewrote the record books, but
only by a narrow margin over the record point drop of 349.15 set
just last week on April 4. At the close on Friday, the
technology-driven measure was down 355.49 points at 3,321.29.

<HEADLINE> Fifteenth annual beach cleaning has dual purpose  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARGATE, N.J. (AP) -- Trash bags in hand, a small army of
volunteers will hit the beaches of the Jersey shore this weekend to
collect cigarette butts, plastic bottles, candy wrappers and all
manner of other trash in what organizers call the biggest
environmental event in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cleaning the beaches, participants in Clean Ocean
Action's annual beach sweeps, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday
from Keyport to Cape May, will catalog what's collected in hopes of
identifying pollution trends.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unusual items picked up last year: 39 batteries, 28
flower pots, 392 spent shotgun shells, seven propane tanks, 19 baby
pacifiers and a car windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 3,000 people are expected to turn out at 46 locations for
the 15th annual event, according to Cindy Zipf, executive director
of Clean Ocean Action.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are really concerned about the state of the ocean these
days, between the dumping of dredge spoils and plans to sand mine.
This is one way they can help,'' said Zipf.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's two ways.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers are asked to show up at 9 a.m. at staging points
wearing gloves, hard-soled shoes, warm clothes and sunscreen. Once
there, individual ''beach captains'' will give them trash bags and
data cards.
</P>
<P>
   The bags are for the trash; the cards are for keeping track of
what's collected, be it run-of-the-mill or extraordinary. Clean
Ocean Action officials say the cataloging helps environmental
groups track pollution trends and use the information to lobby for
stricter enforcement of environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   Information from the data cards is collected and sent to the
Center for Marine Conservation in Washington, D.C., which uses it
in a national report on pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of it being a one-day event, it becomes a long-term
help to the environment,'' Zipf said.
</P>
<P>
   Municipalities have arranged for trucks to take the trash and
recyclable plastics, glass and cans to recycling centers and
landfills, Zipf said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People really seem to enjoy it,'' said marine biologist Tony
Totah, Clean Ocean Action's education coordinator. ''It's like an
Easter egg hunt only it's the environment and the beach you're
looking out for. Kids, especially, get into it.''

<HEADLINE> Norway Upholds Euthanasia Conviction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The supreme court on Friday upheld the
murder conviction of the first Norwegian doctor ever tried for a
mercy killing in a key test of the nation's euthanasia laws.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Sandsdalen, a retired 82-year-old physician, gave a
lethal dose of morphine to multiple sclerosis victim Bodil
Bjerkmann, 45, at her request in June 1996. He then demanded that
he be tried for murder to test the laws.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted of first-degree murder in a court battle that
went through a series of appeals before reaching the supreme court.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member high court also upheld the lower court's
decision to indefinitely postpone Sandsdalen's sentencing, which
means the elderly doctor will probably never be punished due to
mitigating circumstances. First-degree murder carries a maximum 21
year jail term in Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in a unanimous ruling, said the most important thing
was to confirm that euthanasia remains illegal in Norway, no matter
how good the intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Previous courts had also noted that Sandsdalen believed he was
doing the right thing because the woman was dying and in terrible
pain. However, the courts said Sandsdalen, who retired from active
practice in 1985, should have done more to find an alternative,
such as prescribing stronger pain killers.
</P>
<P>
   After Sandsdalen administered the lethal dose, he wrote to
public prosecutor admitting the killing and demanding that he be
tried to test.

<P>
   MIDDLESBROUGH, England (AP) -- A man who was cleared of murdering
a woman more than a decade ago but later confessed to the killing
was convicted of perjury Friday and sentenced to six years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   William Dunlop, 36, had always denied killing Julie Hogg in a
frenzied sexual attack at her Billingham home in 1989. The jury in
his first trial failed to reach a verdict, and a formal verdict of

a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Police and Hogg's family always believed Dunlop was guilty, but
he could never again be tried for her death.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, while serving a seven-year sentence for a
serious assault on another woman, Dunlop told a prison officer he
had killed Hogg.
</P>
<P>
   He then was charged with two counts of perjury for giving false
evidence under oath at his two trials.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Times Staff Welcomes Changes  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Orlando Sentinel Publisher John Puerner will
take over as publisher of the Los Angeles Times and John Carroll of
The (Baltimore) Sun will be editor in a shakeup a month after the
Tribune Co. agreed to buy Times Mirror Co, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were welcomed by the Times staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could use some stability and some strong leadership,'' said
Henry Weinstein, a senior reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Chandler, a former Times publisher and member of the family
that has run the paper for more than a century, welcomed what he
called ''a clean sweep.'' He said the new leadership would ''start
to move the Times back into the kind of paper it was until recent
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as word of the executive sweep leaked out, a new
controversy erupted over an advertising campaign that includes
pictures of bikini-clad blondes juxtaposed with Muslim women in
long chadors. More than 200 reporters and editors signed a petition
denouncing the ads, and a Muslim group sent a letter of protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Times reported Friday that Puerner will replace Kathryn M.
Downing and that Carroll will replace Michael Parks. The report
cited anonymous sources within the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Times Mirror and the Tribune Co. said they could
not comment on any planned management changes until the sale is
complete. The deadline for Times Mirror shareholders to respond to
a Tribune tender offer is midnight Monday. The sale is expected to
become final sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The changes come during a period of turmoil at the paper. In
December, the Times apologized to readers for not disclosing an
agreement to share profits of a special edition of its Sunday
magazine with the Staples Center, which was the subject of the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The paper has also been criticized for breaking down the walls
that have traditionally shielded journalists from interference by
the business side of the paper. That policy was championed by Times
Mirror CEO Mark Willes, who began his tenure at the company in 1995
by slashing jobs and closing Times Mirror papers. Willes has said
he will resign once the sale is complete.
</P>
<P>
   The paper responded to criticism over the ad campaign by
scheduling a meeting between angry staffers and representatives of
the marketing department, said Weinstein, who circulated the
petition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is the ad supposed to mean the blondes are 'us' and the Muslim
women are 'them?''' the petition asks. ''This campaign risks
alienating more readers and embroiling the Times in another
controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   The television, radio and billboard campaign, called
''Connecting Us to the Times,'' uses images of Southern California
next to images from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Council on American-Islamic Relations Southern California
demanded the ads be changed or canceled. ''This is deeply offensive
to the 600,000 Muslims in Southern California and to the millions
of Californians who value the diverse nature of their society,''
the group said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has been editor of The Sun since 1991. In 1998, the
National Press Foundation named him Editor of the Year, citing his
leadership in building The Sun, a Times Mirror newspaper, into a
''regional force.'' The Sun won Pulitzer Prizes for feature writing
in 1997 and investigative reporting in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Puerner, 49, has helped lead Tribune company into new media
advances. He was named publisher at The Orlando Sentinel in 1993
after serving as vice president of marketing and development for
the Chicago Tribune Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clearly important for the Times to take a deep breath, to
have a chance to sort of start over,'' said Roy Peter Clark, a
senior scholar at the Poynter Institute, a leading journalism
research and training organization. ''I think John Carroll is the
kind of person who will make this next transition very easy.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Urges Ban on Guns in Churches  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Al Gore called for a ban on guns in
churches and other places of worship Friday, taking a poke at
Republican presidential rival George W. Bush's Texas version of the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should ban guns from our churches and school events --
something that is shamefully legal in George Bush's Texas and in 20
other states,'' Gore told a group of young people. ''Our children
can't reach for their dreams if they're ducking for cover.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was expanding his proposals on gun control, a
hot election-year issue in the nation's largest state, at the start
of a weekend trip that was also serving as an aggressive
fund-raising swing.
</P>
<P>
   In all, he planned to raise well over $5 million for his
campaign and for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech here late Friday, Gore announced support for federal
legislation banning firearms in churches, synagogues and mosques,
as well as where school events are held.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time to take further steps to deal with the flood of
cheap available handguns ... and get these guns out of the hands of
people who shouldn't have them,'' Gore said at a fund-raiser
earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, noted that Bush signed
a law in 1995 that allows Texans to carry concealed weapons with a
permit.
</P>
<P>
   While that law banned guns from churches and synagogues, in 1997
Bush signed another law that said houses of worship would have to
post signs or hand out cards alerting visitors if the gun rule was
to be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a law that I would gladly overturn as president with a
new national law banning guns in all houses of worship,'' Gore said
at a community center here. The 300 young people gathered in a
gymnasium applauded, as did a minister standing next to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, who stood next to Gore, signed into law last
year measures that gave California the strictest regulations in the
nation on assault weapons and cheap ''Saturday Night Special''
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look at what Texas has done on gun legislation and you
look at what California has done on gun legislation and I can tell
you vice president is siding with California in this debate,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is viewed as an attractive running mate by some Gore
aides. The two met for about 20 minutes before the community center
event and discussed the campaign, but not the running mate
question, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore contended that Bush is beholden to the National Rifle
Association, pointing to a law Bush signed that prohibits Texas
cities and counties from suing gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has passed virtually everything that the NRA has asked him
to pass,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Gore added that he has always believed in the
right of hunters to carry weapons. ''But America cannot afford
another Columbine, or another Paducah, or another Jonesboro,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been two church shootings in Texas in recent months.
Last month, a man opened fire in a Pasadena church, wounding an
18-year-old woman he was courting, her mother and two others before
shooting himself to death. Last September, a man fatally shot seven
people in a Fort Worth church before killing himself in a pew.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp noted that Tennessee had passed a law in 1994
allowing citizens to carry guns, including into churches.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why didn't he speak out when a concealed-carry law was passed
in his home state of Tennessee, where residents can also carry guns
in churches?'' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports a number of gun control measures including
mandatory child safety locks, required background checks for
purchases at gun shows and a ban on ''junk guns'' and assault
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he would support background checks at gun shows,
but only if they were instant. He also has said that a federal law
requiring child-safety locks would be impractical but he would sign
it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was raising $100,000 for his campaign in San Jose, and
helping the DNC take in $2.5 million. Saturday night, he and
President Clinton plan a fund-raiser for the party that is expected
to raise $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   At the San Jose fund-raiser, Gore noted his support for a ban on
so-called soft money -- the very sort of unlimited contributions he
was aggressively raising Friday and Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Officials pin development dreams on light rail  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYONNE, N.J. (AP) -- This city hasn't had a train come through
in nearly 30 years. The one that's coming on Saturday cost $1.1
billion and carries dreams of towering office buildings, new jobs,
short commutes and no traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Bergen Light Rail Line, the costliest public transit
project in state history, begins service on 12 stations from
Bayonne to Jersey City in the first leg of what officials hope will
eventually go to Ridgefield in Bergen County and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say plans for the project have already raised
property values and brought 300 jobs to Bayonne and caused the
purchase of 4 million square feet of new office space in Jersey
City. They predict that once completed, the 20.5-mile line of
high-speed trolleys will make the most congested county in the
state more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be the best example of a public transit
investment spurring economic development that we've seen in the
United States,'' said Martin Robins, director of the Transportation
Policy Institute at Rutgers University and a former director of the
light rail project.
</P>
<P>
   NJ Transit expects 7,200 riders on the first weekday of service
on the 7.5-mile line connecting 34th Street in Bayonne to Exchange
Place in Jersey City, and 9,200 by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the agency says more than 100,000 people will park
and ride along the Hudson County waterfront and through Bergen
County cities like Saddle River and Hackensack.
</P>
<P>
   Trains will run every 7 1/2 minutes during peak hours and every
15 minutes or so off-peak. Passengers will buy validated, $1.50
one-way tickets on station platforms that will be checked by random
inspections. Passengers can also purchase $53 monthly passes that
pay for free bus transfers.
</P>
<P>
   NJ Transit Executive Director Jeffrey Warsh said the system will
cost $15 million a year to operate and is not expected to turn a
profit for the agency until 2010. But the system ''has already more
than paid for itself in terms of tax ratables, new jobs,'' Warsh
said.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the funding for the project comes from federal
grants secured primarily by U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The agency chose to build the high-speed trolleys because they
are better designed to travel along urban corridors, accelerate and
brake quicker than commuter rails, Warsh said. The trains are also
more flexible because they are easily able to stop at new stations
if they are created, Warsh said.
</P>
<P>
   For Bayonne, which last had a train station in the early 1970s,
the two stops should help connect the isolated peninsula it sits on
to fast-growing cities like Jersey City and Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to make Bayonne part of the mainline development,''
said Mayor Joe Doria.
</P>
<P>
   A paper business and a kosher food company have recently decided
to relocate here, bringing between 150 and 200 employees apiece,
Doria said. Property values are up 20 percent and fewer than 100
homes are for sale in the community of 61,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While crews painted poles and crosswalks at Bayonne's new
station Friday, residents seemed underwhelmed. Casimir Patufka, 80,
said he didn't think the trains would attract any incoming
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing here,'' Patufka said. ''All the industry has
gone out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Jursza, 88, said her niece would be able to take a train
to Jersey City in 23 minutes instead of driving, which can take
twice that time in rush hour traffic. Jursza didn't know when she
might want to get on a train, though.
</P>
<P>
   ''I imagine I might go into New York,'' she said, shrugging.

Judge OKs Chemical Arms Destruction   
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGON (AP) -- A federal judge has cleared the way for
continued destruction of chemical weapons at a government
incinerator in Utah, concluding there is no risk to human health or
the environment, the Justice Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of the weapons, including nerve gas, has been
the focus of controversy for years with critics charging lax safety
procedures at the U.S. Army's Tooele chemical weapons disposal
facility. They also argued that the burning releases harmful levels
of toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell, in a ruling issued in
Salt Lake City, said that the incineration of the weapons and
chemical agents at the Tooele facility presents no imminent or
substantial danger to human health or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The government under a 1985 law must destroy more nearly 4
million munitions and bulk containers holding 30,000 tons of deadly
chemical agents -- including nerve gas, mustard gas and VX gas --
once part of the military arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   So far it has burned about 20 percent of the material in the
special incinerators at Tooele and on the Johnston Island in the
Pacific. In all, eight incinerators, including the Tooele facility,
are to be used for the weapons destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's decision ''assures that the Army can complete the
destruction of these dangerous weapons in an environmentally safe
manner,'' said Lois J. Schiffer, assistant attorney general for
environment and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups, including the Chemical Weapons Working Group and
the Sierra Club, had filed a lawsuit asking the court to stop the
Army from operating the Tooele incinerator, arguing the facility
did not meet safety requirements and violated a number of
environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell rejected the claim and said the citizen and
environmental groups did not prove that any violations had occurred
or were likely to occur at the Tooele facility near Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The plants at Tooele and Johnston Island have been the only
incinerators in operation under the Army program. The pilot project
on Johnston Island recently was concluded after more than 1,800
tons of chemical agent and about 380,000 tons of munitions and
containers were destroyed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Guatemala OKs U.S. Anti-Drug Plans  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Lawmakers have voted to allow the U.S.
Army to send about 40 soldiers with military hardware to join
Guatemalan narcotics agents.
</P>
<P>
   After three hours of heated debate, senators from both of
Guatemala's leading parties backed a measure late Thursday night
that had been pushed by Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo and
U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the soldiers, who will serve as advisers and
provide logistical support, the United States will offer three
helicopters and one naval vessel. No date has been set for the aid
to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   According to the measure, all U.S. personnel are required to be
accompanied at all times by Guatemalan soldiers or police.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed overwhelmingly despite the objections of
many Guatemalans who criticized it as an affront to the country's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal lawmakers who opposed the measure recalled a
CIA-supported coup which deposed democratically elected socialist
President Jacobo Arbenz in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Americans asked permission to 'aid' Guatemalan soldiers
then too,'' said Sen. Ricardo Rosales.
</P>
<P>
   But Portillo and other officials have complained of Guatemala's
growing reputation as a transfer point for Colombian and Peruvian
cocaine heading to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something that is in the interest of Guatemala and the
U.S.,'' Frank Neville, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in
Guatemala City, said Friday. ''Drug trafficking is certainly a
shared regional danger and it is always best to approach these
things together.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hits GOP on Education, Tax  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton accused Republicans on Friday
of shortchanging schools to pay for huge tax cuts and said
Americans should look at the GOP's budget and ask, ''How does all
this add up?''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's wrong to spend about $100 of the surplus on tax
cuts for every $1 you spend on education,'' Clinton told reporters,
university spokesmen and others at a gathering of the Education
Writers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The president's remarks sharpened his election-year fight with
Republicans over budget priorities and the nation's fast-growing
surplus. The House and Senate approved a $1.83 trillion package
Thursday that that includes big tax cuts as well as reductions in
many domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew to Atlanta on the first leg of a six-day trip that
is also taking him to California, New Mexico, Illinois, back to
Washington and out again to Oklahoma City. He appeared weary at the
outset, leaning on his lectern with both arms and holding his face
in his hand as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Before a late flight to Palo Alto, Calif., Clinton also was the
speaker at two political fund-raisers for Georgia Democrats, a
$300,000 bash for Rep. Cynthia McKinney and a $500,000 tribute to
Rep. John Lewis, who was jailed and wounded during the civil rights
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ''John Lewis' life represents the central lesson I think we all
have to learn in life,'' Clinton said. ''We find more meaning in
compassion than in judgment and we find more meaning in unity than
division.''
</P>
<P>
   The president covered a lot of ground, from calling rocker Tina
Turner his favorite philosopher to lamenting about the lingering
controversy in the South over flying the Confederate flag. He
blamed his own visit to South Asia for the massacre of 35 Sikhs in
the Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure they were murdered because I was there,'' the
president said. ''Those people lost their lives because I went to
India and to Pakistan. And people who don't want their turmoil to
be eased used my trip there as a pretext to highlight the
difficulties'' in the struggle between India and Pakistan over
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session after his education speech,
Clinton said states should not prohibit gay youth groups in high
schools. ''I think it ought to be decided by the school
districts,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton criticized Republicans for clinging to
the concept of school vouchers, which he called a ''sideshow,'' and
for passing budget bills he said ''greatly underfund education.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, House Education Committee Chairman Bill Goodling,
R-Pa., said Clinton was beholden to teachers' unions and had
adopted a ''Washington knows best'' approach to education.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that Clinton may be preparing for his next career as
school board president by running education policy as though he
heads a national school board,'' Goodling said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said GOP programs sound appealing but can't be paid for
because Republicans want to earmark the money for tax cuts and
defense spending increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''When anybody says anything -- they're for this, that or another
thing -- you have to say, 'Well, how does all this add up?'''
Clinton said, adding later: ''Arithmetic is a very important
element in politics and public life, and it is often ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe the majority of the people in the other party in
Congress are still resisting the investments our schools need,''
Clinton said. ''In the name of accountability, they're still
pushing vouchers and block grants that I believe would undermine
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers, long popular with Republicans, offer poor families a
chunk of money that represents part of the cost of educating a
child in public schools. The family can use the money to send a
child to private or parochial school instead if the parents think
their public school is not performing.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a Bush campaign spokesman, responded to Clinton's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''As governor, George W. Bush cut taxes and invested in
education while test scores in Texas went up. As president, Bill
Clinton raised taxes while reading scores across the nation
stagnated.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton boasted of progress. A new administration report
said 67 percent of high school graduates now go to college, up 10
percent from when he took office in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Outline Views  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, nearing
the end of another round of talks, have exchanged documents
outlining their views on a Palestinian state, the future of
Jerusalem and other tough problems.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said although these
could become the ''core elements'' of an overall settlement, he did
not want to overstate the significance of the step.
</P>
<P>
   While traveling in Atlanta on Friday, Clinton called Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to update him on a nearly four-hour discussion
the president had earlier this week with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak. Arafat is scheduled to meet with Clinton in Washington
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They spoke for about 10 minutes,'' said P.J. Crowley, a
national security spokesman for the White House. ''It is kind of
standard practice. When the president has a meeting with one, he
will give a perspective about where that one side is to help the
other side better prepare for the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks, in a second round at Bolling Air Force Base in
southeast Washington, are to wind up this weekend. In about two
weeks, the two sides will resume work at a site in the Middle East
on an accord and another Israeli withdrawal on the West Bank, Rubin
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are demanding a state on the West Bank and in
Gaza, with part of Jerusalem as its capital. Rubin gave no
indication whether headway was made on these twin goals, or on
other knotty issues such as water supplies and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Hasan Abdel Rahman, the PLO's representative in Washington,
agreed with Rubin that ''this should not be overstated.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Rahman said, ''It is an exchange of informal
papers. We presented the Israelis with our understandings, and they
presented us with theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahman added: ''There is no progress on substance. There is a
wide gap between the two sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Embassy spokesman, Mark Regev, said there had been
no expectation the current round of talks would produce historic
breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are hoping for an energized process with the Palestinians,
and it can move if both sides show a seriousness and a level of
conciliation and a willingness to compromise,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Disturbed by Elian Video  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Disturbed by a new video of 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez saying he doesn't want to return to the communist island,
an increasingly frustrated Cuban government wondered Friday how
long the agonizing saga would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why doesn't this sad show end?'' asked the international
weekly edition of the Communist Party's newspaper Granma.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one understands it,'' the article said. ''Least of all his
father, who after five months has not seen his son, except on the
news and questionable videos,'' it continued, referring to a home
video of Elian saying that he doesn't want to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That video, evidently made after Elian's Miami relatives met
with Attorney General Janet Reno Wednesday night and obtained by
the Spanish-language network Univision, disturbed communist
officials and Cuban citizens in general.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Cubans do not have access to foreign news
reports and most did not see it until it was shown Thursday night
on Cuba's state television.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, speaking in Spanish on the video, addressed his father,
saying: ''I don't want to go to Cuba. ... I want to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   The video prompted Gregory Craig, the American attorney for
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to call on the news media on
Thursday to stay away from the boy because he ''has been exploited
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The video ''was frightening,'' said Vilma Espin, president of
Federation of Cuban Women and the wife of Raul Castro, who is the
Cuban president's brother and chief of Cuban Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are trying to destroy that child,'' Espin said in a brief
interview with Associated Press Television News.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States does not have ''the force to make the Miami
mafia let go of the boy ... that is scary,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Granma International article said it was clear from the clip
that Elian was being coached. It said the boy was ''incoherent and
looking off to the side, seeming to receive orders from someone
behind the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was clearly shown that Elian was criminally pressured to
say these things without meaning them,'' commented Juventud
Rebelde, the daily of the Union of Young Communists, which called
the video ''abominable.''
</P>
<P>
   For 4{ months, Fidel Castro and his government have backed
Gonzalez in his battle to get his son, who was rescued off the
coast of Florida in late November. Elian's mother and 10 others
died when their boat sank during the illegal crossing from Cuba to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States gave temporary custody of Elian to the boy's
relatives in Miami, who are fighting to keep him in the United
States. Attorney General Janet Reno revoked the temporary custody
on Thursday, after the relatives defied her orders to turn him over
so he could be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez said Wednesday night that
U.S. authorities will have to use force to take Elian from his
house in Miami's Little Havana, which on Friday was ringed by
people who support efforts to keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There was astonishment in Havana at Reno's patience with the
Miami relatives, who are commonly referred to here as Elian's
''kidnappers.'' The government questioned why a cabinet-level
official would fly from Washington to Miami to meet with the
relatives only to have them defy her orders afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who, in any country, can publicly make fun of the law and then
be treated with the patience and respect deserving of a
gentleman?'' Granma International wondered, referring to Reno's
treatment of Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle caring for Elian in
Miami.

<HEADLINE> Woman Who Faked Cancer Avoids Jail  </HEADLINE>
By BECKY BOHRER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Two years ago, Charlene Zimmerman told
her husband and three children she was dying of cancer. The story
circulated quickly around their suburb of Waukee and people all
over Des Moines rushed to help.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, neighbors and strangers brought food for Thanksgiving
and toys for Christmas. More help came in January when the family's
house burned down. Schoolchildren collected about $1,000 and
donated clothing and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimmerman, 34, didn't have cancer. She had shaved her head
to mimic the effects of chemotherapy, and the scars she displayed
weren't from biopsies -- they were self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   The lies led to a police investigation and a charge of felony
theft for taking more than $10,000 from charities and well-wishers.
On Thursday, Zimmerman entered a so-called Alford plea to a reduced
theft charge, admitting no guilt but conceding that prosecutors had
enough evidence to convict her, said her attorney, Peter Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman was ordered to pay $1,400 in restitution and was given
a deferred sentence. She will serve no jail time if she completes
two years' probation, and her record will be expunged of the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened to Charlene was the result of psychological
problems,'' Berger said. ''She truly believed she had cancer and
didn't intend to profit from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman had told neighbors in Waukee, population 5,000, that
she wouldn't live past a certain date. But when she didn't die, her
story changed and people grew suspicious, Dallas County Attorney
Wayne Reisetter said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman must write a letter of apology to be published in a
Dallas County newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''The letter won't say, 'I stole from you.' She will apologize
for hurting people,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, he said, suffered ''multiple traumatic events in her
childhood'' and has been ''in treatment off and on again for a long
time.'' He refused to elaborate but said he and his client had
agreed to an in-depth discussion on the ABC program ''20/20.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sixth NYC Cabbie Slain This Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A livery cab driver shot early Friday morning
was the sixth driver killed this year, prompting the mayor to
create a grant program to help the drivers install partitions or
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department has created a task force to investigate
the six homicides. An arrest has been made in only one of the
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the earlier cases appeared to have been motivated by
robbery. But the driver killed Friday, Luis Francisco Perez, had
cash on him after he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   A $5 million Safety Grant program will help drivers install
bulletproof partitions or digital security cameras in their cabs,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   The city requires partitions on all yellow cabs and livery cars
operated by more than one driver. But individual drivers who own
their cars say the devices are too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the partitions were installed in yellow cabs, murders
of those drivers are rare, Giuliani said. The last yellow cab
driver killed on the job occurred in 1997.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Assemblywoman Stepping Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Assemblywoman Elizabeth Connelly, the
longest-serving woman in the history of the New York Legislature,
said Friday she won't seek re-election in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   After 27 years in office, Connelly said she will step down when
her term ends in December to spend more time with her family.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been something I've been thinking about,'' Connelly said.
''It was time.''
</P>
<P>
   The 71-year-old Democrat cited the long, tiring commute between
her Staten Island district and Albany as well as the
unpredictability of the legislative schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly is speaker pro tempore, usually presiding from the
podium in the sometimes raucous 150-member House. As temporary
speaker -- the real speaker, Sheldon Silver, rarely presides -- she
recognizes speakers during debates and makes decisions on
parliamentary questions, all the while pleading for quiet and order
in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The position is the highest-ranking leadership post ever held by
a woman in Assembly history.

<HEADLINE> Rushdie Hopes For Ties With India  </HEADLINE>
By LAURINDA KEYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- On his first visit to India in 12 years,
author Salman Rushdie said he hoped to begin a new relationship
with his native country, where his book ''Satanic Verses'' was
banned following protests by Muslims across the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''This long rift between India and myself is now completely
over. I hope we can just turn the page and begin a new page,''
Rushdie told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie went into hiding in Europe after Muslim extremists
issued a religious edict in 1989 calling for his death for alleged
blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   Bodyguards surrounded Rushdie and photographers mobbed him as he
walked into a New Delhi hotel, where the Commonwealth Writer's
Prize for writers from the United Kingdom and its former colonies
was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie did not win. J.M. Coetzee of South Africa for
''Disgrace'' was named best book, while Canadian Jeffrey Moore's
''Prisoner in a Red Rose Chain'' won best first book.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim groups staged small demonstrations in the Indian capital
to protest the government's decision to grant Rushdie a visa.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie said he would like the ban on ''Satanic Verses'' lifted,
but had not sought to meet any government official.
</P>
<P>
   ''My message to Indian Muslims is that I've never been their
enemy and if they read my book, they would see that,'' Rushdie
said. ''I'm just here to restore a broken connection.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Protect Calif. Sequoias  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LAWRENCE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTERVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton is extending
greater protection to more than 30 groves of giant sequoia trees
across California, employing his executive authority to add to his
environmental legacy in his final year in office.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration Saturday would bring the amount of land Clinton
has designated as national monuments to more than 3 million acres,
more than Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   The sequoias can grow close to 300 feet tall and 40 feet thick
and are found in ancient groves scattered through the Sierra Nevada
range.
</P>
<P>
   The massive reddish trunks create what are often described as
nature's cathedrals, with thick carpets of pine needles that mute
most sound and sunlight that filters dimly through the branches.
</P>
<P>
   ''These trees are truly amazing,'' says Don Holtan, a Madison,
Wis., engineer who stopped in Sequoia National Park on Thursday to
walk among the giants. ''I think they are truly humbling.''
</P>
<P>
   About half of America's sequoia groves are already protected
because they lie within the Sequoia, Kings Canyon and Yosemite
National Parks. Clinton's declaration applies to most of the other
half.
</P>
<P>
   Those trees are already in national forests and are protected
from logging. But changing the land's designation from a ''national
forest'' to a ''national monument'' creates a buffer zone around
the trees where logging of other species would be banned along with
some forms of recreation and development.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is protecting 355,000 acres under the Antiquities Act of
1906, which allows him to designate land a ''national monument''
without going to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That angers some Republicans, and many residents of the
foothills here, who say the president's move is yet another federal
land grab. Others worry that business and recreation will be
squeezed out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we really need this,'' said Brian Clausen, a
Porterville convenience store clerk. ''I think the president is
just trying to leave a legacy so people do not think so much about
the sex scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   California GOP chairman John McGraw said: ''The best way to
preserve this area is to have the public use it carefully, not shut
it down completely.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration will bring the amount of land set aside by
Clinton in the Lower 48 states to 3.1 million acres -- more than any
president including Theodore Roosevelt, who created the national
park system. Substantial amounts of the land in Clinton's monuments
is near existing parks or already owned by a government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter holds the conservation record. Frustrated after
battles with Congress, he used the Antiquities Act to create 54
million acres of national monuments in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Clinton created the 1.7-million-acre Grand
Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah in 1996. In January,
he designated the Grand Canyon-Parashant and Agua Fria national
monuments in Arizona, which total more than 1 million acres, and
the California Coastal National Monument, which encompasses
thousands of offshore rocks and tiny islands the length of the
California coast.
</P>
<P>
   In October, he ordered the Forest Service to study whether to
designate ''wilderness areas'' across 50 million acres of national
forest in 38 states. A wilderness designation is the highest degree
of protection; it bars logging, grazing, road-building and all use
of motorized vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''That may make him the Teddy Roosevelt of the 21st century,''
said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club.

<HEADLINE> State agency fines political fund-raising committees for incompletereports  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The state Election Law Enforcement
Commission has fined a Republican fund-raising committee almost
$11,000 for not including enough detail about contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The fine issued Wednesday was the most recent of five fines in
the past year against the six statewide campaign accounts that are
allowed to collect large contributions not designated for specific
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican State Committee was fined $10,950 because staff
members, in quarterly campaign finance reports, failed to provide
enough information about the occupations or employers of scores of
donors who gave more than $412,000 in 1995 and 1996. The
information was provided after the election commission notified the
committee of its complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Republican State Committee agreed to pay the fine
and settle the complaint without appeal, the commission reduced the
fine to $8,775 as a sort of prompt-payment discount.
</P>
<P>
   The election commission has been cracking down on political
committees that collect large ''soft money'' contributions but make
it difficult to trace the occupations of the contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Since last June, the commission has fined five of the six
statewide fund-raising committees $31,400 for more than 100
violations in which donors giving up to $25,000 did not list their
occupation or employer's address properly.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic State Committee was fined $15,175 in October. The
commission agreed to accept $12,015 to resolve the case without
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   State law permits the Republican and Democratic state committees
plus the legislative leaders of both parties in the Senate and in
the Assembly to each operate separate campaign fund-raising
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   While ordinary candidates can accept donations of only $1,800 a
pop, these statewide war chests can accept donations of up to
$30,000 a year and can dole out the money to whomever they choose
or for whatever ''party building'' purposes they deem necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The only regulation is that these committees must file reports
with the commission every three months disclosing their donors'
names, addresses, occupations and work addresses.
</P>
<P>
   A failure to include occupation or work addresses in these
reports makes it difficult for interested people to learn what sort
of industries or special interests are represented by these donors.
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing these special-interest or business affiliations,
lengthy lists of names and home addresses have limited value.
</P>
<P>
   The Doria Leadership Fund, which is designed to help Assembly
Democrats and is controlled by their minority leader, Assemblyman
Joseph Doria, D-Hudson, was fined $2,675 last year. The fine was
reduced to $2,150 because the committee agreed to pay without an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Republican Majority was fined $650 in July, and the
fine was reduced to $550. The Senate Democratic Majority Committee
was fined $1,950, which was reduced to $1,525.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican State Committee's reports shows that financier
Candace Straight gave the GOP $26,500 in 1996, but does not give
any more information about her. The GOP was fined for listing her
employer only as ''John Head Investment Finance,'' without the
required city and address that make it possible to learn more about
the possible political or legislative interests of the firm or its
clientele. Head Investments is located on Madison Avenue in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Many other partial listings for which the GOP was fined involved
donations from attorneys that named partnerships where they worked
but did not give addresses or even city or state locations, which
would be necessary to learn more about the firm and its other
partners.
</P>
<P>
   There were two $25,000 donations in 1996 from the two managing
partners of Interstate Properties, but the firm was not identified
in any way at all. Interstate Properties is a real estate and
development firm in Saddle Brook.

<HEADLINE> Church Offers Holocaust Apology  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) -- Lithuania's Catholic Church issued an
official apology Friday for not doing enough to prevent the
massacre of some 220,000 Jews during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are sorry the church did not show enough resistance in
times when nationalist egoism was overtaking the values of the
Bible,'' said the statement, signed by Lithuanian Archbishop
Sigitas Tamkevicius.
</P>
<P>
   ''The memory of the church is depressed by the violence and hate
that was used,'' the two-page document said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of Lithuania's Jewish community -- one of
Europe's largest -- perished during Nazi rule in this predominantly
Catholic nation. Killings were ordered by the German occupiers, but
were often carried out by Lithuanian collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's statement alluded to collaborators and those who stood
by as the killings occurred, saying ''some of the church's children
were short of love to Jews and short of willingness to influence
Nazi collaborators.''
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Israel last month, Pope John Paul II said the
Catholic Church was ''deeply saddened'' by Christian persecution of
Jews through the centuries. But he stopped short of the apology
many Jews were hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   Since independence from Moscow in 1991, Lithuania has come under
fire for not doing enough to face its Nazi past. Several Nazi war
crimes trials, which began and were then halted, have also focused
attention on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Lithuanian Catholic Church also
apologized for the collaboration of some of its clergy with Soviet
secret police, the KGB, during fifty years of rule by Moscow.

Dow, Nasdaq, Suffer Worst Daily Point Drop
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A one-two punch from strong U.S. inflation
numbers combined with the recent worries about overvalued
technology stocks dragged all three major North American markets to
their worst daily point drops ever Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's most watched index, the TSE 300, plunged 491.90 points
to 8,473.51 -- down more than five per cent on the day. For the
week, the TSE lost 10.53 per cent of its value, suffering its worst
five-day loss in nearly 13 years, since the global market crash of
late 1987.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the Dow industrials plunged a record 617.78
points and the Nasdaq composite index also took a record hit of 355
points as inflation jitters led to feverish selling by investors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go hide under the bed for a while,'' advised Fred Ketchen,
chief of equities trading at Scotia Capital and one of the Toronto
market's most veteran traders.
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, the one-day loss was the worst for the Toronto Stock
Exchange since Oct. 27, 1997, when the index fell 434.25 points.

Tour Buses, Semi-trailers, Pickup Truck Collide

   MAPLE CREEK, Saskatchewan (AP) -- Steel crunched, fires raged and
smoke billowed on a stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway when two
tour buses, two semi-trailers and a pickup truck collided on an icy
section in southern Saskatchewan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   RCMP confirmed at least two people were killed in the crash,
although a witness said three people lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Police also said five people were injured and one was missing.
</P>
<P>
   The crash happened around 9 a.m. CST just east of the
Alberta-Saskatchewan boundary.
</P>
<P>
   The buses weren't carrying passengers, said Danny Holmedal, who
was running water to the accident site to help extinguish fires
that engulfed some of the vehicles.

   The crash forced the closure of the highway about 350 kilometers

Swissair Victims' Relatives Could Win Millions in Settlements:
Lawyer
</P>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- The relatives of people who died
aboard Swissair Flight 111 in 1998 stand to make millions in
settlements because of legal developments that remove limits on the
damages they can seek.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for 82 of the 229 victims of the air crash off Peggy's
Cove, Nova Scotia, says new American legislation and a recent
decision from a U.S. Appeal Court will increase the money paid out
to families suing the airline.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton quietly signed into law last week a
revised version of the Death on the High Seas Act.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, passed earlier by the U.S. House of Representatives
and Senate, will allow families to recover damages for loss of
care, comfort and companionship, which could make the cases some of
the priciest in aviation history.
</P>
<P>
   The previous act did not contain those provisions, limiting the
amounts for which family members could sue.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the relatives were also hoping the revision would
include provisions for ''conscious pain and suffering in
anticipation of death.''

One Million Stored Blood Samples To Be Tested for Hepatitis C
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Canadian Blood Services will test about a million
samples of stored blood for hepatitis C as part of a massive effort
to determine who's eligible for long-awaited government
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Testing the samples, stored in Toronto and Winnipeg, should make
it possible for many tainted-blood victims to trace their disease
to a specific unit of infected blood.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is vital as thousands of people prepare to apply
for compensation under a $1.2-billion federal-provincial agreement.
Application forms are to be mailed out April 25.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear why the blood samples were originally frozen and
placed in storage, but they are now seen as an invaluable resource
given the complex criteria of the compensation deal.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 200,000 Canadians have hepatitis C, but it is
believed only a fraction of those were infected through
transfusions or blood products. Injection drug use is the most
common mode of transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Those who did become infected through the blood system must show
the infection occurred in the 1986-1990 period for which the
government has accepted responsibility.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees Return Home  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Lugging their worldly possessions in
plastic bags, some 140 ethnic Albanian returnees arrived home in
Kosovo on a flight from Germany Friday -- many not knowing where
they would live or how they would get a job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was forced to return. The (German) police came and told me
to sign papers and said if I didn't they wouldn't let me return to
Kosovo for ten years,'' said Shqipe Dautaj, a 19-year-old traveling
with her one-year-old daughter. Her Albanian fiance and parents
remained in Germany, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My house has been destroyed so I will probably go and live
with my uncle,'' Dautaj said.
</P>
<P>
   The 144 returnees who flew in from Munich received money for
travel, plus $225 from the German government to cover some of their
resettlement expenses.
</P>
<P>
   With the onset of spring, hundreds of returnees are expected to
return to Kosovo from Australia, Germany, France and Switzerland.
More than 1,000 have returned in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bernard Kouchner, the U.N administrator of Kosovo,
called for a slowdown in the return of thousands of people to the
province, which is strained by poor infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   An influx of thousands within a short period of time ''will put
at risk the fragile institutions set up to provide social welfare,
and ... their position will tarnish the ... humanitarian and
international efforts to restore stability, law and order to the
province,'' he said in an open letter.
</P>
<P>
   There are concerns that people will be uprooted against their
will -- some people returning have lived in host countries with
families for several years -- and will have nowhere to live.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be good to be with my family again, but our house was
destroyed by Serbs,'' said Haradin Bujupi, 21, who fled Kosovo
during the 78-day NATO air war when his older brother-- a fighter
for the Kosovo Liberation Army -- was killed by forces loyal to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   There have already been cases of people being forcibly returned.
Two days ago, a man was handcuffed and taken off a plane at the
Pristina airport because he did not want to return to Kosovo, U.N.
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Vetos Abortion Waiting Bill  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN BAKST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura on Friday vetoed a
bill to create a 24-hour waiting period before a woman can have an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said he consulted with friends, family and advisers to
reach his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Listening to the people has brought me back to the convictions
that have always been the centerpiece to my administration,'' he
said. ''Convictions like personal responsibility, self-sufficiency,
and limited government.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators worked with top Ventura staffers on the bill,
leading them to believe he would support it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement had been worked out with the governor and his
staff, and to dishonor the agreement brings forward real questions
of honor and trust,'' said House Speaker Steve Sviggum, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Ventura's office, a group of lawmakers who favor
abortion rights praised the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''God bless you governor, you did the right thing,'' said Rep.
Betty Folliard, a Democrat. ''You knew what to do and you did it,
and today women across the state are proud of you for your
decision. You realized that there was no compromise on this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, women seeking abortions would have had to
receive information that described medical risks, alternatives to
abortion, fetal development, the father's responsibilities and
pregnancy prevention. Physicians or nurses would have provided the
information at least one day before a scheduled abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to comply could have resulted in injunctions against
clinics and fines.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states have enacted waiting periods of up to three
days. Five of them have been struck down or are facing legal
challenges, according to the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Driver Charged With Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- A woman suspected of causing a deadly
head-on crash while driving in the wrong direction was charged
Friday with seven counts of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Judy Kirby, of Indianapolis, intended to cause
the crash that killed three of her children and a nephew she had
adopted, and three others, because she was distraught over a
strained relationship with her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the evidence and witnesses were telling us lead us to
believe that she knew what she was doing at the time,'' Detective
Rick Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby, 31, drove more than a mile in the wrong lane of a divided
highway before colliding with a minivan March 25 near Martinsville,
southwest of Indianapolis, according to a probable cause affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Kirby appeared to accelerate before her car
slammed head-on into the minivan, killing its driver and two of his
children and her children.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby was one of only two survivors. She was arrested after her
release from the hospital Friday and is being held without bond.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby's lawyer, Maryann Wunder, did not return a phone message.

<HEADLINE> Last Texas A&AMP;M Victim Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The last Texas A&AMP;M University student to be
rescued from last year's fatal bonfire collapse has been released
from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   John Comstock, 19, was upbeat as he left Zale Lipshy University
Hospital after five months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to try to get back to A&AMP;M by next spring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Comstock, a freshman, was wiring logs together on the fourth
tier of the 59-foot stack of logs when it fell on Nov. 18. He was
pinned under timbers for almost seven hours in the collapse that
killed 12 students and injured 27 others.
</P>
<P>
   He was partially paralyzed and his left leg was amputated above
the knee. He lives in the Dallas suburb of Richardson and is taking
college classes via the Internet from A&AMP;M's biomedical science
program.
</P>
<P>
   Comstock said he would like to see the bonfire tradition
continue, although he cautioned against working on the construction
at night and suggested it should be better supervised.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be a lot safer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In three weeks, a commission investigating the bonfire collapse
will issue a report. Speculation on a possible cause has focused on
everything from a flawed structural design to a weakened center
pole.
</P>
<P>
   Comstock will undergo outpatient therapy at the hospital five
times a week.

<HEADLINE> Manager Sentenced in Fraud Scheme  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A money manager behind a municipal fraud
scheme prosecutors called the largest in Pennsylvania history was
sentenced Friday to more than three years in prison and ordered to
pay $61.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Donetta Ambrose ordered John Gardner Black,
55, to serve 26 concurrent sentences of three years, five months.
</P>
<P>
   Black was accused of persuading 50 school districts across
Pennsylvania and one in Maryland to invest school construction
money in risky securities. Prosecutors said he then tried to
conceal up to $71 million in losses.
</P>
<P>
   Black pleaded guilty in January to 21 counts of offering
fraudulent investment advice, three counts of mail fraud and two
counts of making false statements, accounting for $61.3 million in
losses. He could have been sentenced to 130 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''I apologize for the harm caused to the school districts in
Pennsylvania and my other clients,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Richard Scheff, said Black would not be able to
repay $61.3 million. He is supposed to pay the money through
installment plans of 10 percent of his monthly income after he
serves his prison sentence.

<HEADLINE> Boy Sues Over Teacher Relationship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A boy who fathered two children with his former
teacher has apparently decided he is a victim and is seeking
damages from a suburban municipality and school district.
</P>
<P>
   Vili Fualaau, 16, filed a claim against the municipality and
district where he became sexually involved with Mary Kay Letourneau
at the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
   Fualaau and his mother, Soona, say officials in south suburban
Des Moines and the Highline School District failed to protect him
from the sexual advances of a woman nearly three times his age.
Letourneau is serving a 7{-year sentence for child rape.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Vili, his mother and Letourneau, 38, all
characterized the relationship as a love affair. Lawyers for the
boy and his family would not say whether there had been a
falling-out between Letourneau and the family.
</P>
<P>
   But the boy's lawyer, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said Vili was too
immature to fully comprehend the relationship or the implications
of rearing two children.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a very young boy,'' Vance said. ''He has two kids. It's
an oversimplification to conclude that he was having a mature love
affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Vance did not return a telephone call Friday seeking additional
comment on the boy's apparent change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   The claims seek damages that could exceed $1 million for
emotional suffering, lost income and the cost of rearing the girls,
who are being raised by Vili's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the municipality and school system say the claims
are without merit. If the claims remain unresolved by the end of
the month, the boy and his mother can sue in King County Superior
Court.

<HEADLINE> Tentative U.S. Trade Deal Praised  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional leaders welcomed a tentative
agreement on legislation extending new trade benefits to African,
Central American and Caribbean nations Friday and suggested final
action could come next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement marks a significant milestone for a strong and
meaningful trade mechanism in the African and Caribbean Basin
areas,'' House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer,
R-Texas, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A monthslong logjam on the bill, a top Clinton administration
trade initiative, was broken Thursday night as leaders from the
House and the Senate met to hammer out a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Although some staff work remained, leaders characterized the
agreement as a major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the legislation would boost investment,
economic growth and job creation in these countries and improve the
competitive position of the U.S. textile industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will help promote economic reform, reduce poverty and
broaden participation in the benefits of the global economy,''
Clinton said in a statement. ''I urge Congress to complete the
remaining work on the bill rapidly so that final approval can occur
during the first week after its Easter recess.''
</P>
<P>
   According to participants, House leaders agreed to a Senate
proposal to give Caribbean and Central American nations many of the
same duty-free benefits to be extended to sub-Saharan African
nations.
</P>
<P>
   And House negotiators, in turn, agreed to some Senate
restrictions on apparel imports designed to protect the
hard-pressed U.S. textile industry.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said he hoped for final
House and Senate votes on the measure ''as soon as possible,''
suggesting it might come up soon after Congress returns from a
two-week spring recess that began on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
participated in the evening talks that produced the tentative
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Lott on Friday said that winning final approval of the bill
would be ''a major achievement ... It will help Africa and help the
Caribbean and help America.''
</P>
<P>
   Some details were sketchy, but those close to the negotiations
said House leaders agreed to accept a more-expansive Senate version
in terms of countries covered.
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed bill only dealt with the 48 countries of
sub-Saharan Africa. The Senate bill -- and now the compromise --
covers these nations, plus 24 Caribbean and Central American
nations as well.
</P>
<P>
   In another compromise, House leaders agreed to go along with a
cap on the volume of apparel shipments to receive duty-free
treatment, while Senate leaders agreed to lower restrictions than
in the original Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders also agreed to drop a Senate-passed requirement
that African-assembled apparel use U.S. fabric and thread, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the poorest countries in Africa would be eligible
for duty-free treatment in U.S. markets with no restrictions for
four years.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts manufactured in Caribbean and Central American
countries would be subject to some restrictions not applied to
other apparel, however, in a nod to U.S. textile manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something we have really wanted to accomplish for
sometime,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told
reporters. He called the tentative agreement ''good news for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and congressional leaders hoped to
handle the measure before taking up an even more contentious trade
bill later in the spring, extending permanent trade benefits to
China to help ease the way for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.

<HEADLINE> ACLU Probes Parent Meeting Ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COVINGTON, La. (AP) -- A school board got a court order to stop a
woman from complaining about her son's teacher during public
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU is looking into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   School boards never limit positive public comment, said Joe
Cook, ACLU executive director for Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as you praise them, you can speak,'' said Cook. ''If
you criticize, you can't speak? You can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana Thompson, 31, filed a complaint with the ACLU after the St.
Tammany Parish School Board won a temporary restraining order
against her.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson sought to complain about her son's first-grade teacher
at Madisonville Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never try to stifle any opportunity to speak before the
board,'' said School Board president John Lamarque.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lamarque said, there are limits to what Thompson can
say during the board meetings, particularly if she tries to
challenge a teacher's competence in public.
</P>
<P>
   The board has policies about complaints, and teachers' contracts
guarantee that their competence won't be discussed in public,
Lamarque said.
</P>
<P>
   ''An open forum attacking our employee is not a productive way
to accomplish that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the restraining order, Thompson also is required to sign
in and out of the school and cannot loiter on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the ACLU will decide whether to intervene before a May
22 court hearing, when a judge will consider whether to continue
barring Thompson from talking about personnel matters public
meetings.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Crane Talks About Alcoholism  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Phil Crane's alcohol use grew to almost
nightly 10-Heineken binges until a surprise intervention by
friends, family and fellow lawmakers made him reluctantly agree to
get help.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after three weeks in a Maryland rehabilitation facility,
the Illinois Republican is back in the fray of Congress, conducting
soul-baring interviews with reporters and even briefly running the
House floor for the first time in his 16 terms on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Crane, the House's most-senior Republican and a former
presidential candidate, declared Friday he has given up alcohol for
good and already feels better.
</P>
<P>
   ''My victories are on a roll. ... See, rehab and now I'm
speaker,'' the 69-year-old congressman from Chicago's northwest
suburbs joked during a wide-ranging interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Crane appeared to struggle with the widely accepted view
of alcoholism that it is a lifelong addiction and disease. Instead,
he repeatedly referred to it as a ''habit'' he has successfully
kicked, even bragging that he left his treatment program after 26
days -- four days early -- because counselors deemed him ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not that you conquer it,'' he quickly corrected himself. ''You
do it day by day, they stress that, hour by hour.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been invigorated since his return on Monday by
colleagues' ''hugs and pats'' and applause.
</P>
<P>
   But Crane said he was especially anxious to get back before
lawmakers left for a two-week recess so he could work on his
longtime pet project: extending new trade benefits to African,
Central American and Caribbean nations. Indeed, a tentative
House-Senate agreement was reached just Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that addressing his drinking problem was
important as he strives to become chairman of the powerful House
Ways and Means Committee next year.
</P>
<P>
   Crane is next in line to succeed retiring Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, as head of the tax-writing panel. But Crane faces a stiff
challenge from Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., and perhaps others, in
part because of his reputation for being largely absent from some
of the committee's toughest battles.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, the congressman said he had become
''vaguely aware'' he was drinking too much as he counted up to 10
empty bottles many evenings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hadn't gotten that bad, except I had put on weight,'' Crane
said. ''This takes a toll on your health in terms of your vigor. My
scheduling was escalating in intensity at a time when I was really
undermining my capability to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crane traces his increased intake to the death of his
31-year-old daughter, Rachel, of non-Hodgkins lymphoma the day
after Christmas 1997. Two months later, after a bout with
pneumonia, he gave up 50 years of smoking Camels and, he said,
substituted one habit for another.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not have a problem with alcohol before that. But
his well-known affinity for Heinekens was talked about -- albeit
quietly -- as far back as his 1980 presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Crane's wife, Arlene, had recently pleaded with him to cut back,
or at least to switch to a lower-calorie brand, and he had started
considering whether he should quit.
</P>
<P>
   But it took an ''overwhelming'' confrontation by seven friends --
including Rep. Jim Ramstad, R-Minn., former Rep. Rod Chandler,
R-Wash., and another former congressmen he would not name -- in his
spacious Capitol Hill office the evening of March 15 to enroll him
in an inpatient program.
</P>
<P>
   Crane resisted for about an hour, concerned about speaking
engagements and other commitments on his calendar. Eventually, he
got in the car with his 36-year-old daughter, Rebekah, who had
packed a bag with some sweat suits and toiletries, and went to the
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, he said he was struck by how many patients had
relapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't want to slip with the rationalization to yourself
that, 'OK, now I haven't had anything to drink for six months, a
year, whatever, so now I can go back to drinking in moderation,'''
he said. ''You've got to recognize that the war is eternal. You
take it one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now back at work, his office refrigerator is already stocked
with low-sodium V-8 juice. He also plans to go to Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings, though he hasn't yet.
</P>
<P>
   And though he hasn't had to tackle the requisite Washington
party circuit yet, he has a plan for that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been looking forward to a reception to see what these
bottles of sparkling water are that people keep talking about,'' he
said. ''Somebody told me you can put a lemon or lime in it.''

<HEADLINE> Sunjet Says Investigation Hampering  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANFORD, Fla. (AP) -- Sunjet Aviation Inc. has been unable to
operate normally since federal agents seized documents as part of
their investigation into the crash that killed golfer Payne
Stewart, the charter company's president said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They took every piece of paper in this building,'' said James
Watkins. ''They have certainly hampered our operation. But we're
not quitters and we're going to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Federal Aviation Administration has not revoked the
company's license to fly, nearly 50 agents conducted a daylong
search of Sunjet's offices and hangars at Orlando Sanford Airport
on Tuesday. They seized thousands of records in what the FBI said
is an investigation into possible illegal maintenance and
record-keeping practices and making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Without those records, all but two of the company's eight planes
are effectively grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, business associates Robert Fraley, Van Ardan and Bruce
Borland and pilots Michael Kling and Stephanie Bellegarrigue died
Oct. 25 when their Learjet went off course on a flight from Orlando
to Dallas. The plane flew for hours, sometimes above 50,000 feet,
before crashing in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators believe the
plane lost cabin pressure and oxygen during the flight, but have
apparently been unable to determine why.
</P>
<P>
   The company is negotiating with federal officials to return
maintenance and flight logs and other records needed to operate
their aircraft, Watkin said.

<HEADLINE> Ex Miami Official Settles Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A former city manager on Friday settled securities
fraud charges without admitting any wrongdoing by agreeing not to
commit future violations.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Odio and the city were accused by the Securities and
Exchange Commission of violating securities laws by making
deficit-ridden city finances look good on three bond offerings in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Odio, who testified for the commission at the city's trial last
month, acknowledged signing stacks of bond papers without reading
them. He agreed under the settlement that as city manager he was
ultimately responsible for the financial misstatements in the bond
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires cities to operate with balanced budgets, but
the city ran a $68 million deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the city argued in trial that city officials
relied on professional advice and couldn't anticipate the deficit
before it was uncovered by Odio's successors in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A decision in the city's case is not expected for months. Former
city finance director Manohar Surana also faces the securities
charges.

<HEADLINE> Ex Cincinnatti Editor Sues Gannett  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NOLAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The former editor of The Cincinnati Enquirer
has sued the paper's owner, Gannett Co. Inc., accusing it of
undermining him while retracting news stories critical of the
Chiquita banana company.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett and its lawyers secretly plotted to remove Lawrence K.
Beaupre as the Enquirer's editor to avert a threatened lawsuit by
Chiquita Brands International Inc. over the paper's stories,
Beaupre said in his lawsuit filed Thursday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Beaupre also claims Gannett and its lawyers failed to give him
appropriate, independent legal representation or inform him of all
aspects of a Gannett settlement with Chiquita that he signed.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett, which publishes 74 daily newspapers in the United
States, issued a statement Friday saying the suit is ''full of
inaccuracies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Gannett intends to vigorously defend itself against Mr.
Beaupre's meritless complaint,'' the company said in a statement
from its Arlington, Va., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Beaupre presided over the Enquirer's May 1998 publication of
stories questioning Chiquita's business practices in Central
America. In June 1998, the Enquirer renounced the stories, fired
lead reporter Michael Gallagher, apologized to Chiquita on its
front page and paid Chiquita more than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Beaupre's lawsuit said Gannett made him ''an official executive
scapegoat.''
</P>
<P>
   Gannett said the lawsuit was Beaupre's attempt to blame Gannett
for his problems, rather than ''accepting responsibility for the
news articles that he edited and for which he later personally
apologized.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaupre, now on administrative leave from Gannett, demands
unspecified damages. Reached at his Cincinnati home Friday night,
Beaupre declined to comment on Gannett's statements.
</P>
<P>
   Beaupre, a 32-year Gannett employee, alleges the company failed
to keep compensation and promotion promises made when he accepted a
transfer to headquarters as a news executive following the
settlement with Chiquita. He also claims Carl Lindner, Chiquita's
chief executive officer, insisted on the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Lindner spokeswoman Sandra Heimann did not return a call to her
home Friday night. Chiquita spokesman Joseph Hagin Jr. declined to
comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Gannett, Beaupre names as defendants two of
Gannett's corporate lawyers, Thomas Chapple and Barbara Wall, along
with Washington law firm Nixon Peabody LLP and two of its lawyers
who represented Gannett, Robert Bernius and Henry DePippo.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Cypriot Leader Challenged  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- Rauf Denktash, the leader of Cyprus'
Turkish community for more than 25 years, faces a stiff challenge
in elections for president of the self-declared Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's election comes just a month before the third round of
U.N.-sponsored talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Denktash
is urging Turkish Cypriots to give him a mandate as he pursues
talks with the island's Greek community.
</P>
<P>
   But Denktash, 75, faces a strong challenge from Prime Minister
Dervis Eroglu, 62, a center-right candidate who is picking up
support from Cypriots tired of Denktash's long rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for someone new,'' said Ahmet Ince, as he attended
Denktash's last campaign meeting Thursday in the historical seaside
town of Famagusta.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus has been divided into Turkish and Greek sections since a
1974 Turkish invasion, which came in the wake of an Athens-backed
coup by supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Denktash gets elected in the first round, it would be a
public declaration to the world that the Cypriots are behind him
and that he can make a (peace) deal on their behalf,'' said Yusuf
Kanli, an expert on Cyprus politics.
</P>
<P>
   Six other candidates are running Saturday, including five
left-wing candidates.
</P>
<P>
   If Denktash does not win a majority of the votes, he will face a
run-off with the other leading candidate on April 22. That is
likely to be Eroglu, who forced Denktash into a run-off in the last
election in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Eroglu's strength comes from his position as prime minister. In
this small community of 200,000 people, he is able to gather
support through popular policies and the distribution of social
aid.
</P>
<P>
   But many wonder if Eroglu would be the best representative for
Turkish Cypriots in negotiations with Greeks. The premier used to
say that the division of the island into two separate states was a
solution in and of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash has the support of Turkey, which is key, particularly
among the tens of thousands of mainland Turkish settlers who have
moved to the island since 1974. Estimates of the number of settlers
range from 30,000 to 80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Denktash established the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in
1983. It is only recognized by Turkey, which maintains 30,000
troops on the island.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 9, Angels 4  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Frank Thomas homered and extended his
season-opening hitting streak to 11 games Friday night as the
Chicago White Sox won their home opener, beating the Anaheim Angels
9-4 and matching their best start in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, bothered by a sore right foot and ankle that required a
cortisone injection earlier this week, reached out and hit a
first-inning pitch from Ken Hill nearly 400 feet to right-center
field for his third homer, limping noticeably as he rounded the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   He later added a single to finish 2-for-4 as he tries to bounce
back from two sub-par seasons. Paul Konerko also homered and had an
RBI double and Ray Durham drove in three runs for the White Sox,
off to their best start since also going 7-4 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson, who agreed to a four-year contract extension
Friday, hit a two-run homer to pull the Angels within 8-4 in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, averaging seven runs this season, loaded the
bases in the second as Carlos Lee was hit by a pitch, Craig Wilson
singled and Mark Johnson walked. Durham hit a sacrifice fly and
then Greg Norton drove in two with a double.
</P>
<P>
   Durham hit another sacrifice fly to make it 5-0 in the fourth.
Hill (1-2), battling the stomach flu, was removed one batter later,
slumping into the corner of the dugout before heading to the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Durham singled home a run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy hit an RBI single for the Angels' first run in the
fifth. Konerko scored Thomas, who had singled, with an RBI double,
and Lee hit a run-scoring single to make it 7-1. Darin Erstad had a
run-scoring grounder in the seventh before Konerko hit a solo homer
off Lou Pote.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson homered off reliever Scott Eyre and Troy Glaus
singled, Keith Foulke relieved and struck out the side.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sirotka (2-1), who pitched out of a bases-loaded
predicament in a long first inning, went 5 1-3 innings, allowing
seven hits and a run.
</P>
<P>
   Hill gave up five hits and five runs in 3 2-3 innings.
Notes: An announced crowd of 38,912 was the White Sox's largest
for a home opener since 42,890 in 1994. The team called Friday
night's crowd a sellout. Several thousands seats were not sold
because they were covered as part of a post-game fireworks display.
The capacity of the park is 44,321. ... Sirotka threw 34 pitches in
the first inning before striking out Glaus with the bases loaded.
He was helped by Durham's spectacular over-the-head catch of Tim
Salmon's short fly as he fell down in right field. ... The most
visible addition to Comiskey Park is the giant billboard behind the
left-field bleachers that is a stock ticker. ... The game was the
first of a 13-game homestand for the White Sox, who spent most of
their first two weeks on the road. ... The White Sox opened the
season with an average age of 26.8 years, tying them with the Twins
for the youngest roster in the AL. ... After nine straight games at
home, Friday night's was the first of 10 straight on the road for
the Angels.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 13, Red Sox 6  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Oakland manager Art Howe would trade it all -- the
13 runs, the 11 hits, and even the victory -- to get his first
baseman back.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Chavez hit a grand slam as the Athletics scored six runs in
the first inning and kept on scoring Friday night to beat the
Boston Red Sox 13-6.
</P>
<P>
   But the A's mood soured when Jason Giambi pulled up lame in the
seventh inning with injuries to his right knee and hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bittersweet victory because of that,'' Howe said.
''It's one of the keys to our success, to stay healthy. But that's
what you've got bench players for.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Appier (2-1) allowed three earned runs and eight hits in
six innings, striking out six to win his second consecutive start.
Frank Menechino also homered in the first inning for the A's.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi was 1-for-3 with two walks and a three-run homer -- his
fifth of the season, second in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning, he hit a ground ball to the second
baseman in the hole behind first base. He might have been able to
beat it out, but he pulled up a few steps before the bag.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how I came down on it or when I did it. It just
locked up on me,'' he said. ''We'll see how it comes back tomorrow.
Hopefully, it won't be too long.''
</P>
<P>
   He was diagnosed with a hyperextended right knee and also a
hamstring injury. Doctors won't know how severe the latter is until
they examine him Saturday, after the swelling has subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll give him tomorrow off for sure,'' Howe said. ''That will
give the trainers a chance to diagnose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rose (0-2) retired only two batters and walked four,
giving up a two-run homer to Menechino and then walking the bases
full before giving up Chavez' third home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I let my team down today,'' Rose said after the Red Sox lost
for the first time in four home games. ''I let the fans down
because we seemed to have something going the last couple of
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Menechino also doubled and scored in the second to make it 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox cut the deficit to five runs on Nomar Garciaparra's
two-run single in the third. Wilton Veras singled to lead off the
fifth, took third on Jose Offerman's single and scored on Trot
Nixon's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman took second on Brian Daubach's single, and Garciaparra
hit a grounder to short, forcing Daubach. But Daubach went hard
into Menechino at second base, forcing him to throw wide on his
attempt for a double play and allowing Offerman to score to make it
7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi hit a three-run homer in the sixth, and Oakland scored
three more in the seventh to make it 13-4. Garciaparra added
another RBI single in the seventh to make it 13-5.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was Oakland's first road game of the season. ...
Menechino has reached base safely in nine of Oakland's first 10
games. ... Appier's last shutout was at Fenway Park on May 5, 1997,
while with the Royals. ... Red Sox 3B Gary Gaetti retired before
the game and was replaced on the roster with infielder Andy Sheets.
Garciaparra had his first two-error game since Game 1 of the AL
Championship Series last year against the New York Yankees. ...
Chavez was 3-for-5 with a career-high five RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Friday's Baseball Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Rangers-Indians:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers didn't arrive in Cleveland until 2:30 a.m.
Friday morning after playing a 7:05 p.m. night game in New York on
Thursday. The team said the 18-hour time difference between
starting times was the shortest ever for the Rangers when playing
games in two cities. ''I've never experienced anything like that
before,'' said Rafael Palmeiro who homered in Texas' 7-2 win over
Cleveland. ''It was tough, but that's just part of the game.'' ...
Palmeiro has eight career homers at Jacobs Field. Only Mark
McGwire, Juan Gonzalez and Frank Thomas have hit more (9) for
visiting teams. ... Like the Indians, the Rangers were playing in
their third opening day game of 2000. Texas won its home opener and
lost in New York on Wednesday before beating the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: The Indians are now 5-2 in their seven home openers
at Jacobs Field. ... Before Friday's game manager Charlie Manuel
joked about being thrown out of the Indians' only two losses this
season. ''I think I might stick around for this one,'' he said. ...
Center fielder Kenny Lofton, who had offseason surgery on his
(left) throwing shoulder, twice made short relay throws to
outfielders Manny Ramirez and David Justice, who fired the ball
back into the infield during Friday's game. ... In winning five
straight AL Central titles, the Indians have been in first place or
tied for first for 825 of the 892 days (92.5 percent).
Athletics-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Oakland played its first road game of the season. ...
Frank Menechino, who homered in the first inning, has reached base
safely in nine of Oakland's first 10 games. ... Kevin Appier's last
shutout was at Fenway Park on May 5, 1997, while with the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: 3B Gary Gaetti retired before the game. He was 0-for-10
with one RBI in five games for Boston this year. ... Infielder Andy
Sheets was promoted to take his place on the roster. ... Brian Rose
retired only two batters and walked four, giving up a two-run homer
and a grand slam in the first inning.
Angels-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: The Angels, who played their first nine games at home
this season, were just 33-48 on the road a year ago. .. Anaheim
batted .289 with nine homers and 46 RBIs on its first homestand.
... April has always been one of the Angels' best months. It is
just one of two winning months in club history. The other is the
final one, October, when the Angels have gone 40-34. ... OF Garret
Anderson, who agreed to a contract extension Friday, is a Los
Angeles native. Asked if would like to play his entire career with
his hometown team, Anderson said, ''I don't know what's going to
happen. If it happens, it does. I'm not going to lose sleep if it
doesn't.'' . ... During his playing career, Angels manager Mike
Scoscia caught two no-hitters while with the Dodgers -- Fernando
Valenzuela against St. Louis and Kevin Gross against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO WHITE SOX: Frank Thomas was in the lineup as DH, despite
a sore right foot that restricts his mobility. Thomas was 20-for-42
with two homers on the Sox's opening road trip in which he hit in
all 10 games. ... James Baldwin, struck in the chest by a line
drive off the bat of Tampa Bay's Greg Vaughn on Wednesday, is still
not sure if will make his next start. Baldwin has a bruised rib.
''It was a scary situation, there was no time to react,'' Baldwin
said. ''To this day I can't even watch the replay. I opened my eyes
and everybody was out there. I was gassing, out of breath.'' ...
The White Sox had to switch their infield around for their home
opener because of injuries. SS Jose Valentin had a tight hamstring
so Craig Wilson went from third to short, Paul Konerko from first
to third and Greg Norton, also bothered by a sore hamstring, from
the bench to first base.
Devil Rays-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Right-hander Dwight Gooden makes his Devil Rays debut
Saturday against the Tigers. ''He's going to get the ball for the
next month or so,'' general manager Chuck LaMar said. ''If he
pitches good he's going to win that spot. And my gut feeling is
that he'll respond to it. He wants to be here and he wants to pitch
here.'' Gooden, a Tampa native, was obtained in a Thursday trade
with Houston. ... Should Fred McGriff homer in his first visit to
Comerica Park this weekend, he would add to his major league record
of home runs in 36 different ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Second baseman Damion Easley is likely to go on the DL
when the Tigers activate right-hander Jeff Weaver to start
Saturday's game against the Devil Rays. Easley has been out since
straining his right rib cage last Sunday at Baltimore. ... Gregg
Jefferies and Shane Halter have been doing more than an adequate
job of filling in for Easley. Jefferies had the first Comerica Park
RBI Tuesday and a key defensive play Thursday, both wins against
Seattle. Halter, who replaced Jefferies to start the eighth
Thursday, drew a walk to lead off the bottom half and scored on
Juan Gonzalez's double that keyed the 2-0 win.
Mariners-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays averaged 20,926 fans in their first four
home games. That's about 6,000 less than last season. ... Before
the game, a pizza company held a contest where if a kid caught all
three fly balls hit to him, everyone in attendance would receive a
coupon for a free pizza. The kid caught the balls, but the P.A.
announcer said the coupon wasn't redeemable at one of the Pizza
Pizza stands in SkyDome. They're only redeemable at Pizza Pizza
stores outside SkyDome.

   SEATTLE: Before the game, John Olerud, who has played for the
Blue Jays, Mets and Mariners, compared the three managers he's had.
''I went from Cito Gaston, who was easy going and laid back, to
Bobby Valentine, who was high strung and very emotional. Lou
Piniella is kind of a blend of the two. He seems pretty laid back,
but I've seen him run on to the field.'' ... Seattle starter Jamie
Moyer walked two or less batters in 29 of his 32 starts last
season.
Royals-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals entered Friday night's game with the
most wins in the major leagues (8-3), having won four straight
games with walk-off hits (three homers and a single). ''In 34 years
of professional baseball, I've never seen it happen,'' manager Tony
Muser said. ''It's great to see the players excited.'' ... At 8-3,
which includes five come-from-behind wins, Kansas City was off to
its best start since 1978 (9-2). ... The Royals already have two
four-game winning streaks, which matches their longest streak last
year. They are five games over .500 for the first time since June
30, 1995 (21-25). ... The Royals were only one of three teams to
win last year's season series against the Yankees (5-4), joining
Boston (8-4) and Anaheim (6-4). ... Muser on confidence: ''It can
be fleeting. ... We'll learn a lot about ourselves in this
series.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK YANKEES: With Andy Pettitte on the DL, the Yankees
intend to start Jason Grimsley on Sunday, then bring Mike Stanton
out of the bullpen when Grimsley tires. Grimsley hasn't started in
the major leagues since 1996, when he had 20 starts and 15 relief
appearances for the Angels. He had 16 minor league starts the
following season. ... Tino Martinez came out of Thursday night's
game because of double vision. During batting practice, a ball hit
the screen in front of first base and dislodged dirt, which when
into an eye. ... Joe Torre entered needing one win for his 1,300th
as a major league manager (1,254 losses). ... Torre on the Royals:
''They have a good lineup. The question is how good is their
pitching going to be, and I think that's everyone's question. As
far as the 1-to-9 lineup, they're like us in that they don't strike
out a lot.'' ... Wilson Delgado started at third and Alfonso
Soriano (two errors in five games) was rested.
Orioles-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Cal Ripken's family joined him in Minneapolis as he
continued his chase for 3,000 hits. ''If I get a few hits, they
want to be here,'' said Ripken, who entered the game four hits shy
of becoming the 24th member of the exclusive club. Two others have
gotten their 3,000th hit at the Metrodome: Dave Winfield, with the
Twins, on Sept. 16, 1993; and Eddie Murray, with Cleveland, on June
30, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins scrambled to change their lineup when
manager Tom Kelly learned that Jose Mercedes and not fellow
right-hander Calvin Maduro was pitching for the Orioles. A Twins
spokesman said the Orioles made the change midweek but neglected to
notify anybody, so Kelly only found out about it less than two
hours before the game.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Marlins-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO CUBS: Cubs shortstop Ricky Gutierrez extended his
hitting streak to nine games with a first-inning single Friday. The
streak equals the longest of his career, which he achieved May
24-June 6, 1998, with San Diego. ... Right-hander Kerry Wood, who
is coming back from elbow surgery, will make his second injury
rehab start for Class A Daytona on Tuesday. Wood threw 90 pitches
over five innings Thursday for Daytona, giving up one run on one
hit and five walks. He struck out nine, including the last six
batters he faced. Cubs general manager Ed Lynch won't set a date
for Wood's return. ''We've never etched an anticipated return date
in stone,'' Lynch said of Wood, the 1998 Rookie of the Year. ''Now
it's less of a medical question. Now, it's a baseball question.''
... Cubs RHP Ismael Valdes, who is rehabbing from tendinitis in his
shoulder, will not pitch Friday as scheduled because of a small cut
on his right index finger. Valdes was to pitch in Mesa, Ariz., for
the team's extended spring training team. Lynch said Valdes will be
pushed back four to five days because of the injury. ... In a minor
league deal, the Cubs traded left-handed pitcher Ray King, who was
at Triple-A Iowa, to the Milwaukee Brewers for RHP Doug Johnston,
who was at Double-A Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The Marlins outrighted catcher Sandy Martinez to
Triple-A Calgary. ... SS Alex Gonzalez returned to the No. 2 spot
in the Marlins order Friday. Gonzalez was dropped to the bottom of
the order for the last three games. ... Andre Dawson and Tony
Perez, both special assistants to Marlins GM Dave Dombrowski, were
guest singers for the seventh-inning stretch. ... Florida manager
John Boles who was born in Chicago and attended Lewis University in
Romeoville, Ill., expected a large contingent of friends and family
at the weekend games. ''We'll invade the 'Cubby Bear' (bar) after
Sunday's game,'' Boles said.
Reds-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Pokey Reese, hit above the left elbow by a Rolando
Arrojo pitch Monday in Colorado, returned to the lineup Friday and
went 4-for-4 with a walk, raising his batting average to .500.
''I'm back to normal, I'm feeling fine,'' he said. ... Manager Jack
McKeon pointed out his team was playing its third opener -- its own
against Milwaukee on April 3, and Colorado's home-opener last
Monday. ''We haven't won one yet,'' he said before the Dodgers
became the final NL team to play a home game. ''We're due to break
our streak.'' Unfortunately for McKeon and the Reds, it didn't
happen. ... Barry Larkin, who hits second for the Reds behind
Reese, is hitting .349, but no other player in Cincinnati's
starting lineup Friday is hitting higher than .235. ''I've been
getting on for these guys, and they're going to come through,''
Reese said. ''We're not worried about that.''
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: The Dodgers arrived at Los Angeles International
Airport after 1 a.m. Friday -- some 12 hours before the start of
their home opener -- after completing a suspended game and then
playing the regularly scheduled game in San Francisco on Thursday
night. ''I don't think there was a lot of thought that went into
our schedule,'' Eric Karros said. Gary Sheffield agreed, saying,
''No sleep; It doesn't help the way our schedule is messed up.''
... Sheffield, who has been playing despite a sprained right ankle
that remains visibly swollen, went 3-for-3 with an intentional walk
against the Reds, raising his average to .429. He has hit safely in
all 10 games this season, and also had at least one hit in his
final six games last year. ... Rookie right-hander Eric Gagne is
scheduled to pitch for the Dodgers on Saturday night. Left-hander
Onan Masaoka was optioned to Albuquerque after Friday's game.
Braves-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Andres Galarraga has been hit four times already this
season. ''I'm getting tired of it,'' he said. ''I don't know what I
have to do to get the message to the pitchers. I don't know if I
have to fight or what, but there's a lot of room between my face
and the plate. If they don't want to pitch to me, they can throw it
outside, not at my face.'' ... Manager Bobby Cox doesn't seem
concerned about three straight losses to the Cubs and a 4-5 start
to the season. ''We'll get our team together next week,'' he said.
''We're fine.'' He referred to the return of OF Brian Jordan, LHP
John Rocker and LHP Rudy Seanez.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: SS Mark Loretta was 0-for-12 and batting .139
entering Friday's game against Atlanta. He ended the slide with an
RBI double in the first inning. ... Jason Bere, 2-0, leads the
majors with a 0.69 ERA after pitching seven innings in Thursday's
4-0 win over Florida. ... The Brewers named Elanis Westbrooks as
their advance scout. He worked the past two years for the Colorado
Rockies in a similar position. Westbrooks, 34, replaces Tim
Johnson, who resigned.
Expos-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: LHP Graeme Lloyd returned to the Expos for the first
time since the death of his wife Cindy on April 3. Lloyd was
already on the disabled list with left shoulder tendinitis when
Cindy died because of complications with Crohn's disease. Lloyd
will begin a throwing program but is expected to be sidelined for
10-14 more days. ... With Hideki Irabu pitching on Saturday, NHK in
Japan will televise the game against the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Curt Schilling will make his third rehab start for
Clearwater on Saturday night. Many speculate that Schilling will be
available in early May but is scheduled to make two additional
starts in the minor leagues before rejoining the Phillies. ... The
Expos are Philadelphia's first opponent this season that did not
make the playoffs last year. ... Doug Glanville is set his to throw
out the first ball at the University of Pennsylvania's new baseball
field at Murphy Field before Saturday's Penn-Cornell college
baseball game. Glanville is a 1992 graduate of Penn.
Mets-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK METS: Rick Reed, who broke into the majors with the
Pirates, has started three of the Mets' four victories. He has an
0.79 ERA. ... The Mets were 7-2 against the Pirates last season,
sweeping a three-game series in New York the final weekend of the
season to force a playoff with Cincinnati for the NL wild-card
spot. ... LHP Glendon Rusch starts Saturday, his first outing since
an exhibition game in Norfolk, Va., on April 4. He allowed five
runs, four earned, in five innings that day against the Triple-A
Tides. ... Three of the Mets' first four victories were by 2-1
scores.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Pirates RHP Jason Schmidt's first three starts have
been against Houston's Shane Reynolds, Arizona's Randy Johnson and
the Mets' Al Leiter. ... Pirates pinch-hitters started the season
6-of-10 with two homers, both by John Vander Val, and eight RBIs.
... C Jason Kendall began last season as the Pirates' lead off
hitter, but lasted only 15 games before being dropped to No. 2.
This season, he figures to lead off for the foreseeable future. He
started and led off the Pirates' first 10 games. Since 1981, the
only catcher to lead off more than Kendall did last season was
Houston's Craig Biggio, now a 2B, who led off 17 games in 1989.
Biggio also led off 14 games while catching in 1991. Kendall said,
''Wherever they want me to hit is fine. But I'm not going to change
my approach. If I get a fastball to hit on 2-and-1, I'm ripping.''
Cardinals-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Mark McGwire, who returned to St. Louis before the
start of a four-game series in Colorado on Thursday, was examined
for lingering back pain by team physician Dr. George Paletta. The
exam showed no new disk injury, and McGwire was treated for
inflammation in the lumbar region. He will rest and receive
treatment in St. Louis and will be re-evaluated Monday. ... St.
Louis recalled RHP Alan Benes from Triple-A Memphis. Benes, whose
most recent of two shoulder operations was in September 1998,
received a no-decision in last Sunday's start at Iowa. To make room
for Benes, the Cards sent left-hander Justin Brunette to Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Closer candidate David Lee, who faltered again in the
ninth inning Thursday night, probably will be moved temporarily to
middle relief, manager Buddy Bell said. ... Pedro Astacio, who made
his 2000 Coors Field debut Friday night, hasn't missed a start
since joining the Rockies in August 1997 -- a string of 78 starts.
Astros-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: 3B Ken Caminiti (strained left hamstring) missed his
fourth straight start, although he said he might be ready to play
Saturday. Caminiti, the 1996 NL MVP when he played with San Diego,
has yet to play against his former team since signing with Houston
as a free agent after the 1998 season. He missed all nine games
against the Padres last season when he was on the disabled list for
nearly three months. ... OF Matt Mieske (lower back strain) was
activated from the 15-day DL. ... RHP Scott Elarton is scheduled to
make his first start of the season Tuesday at Los Angeles. Elarton,
who began the season on the DL as he recovered from offseason
rotator cuff surgery, had been scheduled to start Sunday for Double
A Round Rock. Elarton's availability cleared the way for Thursday's
trade of pitcher Doc Gooden to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Tony Gwynn sat out his fourth consecutive game after
having his left knee drained Monday. Manager Bruce Bochy expected
Gwynn to be back in the lineup against Houston on Friday night, but
his knee is still too sore. ... Center fielder Ruben Rivera (wrist)
missed his fifth straight game. ... Pitcher Sterling Hitchcock said
he was going to keep the camouflage jersey the team wore Sunday to
honor the military. Asked if he still had the unsightly futuristic
uniform the Padres wore in a game last season, Hitchcock said,
''That one was torn up right away, as soon as I came out.''
Diamondbacks-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: LHP Randy Johnson has 127 career double-digit strikeout
games entering Friday night's contest. That's the second most to
Nolan Ryan's 215. Left-handed hitters are 0-for-8 so far this
season. Barry Bonds was the only lefty in the starting lineup on
Friday. ... OF Luis Gonzalez has a career .345 batting average
(57-for-165) with three homers and 30 RBIs in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: The Giants optioned RHP Ben Weber to Triple-A
Fresno of the Pacific Coast League before the game. Weber was 0-1
with a 13.50 ERA in six appearances with San Francisco. To take
Weber's place on the 25-man roster, the Giants recalled RHP Scott
Linebrink from Fresno. ... Giants leadoff hitters are 1-for-9 with
one walk and one run in the first inning.

<HEADLINE> Congo Leader Urges End To War  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- In an emotional speech at the Group of 77 summit,
Congo's foreign minister asked Third World leaders Friday to
pressure Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi to withdraw their forces from
his country.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with the summit's theme of unity among poor nations
against rich nations, Abdoulaye Yerodia demanded that the summit
not ignore the 18 month old war in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   While not mentioning the countries by name, he said that at the
summit, three member nations had ignored the crisis in Central
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has spoken about these things. They haven't even said
they are at war,'' Yerodia said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million people have been displaced by fighting in
the Democratic Republic of Congo and the government has received
troops and arms from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia. The Congolese
government insists the rebel groups -- who also fight among
themselves -- are surrogates for Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are part of the G-77. Do something to make these people
go home,'' he said. ''Stop their invasions so together we may turn
our eyes toward the North.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebels began fighting in 1998 to oust Congolese President
Laurent Kabila. Citing concerns about security along their common
borders, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda supported the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a new cease-fire took effect in Congo. Yerodia
accused the rebels and their backers of already violating the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council plans to deploy a 5,500-strong U.N.
peacekeeping mission to monitor the disengagement within months.
</P>
<P>
   Yerodia noted that while summit speakers had emphasized
presenting a common front among developing nations, three G-77
nations were Congo's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brothers and sisters, where is OUR side?'' he declared. ''I
beg you to listen to what I'm saying. ... The aggressors should go
home.''

<HEADLINE> Raptors 86, Knicks 71  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Vince Carter scored 34 points and the Toronto
Raptors showed they're ready for a possible first-round matchup
against the New York Knicks with a convincing 86-71 victory Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Carter shot a stellar 14-for-19 from the field, making an
assortment of long-range jumpers, while Antonio Davis added 17
points on 8-of-13 shooting and Tracy McGrady had 11 points and nine
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing had 16 points for the Knicks, who had their
two-game winning streak snapped as they missed a chance to move
into a tie with Miami atop the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors won the season series 3-1, with all the victories
coming by decisive margins. If the playoffs were to start now, the
Knicks (No. 3) and Toronto (No. 6) would face each other in the
opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto is 2{ games ahead of seventh-place Detroit in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Davis set the tone on a number of strong drives to the net and
had 10 points in the first quarter as Toronto led 28-11.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors finished the quarter on a 9-0 run when Allan Houston
took a needless foul with 1.3 seconds left on Dell Curry's 3-point
attempt. Curry knocked down all three free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Although Carter was held to just two points in the first, he
stormed back with 13 straight points in the second quarter, all of
them coming on long jumpers to give Toronto a 41-22 lead with 4:52
left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' 27 points was the lowest first-half total by an
opponent in Raptors history.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't get any better for the Knicks, who fell behind by
26 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   New York began a 6-0 run with 4:26 left in the quarter to make
it 59-39, but Ewing had his shot blocked by McGrady and Latrell
Sprewell missed a wide-open dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Carter then scored on a layup, ending the Knicks' only challenge
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell had only six points for New York on 3-of-13 shooting.
Marcus Camby had 11 points and 12 rebounds but four turnovers, and
Kurt Thomas had 11 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   New York had 19 turnovers to Toronto's five and shot a miserable
11-of-19 from the line.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Knicks' lowest output this season was 70 in Toronto on
Feb. 15. They scored 25 in the second half of that game. ... Doug
Christie did not play for the fifth straight game but is expected
to be back on Sunday against the Bulls. ... Kevin Willis returned
to the lineup after missing one game with a sore knee. ... The
Knicks visit Cleveland on Saturday. ... Camby, who was drafted by
the Raptors in 1996, was booed when he entered the game with 3:12
left in the first quarter. ... Carter didn't get his first basket
until 32.9 seconds remained in the first quarter. ... The Knicks'
11 points was the lowest first-quarter output by a Raptor opponent
this season. ... Knicks forward John Wallace was activated off the
injured list before the game and guard Brandon Williams was
released.

<HEADLINE> Hornets 109, Bucks 106, OT  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Eddie Jones hit seven 3-pointers, including one
that tied the game with 23.9 seconds left in regulation, as the
Charlotte Hornets took away Milwaukee's grip on a playoff spot with
a 109-106 overtime victory over the Bucks on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte had just one basket in the final 4:48 of regulation as
Milwaukee erased an 11-point deficit with an energetic rally. Glenn
Robinson, who had a season-high 38 points, hit two difficult
jumpers in the final 1:09 and gave Milwaukee a 93-90 lead with 36
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones, who led the Hornets with 29 points, hit a long
3-pointer to tie the score at 93. Robinson missed a jumper with two
seconds left, and Scott Williams' tip at the buzzer hung on the rim
before falling off.
</P>
<P>
   In overtime, Charlotte grabbed four offensive rebounds and David
Wesley hit two quick jumpers. Jones then hit another 3-pointer, and
Elden Campbell added two dunks as the Hornets went up 106-99.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Thomas hit two straight 3-pointers in the final 30 seconds
to make it close, but Wesley made two free throws with 6.6 seconds
left and Ray Allen missed a 3-pointer as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was discouraging for Milwaukee (39-40), which began the
night with the same record as the Orlando Magic and a tiebreaker
over the Magic by virtue of their three wins over Orlando this
season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bucks' loss and Orlando's 96-88 victory over the New
Jersey Nets put the Magic (40-39) one game in front of Milwaukee
for the eighth seed. Both teams have three games left, including a
head-to-head meeting Monday night at Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte (46-33), which won for the 11th time in 13 games,
erased a 16-point first-half deficit and remained a game behind
Philadelphia for the fourth seed in the East. All five Hornets
starters scored in double figures as their bench played just eight
minutes and scored two points after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks were down 86-75 with 5:47 left, but an arguing
technical foul on Campbell kick-started a frantic 18-4 Milwaukee
rally. The Bucks went up by three points when Robinson, who had 24
points in the second half and overtime, hit another jumper over
Anthony Mason with 36 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee, which had its three-game winning streak snapped, got
26 points from Allen and 16 points and 11 assists from Sam Cassell.
The Bucks have not won four straight games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley had 24 points for Charlotte. Derrick Coleman added 10
points and 12 rebounds, and Campbell finished with 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's poise and proficiency disappeared in the third
quarter as Charlotte began the second half with a 23-7 run. Coleman
had eight points during the run, and the Hornets took a 77-67 lead
entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jones was 7-of-12 on 3-pointers. ... Instead of deflecting
an attempted entry pass by Cassell in the fourth quarter, Jones
leaped up and cleanly caught it out of the air. Jones then drove
downcourt and passed to Baron Davis, whose layup gave Charlotte an
84-72 lead with 8:01 left. ... Mason and Bucks assistant coach
Terry Stotts exchanged angry words shortly before the Hornets put
the game away in the overtime. Stotts, the Bucks' defensive guru,
designed a physical game plan against Mason, who had 18 points.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Change Advance Scout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Tim Johnson, former manager of the Toronto Blue
Jays, resigned as the Milwaukee Brewers' major league advance scout
Friday and was replaced by Elanis Westbrooks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was for personal reasons,'' Brewers general manager Dean
Taylor said. ''He said the scouting job put a lot of stress on his
family life. He also expressed some feelings that he wanted to try
to get back on the field. That's where his heart is.''
</P>
<P>
   Westbrooks, 34, was the advance scout for the Colorado Rockies
in 1999 and was hired by the Brewers during the offseason to serve
as a pro scout.
</P>
<P>
   He begins his new duties immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrooks was an outfielder in the San Francisco organization
from 1987-90 after being selected in the 47th round of the 1987
June draft.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson played five seasons with the Brewers before becoming
manager of the Blue Jays, who fired him in March 1999 after it was
discovered he lied about serving in Vietnam with the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto replaced Johnson with Jim Fregosi. Toronto general
manager Gord Ash said the controversy over Johnson's military
service was a distraction to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson never saw combat but supposedly made up stories to
inspire the team. He taught mortar training to recruits going to
Vietnam but never served there.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson apologized to the team. The Blue Jays went 88-74 and
finished third in the AL East in Johnson's only season as a major
league manager.

<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Erick Strickland scored 15 of his 21 points while
Dallas was rolling to a 23-point halftime lead and the Mavericks
continued their strong finish with a 117-103 victory over the
Seattle SuperSonics on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Ceballos had 19 points and nine rebounds in 17 minutes,
Michael Finley scored 18 points, and Greg Buckner had 17 off the
bench for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nash's 12 points and 10 points each from Dirk Nowitzki and
Sean Rooks helped Dallas win for the sixth time in seven games and
13th in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland converted seven of eight first-half field goal
attempts and the Mavericks made six 3-pointers to take early
control against the lethargic SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker's 25 points, Lazaro Borrell's 15 and Gary Payton's 12
paced the SuperSonics, who've lost four of five.

   The Mavericks surged to a 73-50 halftime lead, Dallas'
highest-scoring half of the season. Dallas made 13 straight from
the field during one stretch in the first half and sank 28 of its
first 38 field goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas led by as many as 27 in the second quarter and shot 67
percent (31-for-46) in the first half as Buckner scored 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks maintained their intensity after halftime and took
a 105-73 lead into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach Don Nelson sat his starters for most of the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mavericks center Shawn Bradley did not play. Bradley was
serving a one-game league suspension for an altercation in Thursday
night's 111-102 defeat at Houston. Bradley was suspended and fined
$10,000 for initiating a fight with a flagrant elbow to the side of
the head of Walt Williams of the Rockets. Williams was suspended
for a game and fined $5,000. ... Ceballos started for Bradley as
Nelson went with a small lineup. Ceballos had missed nine of the
previous 10 games due to a broken pinkie on his left hand. ... The
73 points allowed in the first half were the most by the Sonics in
any half this season.

<HEADLINE> Essence Magazine Turns 30  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Famous faces crowded into Radio City Music Hall
Friday to wish Essence magazine a happy 30th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey and Bill Cosby were the hosts of the black-tie
bash, where Essence awards were presented to black Americans who
have worked to improve their communities and the world.
</P>
<P>
   The honorees were Michael Jordan, actor Danny Glover, the mayor
of a tiny Georgia town, a Texas couple who have arranged more than
100 adoptions and three doctors who teach city kids to follow their
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here to make a joyful noise,'' Winfrey exulted. ''We're
here to celebrate 30 years of building a better world, and we've
got cause to celebrate. ... What other magazine has documented the
progress of so many pioneering black women?''
</P>
<P>
   Glover, honored for his years of political activism at home and
overseas, spoke about AIDS in Africa and elsewhere after accepting
his award from actors Susan Sarandon, Delroy Lindo and Omar Epps.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was reluctant to receive this award, in part because I feel
there's so much more that I can and should be doing,'' he said.
''There are no continents or communities that remain unaffected (by
AIDS). It's only a matter of degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton turned up to give an award to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Not THAT mayor -- her likely Senate opponent, New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani. She honored Emma Gresham of Keysville, Ga., where
City Hall is a small mobile home and Gresham has rallied the town's
400 residents to get basic services like indoor plumbing, garbage
pickup, a medical clinic and a fire department.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. W.C. Martin and Donna Martin were cited for arranging
the adoptions of more than 100 orphaned and foster children by
members of the Bennett Chapel Baptist Church in Shelbyville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Three doctors who grew up together in Newark, N.J. -- George
Jenkins, Rameck Hunt and Sampson Davis -- got Essence awards for
their efforts to encourage young people to overcome the challenges
of poverty and stick to their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The show is to air May 25 on Fox.

<HEADLINE> 76ers 104, Hawks 92  </HEADLINE>
By ED SHEARER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Allen Iverson scored 27 points and Tyrone Hill
added 20 points and 10 rebounds as the Philadelphia 76ers beat the
Atlanta Hawks 104-92 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third victory in a row and the fifth in six games for
the Sixers, who handed Atlanta its season-high ninth straight loss
while sweeping the four-game season series.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Geiger came off the bench to add 18 points and Theo Ratliff
had 13 points and 13 rebounds for the Sixers, who never trailed
after Geiger hit a turn-around 10-footer for a 31-29 lead with 8:57
left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Terry led the Hawks with 20 points and Dikembe Mutombo
added 16 points with 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson scored 18 in the first half when Philadelphia built a
53-45 lead, and the Sixers then took control in the third quarter
as Hill and Ratliff each scored six in a 15-4 run that created the
biggest lead of the night, 72-51 on a dunk by Hill with 4:42 left
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc added 12 points and seven assists for the 76ers,
while Dion Glover had 12 and Jimmy Jackson 11 for the Hawks. Terry
scored 14 in the final 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Iverson was the leading scorer in each of the Sixers' four
victories over the Hawks this season, getting 31, 25 and 30 in the
three previous wins. ... It was the first time since the 1990-91
season that Philadelphia swept the season series from the Hawks.
... Atlanta's 26-53 record is its worst since the team moved to
Atlanta from St. Louis in 1968. ... Mutombo's 41 minutes of action
pushed him over the 25,000 mark in minutes played for his career,
going to 25,025.

<HEADLINE> Judge Closes Horse-Shooting Hearing  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. (AP) -- More than a year after three men were
accused of killing 30 wild horses, a judge cleared the way Friday
for their trial in the death of only one mustang.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Michael Griffin refused a request to dismiss the lone
count remaining against two ex-Marines and their former high school
buddy.
</P>
<P>
   While setting a Monday trial date, the judge expressed concern
about the ability to seat an impartial jury in the highly
publicized case and said he might be forced to move the trial to
another county.
</P>
<P>
   Former Lance Cpls. Darien Brock and Scott Brendle and Reno
construction worker Anthony Merlino were charged with killing more
than two dozen wild horses in the hills near Reno in December 1998.
But last month Griffin dismissed all but one charge, citing a lack
of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin ruled Friday that there was no serious violation of the
suspects' Miranda rights when they were questioned by
investigators. He says with only one slight exception all their
statements were voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday on the charge of
killing one horse, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of
up to one year in a county jail and a $2,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's ruling came after he rejected media objections and
closed a hearing on a motion to suppress partial confessions by
each of the three defendants.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged he was taking an unusual step -- closing a
hearing for only the third time in 20 years on the bench -- but said
opening it to the public would further jeopardize his ability to
seat a jury and ensure the defendants' right to a fair trial in
this tiny tourist community.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said Friday that he had received more than 200 letters
criticizing him for dismissing most of the charges. ''There are
strong opinions about wild horses on the range in this area,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 7, Royals 5  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Roger Clemens, struggling with his control,
became the first Yankees starter other than Orlando Hernandez to
win, and New York stopped the streaking Kansas City Royals 7-5
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (1-1) went to three-ball counts on 10 of 28 batters,
including five of his first eight, throwing 104 pitches, 53 of them
balls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he improved to 19-7 against Kansas City, allowing five
runs, seven hits and four walks in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada hit a game-tying, two-run homer in the second,
Ricky Ledee put the Yankees ahead 3-2 with an RBI double in the
third. Bernie Williams chased Jay Witasick (0-3) with a two-run
double in the fourth -- a pop down the third-base line that third
baseman Joe Randa pulled off of, allowing it to drop between
himself and shortstop Rey Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter's two-run single off Brad Rigby put the Yankees up
7-3 in the fifth, but Gregg Zaun hit a two-run homer off Clemens in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees lead the AL East at 6-3, ''El Duque'' (2-0)
has been their only consistent starter. Clemens and David Cone have
stumbled, and Andy Pettitte is on the disabled list with a strained
back muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens repeatedly got himself into trouble on a night there
were just two 1-2-3 innings -- Kansas City in the third and ninth.
He gave up a two-out, two-run single in the second to Sanchez, the
Royals' No. 9 hitter, hanging his head as he walked off the mound
following the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens also threw a wild pitch in the fifth that allowed
Sanchez to score from third. He hit Mike Sweeney in the arm with a
pitch and nearly hit Randa in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, at 8-3 off to its best start in 22 years, came in
after a homestand that ended with four wins, three on last-inning
homers followed by another on a final-swing single.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson followed Clemens and struck out four in 1 2-3
innings, including Randa to end the seventh with runners on second
and third.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera retired pinch-hitter Scott Pose to escape a
second-and-third, two-out jam in the eighth and converted his 27th
consecutive save chance, his fifth this season.
</P>
<P>
   Witasick, who has lost four straight starts dating to last
season, was chased after 3 2-3 innings -- needing 101 pitches to get
those 11 outs. He allowed five runs and seven hits, including his
fifth homer, the 22nd off the Royals in 12 games. Only the Cubs,
with 23, have given up more.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Yankees have homered in eight of nine games this
season. ... The Royals had been 12-for-12 on stolen-base attempts
until Carlos Febles was thrown out at second by Posada in the first
inning. ... Chuck Knoblauch, who popped to third with the bases
loaded and one out in the fifth, has no RBIs in 41 plate
appearances this season. He made his second error, fumbling an
eighth-inning grounder. ... Rigby and teammate Jeff Suppan also
have allowed five homers each. Despite giving up two runs in two
innings, Rigby's ERA dropped from 18.69 to 15.63. ... Clemens tied
Vic Willis for 39th on the career list with 248 wins. Bob Gibson is
next at 251. ... Zaun left in the seventh with a sprained right
elbow after throwing out Shane Spencer at second. Zaun appeared to
get hit in the arm by the bat on Clay Bellinger's follow through.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Hoops Hit With Subpoenas  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The University of Minnesota has been
subpoenaed to provide information about academic fraud in the men's
basketball program and former star Bobby Jackson's eligibility and
courses.
</P>
<P>
   The university was ordered to appear Tuesday at the U.S.
courthouse in Minneapolis with documentation about academic fraud.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney B. Todd Jones confirmed an ''ongoing
investigation'' but would not give details Friday. Subpoenas are
secret unless recipients publicize them. Prosecutors seek subpoenas
when they determine probable cause exists.
</P>
<P>
   One of the university's two subpoenas, dated April 6, asked for
all documents given to the law firm that conducted the university's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The other subpoena asked for information about whether Jackson
was eligible when he transferred from Western Nebraska Community
College and information about two correspondence courses he took at
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who plays for the Minnesota Timberwolves and was in
Vancouver for a game Friday night, said he was more concerned about
basketball than any possible legal troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't worry about that right now,'' he told KMWB-TV, which
broadcasts Wolves' games. ''I have to worry about the Timberwolves.
We're going into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   University lawyer Mark Rotenberg said the university plans to
cooperate fully. But he criticized federal prosecutors for pursuing
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're of the view that this is an unusual step,'' Rotenberg
said. ''The university has publicly stated before that academic
misconduct is an academic matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson may have mailed coursework in two history classes to a
university instructor. College of Liberal Arts spokeswoman Eugenia
Smith said she didn't know whether Jackson took the classes while
enrolled at the university or before transferring from Western
Nebraska. Anyone is eligible for a ''distance education'' course,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena asks for information about academic fraud from 1990
until now.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Zamansky, attorney for former head coach Clem Haskins, said
Haskins had not received a subpoena. Jan Gangelhoff, a former tutor
who admitted she wrote papers for players, was not subpoenaed, said
her attorney, Jim Lord.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg also said university officials told Haskins they might
sue him to recover at least some of the $1.5 million contract
buyout he received last year.
</P>
<P>
   The university started a seven-month investigation last year
when allegations surfaced of academic cheating in the program. A
1,000-page report concluded 34 of 50 allegations were true.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight of those involved at least one violation of NCAA
rules during nearly a decade when Haskins was the coach. The report
concluded Haskins knew about the fraud, lied to investigators and
told his players to lie after the wrongdoing was exposed. Haskins
has denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the university announced it would eliminate six
scholarships, pay back money to the NCAA and reduce recruiting as
part of self-imposed sanctions on its basketball program. It
earlier banned the team from postseason play for one year and put
itself on indefinite probation.
</P>
<P>
   The school still faces possible NCAA sanctions. Tonya Moten
Brown, the university's vice president for administration, said she
informed the NCAA of the subpoenas but doesn't expect them to
affect the pace of the NCAA's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for a public university to face a criminal
investigation when academic misconduct is involved.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Andre Deutsch, the British publisher who brought
out Norman Mailer's ''The Naked and the Dead,'' died Monday. He was
82.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Deutsch went to work for Nicholson and Watson,
but the firm's reluctance to publish George Orwell's ''Animal
Farm'' encouraged Deutsch to venture out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   He set up his own publishing house in 1945 under the name Allen
Wingate.
</P>
<P>
   The firm experienced immediate success with the publication of
''Operation Cicero,'' a book about a butler who had acted as a
German spy in the British embassy in Turkey during the war. But it
was the publication of Mailer's ''The Naked and the Dead'' in 1949
that cemented Deutsch's reputation.
Virginia Rymer Frear:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Virginia Rymer Frear, the widow of the
longtime editor of the Bedford Gazette who ran the newspaper during
World War II, died Thursday. She was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Frear took over as editor from 1943 to 1945, when her husband
volunteered to serve in the Navy on the aircraft carrier Bon Homme
Richard in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The Frear family sold the 10,000-circulation paper last month,
and George Sample III became its principal owner.
Hugo Germino:
</P>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Hugo Germino, a former sports editor who
spent more than 40 years with The Durham Sun, died Thursday of
cancer. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   The Durham Sun and the Durham Morning Herald combined in 1991 to
become The Herald-Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include two brothers, three children, nine
grandchildren, six great grandchildren and one great-great
grandchild.
Arnold H. Johnson:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Arnold H. Johnson, who starred in the
1969 film ''Putney Swope'' and was a regular on the television
series ''Sanford and Son,'' died Monday. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared in several other television shows, including
''Good Times,'' ''The Jeffersons,'' ''Highway to Heaven'' and
''Matlock.''
</P>
<P>
   He was cast as Swope in the Robert Downey-directed comedy
''Putney Swope,'' about blacks taking over a Madison Avenue
advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Norman Lear brought Johnson to Los Angeles for a
running role as George Hutton in the ''Sanford and Son'' sitcom,
which ran from 1972 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He also played a patient in ''A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a
Sandwich,'' a bum in ''Honky Tonk Freeway,'' a tattoo artist in
''Racing With the Moon,'' an inmate in ''Weeds,'' a butler in
''Sunset,'' a janitor in ''The Seventh Sign'' and Grandpapa in
''Menace II Society.''
Bruce Lincoln:
</P>
<P>
   DEKALB, Ill. (AP) -- Bruce Lincoln, a Northern Illinois
University historian whose books about Russians and their history
were widely praised, died Sunday of cancer. He was 61.
</P>
<P>
   Each of his dozen books -- which include ''Red Victory: A History
of the Russian Civil War'' and ''Between Heaven and Hell: The Story
of a Thousand Years of Artistic Life in Russia'' -- have sold more
than 100,000 copies.
Jerry Mead:
</P>
<P>
   CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- Jerry Mead, who parlayed his love for
wine into a career as a columnist on the subject and an advocate
for the beverage, died Wednesday of congestive heart failure. He
was 60.
</P>
<P>
   Mead wrote a weekly column on wine and was editor of The Wine
Trader Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Mead, who wrote the nationally syndicated column ''Mead on
Wine,'' had his own judging system that included not only quality
but price.
Daniel H. Thomas:
</P>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Senior U.S. District Judge Daniel H. Thomas,
who was known for his handling of cases in maritime law during a
lengthy career on the bench, died Thursday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   President Truman appointed Thomas to the federal bench in the
Southern District of Alabama in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   He developed a national reputation for presiding over admiralty
trials, including the trial that followed a March 1980 incident
when a ship struck the Tampa Bay Bridge, causing 35 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   His rulings on voter discrimination and the desegregation of
public transportation and schools helped bring about desegregation
in south Alabama, said Alex F. Lankford III, the judge's first law
clerk and now president of the Mobile Bar Association.
Albert Turner Sr.,
</P>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. (AP) -- Albert Turner Sr., a civil rights activist
who led the mule wagon that carried the body of Martin Luther King
Jr. at his funeral, died Thursday while awaiting surgery. He was
64.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was Alabama field secretary for the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference in 1965, when he helped lead the aborted
Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march that was blocked by
stick-swinging state troopers. The day came to be known as ''Bloody
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, Turner was among a group of civil rights
workers put on trial on federal charges of voter fraud in west
Alabama, where activists claimed Republicans were trying to
diminish black voting. Turner was found innocent.
James Charles Wingard:
</P>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- James Charles ''Bud'' Wingard, long-time
head writer for the television country variety show ''Hee Haw,''
died Wednesday. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   Wingard was a cosmetics executive in California in the late
1960s when he decided to move to Nashville to be a singer. His
career stalled, so he went to Archie Campbell, who later became a
''Hee Haw'' regular, for advice. Campbell asked Wingard if he could
write jokes and Wingard fibbed and said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Wingard went on to lead a team of writers who turned out 2,000
jokes a year for the likes of Grandpa Jones, Junior Samples,
Campbell and Roy Clark.

<HEADLINE> NHL Statement on Disputed Goal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The full text of a statement released Friday
night by the National Hockey League about a disputed goal in Game 2
of the Buffalo-Philadelphia first-round series:
</P>
<P>
   Following a goal scored by Philadelphia's John LeClair at 4:53
of the second period, series supervisor John D'Amico, along with
video goal judge Mike Condon, commenced an immediate review to
determine if the goal was a ''good goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Two different camera angles were utilized and replayed -- the
regular game-action angle and the overhead camera angle. The first
angle showed that the puck appeared to enter the net between
goaltender Dominik Hasek's pad and the left goal post. The second
camera angle (overhead) showed the puck appeared to enter the net
off the left post and go in.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the determination was made by the series supervisor and
video goal judge that this was a good goal. Also, to note, the
referees believed this to be a good goal.
</P>
<P>
   The puck was dropped and play resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately five minutes of playing time elapsed when it was
pointed out to the video goal judge that the ESPN net camera replay
showed that the puck appeared to enter the net on the outside of
the left post (through the mesh). This camera angle is not
available to the video replay booth.
</P>
<P>
   The series supervisor then reviewed the overhead angle again and
it became apparent, when supported by the net camera angle, that
the puck had entered the net on the outside of the post.
</P>
<P>
   NHL video replay procedures do not allow for a decision to be
reversed after the ruling has been made and, as such, the goal was
allowed to stand.
</P>
<P>
   It should be also noted that the net was checked per NHL
procedure -- before the game and following each period. No holes
were detected.
</P>

Miami Relatives Respond in Elian Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives claimed tonight that the boy
would be psychologically harmed if he were turned over immediately to his
father. Relatives said they were willing to bring Elian to a meeting with his
father, but only within close driving distance of Miami so as not to traumatize
him. The U.S. government had asked a federal appeals panel to order Elian's
great-uncle to turn the 6-year-old Cuban refugee over to his father. The Justice
Department said Lazaro Gonzalez should receive no help from a court until he

Russia Lawmakers OK START II
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- As Russian lawmakers approved the START II treaty to scrap
thousands of U.S. and Russian nuclear warheads, the government warned it would
abandon all arms-control pacts if Washington goes ahead with an anti-missile
system. The swift approval of START II was President Vladimir Putin's first
major foreign policy action and underlined his strong authority and the
willingness of the new centrist majority in parliament to work with the
government. Putin warned that Moscow would pull out of arms agreements if the
United States breaches the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

Clinton Hits GOP on Education, Tax
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton accused Republicans today of shortchanging
schools to pay for huge tax cuts and said Americans should look at the GOP's
budget and ask, ''How does all this add up?'' ''I think it's wrong to spend
about $100 of the surplus on tax cuts for every $1 you spend on education,''
Clinton told reporters, university spokesmen and others at a gathering of the
Education Writers Association. The House and Senate approved a $1.83 trillion
package yesterday that includes big tax cuts as well as reductions in many
domestic programs.

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The Florida Supreme Court today voided most of a
new law intended to speed death penalty appeals but promised to address the
issue itself. The justices unanimously found that parts of the Death Penalty
Reform Act of 2000, which was passed during a special legislative session in
January, violate the separation of powers clause in the Florida Constitution.
Only the judicial branch of government has the power to make court rules, the

<HEADLINE> Mets 8, Pirates 5, 12 innings  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Mike Piazza homered twice in his first career
five-hit game and Melvin Mora had a go-ahead, two-run single in the
12th inning as the New York Mets, shrugging off yet another
controversy, beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 8-5 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets outhit the Pirates 20-11, but didn't win it until Mora
followed Rey Ordonez's single and Benny Agbayani's bad-hop double
with a bloop single to center off Jose Silva (2-1).
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who had homered in the seventh, followed with his third
homer of the season and 19th of his career against Pittsburgh. He
went 5-for-6 with two homers, a double and four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings for the victory
after Armando Benitez blew his first save opportunity of the season
and a 4-3 lead in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza and Robin Ventura homered on consecutive pitches off
Jason Schmidt to put the Mets ahead 4-2 in the seventh, but their
usually reliable bullpen couldn't hold it.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Young, 0-for-15 until he doubled in the fourth, hit his
first homer in the eighth off Al Leiter. The Mets starter, who
began the game with an 0.94 ERA against Pittsburgh, yielded three
runs, two earned, in 7 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez, 3-for-3 previously in save opportunities, struck out
the first two batters in the ninth. But Jason Kendall, whose
game-winning single capped a two-run game-winning rally in the
ninth Thursday against Montreal, doubled and Pat Meares tripled to
tie it.
</P>
<P>
   The extra-inning victory came amid the Mets' latest distraction
-- inflammatory comments reportedly made several days ago by manager
Bobby Valentine concerning some of general manager Steve Phillips'
personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips flew to Pittsburgh and met briefly with Valentine, then
said he was ''surprised and curious'' about the comments. They also
were to meet after the game, although Phillips said the manager's
job wasn't in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza broke a 2-all tie in the seventh by hitting a hanging
breaking ball from Schmidt over the right-field wall for his second
homer.
</P>
<P>
   With Schmidt clearly tiring, Ventura followed on the next pitch
with another drive to right for his first homer -- the first time he
has left the park since his grand slam-turned single to beat the
Braves in Game 5 of the 1999 National League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates normally have a 100-pitch limit for their starters
early in the season, but Schmidt threw 139 pitches before being
lifted after seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Wil Cordero hit his first Pirates homer in the second.
The Mets tied it in the third on Edgardo Alfonzo's sacrifice fly,
then took a 2-1 lead in the fifth on Alfonzo's triple that fell
between left fielder Cordero and center fielder Chad Hermansen and
Piazza's double.
Notes: Piazza is a .358 career hitter against Pittsburgh. ...
Schmidt is 0-2 in three starts after going 3-1 last April. ...
Alfonzo was 0-for-11 until he tripled and Ordonez was 0-for-24
until he singled in the fourth. ... Cordero's homer was the first
run the Pirates have scored for Schmidt this season. ... Franco hit
Meares in the top of the helmet in the 11th, causing a loud thud
that could be heard around the ballpark. But Meares stayed down for
only a few seconds before taking first. ... Silva has gotten the
decision in the Pirates' last three games.

<HEADLINE> Twins 10, Orioles 9  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Cal Ripken moved within three hits of 3,000,
but the Minnesota Twins rallied for six runs in the eighth inning
to defeat the Baltimore Orioles 10-9 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken went 1-for-4 with a sacrifice fly and Mike Bordick, Jeff
Conine and Delino DeShields homered off Eric Milton.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, however, snapped a five-game losing streak and an
eight-game skid to the Orioles dating to last year when they
rallied from a 9-4 deficit in the eighth. Baltimore lost its fourth
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   After the Twins loaded the bases off Chuck McElroy, Al Reyes
gave up a pair of two-run doubles, to Matthew LeCroy and Torii
Hunter, as Minnesota pulled to 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Groom (0-1) replaced him and gave up an RBI single to
Cristian Guzman that tied it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Matt Lawton's sacrifice fly to left scored pinch-runner
Jason Maxwell for a 10-9 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Redman (1-0) got the final out in the eighth -- on one pitch
-- for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Guardado pitched the ninth for his first save. Albert
Belle opened with a walk but was picked off for the second out, and
Ripken grounded out to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's single in the second inning gave him 2,997 career hits
in his quest to become the 24th player to collect 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The sparse crowd of 15,249 at the Metrodome booed when Ripken
fouled out to first base in the fourth inning and again in the
fifth, when Ripken was robbed by left fielder Jacque Jones' leaping
catch at the wall.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff went 4-for-4 and scored on Ripken's line-drive
sacrifice fly to center field off Bob Wells in the seventh that
made it 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mercedes gave up four earned runs on eight hits in six
innings. He allowed a sacrifice fly to LeCroy in the second, a
two-run triple to Hunter in the fourth and an RBI single to David
Ortiz in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Milton, who took a perfect game into the seventh inning at
Kansas City on Saturday, struggled through five innings,
surrendering six earned runs on nine hits. He had never given up
more than two homers in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Milton gave up a three-run homer to Bordick, his fourth, in the
second inning. Conine's solo shot, his first of the year, made it
4-1 in the fourth, and DeShields' first homer of the season made it
5-3 in the fifth. Harold Baines added an RBI single before Ripken
lined out to left for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, LaTroy Hawkins gave up a single to Conine and a
double to Charles Johnson. A wild pitch scored one run and Rich
Amaral's single scored another to make it 8-3.
Notes: Baltimore came into the Metrodome after losing three in a
row at Kansas City. In those games, the Orioles gave up the winning
run in the bottom of the ninth, the 12th and the ninth. ... Bordick
has hit in all 10 of the Orioles' games. ... With one out in the
third, Belle hit a bloop to center field, but Hunter threw out
Surhoff at second, leaving Belle with a fielder's choice instead of
a single.

<HEADLINE> Cook To Pay Ex-Campaign Manager  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT GEHRKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Rep. Merrill Cook must pay a former
consultant $174,471 for debts incurred during his 1996 campaign, a
jury found Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claimed victory after the jury awarded R.T. Nielson
all of the $193,992 he sought in his lawsuit, but ordered the
consultant to repay Cook, R-Utah, $19,521 for double billings and
excessive markups.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you walked out of here with a net ruling of $175,000, I'd
call that a victory,'' said Russell Fericks, Nielson's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Nielson sued Cook two months after his 1996 election, claiming
Cook had orally agreed to boost Nielson's pay, then reneged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's very unfortunate we had to go to court,'' Nielson
said. ''I feel we got a just verdict. ... I'm just very relieved
it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook, who was in a court hallway when the verdict announced,
claimed the oral agreements never existed. He said he had no
regrets fighting the three-year court battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have come out better today, but it's not all that
bad,'' said Cook. ''Sometimes you have to stand up and continue to
fight for the things you believe in, despite political or personal
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict comes at a bad time for Cook, whose grip on the 2nd
District seat was already shaky after reports in the past year of
erratic behavior, mood swings and staff mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   He is being targeted by national Democratic groups and will face
two Republican challengers at the state party convention on May 6.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Within Three Hits of 3,000  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Cal Ripken says chasing 3,000 hits is harder
than chasing Lou Gehrig.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little bit more nerve wracking, I guess,'' Ripken said.
''At least the games just came and added up each time. Getting a
hit requires you to go out and get a hit. You have to do something.
You can't just show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, who broke Gehrig's consecutive games streak five seasons
ago, is three hits shy of becoming the 24th member of baseball's
3,000-hit club after going 1-for-4 Friday night at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken started the season nine hits shy of the milestone but has
just six hits in his first 34 at-bats, a .176 average.
</P>
<P>
   He said the pressure of the chase is giving him the jitters, the
last thing a hitter needs when he's at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your excitement level gets up inside, and the secret of
hitting is to try to control that and relax -- and maybe the secret
in athletics is to be able to control that and let your talent come
through,'' Ripken said. ''But it's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken said he didn't know if he'd play all three games of the
series, but it's possible that if he hasn't reached the mark by
Saturday, he'll sit out Sunday's game so he can get hit No. 3,000
at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles manager Mike Hargrove is giving Ripken regular days off
each week because of his bad back. Ripken said he feels fine but
the Metrodome's turf could take its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to play every game the rest of the year,'' said
Ripken, who holds the mark with 2,632 consecutive game played
between 1982-98. ''The way I played all those games all those years
was just to show up and say, 'I'm ready to play today.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken said he'd prefer to get his 3,000th hit at home but he's
not about to get picky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to leave here with eight hits in this series,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken said a stream of fans went up to him at breakfast Friday
to encourage him, and he appreciates the support. It's just that he
can never get away from the chase.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City this week, fans constantly yelled encouragement
when he stepped on deck.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all positive,'' Ripken said. ''But, again, I'm trying to
think, 'OK, what's the pitcher got? What's he going to throw? What
am I going to do? What am I going to look for?'''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Molitor, a member of the 3,000 hit club and a Twins coach,
said the adrenaline rush Ripken is experiencing as he closes in on
the mark is natural.
</P>
<P>
   ''But what's good about a milestone like 3,000 is that most
players who get to that mark have had to deal with those things in
the past,'' Molitor said. ''Cal in particular has had very
emotional games in the past few years.''

<HEADLINE> Nuggets 105, Warriors 97  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Raef LaFrentz had 23 points, 12 rebounds and six
blocked shots and Nick Van Exel added 22 points as the Denver
Nuggets beat the Golden State Warriors 105-97 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes, who burned the Nuggets for 44 points on Sunday,
was held to 16 points on 7-for-28 shooting. Mookie Blaylock had 21
points and 10 rebounds for Golden State which lost its eighth
straight road game.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State took a two-point lead into the fourth quarter, but
the Warriors only scored three points in the first 4:30 of the
fourth quarter and trailed 83-82.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Van Exel took over, hitting two 3-pointers and two
free throws over the next three minutes as the Nuggets went ahead
91-86.
</P>
<P>
   James Posey, who had 21 points, hit a short jumper to make it
98-87 with 3:20 to go, and the Warriors were never closer than
eight points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors led by as many as 15 points in the second quarter,
behind a 16-0 run with Adonal Foyle and Sam Jacobson contributing
four points each. Denver ended the drought with a pair of free
throws by McCloud and Van Exel followed with a 3-pointer, to cut
the lead to 42-32.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets drew within 52-51 on a dunk by LaFrentz. Mookie
Blaylock beat the buzzer with a 3-pointer to Golden State a
four-point lead at the half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Golden State is (3-16) on the second night of back-to-back
games. ... No Warrior has played in every game. ... Denver has been
outscored 183-119 in the first quarter of its last six games. ...
Jacobson left the game early in the second quarter after being
elbowed in the face by Denver's Chris Gatling and never returned.
... Denver has connected on 447 3-pointers, second most in
franchise history to the 636 in 1996-97.

<HEADLINE> Texas Inmate Gives Up After Standoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMARILLO, Texas (AP) -- A Texas prison inmate who took a
correctional officer hostage surrendered to prison officials after
a seven-hour standoff Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was not hurt. She stepped out, she took a deep breath, and
now she is with her family,'' said Texas Department of Criminal
Justice spokesman Larry Todd.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate, Charles Lamon Polk, demanded to speak with his
daughter after taking guard Heather Wheeler into a room in the
kitchen area about 2:30 p.m., prison system spokesman Glen
Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear if he had a weapon and how he got the officer
into the room. Polk talked with negotiators through a steel door,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Polk surrendered at 9:35 p.m. and was handcuffed and taken to a
cell, Todd said. Polk has been in the prison since 1989 on a
25-year sentence for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had nothing to say when he came out,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the second of its kind in as many months.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 21, two armed death-row inmates used homemade weapons to
hold a guard hostage in a prison near Livingston. The 57-year-old
guard was released unharmed after 13 hours.

   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Brewers placed Henry Blanco on the 15-day
disabled list Friday with a lacerated right index finger.
</P>
<P>
   Blanco, acquired during the offseason from the Colorado Rockies
in a trade for Jeff Cirillo and Scott Karl, needed eight stitches

Triple-A Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Casanova was hitting .320 in six games with one home run and six
RBIs through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Casanova on the 40-man roster, the Brewers
moved pitcher Kyle Peterson to the 60-day DL. Peterson originally

<HEADLINE> Rockies 6, Cardinals 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Pedro Astacio pitched 7 1-3 solid innings and the
Colorado Rockies backed him with three home runs to beat the St.
Louis Cardinals 6-2 Friday night for their third straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio (1-2) allowed just four hits and two runs. He struck out
eight against a lineup missing Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was examined for lingering back pain by team physician
Dr. George Paletta, and no new disc injury was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was treated for inflammation and will rest and receive
therapy in St. Louis. He will be re-evaluated Monday to determine
his playing status.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs by Jeff Cirillo, Scott Servais and Mike Lansing -- all
off Rick Ankiel (1-1) -- gave the Rockies an early 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Brian Hunter singled and scored on Cirillo's first
homer for the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Servais got his first hit of the year, a 426-foot solo shot to
left-center in the second. Lansing also hit a solo homer, his
fourth, in the third.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cardinals' second, J.D. Drew and Craig Paquette both
singled and Eli Marrero had a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Davis hit a 446-foot solo homer to center in the Cardinals
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Both Astacio and Ankiel worked out of jams in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the top half, Fernando Vina reached third on
third baseman Cirillo's three-base throwing error. Edgar Renteria
hit a bouncer to Cirillo, who threw out Vina at home, and Astacio
struck out Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel walked three batters in the Rockies' half, but got Terry
Shumpert on a grounder for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado threatened again in the seventh off Alan Benes, called
up earlier in the day from Triple-A Memphis. With one out, Lansing
singled and Larry Walker was hit by a pitch, but Cirillo then
grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Vina led off the Cardinals eighth with a double and, after a
ground out, Astacio gave way to reliever Mike Myers, who struck out
both Edmonds and Ray Lankford.
</P>
<P>
   Neifi Perez and Scott Servais hit RBI singles in the Rockies
eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cardinals promoted Benes and sent LHP Justin Brunette
to Memphis. ... Walker received a Gold Glove award, his fifth, in a
pregame ceremony. ... Colorado's Terry Shumpert was caught stealing
in the second, ending his club-record streak of stolen bases at 16.
... Cirillo's homer was his seventh hit of the season. His first
six hits all were doubles.
