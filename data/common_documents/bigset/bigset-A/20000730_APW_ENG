Republicans Ready in Philly
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Republicans nailed the final planks into place in George
W. Bush's campaign platform Saturday as delegates flocked to their convention
city, determined to launch the Texas governor on his way to the White House.
''This platform is putting the flesh on compassionate conservatism,'' said
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, echoing a slogan that Bush hopes to ride to
victory this fall. Republicans are conceding no region, no issue and no voter''
in the campaign already unfolding, said host governor Tom Ridge, voicing
optimism that stemmed from polls showing the GOP ticket running ahead of the
Democrats.

Fiji Warns Rebels of Crackdown
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Extending their crackdown on coup supporters, Fiji's
military gave a group of armed rebels holding hostages at a barracks until
midnight Sunday to clear out or face ''drastic action.'' The town of Labasa on
the Fiji's second-largest island of Vanua Levu is one of few remaining pockets
of hardcore support for arrested coup leader George Speight, who is being held
on a prison island while authorities conduct a treason investigation. Around a
dozen rebels have taken over a small military base at Labasa and several times
have taken small groups of ethnic Indians hostage before letting them go. The
group has not made any demands, but their grievances include land claims, the
military said.

U.N. Troops To Deploy in S. Lebanon
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- The Lebanese president has given the go-ahead for
more U.N. troops to deploy along the Lebanese-Israeli border, starting Sunday,
the United Nations said. The deployment will take place in four different
locations, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, said Saturday in a
statement, following consultations between U.N. commanders and Lebanese
officials. It was not immediately clear why the peacekeepers were to take up
positions at only four border points. A possible reason was Lebanon's complaint
that Israel continues to violate a U.N.-drawn border line following its May
withdrawal from south Lebanon.

Arafat Counters 'Israeli Propaganda'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Yasser Arafat initiated a multi-country tour Saturday to drum
up support for the Palestinians in the Middle East peace process, shunning a
warning by President Clinton not to declare an independent state and charging
Israel with spreading lies. Speaking before his departure at the airport in the
Gaza Strip, Arafat said his trip aimed to counter ''Israeli propaganda'' about
why the Camp David summit failed. When the two-week meeting ended Tuesday,
Israel blamed the Palestinians for lacking the flexibility to forge a historic
peace deal at the U.S.-mediated summit.

Evangelicals Open Big Conference
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Rev. Billy Graham, recovering from brain
surgery, was too sick Saturday to deliver opening remarks by satellite TV to a
huge, $40 million evangelical conference, the culmination of years of work by
his ministry. Graham, 81, is in Rochester, Minn., for outpatient therapy at the
Mayo Clinic following an operation to relieve a blockage of fluid to the brain.
He had previously decided not to come to the Netherlands for his Amsterdam 2000
meeting and had planned to address the 10,000 evangelicals long-distance.

Navy Exercises May Include Vieques
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A Navy battleship group is planning exercises
next month likely to include the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, where exercises
last month prompted protests that led to the arrest of more than 100 activists.
The Navy published an environmental impact advisory in local newspapers Saturday
notifying citizens that the USS Harry Truman Battle Group may have ship-to-land
and air-to-land exercises with inert artillery on Vieques between Aug. 3 to Aug.

Concorde Down, Maybe Not Out
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The crash of Air France Flight AF4590 triggered a round of
warnings that the once-glorious Concorde era had ended in an ugly ball of flames
just outside Paris. ''The Mourning of the Concorde'' blared the headline of the
French weekly news magazine Le Point's cover story yesterday. ''The Concorde,
without a doubt, died yesterday,'' the widely read Le Figaro daily lamented in
its pages Wednesday, a day after the crash that killed 114 people. Yet British
Airways put its fleet back into service after a brief pause and French officials
say they haven't made any final decisions on the Concorde.

Chicago Obtains Johnson, Baines
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox enhanced their already potent offense
Saturday night by obtaining catcher Charles Johnson and designated hitter Harold
Baines from the Baltimore Orioles for catcher Brook Fordyce and three minor
league pitchers. The White Sox started the day leading the AL in runs and
batting .290 as a team, just one point behind league-leading Boston. The
addition of Johnson and Baines should make a solid offense even better.

<HEADLINE> Goodson Will Be Waived By Packers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Receiver Tyrone Goodson failed his
physical exam with the Green Bay Packers and will be waived by the
team, probably Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Sherman said Goodson, who reported a week late to
training camp and didn't inform the Packers of his whereabouts
during his absence, will be waived soon.
</P>
<P>
   A Packers spokesman confirmed the team's plan to waive Goodson,
but said it hasn't happened yet.
</P>
<P>
   Goodson signed with the Packers in February 1999, and spent much
of last season on the team's practice squad. He was activated late
in the season after a run of strong performances in practice, but
he didn't catch a pass.
</P>
<P>
   He would have been a candidate for the Packers' No. 4 receiver
job this fall, but he returned from his absence with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the team could release Goodson while he
was injured, a practice generally not permitted in the NFL but
possible under certain circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Obtains Johnson, Baines  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox enhanced their already
potent offense Saturday night by obtaining catcher Charles Johnson
and designated hitter Harold Baines from the Baltimore Orioles for
catcher Brook Fordyce and three minor league pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox started the day leading the AL in runs and batting
.290 as a team, just one point behind league-leading Boston. The
addition of Johnson and Baines should make a solid offense even
better.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives everybody somewhat of a shot in the arm,'' White Sox
manager Jerry Manuel said. ''This should be some help for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is batting .294 with 21 homers and 55 RBIs. Baines, a
left-handed batter, is hitting .266 with 10 homers and 30 RBIs in
72 games.
</P>
<P>
   Even more valuable to the White Sox, though, is Baines and
Johnson's leadership and experience.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox have one of the youngest pitching staffs in the
majors, and a veteran catcher like Johnson -- he was with the
Cleveland Indians for the 1997 World Series -- can help settle any
jitters they might get as they head for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Charles we've gained an All-Star with significant
experience,'' general manager Ron Schueler said. ''He adds a
presence to our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   And after 21 years in the majors, Baines has seen just about
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important,'' Manuel said. ''When you're going
through the little things, like the things we're going through now,
it's somewhat of a calming influence to have one of your peers say
it instead of from a nagging manager.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles earlier in the day traded right-hander reliever Mike
Timlin to the St. Louis Cardinals for first baseman Chris Richard
and minor league pitcher Mark Nussbeck.
</P>
<P>
   With virtually no hope of reaching the playoffs, the Orioles
(44-58) are working toward the future. Baltimore traded Mike
Bordick to the New York Mets on Friday and are trying desperately
to add some pitching to its depleted minor league system.
</P>
<P>
   The three pitchers in the deal are all right-handers: Miguel
Felix, Juan Figueroa and Jason Lakman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think obviously Brook Fordyce is a very good major league
catcher,'' manager Mike Hargrove said. ''Also, the three pitchers
we got in return are very good prospects. You get an immediate
return in that you get a proven major league player, but also you
look at the long term with these three pitchers ... and you can see
where we have a chance to get better as the years come.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of those deals that's good for both teams. The White
Sox get two very good players and we get what we need, also.''
</P>
<P>
   First-place Chicago was delighted to get back Baines, who has
already done two stints with the White Sox, as well as Johnson, who
is known for his prowess behind the plate as well as his talent at
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We needed a left-handed bat,'' Schueler said. ''And Harold is
Mr. White Sox. I've said all along, I've wanted him to finish his
career in Chicago -- whether it be this year or next.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was in his second season with the Orioles after being
acquired December 1, 1998, in a three-team trade from the New York
Mets. He hit his 100th career home run Saturday afternoon against
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   His contract expires after this season, and the Orioles feared
losing him for good.
</P>
<P>
   Fordyce, 30, hit .272 with seven doubles, five homers and 21
RBIs in 39 games for Chicago after starting the season on the
disabled list with a broken foot.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa, a 21-year-old native of the Dominican Republic, is in
his fourth pro season. He was 2-3 with a 3.40 ERA in 10 starts
since moving up to Double-A Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Lakman, 23, is in his sixth pro season. He was 2-2 with one save
and a 4.14 ERA in 27 games for Birmingham this season. He was
primarily a starter until this season; he made 22 relief
appearances to begin the year before starting two of his last five
outings.
</P>
<P>
   Felix, a 23-year-old native of the Dominican Republic, is in his
sixth pro season. He was 0-0 with a 7.64 ERA in 27 relief
appearances at Class A Winston-Salem.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa and Lakman will report to the Orioles' Double-A Bowie
farm team and Felix will report to Class A Frederick.
</P>
<P>
   ''All three pitchers have fine arms, they all have high
up-sides. Figueroa has a chance to pitch in the big leagues by next
September,'' said Syd Thrift, the Orioles vice president of player
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Thrift has made his objective this month to add pitching to a
team that has given up at least 10 runs in 19 games this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had a plan of improving pitching, period, from the major
leagues down,'' he said. ''We've had the development of pitchers in
our minor league system, and the addition of these new pitchers in
recent days puts us in even a stronger position.''

<HEADLINE> Karolyi: Miller Has Good Chance  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Shannon Miller sat on the sidelines Saturday at
the U.S. Gymnastics Championships. It didn't seem to hurt her
chances of making the Olympic team too much.
</P>
<P>
   Still recovering from a hairline crack in her right leg, Miller
performed just one routine, on the uneven bars, in the first round
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She withdrew from Saturday's second round and petitioned for a
spot in the Olympic trials. To hear national team coordinator Bela
Karolyi tell it, the petition is a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking for Shannon to come back and claim her place like
she should, she could and she probably will,'' Karolyi said.
''She's a strong performer, one I would definitely like to see
earning her place on this strong national team.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said it wouldn't be easy, but with her resume, it seems
she'll be difficult to turn down.
</P>
<P>
   She has won seven medals in two trips to the Olympics, making
her America's most-decorated gymnast. She also seems to fit right
into Karolyi's desire to bring a few specialists to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is banking on her strength on the uneven bars. Her 9.650
surely must have helped. It was the only bright spot of a
frustrating week in which she played a waiting game, hoping the
injury would heal in time to compete in all events, but not seeing
that wish come true.
</P>
<P>
   The story played out strangely Thursday night. Miller was forced
to simply touch the apparatus and take scores of 0.00 on the beam,
floor and vault so she could stay eligible for the bars.
</P>
<P>
   She got there and shined.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know her,'' Karolyi said. ''She would be dying to be in
competition. But I was very glad to see her on the first day,
showcasing part of her preparation. Based on that, I can see a very
strong possibility of making the team at the Olympic trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and the others who are petitioning to the trials --
Jeanette Antolin, Amanda Stroud and Jaycie Phelps -- must all show
they are healthy enough to compete at a workout before the trials
at Karolyi's ranch near Houston.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 12, Red Sox 1  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Athletics scored seven runs in the
fifth inning and Kevin Appier scattered four hits over seven
innings as Oakland routed the Boston Red Sox 12-1 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   A's rookie Adam Piatt went 2-for-3, with an RBI single in first
and a three-run homer in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland led 4-0 with the bases loaded and no outs in the fifth
when Terrence Long's grounder down the first-base line was picked
up by Jose Offerman, who overthrew catcher Scott Hatteberg as two
runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Boston starter Jeff Fassero (7-4) was replaced by Bryce Florie,
who gave up a two-run double to Miguel Tejada. An out later,
pinch-hitter Eric Chavez hit an RBI double, then scored on Ryan
Christenson's double.
</P>
<P>
   Christenson scored on Randy Velarde's single to make it 11-0.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero allowed eight runs -- seven earned -- and six hits in
four-plus innings. He walked five and struck out seven. Still one
win away from 100 for his career, Fassero has failed to pitch at
least five innings in five of his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   With the A's up 1-0 in the third inning, Fassero walked Giambi
and Olmedo Saenz. Piatt, recalled from Triple-A Sacramento on July
13 for his second stint in Oakland, hit his third homer.
</P>
<P>
   Appier (9-8) was 0-5 in his previous six starts, matching the
longest losing streak of his career. The last A's pitcher to lose
more than five straight was Tom Candiotti, who lost six in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland went ahead in the first on Piatt's RBI bouncer to left
field.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox avoided the shutout with Bernard Gilkey's RBI
grounder in the eighth inning off Doug Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada added an RBI single in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Red Sox INF Sean Berry, who was designated for
assignment, cleared waivers and was sent outright to Triple-A
Pawtucket.... Mike Lansing, acquired in a seven-player deal with
Colorado on Thursday, was in Boston's lineup on Saturday. ... Setup
man Jim Mecir, who the A's acquired Friday in a trade with Tampa
Bay, was set to arrive in Oakland on Saturday. There was no sign of
him before the game, however. ... To make room for Mecir on the
roster, the A's optioned RHP Ariel Prieto to Triple-A Sacramento.
.. LHP Todd Belitz, also acquired in the Tampa Bay trade, was
optioned to Triple-A Sacramento. ... Massachusetts state lawmakers
gave initial approval Saturday to a financing plan for a $664
million, 44,000-seat stadium for the Red Sox, to be built adjacent
to Fenway Park.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Indianapolis Colts, 13-3 in a magnificent
turnaround last
season, opened the NFL exhibition schedule more closely resembling
the bumblers who went 3-13 in 1998.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two big mistakes proved costly in a 20-13 loss at home to the
Atlanta Falcons. In only other game Saturday night, the New York
Jets beat the New Orleans Saints 24-20 in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Danny Kanell threw for two touchdowns following costly
Indianapolis errors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed like our receivers were able to get open against a
defense that didn't know what was coming,'' said Kanell, who
replaced starter Chris Chandler early in the second quarter and was
9-for-15 for 92 yards. ''Our execution was very good during certain
series. We're only going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   His first touchdown pass, 14 yards to Brian Kozlowski in the
second quarter, was set up when Colts rookie David Macklin bobbled
a punt that the Falcons recovered at the Indianapolis 25.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the score tied midway through the fourth period, a
personal foul on Billy Austin gave Atlanta the ball at the Colts
13, where Kanell passed to Brian Finneran for the winning TD.
Jets 24, Saints 20:
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn Sanders' 1-yard run with 1:17 left capped a 72-yard
touchdown drive led by fellow rookie Chad Pennington as the New
York overcame four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets converted seven of 10 third-down plays and moved the
ball well all night as their three quarterbacks -- Vinny Testaverde,
Ray Lucas and Pennington -- combined to complete 25 of 33 passes.
Patriots:
</P>
<P>
   Second-year backup quarterback Michael Bishop has cult-hero
status with some New England Patriots' faithful. On Monday, he'll
get the chance to make new head coach Bill Belichick a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Drew Bledsoe is expected to start but play only briefly
in the Pro Football Hall of Fame game, the traditional start to the
NFL exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop and fellow backup Tom Brady will see most of the action
both Monday against San Francisco and in the Patriots' second game
the following Friday at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, runner-up in the 1998 Heisman Trophy voting at Kansas
State, wasn't drafted until the seventh round, partly because of
questions about his consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's had a solid camp, but the rubber meets the road
here Monday night when we start playing preseason games,''
Belichick said. ''He's a good athlete, he's got a quick release and
a strong arm. He came from a program in college that took advantage
of those skills, but he's had to make an adjustment over what he
had to do last year and what he was asked to do at Kansas State.''
Cowboys:
</P>
<P>
   While Dave Campo would like to win his first game as head coach
of the Dallas Cowboys, he knows the real importance of Sunday's
game against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want our guys to come out with the idea that we are going to
win the football game, but I have also made it very clear to the
young guys especially that you make the football team in games, so
it's an evaluation period,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose really doesn't matter for five more weeks. Finding
the right mix of players for the final 53-man roster from the 88
currently in camp does.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the first evaluation of players against outside
competition, the Cowboys will play with a revamped offense that
includes receiver Joey Galloway instead of retired Michael Irvin
and a defense without cornerback Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman isn't likely to play past the first
quarter. Veteran running back Emmitt Smith may not play at all
because of a strained left big toe that has kept him out of
practice since Wednesday.
Seahawks:
</P>
<P>
   Isaiah Kacyvenski is living his dream.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse and Notre Dame told him he was too small to play
linebacker for them. Now, he's in the NFL and he intends to make
the Seattle Seahawks' roster as a rookie middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine doing anything else,'' Kacyvenski said. ''I
wouldn't want to do anything else. I'm just having a great time.
I've having fun every time I come out here. This is the only thing
I ever wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rejected by high profile football schools, Kacyvenski played
college football in the Ivy League, the first player to start every
game of his four-year career at Harvard. And that as a premed
major.
</P>
<P>
   He set a school record with 395 tackles, and had 11
interceptions, eight fumble recoveries and 4&AMP;frac12; sacks. He earned
all-Ivy League first-team honors three times.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks liked what they saw of his game. In April, they
drafted Kacyvenski in the fourth round as the 119th overall
selection.
</P>
<P>
   He was ecstatic then and he's more ecstatic now with a week of
coach Mike Holmgren's training camp under his belt.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's spinning a little bit,'' Holmgren said of the rookie.
''But he's a smart kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of a season-ending knee injury this week to third-year
veteran DeShone Myles, Kacyvenski is listed as understudy to
starting middle linebacker George Koonce.
</P>
<P>
   Kacyvenski's not taking anything for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not how I'm thinking,'' he said. ''I'm thinking there's
always somebody else who's hungry and who's coming up.''
Redskins:
</P>
<P>
   Andy Heck walked in the front door of Redskins Park on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After examining his own desire and deciding whether his
degenerating back could take it, Heck has returned for another
season with the Washington Redskins, even though he's not expected
to start for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, entering his 12th season at age 33, has had back problems
since he was a rookie. It gets worse every year, and a flare-up a
month ago kept him home in Chicago as his teammates started camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know if I was going to be able to come back,'' Heck
said. ''It was a little bit of a scare, but I just need to get some
rest. Nothing's really changed with my back. It's just kind of a
chronic thing that can really flare up. I have a bulging disk,
'lineman's disease.' It's just the wear and tear.''
</P>
<P>
   Heck said he won't be on the practice field for another week at
least, but he's ready to start lifting weights and getting back
into football shape.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think when I ease back into things, I'll be just fine,'' he
said.
Broncos:
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a year after playing with a pinched nerve in his
neck, Denver Broncos backup fullback Anthony Lynn said Saturday
that he is considering retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now it aches and last night I had the tingling feeling
in the back of my neck,'' Lynn said. ''I knew something was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn, 32, said he spent a sleepless night and took a long walk
about 3 a.m. around the Northern Colorado campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I was going to be faced with this decision when I woke
up this morning,'' Lynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn, primarily a key special teams player, played with the
injury much of last year. The injury returned in a July 22 practice
which forced him to miss four days of practice, but he did come
back Thursday and Friday for all the drills.
</P>
<P>
   He took a direct hit on Friday that forced him to have the neck
re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had an MRI taken and it actually came back pretty
positive,'' Lynn said. ''I have a bulging disc which many people
have in their necks right now, but unfortunately I play football.
So I may be a little bit worse.''
Chiefs:
</P>
<P>
   After 15 practices in nine days, Kansas City Chiefs head coach
Gunther Cunningham thought his team needed a rest.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham put the Chiefs through a spirited practice Saturday
morning before giving his players the rest of the day and Sunday
off. The team will get back to business Monday when the Minnesota
Vikings visit training camp for a pair of practices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope we worked them hard enough they'll think about getting
rest,'' Cunningham said. ''But they need this. They need some
space. They need to get away from the pressure and I'm looking
forward to having them come back Sunday night.''

<HEADLINE> Brad Pitt Marries Jennifer Aniston  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- After months of rumors, Brad Pitt and
Jennifer Aniston were married Saturday at a ceremony on an ocean
bluff.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 guests attended the lavish sunset ceremony at an
estate owned by television executive Marcy Carsey.
</P>
<P>
   Guests seen going into the Malibu estate included actress
Cameron Diaz and Aniston's ''Friends'' co-stars, including Matthew
Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Aniston wore a floor-length white satin silk gown designed by
Lawrence Steele, according to a press statement. Her ivory-colored,
suede high-heel sandals were designed by shoemaker Manolo Blahnik
for Steele. The bridesmaids wore pale green silk chiffon slip
dresses with pale tafetta mules.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt wore a black tuxedo designed by Hedi Slimane. His
attendants wore black tuxedos designed by Prada.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters buzzed overhead for days before the event as a large
white tent mushroomed at the location to ensure privacy. But
airspace was restricted over the site during the actual ceremony
for Pitt, 36, and Aniston, 31.
</P>
<P>
   The event cost $1 million, according to widespread media
reports, including $100,000 for security, $75,000 for flowers and
$20,000 for fireworks. A publicist did not immediately confirm
those reports.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment reporters and paparazzi who had been staking out
the site for days were kept away by tight security.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Pacific Coast Highway was shut down to accommodate the
guests and workers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first marriage for both Aniston and Pitt, whose movie
credits include ''Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire
Chronicles,'' ''Legends of the Fall,'' ''12 Monkeys'' and ''Fight
Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors the couple were engaged and planning a wedding have been
swirling in Hollywood for months. Though the couple had never
confirmed their engagement, their publicist on Thursday confirmed
plans for the wedding.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Down, Not Necessarily Out  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The crash of Air France Flight AF4590 triggered a
round of warnings that the once-glorious Concorde era had ended in
an ugly ball of flames just outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Mourning of the Concorde'' blared the headline of the
French weekly news magazine Le Point's cover story Friday. ''The
Concorde, without a doubt, died yesterday,'' the widely read Le
Figaro daily lamented in its pages Wednesday, a day after the crash
that killed 114 people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet British Airways put its fleet back into service after a
brief pause and French officials say they haven't made any final
decisions on the Concorde. With experts saying the Concorde is
still a sound plane and wealthy travelers still revering its speed
and luxury, it may be too soon to write off the supersonic
jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday, the Concorde had avoided major disasters during
its 31 years and no commercial aircraft comes close to its
supersonic speed. The jet travels at twice the speed of sound and
zips between the European continent and New York in under four
hours -- twice as fast as normal airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   It also allows business executives to leave London or Paris at
the end of a full day's work and arrive in New York the same
evening. For $10,000, celebrities can sip champagne and enjoy meals
catered by the famed French chef Alain Ducasse -- away from the gawk
of commoners.
</P>
<P>
   ''For most of those who fly the Concorde, their time is worth
money,'' said Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst at JSA Research in
Newport, R.I. ''I don't think people will be reluctant to fly the
Concorde anymore than they've been reluctant to fly after other
crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts in Europe and the United States echoed those
words, saying that travelers have continued to fly airplanes by
Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas, despite high-profile, fatal
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed that the Concorde's image has been tarnished by
Tuesday's crash but that the jetliner will rise from the ashes of
the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just like the other tragic crashes, as time passes, the shock
will heal,'' said Zafar Khan, a London-based aerospace analyst for
the French bank, Societe Generale. ''I don't see it having any
other long term effect on the psyche of air travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet within hours of the crash, the French began mourning the
death of the Concorde, a mix of technology and elegance that was
the pride of this Gallic nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was 31 years old. For France, it is a day of mourning. ...
It will remain the myth of the beautiful white bird,'' Le Figaro
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the tragedy there had been complaints about the
Concorde, the expense it took to run it and whether it was
environmentally unsound.
</P>
<P>
   Air France had a fleet of six Concordes -- now five -- while
British Airways operates seven. The British carrier resumed several
of its Concorde flights a day after the crash, while the French
Transport Ministry grounded Air France's Concordes, giving no
indication as to when they may fly again.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have long denounced the Concorde since its
maiden voyage in 1969 as noisy and environmentally unsound. The
luxury airliner guzzles 220 pounds of fuel a minute and has come
under criticism as contributing to the deterioration of the ozone
layer.
</P>
<P>
   In its early days, residents near New York's John F. Kennedy
Airport filed lawsuits to block the noisy new aircraft, known for
its thundering roar.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Mamere, a senior member of France's Green Party on Friday
urged France to shelve the Concorde, calling it the ''sacred
monster of Gaullism'' -- a reference to the ancient empire and a
time of Western European dominance.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, investigators combed through wreckage and examined
debris in high-tech labs to confirm whether the explosion of a tire
on the Concorde could have triggered the chain of events that led
to an engine fire and crash shortly after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   A tire blew out on the supersonic jet's undercarriage as it
raced down the runway for takeoff, France's Transport Ministry
confirmed Friday. Police also discovered the corpse of a new victim
buried beneath the rubble of a hotel struck by the jet.

Fiji Warns Rebels of Crackdown
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Extending their crackdown on coup supporters, Fiji's
military gave a group of armed rebels holding hostages at a barracks until
midnight Sunday to clear out or face ''drastic action.'' The town of Labasa on
the Fiji's second-largest island of Vanua Levu is one of few remaining pockets
of hardcore support for arrested coup leader George Speight, who is being held
on a prison island while authorities conduct a treason investigation. Around a
dozen rebels have taken over a small military base at Labasa and several times
have taken small groups of ethnic Indians hostage before letting them go. The
group has not made any demands, but their grievances include land claims, the
military said.

Earthquake Rattles Japan Islands

   TOKYO (AP) -- A moderately strong earthquake jolted islands south of Tokyo on
Sunday morning, but there were no immediate reports of casualties, the
Meteorological Agency said. The quake, which struck at 9:18 a.m. with a
preliminary magnitude of 5.8, hit hardest in the Ako district of Miyakejima. It
also shook Shikinejima and Kozushima. The islands, 100 miles south of Tokyo,
have been hit by thousands of quakes since undersea volcanic activity near
Miyakejima began in late June. Experts have predicted strong earthquakes would
continue for a couple of weeks.

U.N. Troops To Deploy in S. Lebanon

   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- The Lebanese president has given the go-ahead for
more U.N. troops to deploy along the Lebanese-Israeli border, starting Sunday,
the United Nations said. The deployment will take place in four different
locations, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, said Saturday in a
statement, following consultations between U.N. commanders and Lebanese
officials. It was not immediately clear why the peacekeepers were to take up
positions at only four border points. A possible reason was Lebanon's complaint
that Israel continues to violate a U.N.-drawn border line following its May
withdrawal from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Accuses His Opponents  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori accused his
opponents Saturday of plotting to set fire to Congress during
clashes that marred his inauguration, delivering his most
blistering attack in years on Peru's opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The visibly angry Fujimori, comparing his opponents to leftist
terrorists, laid the blame on them for rioting Friday that left six
people dead and several downtown buildings in flames during
demonstrations by tens of thousands of Peruvians against his
inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the military high command, he said the demonstrators
had conceived a ''totally delirious plan to burn the Congress
building so that the president-elect could not be sworn in.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What infamy if they had burned Congress!'' Fujimori declared,
praising security forces for cracking down on demonstrators and
allowing him to take the oath of office Friday in the Congress
building.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not having achieved their objective, they burned several
buildings,'' Fujimori said of the demonstrators. A state bank and
the offices of the national election board, which oversaw
Fujimori's tainted May 28 re-election, were among the buildings
burned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's harsh rhetoric against his rivals reflected how
polarized the country has become over his installation for an
unprecedented third five-year term and what critics call his
authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   The streets were quiet Saturday, as the last two victims from
Friday's riots were removed in black body bags from the state bank
that was burned by protesters. Street sweepers cleaned up glass and
graffiti reading ''Down with the Dictatorship!'' Security was
noticeably scaled back from the 40,000 police out the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Alvaro Vargas Llosa, an opposition protest spokesman, warned
that Fujimori's words could be a prelude to a wave of arrests meant
to throw opponents into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are pointedly destroying the capacity of the opposition
to mobilize people ... I think it is likely they will try to arrest
some of us,'' said Vargas Llosa, a writer and son of Peruvian
novelist Mario Vargas Llosa.
</P>
<P>
   He said Fujimori's claim of a plot to burn Congress was
outlandish, noting that the president hadn't identified those
behind it or given any evidence for his claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why would he make such a wild accusation without pointing the
blame at anyone in particular?'' Vargas Llosa said in an interview,
reiterating opposition claims that government infiltrators inspired
the violence.
</P>
<P>
   New Prime Minister Federico Salas blamed the march organizers
for the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The matter is in the prosecutor's hands, and of course the
families of the victims have every right to begin those legal
actions they consider appropriate,'' Salas said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting media reports that said a prosecutor was going to begin a
formal investigation, Vargas Llosa said: ''That means of course
they will have the power to arrest us,'' he said. ''This is exactly
the kind of government we are combating.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori told the high command that the supposed plot was
comparable to another plan uncovered in 1995 by leftist Tupac Amaru
rebels to seize Congress and take hostages. A crackdown on that
movement followed, with numerous arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 10 years, Peru endured the scourge of extremist
violence,'' he said, adding the country will not be forced to
return to ''times of savagery that cast many Peruvian homes into
mourning and destroyed public and private property.''
</P>
<P>
   He laid blame for the unrest squarely on organizers who brought
tens of thousands of demonstrators to Lima. That march had
Fujimori's opposition challenger as its figurehead: Alejandro
Toledo, the 54-year-old Stanford University-trained economist who
had called for a large, nonviolent march.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo blamed the unrest on what he said were dozens of
pro-Fujimori infiltrators sent to discredit the protesters. He said
late Friday that Fujimori was ''inaugurated behind the tanks and
rifles because he does not have the support of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   He vowed his peaceful movement would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Santiago Pedraglio said Peru's long-splintered
opposition movement showed a newfound ability Friday to mobilize
tens of thousands of people against the authoritarian government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the lamentable violence and the terrible deaths
yesterday, it is undeniable that the opposition now appears to be
more solid and more unified,'' he said. ''Many of those who
mobilized don't identify themselves with any political party. There
is a very large sector of citizenry that no longer wants
Fujimori.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori touts his achievements, including the defeat of leftist
insurgencies and an end to economic chaos in the early 1990s. But
many Peruvians say they are tired of his disregard for democratic
checks and balances and his failure to deliver on promises of jobs.
In a country of 26 million, half of the work force makes less than
the minimum wage of $120 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like former opposition Congresswoman Lourdes Flores Nano,
openly worry about a government increasingly bereft of popular
support and whose authority is questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The inauguration of a new term lacks the one central element
for the stability of government: legitimacy,'' Flores Nano wrote in
a column for El Comercio. ''This is not a good start and doesn't
bode well.''

<HEADLINE> Skylift Stops at Amusement Park  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTOONA, Iowa (AP) -- An amusement park skylift came to an abrupt
stop, stranding riders about 50 feet above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews used fire ladders and a crane to bring the 50
passengers safely back to the ground Saturday night at
Adventureland Park, about 10 miles northeast of Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The ride stopped at about 7:40 p.m. Most of the passengers were
freed within two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people were trapped in four baskets until after midnight.
Rescue efforts were hampered because those riders were in baskets
suspended over a log flume ride and the distance was too great for
the ladders, Altoona Fire Chief Jerry Whetstone said. The crane was
used to rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   Park spokesman Brian Sullivan said the ride shut down because of
a flipped breaker switch, but didn't know why that happened.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Agree To Border Talks  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North and South Korea agreed Sunday to
hold regular high-level talks and reopen their suspended border
liaison offices as part of efforts to implement agreements reached
at the June summit of their leaders, a South Korean official said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was the first sign of progress reported at
Cabinet-level talks that opened Sunday in Seoul. Details on this
and other subjects will be discussed before the North Korean
delegation leaves Seoul on Monday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The talks got off to a good start amid a very friendly
atmosphere unparalleled in the past,'' Kim Sun-kyu, a South Korean
delegate, said at a press briefing. ''Many issues will be discussed
at the Seoul talks.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning session lasted 1&AMP;frac12; hours, during which both sides
also agreed to mark one week around Aug. 15 with programs
celebrating the June summit, said Kim, who serves as vice minister
of culture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 15 marks Korean liberation from Japanese colonialism in
1945. Both Koreas usually mark the day with various programs
dedicated to unification. This year, they will exchange 100 people
each for temporary family reunions, the first since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed visit to Seoul by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and
inter-Korea military and economic exchanges and cooperation were
expected to be discussed in the afternoon session, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting the talks behind closed doors, delegates from
both sides vowed to uphold the spirit of the historic inter-Korea
summit and make efforts to bring a lasting thaw to the divided
Korean peninsula, the world's last Cold War frontier.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid political friction, no flags or other national emblems
were used for the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member North Korean delegation, accompanied by 13
assistants and seven journalists, flew into Seoul via Beijing on
Saturday for the talks which will end Monday. The North Koreans
spent Saturday attending social functions.
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas have been bitter Cold War enemies since the division
of their peninsula into the communist North and the capitalist
South in 1945. Their three-year war in the early 1950s ended in an
armistice, not in a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a senior North Korean delegation visited here was
in 1992, when the prime ministers of the two sides visited each
other's capital for reconciliation talks. Those negotiations were
overshadowed by political tension.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, there are fresh hopes for peace following the
first-ever inter-Korea summit, during which leaders of the two
sides agreed to put the past behind and work together for
reconciliation and unification.
</P>
<P>
   The summit agreements call for wide-ranging economic and other
exchanges. The Koreas already have stopped propaganda broadcasts
directed at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conciliatory mood, Kim Dae-jung has said
reunification could take two or three decades and has warned his
military to stay on alert in close cooperation with the 37,000 U.S.
troops stationed here.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean delegation does not include officials handling
economic and military affairs, although South Korea hoped to
discuss opening a military hot line and connecting rail lines
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   The official did not rule out the possibility of South Korea
raising the issue of the North's missile program. The program is a
major reason behind Washington's plan to build national and
regional anti-missile defense shields.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was discussed at a meeting between Secretary of State
Madeline Albright and North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam during
an Asian regional security forum in Bangkok, Thailand, last week.

<HEADLINE> Fire Spreads In Sierra Nevada  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREA CAVANAUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIDGECREST, Calif. (AP) -- Some residents in the rustic mountain
village of Kennedy Meadows moved their livestock and left their
homes Saturday as smoke and flames from a 49,707-acre blaze filled
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Flames had charred pine forest and brush just east of Sequoia
National Forest, destroying two outbuildings and an abandoned Boy
Scout lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters also spent their weekend on the fire lines
elsewhere across the West in what has become the nation's worst
fire season since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters had contained only 10 percent of the mammoth blaze
in the rugged Sierra Nevada and said they would be unable to
surround it until Aug. 10. No homes had burned.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, a fire that began Saturday afternoon consumed
1,400 acres of heavy brush, some of it more than a century old, on
the Pechanga Indian Reservation in the Cleveland National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The fire threatened 20 to 50 cabins at the Woodchuck Campground,
which was evacuated. About 500 firefighters were working in
100-degree heat, aided by bulldozers, air tankers and helicopters,
said Joanne Evans, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Forestry-Riverside County Fire Departments.
</P>
<P>
   At Kennedy Meadows, at least a half-dozen hardy residents moved
horses, dogs, and mobile home trailers to safety, then returned to
hang out at the only store in town. Exactly how many people left
was not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   Leona Hansen said she stayed open because her Kennedy Meadows
General Store is the only place with telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Some firefighters stopped by her porch for a cool drink, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're waiting for them to say, 'This is it. Get out of here.'
And when they do, we'll be out of here in a flash. We're not going
to be heroes,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities issued a mandatory evacuation order Thursday, but
some residents opted to stay in the isolated area, where generators
are the only source of power and telephone service was first
installed less than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some landowners who were away even returned home upon learning
of the fire, Kern County fire Capt. Tomas Patlan said.
</P>
<P>
   People who defy the order are warned that law enforcement can no
longer protect them, Patlan said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 43 people live in the area full time. Many of the homes are
weekend getaways for urban dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Gant, who owns Grumpy Bear's, a log cabin-style restaurant,
was busy serving breakfast Saturday morning. She never had time to
evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was feeding the firefighters. The closer the fire got, the
faster I cooked.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,300 firefighters were aided by nine helicopters,
five air tankers, four bulldozers and more than 50 fire engines.
Eight firefighters have been injured since the fire began July 22,
including one who was treated for first- and second-degree burns to
one arm.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the blaze had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West, crews fighting a huge blaze in Idaho
placed protective wrapping on historic buildings in the
Salmon-Challis National Forest, including the Leesburg gold mining
town, one of the state's first settlements.
</P>
<P>
   That fire near the Montana state line was moving about a mile a
day and had charred 60,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Another Idaho fire, which burned onto the grounds of the Idaho
National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, was contained at
30,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous range fire in northeastern Nevada raged largely
unchecked Saturday, having charred at least 54,000 acres, and
officials warned of gusty wind and triple-digit temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The extreme danger existing in Nevada through this weekend
cannot be underestimated,'' said state Bureau of Land Management
Director Bob Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   Crews in Utah worked Saturday to put out dozens of wildfires
that had blackened about 35,000 acres. Flames of a 1,000-acre blaze
about 31 miles south of Salt Lake City, in South Fork and Bear
Canyon, were within sight of several homes.
</P>
<P>
   Two big fires in eastern Washington were virtually neutralized.
One, a 9,500-acre fire in Okanogan County, had destroyed 37 homes
since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly cooler, wetter weather Saturday aided Colorado fire
crews who were able to fully contain a blaze that burned 23,600
acres at Mesa Verde National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Calmer wind early Saturday allowed firefighters to return to the
lines of an 8,000-acre blaze on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation
in eastern Arizona. Gusty wind on Friday swept flames through one
firefighters' camp.

<HEADLINE> Auditorium Named After Albright  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Sunday
paid a belated visit to the venue of a recent foreign ministers'
meeting in southern Japan, where officials named a 500-seat
auditorium in the city's new civic center after her.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who missed the meeting earlier this month of the Group
of Eight foreign ministers because of Middle East peace talks in
Camp David, also planned talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei
Kono later Sunday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Miyazaki, 560 miles southwest of Tokyo, had said at
first they would not name the hall after her when she canceled her
visit, but changed plans when she announced she would make a
belated visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the United States, auditoriums are usually named after
people who have died. I am thankful that you did not choose to make
that a requirement in this case,'' Albright joked in a speech at
the dedication.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was also scheduled to pay a half-hour courtesy call on
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on Monday morning, before heading back
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Albright arrived in Japan from Bangkok, where she met Saturday
with North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun in the
highest-level meeting between the United States and North Korea in
a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   She said the talks that she and other leaders had with the North
Korean official should help pull the communist state out of
international isolation.

<HEADLINE> Bush Previews Convention Speech  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- George W. Bush is road-testing parts of his
convention speech and delivery style during short but spirited
rallies on his way to Philadelphia for the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Gone from his speeches these days is the laid-back Texas
governor addressing medium-sized crowds in sparsely-decorated
venues; instead, his supporters and the television cameras see an
exuberant Republican candidate delivering short optimistic messages
to cheering supporters before dramatic backdrops.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Bush first spoke to more than a thousand people in
the rain before the Louisville Slugger Museum's six-story baseball
bat. Later, about the same number gathered on a sun-splashed
hilltop overlooking Cincinnati to listen to him speak of a new era
for the nation while a single-engine plane trailed a banner
overhead that read:
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush-Cheney 2000 -- Renewing America's Purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Bush's theme as he pushes eastward toward Philadelphia on
a six-day tour of battleground states that President Clinton won in
1992 and 1996. As running mate Dick Cheney headed back to
Washington for a round of Sunday talk shows and a rally in
Philadelphia, Bush's sweeping rhetoric gave a preview, aides said,
of parts of his 3,900-word convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are states where the Republican candidate hasn't done
too well,'' Bush told supporters in Covington, Ky., late Saturday.
''We're gonna change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he and his running mate planned to be something of a
tag team in battleground states and predicted that Cheney's quiet
dignity would be reassuring in the face of Democratic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just personally, he's obviously got a different style than I
do,'' Bush told reporters, describing it as ''a little more laid
back than mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he looked forward to what would be one of the most
magical moments of his life: ''walking out on that stage'' to
accept the Republican presidential nomination as his father,
President Bush, and his family look on from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be an emotional experience for me, of course,''
Bush told reporters aboard his campaign plane.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to his audiences about ''calling upon the best of
America'' to help out the less fortunate, rebuilding the morale and
strength of the military and protecting Social Security for
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're running to make sure that this American experience
touches every willing heart,'' he said in Covington.
</P>
<P>
   Bush brushed off polls that showed him expanding his lead going
into the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've watched poll numbers crumble,'' he said, in a reference
to his father's losing 1992 reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about any role his father might have played in choosing
Cheney or making other decisions, Bush said, ''This man is not a
political consultant. He is a father and I love and respect him and
the advice I get from him is the advice a dad would give a son.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Time Magazine, Bush said he is confident
enough to surround himself with smart people as advisers, and would
do so in the White House. ''I'm confident of my intellect,'' he
said. ''I wouldn't be running if I wasn't. My job will not be to
out-think everybody in my administration.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said advisers ''don't decide for me,'' and he will
overrule them when he thinks it right.
</P>
<P>
   He also said in the interview that his family name ''cuts both
ways'' in campaigning. ''Some folks will say 'there's George and
Barbara's son. He must be interesting, let me listen.' Others say
'he's not done anything in his life, just running on his daddy's
name.' It's a mixed blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of protesters shadowed Bush throughout the day,
chanting for Gore and holding up signs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Daddy's money...Empty suit,'' read one.

<HEADLINE> Journalists Leave Philippine Island  </HEADLINE>
By AARON FAVILA
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Journalists working for foreign news
agencies departed Sunday from Jolo, the southern Philippine island
where Muslim extremists are holding 29 hostages, after officials
said their safety could not be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the news agencies will cover the hostage crisis mainly
from Zamboanga City, 95 miles away, or receive information from
local stringers based in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to pull out the last 10 reporters, photographers
and television crew members employed by the foreign news agencies
came after police officials warned of increasing lawlessness and
kidnapping threats against some of the journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Chief government hostage negotiator Robert Aventajado also urged
all journalists to leave Jolo, warning that ''everyone is fair
game'' for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Muslim rebels freed two journalists working for
ABS-CBN, the Philippines' largest TV network, who were kidnapped
five days earlier by a splinter group of the Abu Sayyaf, a loose
collection of several hundred heavily armed Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ABS-CBN pulled the rest of its staff from Jolo to Zamboanga
after the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, rebels freed a German reporter, Andreas Lorenz of
Der Spiegel magazine, after 25 days in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Three French TV journalists remain in rebel captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Ten European journalists were abducted June 2 when they visited
an Abu Sayyaf hide-out but were released about 12 hours later after
paying a $25,000 ransom.
</P>
<P>
   All of the journalists were seized when they attempted to visit
rebel camps to interview a group of 21 hostages kidnapped by the
Abu Sayyaf on April 23 from Sipadan island, a Malaysian diving
resort.
</P>
<P>
   Of the original Sipadan hostages, the rebels have so far
released one German and six Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the French journalists, three French, three
Malaysians, two Germans, two Finns, two South Africans and two
Filipinos are still in captivity. The rebels are also holding 12
Filipino members of a Christian evangelical group.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said he has spoken with a go-between for the rebels
who told him the hostages would be released soon.
</P>
<P>
   About $4 million has been paid for the releases of the German
and the six Malaysians from the Sipadan group despite the
government's official no-ransom policy, Philippine military
officials said.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- A soldier attending a wedding near the southern
Russian city of Stavropol accidentally detonated a grenade at a
wedding reception, injuring 17 wedding guests, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion Saturday night in the village of Kurskaya, near
the border with Chechnya, prompted police to dispatch a rapid
reaction team to search for Chechen terrorists, the duty officer of
the regional Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The police team instead found that a drunken army sergeant was
jokingly demonstrating how the grenade worked when it exploded,
sending 17 guests to the hospital with fragment wounds.

<HEADLINE> Israel Peres To Stand For President  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Shimon Peres resigned from the Israeli Cabinet
Sunday in preparation for his race for president.
</P>
<P>
   Peres' resignation from the post of minister for regional
cooperation paves the way for him to take the presidency. He was
expected to win Monday's vote in the 120-member parliament, which
is vested with electing the largely ceremonial post.
</P>
<P>
   Under Israeli law, he would have had to resign before taking the
presidential oath. His Cabinet resignation does not take effect
until 48 hours after it is submitted.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers think that Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate
with an international reputation, will comfortably beat his
opponent Moshe Katsav, who has held only second-rank ministerial
posts in Likud governments.
</P>
<P>
   However the presidential election has produced surprises in the
past. The balloting is secret.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Troops To Deploy in S. Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   RMEISH, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah guerrillas blocked a U.N. force
for seven hours Sunday from setting up a position along Lebanon's
border with Israel until a Lebanese army officer intervened and
resolved the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   A day after receiving Lebanese government approval to fan out
along the border, a platoon of U.N. Nepalese soldiers attempted to
deploy near the border village of Rmeish. But Hezbollah guerrillas
who have control of the access route refused to let them through.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not get the orders from Beirut to let them through,''
said a bearded Hezbollah guerrilla, consulting with his superiors
by two-way radio.
</P>
<P>
   A Lebanese army general arrived by helicopter to inspect the
area for any Israeli border encroachments seven hours after Lt.
Col. Ramindra Chhettri's platoon of Nepalese officers came to set
up a post.
</P>
<P>
   ''All is good,'' Brig. Gen. Maher Tufeili said. The guerrillas
then allowed the Nepalese peacekeepers to pass and reach the border
point a mile away, where they hoisted a U.N. flag.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the isolated incident just outside Rmeish, the
anti-Israeli guerrillas who have taken effective control of
southern Lebanese areas evacuated by Israel after its May 24 troop
withdrawal have not interfered with U.N. operations.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrilla leaders have pledged to cooperate with the Lebanese
government and peacekeepers of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, peacekeepers deployed to more positions along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   A unit of about 50 peacekeepers in five white armored vehicles,
accompanied by a bulldozer, moved early Sunday morning to an area
on the border just across from the Israeli town of Metulla, 20
miles east of Rmeish.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers raised the blue U.N. flag, blocked access to the road
and declared the area under U.N. control, prohibiting anyone from
approaching.
</P>
<P>
   A unit from the Irish battalion, which has been deployed in the
south since the international force first came in 1978, arrived
first apparently to inspect the area. It was followed by newcomer
peacekeepers from Sweden who stayed; the seasoned Irish later left.
Sweden joined the south Lebanon U.N. force earlier in July.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 Indian soldiers moved farther east to Abbassiyeh. They
hoisted the U.N. flag and set up four tents. As they deployed, two
U.N. soldiers stopped by for coffee at a nearby Hezbollah position.
Armed Hezbollah guerrillas looked on as the troops deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, about 200 Palestinians living in Lebanon came in buses to
the Abbassiyeh border point to watch the activity, some of the
throngs who have been flocking almost daily to the border zone
since the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 U.N. peacekeepers are stationed in areas farther
north from the border in southern Lebanon since a 1978 Israeli
invasion. They have been waiting to move to the border region in
line with U.N. resolutions after Israeli troops ended an 18-year
occupation of a buffer zone in southern Lebanon in May.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon has been refusing consent to the United Nations to fully
deploy to the border, maintaining Israel first must end violations
of Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a U.N. statement said President Emile Lahoud
authorized deployment of the U.N. force to four border locations.
On Friday, Irish and Ghanaian peacekeepers took over two border
hills at Manara and Yaroun that have been the site of recent
Israeli violations of Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   The possible reason for the peacekeepers' deployment in stages
was Lebanon's complaint that Israel continues to violate a border
line drawn by the United Nations. Prime Minister Salim Hoss said
Saturday that the full deployment will start as soon as ''one last
Israeli border violation is rectified.''
</P>
<P>
   Though limited, the U.N. presence in the Israeli-evacuated zone
was expected to improve security in an area made tense by
stone-throwing incidents and standoffs between Israeli soldiers and
Lebanese civilians and guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon also has readied a 1,000-member security force of police
and army commandos to move in when U.N. peacekeepers fully deploy.
The Lebanese forces are to maintain law and order in the former
Israeli-occupied zone, where some assaults against alleged
pro-Israelis and their families have been reported.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cabinet Minister Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A Cabinet minister responsible for regulating the
financial industry resigned Sunday over a scandal involving cozy
ties with a leading bank, dealing another blow to Prime Minister
Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
   Kimitaka Kuze, head of the Financial Reconstruction Commission,
was forced to step down amid allegations that he received nearly $2
million from Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. in office rent,
consultant fees and labor costs between 1989 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The charges of financial irregularities that emerged on Friday
were followed by fresh allegations that Kuze also accepted $909,000
from the president of condominium builder Daikyo Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal erupted three weeks after Mori launched a new
Cabinet following last month's general election, in which his
ruling coalition managed to hang on to power despite rock-bottom
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   It was likely to spell more trouble for his shaky
administration, whose approval ratings currently hover at around 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders accused Mori of appointing Kuze despite
knowing that he had received favors.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Mori) should be held responsible,'' said Yukio Hatoyama,
leader of the main opposition Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Kuze, 71, is the second chief of the powerful FRC, which was set
up to guide Japan's financial reform efforts, to be forced to
resign this year. In February, Michio Ochi stepped down over
remarks he made that suggested he would be lenient in bank
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Mori had initially defended Kuze, saying he was satisfied from
talks with his appointee that he had done nothing wrong. But the
new allegations involving Daikyo reportedly put additional pressure
on the premier to seek Kuze's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Mori replaced Kuze with Hideyuki Aizawa, 81, a former chief of
the Economic Planning Agency, the prime minister's office said.

<HEADLINE> Two Iraqis Killed in Grenade Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- A hand grenade attack has killed two people
at a celebration in southern Iraq attended by a senior ruling party
official, the state-run Iraqi News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Several people were injured in the Saturday morning attack in
Dawaya, 220 miles south of Baghdad, which the news agency blamed on
Iranian agents.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelbaqi Abdelkareem al-Sadoun, a member of the Baath party's
powerful regional command, was not among the casualties, according
to the agency. Al-Sadoun also is the party official in charge of
the southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ''A criminal from the Iranian regime's agents threw a hand
grenade at a gathering of people celebrating the 32nd anniversary
of the July 17 revolution,'' the agency said. ''Two innocent people
were killed and many others were injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and Iran both allow opponents of the other's government to
work from their soil. A 1980-88 war between the two countries
claimed more than a million lives; the U.N.-brokered cease-fire
ended the bloodshed but not the hostility.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from Iran on Sunday's
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the injured were treated at the scene and others were
taken to area hospitals, the news agency said without providing the
number of wounded.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Arrest Hamas Official  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- A prominent member of the militant
Islamic group Hamas was arrested Sunday by Palestinian police less
than two months after being released, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who has been arrested five times in the
past, was spokesman for the group and is now a member of its
political bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police Maj. Gen. Ghazi Jabali refused to comment on
the arrest, reported by Rantisi's son Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, Rantisi has called on Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to abandon peace negotiations with Israel and
''return to the path of jihad,'' or holy war.
</P>
<P>
   Despite numerous arrests, Rantisi has never been put on trial.
He was released a few weeks ago by order of the Palestinian High
Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said the
arrest was regrettable. ''Hamas always advocates freedom of
speech,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yassin and other Hamas leaders claim they have no control over
the Hamas military wing, which carries out the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Hamas is opposed to the 1993 Oslo interim accords between the
Palestinians and Israel and has killed scores of Israelis in
suicide bombings since the agreements were signed.

<HEADLINE> China Building Collapse Kills 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A building housing several shops collapsed in
western China, crushing four people to death and setting back
efforts to improve construction quality, a newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   No cause was given for the collapse in the city of Urumqi in the
far western Xinjiang region July 23. The collapse was reported in
the Xinjiang Daily newspaper viewed in Beijing on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The building, which housed a dumpling restaurant and three other
shops, suddenly collapsed with a massive boom just after 11 p.m.,
sending rubble flying, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers at a nearby night market were sent scurrying while
police and rescue crews rushed to the scene and began digging
through the wreckage with a backhoe, the paper said. The last body
was found over 10 hours later. Another 14 people were injured in
the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The accident followed a series of safety inspections in the
region, and amid a government safety campaign launched nationwide
on July 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a major accident, coming just as we are trying to grasp
safe production, causes serious damage to our people's lives and
our nation's resources,'' the article said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid development of the construction industry and endemic
corruption among local officials have frequently resulted in shoddy
buildings and bridges. Collapses often bring heavy loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   China's Ministry of Construction ordered safety checks
throughout China following the collapse of a newly built pedestrian
bridge last year that killed 40 people in the southwestern city of
Chongqing.

   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Cape Verde's prime minister has quit the
government after nine years in power to run for president of the
West African archipelago, news reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Veiga, the country's first democratically elected
premier, announced his decision Saturday, the Portuguese daily
Publico said.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential elections are scheduled for February 2001, a month

who last month took over the leadership of the ruling party, the
Movement for Democracy, according to Publico.
</P>
<P>
   Veiga was prime minister of Cape Verde, a former Portuguese
colony 300 miles off the coast of Senegal, since its first
democratic elections, held in 1991. He was re-elected in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Israel OK Gaza Air Route  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Egyptian aviation authorities ordered pilots
Saturday to start using a new route to the Gaza Strip airport,
signaling an end to a 3-month-old dispute with Israel over flying
near its territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority's statement to pilots said
that beginning Tuesday pilots should pass 15 nautical miles north
of el-Arish, on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, when heading to the
Gaza airport.
</P>
<P>
   The statement didn't note whether the measure was permanent, but
an aviation official confirmed on condition of anonymity that the
dispute had been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian side had wanted to use a route that passes 30
nautical miles north of el-Arish. Israel, citing security reasons,
had wanted a route 10 nautical miles north of the Egyptian city.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Israel ordered an Egyptian passenger aircraft heading to
the Palestinian international airport to return to Cairo, saying
the plane was using a route that was not recognized in
international flight maps. Gaza airport is run by the Palestinian
Authority, but is subject to overall Israeli security control.

<HEADLINE> Auditorium Named After Albright  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will travel
to Italy on Monday for talks with Vatican officials on the Middle
East peace talks at Camp David, a U.S. official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will meet Tuesday with Vatican Foreign Minister
Jean-Louis Tauran to ''bring him up to date'' on the peace process,
said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Pope John Paul II made a plea during the Camp David
summit for Jerusalem's holy sites to be governed internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the pope's position is ''quite well known,'' but
that the purpose of Albright's visit will be to keep the Vatican
informed about the situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, Albright paid a belated visit to the venue of a
recent foreign ministers' meeting in southern Japan, where
officials named a 500-seat auditorium in the city's new civic
center after her.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who missed the meeting earlier this month of the Group
of Eight foreign ministers because of Middle East peace talks, also
met with Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Miyazaki, 560 miles southwest of Tokyo, had said at
first they would not name the hall after her when she canceled her
visit, but changed plans when she announced she would make a
belated visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the United States, auditoriums are usually named after
people who have died. I am thankful that you did not choose to make
that a requirement in this case,'' Albright joked in a speech at
the dedication.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was also scheduled to pay a half-hour courtesy call on
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   She had initially been scheduled to return directly to
Washington, but changed her plans in Tokyo to travel to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Albright arrived in Japan from Bangkok, where she met Saturday
with North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun in the
highest-level meeting between the United States and North Korea in
a half-century. She said the talks should help pull the communist
state out of international isolation.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebels Warned on Crackdown  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Rebels agreed to release control of one
stronghold Sunday and the deadline on the surrender of a second was
extended as Fiji's military continued mop-up operations in the wake
of a coup.
</P>
<P>
   A standoff was defused when rebel supporters said they would
hand back control of Fiji's largest hydroelectric power station
following negotiations over a land claim. The handback was not to
be immediate, but the issue had been resolved, local radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
   And after warning of ''drastic action'' if a group of about a
dozen armed rebels did not surrender their weapons and vacate a
small army barracks by midnight Sunday, military spokesman Maj.
Howard Politini said late Saturday that negotiations were underway
and the ultimatum would be extended for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The barracks in the town of Labasa on Fiji's second-largest
island, Vanua Levu, is one of a few remaining pockets of hard-core
support for arrested coup leader George Speight, who is being held
on a prison island while authorities conduct a treason
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels at Labasa have several times taken small groups of
ethnic Indians hostage before letting them go. The group has not
made any demands, but their grievances include land claims, the
military said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, a failed businessman, led a group of indigenous Fijians
who stormed Parliament on May 19 and held dozens of officials for
two months, demanding the disenfranchisement of Fiji's large ethnic
Indian minority. The military took power 10 days after the raid and
finally met rebel demands earlier this month, discarding the
multiracial constitution and ousting the government of Mahendra
Chaudhry, Fiji's first prime minister of Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the last hostages were released on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels claim that ethnic Indians -- first brought to Fiji in
the 1870s by British colonialists as indentured laborers -- have too
much power and are threatening Fijian culture. Ethnic Indians make
up 44 percent of Fiji's 814,000 population and dominate business
and commerce here.
</P>
<P>
   A new Fijian government was sworn in Friday and is expected to
prepare the way for elections, possibly in three years. Although it
is strongly pro-indigenous Fijian, it includes no close Speight
supporters. It has one ethnic Indian, a junior minister.
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 rebels, including Speight, were arrested last week
during a military crackdown. Speight had earlier threatened a new
campaign of civil unrest unless the new Cabinet was stacked with
his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The military said allegations that Speight had threatened new
President Ratu Josefa Iloilo's life could lead to charges of
sedition or treason, which carry a maximum penalty of death.
Unlawful assembly, theft and firearms offenses were also being
investigated.

<HEADLINE> AIDS- and HIV-treatment center to target blacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A treatment center for blacks who have
AIDS or HIV is planned in a county where only a third of black AIDS
patients get treatment, compared to half of infected whites.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester has the second-highest number of AIDS cases in New
York state, after New York City. The number of local AIDS cases has
leveled off among whites but is climbing among blacks, according to
the Rochester Primary Care Network.
</P>
<P>
   Existing programs are not reaching the growing number of black
men and women who are HIV-positive, Art Collier, president of
Primary Care Network, said. The rate among Monroe County residents
who are black is over eight times the rate among white residents,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1991, 64 percent of reported AIDS cases in Monroe County
were among whites and 27 percent were among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The center expects to have an initial caseload of about 150
patients. Besides medical care, services will include mental health
counseling and treatment for substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS is helping plan
the center and recruit a black staff, Collier said. Coordinators
believe black patients will respond better to treatment by black
medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anson Wurapa, a black physician at Strong Memorial
Hospital's AIDS Center, said blacks tend to mistrust the medical
system, and when everyone on the staff is white, the situation is
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, one in 50 black men is infected with HIV, and AIDS
is the leading cause of death for all black Americans between the
ages of 25 and 44.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is growing fastest among black women, who account
for 56 percent of HIV cases in women.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies have received $410,000 in federal funds to start
the center. The money comes from a federal initiative to fight HIV
and AIDS among minorities. President Clinton announced the program
in October 1998.

<HEADLINE> GOP Convention opening night is Camden's moment to shine  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - The thought of showing off New Jersey to the
rest of the nation by welcoming visitors to its poorest city may
sound like a real estate agent showing a house by starting in the
moldy basement.
</P>
<P>
   But the basement is getting a makeover.
</P>
<P>
   When 4,000 delegates to the Republican National Convention and
as many as 30,000 spectators arrive in Camden, they'll see a city
in the midst of a rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey State Aquarium, the Sony Blockbuster E-Centre,
the USS New Jersey, a children's garden and a new office building
greet visitors arriving on the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Those entering on Admiral Wilson Boulevard, which connects the
city with Philadelphia, will see a $50 million spruce-up complete
with a tree-lined riverfront, flowers and shrubs, fresh paint on
bridges and new sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a wonderful opportunity to showcase New
Jersey, to showcase the promise of Camden,'' Gov. Christie Whitman
said. ''They're going to see a vibrant waterside. They're going to
see hope and potential. I think people are going to be very
surprised when they come over on Sunday night.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an unrivaled, unparalleled opportunity,'' said Judi
London, executive director of the Camden Waterfront Marketing
Bureau. ''We look at it as two cities, one waterfront. Combined,
Camden and Philadelphia can rival any tourist destination in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   With a mayor facing federal political corruption charges and
things in such disarray that the state is running city finances and
overseeing the police department, any boost is welcome to the
city's 87,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of those residents lived below the federal
poverty level when the 1990 census was taken. AIDS, drug addiction,
homelessness and crime are serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   But change has to start somewhere, and city and state officials
think the momentum has begun. Visitors will see a city ''that's
really coming back,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government last week announced that Camden will
receive $35 million in federal funds to build affordable housing.
Whitman on Thursday said 36 community groups in the city will share
more than $2 million in state grants. Almost half of that money
will be used to support people getting off welfare and going to
work.
</P>
<P>
   One of three groups that received permission to protest in
Camden on Sunday objects to, among other things, the city's lack of
jobs. The group, led by Councilman Ali Sloan El, is also to call on
Whitman to apologize for frisking a black Camden man four years ago
while riding along on patrols by police and state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of the governor patting down the man has revived
accusations that her administration is insensitive to minorities.
Whitman has defended her participation in the pat-down.
</P>
<P>
   A second group planned to protest the U.S. Naval presence on the
Puerto Rican island of Vieques. The third group, Unity 2000, wants
legislators to focus attention on a variety of issues, including
poverty, homelessness, the environment, racism, sexism and
religious intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Police Capt. Joseph Wysocki said the groups agreed to finish
protesting by 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:45 p.m., a light show was scheduled to be held on the Ben
Franklin bridge. London said the show - featuring hundreds of red,
white, blue, pink, purple and orange lights lit in sequences - will
be permanent, starting every hour on the hour.
</P>
<P>
   A ''stately dessert reception'' is scheduled for delegates at 9
p.m. in tents set up by the RCA pier. There they can enjoy New
Jersey Blueberry Pie, Pennsylvania Dutch Shoo Fly Pie, Florida Key
Lime Pie, Mississippi Mud Pie, and, from Texas, brown sugar cookies
made with Barbara Bush's recipe, London said.
</P>
<P>
   After dessert, a parade of lighted boats was to sail on the
Delaware River, followed by a fireworks show.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Continues Gn Buyback Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will continue to offer federal
money for local gun buyback programs, President Clinton announced
Sunday, rejecting the contention by House Republicans that current
law does not authorize such spending.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million ''Buyback America'' program ''will ensure the
removal of thousands more guns, preventing an untold number of gun
accidents suicides and crimes,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Department of Housing and Urban Development has
''clear authority to carry out this important program'' and that
''the gun lobby and other opponents of common-sense gun safety
measures continue to challenge this initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Programs in at least 30 cities are on hold because of the
dispute between the Department of Housing and Urban Development and
Rep. James T. Walsh, R-N.Y. chairman of the House appropriations
subcommittee that oversees HUD.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh maintains that existing law did not authorize such
spending, and that Congress' investigative arm, the General
Accounting Office, supports his position.
</P>
<P>
   He told The New York Times that if the buyback program
continued, housing officials could be fined or even jailed. But he
said he may not seek such penalties.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 10-month-old program has paid out $3.5 million to
buy back more than 17,000 guns in 70 cities. HUD suggests a buyback
price of $50 per gun, and local businesses are encouraged to donate
gift certificates for food, toys and other goods to individuals who
turn in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Buyback America saves lives by taking unwanted guns out of
circulation,'' HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and gun control opponents in
Congress attacked the program as wasteful and potentially dangerous
because it could put cash into criminals' pockets.

<HEADLINE> Pioneering Heart Surgeon Dies  </HEADLINE>
By OSCAR SERRAT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina, (AP) -- Rene Favaloro, a surgeon who
pioneered the coronary bypass surgery, an operation routinely
performed on millions of people each year, has died. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   His secretary found his body in the bathroom of his apartment
Saturday in what police were calling a suicide. Favaloro had a
wound in his chest and a gun was near his body. Farewell letters
from Favaloro were found in another room, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Favaloro performed the first bypass operation on a
51-year-old woman at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, using a
saphenous vein taken from the patient's leg to detour blood around
blockages in her heart, a technique still used today.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could be called the father of bypass surgeries,'' said Dr.
Marcos Nores, an Argentine cardiovascular surgeon at the Cleveland
Clinic. ''Before the 1960s, coronary heart disease was mainly
treated with medications.''
</P>
<P>
   Favaloro spent 10 years working in several U.S. medical centers,
including the Cleveland Clinic, where he specialized in chest
surgery. He later returned to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando de la Rua said Monday would be a national day
of mourning for Favaloro.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a deep love and attachment to his country,'' De la Rua
said in a statement. ''He resigned a brilliant medical career in
the United States, that would have brought him richness, to return
to Argentina, where he began as a humble rural doctor, bringing
along his experience and his talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Favaloro had been complaining lately that the Cardiological
Surgical Foundation that bears his name, the most important in
Latin America, was facing serious financial problems. Argentina has
been in an economic depression since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Several hospitals and state-owned medical centers owed the
foundation more than $18 million, Favaloro disclosed in a recent
letter to the editor of the local newspaper, La Nacion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am going through the saddest period of my life,'' Favaloro
said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   Favaloro's wife died a year ago. He leaves no survivors.

York are developing the ''alpha particle immunotherapy'' and last
year completed initial human tests.
</P>
<P>
   The isotope bismuth-213 was attached to an antibody designed to
carry the alpha-emitting isotope to the cancer. The tests were to
see if the treatment did more harm than good in acute myeloid
leukemia patients.
</P>
<P>
   The results were a surprise. Not only was the therapy safe, but
leukemia cells were eliminated in the blood stream and reduced in
the bone marrow of 13 of the 18 patients taking part, said Dr.
Joseph Jurcic, one of the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really think it has broad implications for the whole field
of oncology, not just for leukemia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers don't envision bismuth therapy replacing
chemotherapy or surgery. Rather they see its potential in
''cleaning up residual cancer cells that are remaining behind after
primary treatments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is no small challenge. Jurcic said only 30 percent to 40
percent of acute leukemia patients are cured by chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of these patients go into remission with
chemotherapy, but they relapse because of these residual cells.
That's where we think the bismuth is going to be particularly
useful.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Sloan-Kettering, under the watch of the National
Cancer Institute, plans to start a second phase of testing with 35
to 40 patients to measure the therapy's effectiveness. The trials
could last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The advantage of alpha-emitters is that they deposit a large
amount of energy in a very small area of tissue,'' said Dr. Jorge
Carrasquillo, deputy chief of nuclear medicine at the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Attaching the bismuth to antibodies that can carry the radiation
dose straight to diseased cells is an ''innovative treatment,'' and
Sloan-Kettering is leading the way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course it is too early to tell the final role,''
Carrasquillo said, ''but it certainly is a strategy worth
pursuing.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was getting more bismuth-213, an exotic isotope with
a 46-minute half-life, which makes it perfect for injecting into
patients because it quickly dissipates but makes it difficult to
acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Bismuth-213 can be obtained in what physicists describe as a
decay chain from uranium-233. First, thorium-229 is extracted, then
actinium-225 is taken from that and then the bismuth is extracted
from the actinium.
</P>
<P>
   The search for thorium led to the uranium-233 stockpile in Oak
Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson agreed last month at the behest
of Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich.,
to double the supply of bismuth-213 by 2002 for the Sloan-Kettering
research.
</P>
<P>
   Rushton said only 1 percent of the available bismuth-213 has
been recovered from Oak Ridge. The total of bismuth-213 there is
infinitesimally small -- so small that it is measured by its
radioactivity instead of its weight.
</P>
<P>
   A typical shipment to Sloan-Kettering ''is literally a spot of
material that is dried in the bottom of a vial. It looks like the
vial is empty,'' Rushton said.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers believe there is enough high-powered bismuth-213
at Oak Ridge to treat up to 100,000 cancer patients a year.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Ridge's uranium-233 was made at the government's weapons
fuel production plants in South Carolina and Washington state in
the 1950s and 1960s. However, it was never intended for bombs,
rather to fuel commercial nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, uranium sources were scarce and nuclear power
generation looked full of promise.
</P>
<P>
   ''But nuclear power did not grow as rapidly as the
too-cheap-to-meter advocates had said, and people found all kinds
of uranium out there,'' Rushton said. ''The price fell and the
economic need for this as an alternative fuel never developed.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the uranium-233, considered more hazardous than enriched
uranium for weapons -- which also is stored in Oak Ridge -- has
remained at the Oak Ridge lab complex. It costs $15 million a year
to store, and some experts estimate it will cost even more to
dispose of.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bismuth extraction will not reduce the volume of
uranium-233, it at least gives value to the uranium's manufacture,
Rushton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spent a lot of money making this stuff,'' he said. ''If we
had disposed of all this 10 years ago, we wouldn't have the option
to look at bismuth-213 today.''

<HEADLINE> Exercise May Also Weaken Immunity  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sometimes, exercise can weaken an athlete's
ability to fight off a cold. Other times, researchers say, exercise
won't make a difference -- or might strengthen the ability.
</P>
<P>
   The difference seems to depend on how much exercise the athlete
does.
</P>
<P>
   ''Recent evidence suggests that athletes experience mild
suppression of immune function during periods of intense
training,'' said researcher Laurel T. Mackinnon of the University
of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. ''In contrast, moderate
exercise training appears to have either no effect on, or enhance
resistance to, upper respiratory infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackinnon's report was in a special supplement to the American
College of Sports Medicine's journal Medicine and Science in Sports
and Exercise. The July supplement reviewed the latest research
about the effects of working out on an athlete's response to upper
respiratory tract infections. These infections largely are colds,
but can include other conditions, such as laryngitis.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that harsh, demanding workouts slightly impair the
production of white blood cells that fight infection, Mackinnon's
article said. The combination of declines in several types of
infection-fighters may set up the athlete for illness, it said.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the body reduces its inflammation-fighting immune
cells a bit to give the exercise injuries a chance to heal by
themselves, Mackinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say athletes seem more prone to symptoms of these
infections after long periods of intense training, or after an
exhausting competition such as a marathon. Researcher David Nieman
of Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C., found that 50
percent to 70 percent of athletes report symptoms in the second
week after a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Having symptoms, however, is not the same as having a full-blown
upper respiratory disease, which is far less common, Nieman said.
And the immune suppression itself is not as extensive as a more
serious clinical immune deficiency, Mackinnon said.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers believe that the period of reduced immune
protection amounts to an open window for infection. But the
research to prove the window exists has not yet been done, Nieman
said in an article in the supplement.
</P>
<P>
   The test would be whether the athletes with the greatest
suppression in their immune system would have the greatest
likelihood of infection, Nieman said.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors, such as stress, lack of sleep and bad nutrition
may also raise risk, Nieman said. The way to aid recovery is
simple: Reduce stress, get more sleep, cut back on the exhausting
training -- and, before an important event, avoid large crowds and
sick people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary exercisers, the effect of a workout or a race seems
different. If it has any effect, exercise may raise disease
resistance a bit, Mackinnon said. In some of Nieman's studies,
sedentary women who took up walking 45 minutes a day had 40 percent
to 50 percent fewer days of symptoms than did similar women who
remained sedentary.
</P>
<P>
   But other researchers say the effect of moderate exercise -- what
the sports medicine group considers a healthy level -- may have to
build over time to become meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   David G. Rowbottom and Katherine J. Green of Queensland
University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, say individual
bouts of moderate exercise don't seem to produce enough of an
effect to change the immune system.

<HEADLINE> Refuel Problem Grounds BA Concorde  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British Airways Concorde was unable to take off
from London's Heathrow airport Sunday because of a refueling
problem, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   The flight to New York, scheduled to depart at 10:30 a.m., was
delayed for more than an hour while the airline switched about 50
passengers to another Concorde, which flew them safely to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a problem with aircraft refueling, so the passengers
were put onto another Concorde aircraft which we always have on
standby,'' a British Airways spokeswoman said on condition of
anonymity. ''It was standard procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   The passengers had not yet boarded the flight but were waiting
in the departure lounge when they were notified of the problem, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said further details about the problem were not available,
but that there was nothing to link it with Tuesday's crash of an
Air France Concorde outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Air France immediately grounded its fleet of five Concordes
after the crash, which killed 114 people.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways, the only other airline to operate Concordes,
resumed flights on most of its seven supersonic jets Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Experts were trying to determine whether a tire explosion before
takeoff could be linked to the raging fire that spewed from the
plane's left-bank of engines before it crashed.

<HEADLINE> Gun owners ballistic in wake of bill, targeting lawmakers  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Every shooter knows about recoil - a gun's
reaction to the action of firing a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a lot of New York gun owners are recoiling. They're
reacting in anger to gun control measures backed by Gov. George
Pataki and the state Legislature that would, among other things,
require trigger locks and ballistic ''fingerprinting.''
</P>
<P>
   Some gun owners are vowing to take their anger out at the polls
this November. A coalition of gun groups plans to target some
legislative races - testing their effectiveness as a political bloc
in a state where polls indicate most residents are inclined to
support gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come to take positive steps and action to remove
every Democrat and Republican from office who does not support our
right to keep and bear arms,'' wrote Essex County resident Don Sage
in a fax distributed to gun groups last month.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki unveiled the gun control plan on the national news in
March. The legislation, approved by the state Legislature in June,
requires mandatory trigger locks, ballistic ''fingerprinting'' to
better track weapons and background checks on gun buyers at gun
shows in the state. The measure also would codify a federal assault
weapon ban into state law and raise the legal age for purchasing
handguns in New York state from 18 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has yet to sign the bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in control of the state Assembly have backed similar
measures in past years, only to find little support in the
Republican-led state Senate. Things played out differently this
year, an election year in which Senate Republicans are trying to
protect their 36-25 majority.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the gun control bill before leaving for the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people are highly upset and feel betrayed,'' said Tom
Chandler, who organized a rally for gun owners outside the state
Capitol on Saturday. ''Not only that, they feel our so-called
friends in the Legislature feel we're a group to be sacrificed
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvanized by the bill's passage, representatives of more than a
dozen state and local hunting and gun groups met in Troy July 23 to
plan a response. The groups decided to have lawyers review the
legislation to see if it violates the Constitution and they intend
to signify their displeasure at the polls this November, said Tom
King, legislative director of the New York State Rifle &AMP; Pistol
Association, which is affiliated with the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all honest, law-abiding, hard-working people and the
only option open to us are the voting booths,'' said King.
</P>
<P>
   Should politicians be fearful?
</P>
<P>
   The NRA by itself reports having 170,980 members in New York
state. But polls have shown a majority of state residents in favor
of gun control, with support the strongest among New York City
dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a pro-gun control state,'' said pollster John Zogby.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, polls have shown support for Pataki's initiative.
Democrats have little to be spooked about, said Zogby, as gun
owners tend to be most numerous in the state's Republican
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder gun owners are looking hard at some Senate
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   King said Sen. Frank Padavan of Queens, the gun bill's prime
sponsor, will be targeted. Sen. Thomas Morahan of Rockland County -
who won a tightly contested special election in 1999 - and other
Senate Republicans who voted yes on the bill are also potential
targets, King said.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are still being formed, but the gun groups will
concentrate on grass-roots lobbying - using billboards - as well as
contributions to political opponents of targeted legislators. King
said it's possible that the gun groups would support Padavan's
Democratic opponent regardless of that person's position on gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Padavan, who notes he is a sportsman himself, said bill
opponents are having a ''knee jerk'' reaction to legislation that
will have little effect on law-abiding hunters. He said he has
drawn criticism from some gun owners before and appeared unworried
about his re-election prospects this November.
</P>
<P>
   ''You do what's right,'' Padavan said, ''and the chips fall
where they may.''

<HEADLINE> Unit begun during WWII puts volunteer troopers on patrol  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - You couldn't pay most people to face down
speeding motorists, jackknifed trucks and armed car thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Walsh does it for free.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, the security manager at J.C. Penney's catalog
distribution center in Manchester, is also an auxiliary state
trooper. Founded in 1941 to replace troopers who joined the
military during World War II, the unit gives volunteers a uniform,
a weapon and training, but not the power to make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not making any money but the rewards are personal,''
said Walsh, of East Hartford, an ''auxie'' since 1972. ''It's as
simple as helping someone call a wrecker while stranded on a
highway, comforting someone at an accident scene or assisting a
trooper with his job so he can get it done better and quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit, which hit a wartime peak of 1,200 in 1945, today has
about 55 volunteers certified for patrol and 22 who do
administrative work. During WWII, the auxiliaries protected bridges
and the shoreline from invasion by German forces. Today, they
mainly back up the 1,100 regular troopers responding to accidents
and disabled vehicles, and handle traffic at special events.
</P>
<P>
   But the unit is being phased out, a victim of tougher training
requirements and increased liability because of changes in search
and seizure, domestic violence and high-speed pursuit laws. No new
classes have been held since 1986, when the Connecticut state
police attained accreditation and grandfathered in the auxiliaries
until their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing a new class up to the heightened requirements would
mean significantly increasing the 240 hours of training most
current auxiliaries received in firearms, first aid, patrol and
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not fair to ask anyone to do that without pay,'' said
Col. John Bardelli, commanding officer of the state police.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh and others say there continues to be interest in the
program, but admit it wanes once the applicants hear of potential
training requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you wanted to invest that amount of time, you'd become a
regular trooper and get paid for it,'' said Bill Akell, of Bristol,
an auxiliary since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Akell had considered becoming a full-time trooper back then. But
he would have had to take nearly a 50 percent pay cut if he left
his job as a traveling metals salesman. For people like Akell who
wanted to serve the community but had a family to support, the
auxiliary unit was the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here I can get out on the road and help people,'' Akell said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Walsh, joined the auxiliaries with hopes of a
career in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Most motorists make no distinction between regular and auxiliary
troopers. Neither does the danger on the roads. The last two
troopers killed in the line of duty were auxiliaries -Edward
Truelove in 1992 and Philip Mingione in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing scares a trooper more than screeching tires, Walsh and
Akell said on a recent patrol out of Hartford's Troop H. Laying
flares at the scene of an accident involving a car, a van and a
tanker truck on westbound Interstate 84, their heads jerked up at
the sound of cars failing to slow down on the rain-slicked highway.
</P>
<P>
   They patrol about five to 10 hours a week, usually after shifts
at their full-time jobs. They provide another set of lights as
troopers fill out accident reports or issue tickets and stop to
help disabled vehicles. They have the power to pull motorists over
only in special cases - if, for example, they see a drunken driver
in heavy traffic and a regular trooper cannot immediately respond.
</P>
<P>
   Auxiliaries must renew their firearm and medical certification
annually. They receive the same state benefits as regular troopers
if injured or killed on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The unit allows full-time troopers to spend less time on
paperwork and routine calls and more time patrolling the highways,
Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't need to waste a trooper on a disabled vehicle or
directing traffic at an accident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But many police departments across the nation are disbanding
auxiliary units in favor of civilian volunteers who handle only
administrative tasks, Bardelli said. He hasn't ruled out updating
the unit, but said he is not sure what form it would take.
</P>
<P>
   Despite mixed feelings about the structure of the unit, state
police leaders stand behind the current auxiliaries who they say
have served the state well.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're unique individuals,'' said Capt. Greg Senick, who as
commander of field operations for the state police oversees the
auxiliaries. ''They put their lives on the line and they do it for
free.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit is unlikely to disappear any time soon. Mandatory
retirement age is 70, but even after decades of service, many
current auxiliaries say they have no intention of quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I've got a couple more years left in me,'' Akell said.

<HEADLINE> Feds Review Telemarketer Rules  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal law offers a three-word statement to
let people fend off unwanted solicitations from the telemarketing
industry: ''Do not call.''
</P>
<P>
   That line is supposed to ensure that a telemarketer will stop
calling that house household. But some lawmakers want to go further
in curtailing intrusive sales calls.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting a yearlong
review of its regulations amid a debate about how well consumers
are being protected.
</P>
<P>
   Both the FTC and the Federal Communications Commission require
many companies to keep lists of people who ask not to be bothered
again. Each call in violation of the FTC rule puts a business at
risk of an $11,000 civil penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, consumer advocates say the regulation needs more muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rule is a joke,'' said Bob Bulmash of Private Citizen, a
consumer rights organization that works to limit junk calls and
mail. Under the rule, private citizens cannot bring a civil action
unless a telemarketer causes them $50,000 or more in actual
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also lacks jurisdiction to enforce its rules against
several industries, including banks, federal savings and loans,
long-distance phone companies, airlines, nonprofit organizations
and certain insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who else calls but these teleintruders?'' Bulmash asked.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators also are studying effects of new technologies such as
''predictive dialers,'' machines that automatically dial many
different numbers in an effort to make telemarketing more
efficient. Because the calls can connect before a telemarketer is
available to make a pitch, people sometimes hear dead silence or
recorded hang-ups on answering machines.
</P>
<P>
   People who use caller ID devices to screen or trace calls also
complain that many telemarketers' numbers do not show up. Without
the name of a company or the number, the telemarketer's target
cannot follow up with a complaint on the suspicion that federal
rules were violated, advocates and some consumers say.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot identify them. Even if you had a problem with them,
you would not know where to find them,'' said Albert LeQuang, who
uses a caller ID box at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has got to be a process that will allow you to appeal to
their supervisor if you are not happy about the approach they are
taking,'' said LeQuang, who manages mortgage credit policy at
Freddie Mac in McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The telemarketing industry says the rules are working. New
regulations or laws constructed too broadly would interfere with
the ability to do business and disseminate information, they
contend.
</P>
<P>
   Telemarketers note that people who do not want to be called can
request that their names be added to a list kept by the Direct
Marketing Association. Many companies voluntarily participate in
this service and abide by the list.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups advise that people clearly say the phrase: ''Put
me on your 'do not call' list.'' They also can demand the
telemarketer not call other numbers in the household.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing association believes regulators should determine
whether charitable or political organizations and other
noncommercial groups that are exempt from the rule are to blame for
consumer irritation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't feel there is an adequate understanding of who is
making the calls,'' said Stephen Altobelli, the association's
director of public affairs. ''The natural knee-jerk reaction is to
impose more restrictions on commercial telemarketers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers still are considering tougher rules. Rep. Matt Salmon,
R-Ariz., has introduced legislation to ban telemarketers from
blocking their identity on caller ID boxes or from calling during
dinner hours, defined as 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing companies say it would cost too much to redo their
phone systems to ensure numbers are picked up by caller ID boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Other consumer advocates have pushed for remedies such as a
nationwide ''do not call'' list.
</P>
<P>
   ''What consumers are looking for is the opportunity to have one
place to go to give the information that they don't want calls at
any time at home,'' said Bill Gilles of the National Association of
Regulatory Utility Commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Some states already have statewide lists. Tennessee set up a
list that takes effect Tuesday, and almost 380,000 homes have
signed up, accounting for close to 18 percent of Tennessee's 1.9
million residential telephones.
</P>
<P>
   States with similar programs include Arkansas, Georgia,
Kentucky, Florida, Missouri, New York, Oregon and Texas. Some
states charge consumers a few dollars per year to stay on the list.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, for example, consumers pay $10 to get their number
on the list and $5 annually to keep it there. The Tennessee program
imposes no fee.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC is expected to give Congress its recommendations early
next year on how the law should be amended.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - With fewer than 100 days left before
Election Day, the largest-ever borrowing proposition in New York
history is almost an afterthought against the backdrop of the
presidential and U.S. Senate races.
</P>
<P>
   And, as things stand now, New Yorkers still cannot find out the
most basic details about the $3.8 billion bonding proposal they
will see on Nov. 7 - such as what all the money would be spent on.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall asked Gov. George Pataki and
legislative leaders last week to at least specify which projects
they plan to fund through the bond act.
</P>
<P>
   Memorandums of understanding (MOUs) listing bond act projects
were supposed to have been agreed to by June 14, but state leaders
missed the deadline, McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very troubled by this,'' McCall wrote in a letter to
Pataki, state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and state Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno. ''If there is a sincere desire to see
the bond act passed, work needs to be done to persuade the voters
of the worthiness of projects. The only way to do that is to finish
the MOUs and share the details with the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Until details are made public, about all New Yorkers know about
the $3.8 billion borrowing proposal is that half the money would be
spent on highways, bridges, airports and canals and the other half
spent on mass transit projects in New York City and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said he has not yet taken a stand on the bond act because
of doubts whether the state, which already has a
highest-in-the-nation accumulated debt of more than $37 billion,
should be borrowing so much new money.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the chief fiscal officer of this state and as a voter, I
need more information,'' McCall said. ''I am ambivalent about this
bond act.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the state Department of Transportation, Michael
Fleischer, urged McCall to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ''The executive and the Legislature are finalizing the MOUs,''
Fleischer said. ''They will be done and made available to the
public in plenty of time for the public to render a judgment and
get the information that they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Meetings to make the project list final were taking place daily
last week, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has said that when the list of projects is completed he
will decide whether he'll support the bond act and, if so, how
actively he'll promote it.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's silence so far is reminiscent of Pataki's
attitude toward a $2.4 billion school construction bond act in
1997. At best, Pataki was only a halfhearted supporter of that
proposal and he and the Legislature reached no agreement on the
geographic disbursal of the money before Election Day. With little
idea of where the money was to be spent, voters defeated the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The education bond act proposal was primarily the creation of
Silver and other Democrats in the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, however, the Republican governor very actively
campaigned for a $1.75 billion environmental bond act which he
initiated in talks with legislative leaders. Pataki raised more
than $1 million to promote the proposal and assigned two top
members of his administration to run a campaign for its passage.
</P>
<P>
   Voters approved the environmental bond act.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation bond act is clearly a creature of the
Legislature and it will be up to lawmakers, and bond act supporters
within the trucking and construction trades industries, to carry
the promotional ball.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno late last week said it would still be ''premature to be
getting too specific'' about the projects to be funded in the
borrowing proposal. ''That's being worked on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When details are released, Bruno said that not every dime of
proposed spending will be accounted for. Rather, the ''largest
part'' of the allocations will be specified, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Voters will know, kind of, what they are getting for their
approval,'' the Senate Republican leader said.

<HEADLINE> Cohen May OK Missile Defense System  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Judging by recent comments, Defense Secretary
William Cohen appears to be leaning toward a recommendation that
President Clinton take the first step toward deploying a national
missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt Cohen believes a shield can be built; the
issue may come down to cost and timing.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is likely to take another week or two to consider many
complex aspects of this decision, from the urgency of a missile
threat to whether an anti-missile shield is affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I frankly think that if you had an ICBM (Intercontinental
Ballistic Missile) that landed in New York or Washington or San
Francisco, Los Angeles or Tampa, the damage would be catastrophic,
and the amount of money ... would be rather insignificant,'' Cohen
said July 6.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed missile defense system is projected to cost $60
billion.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Wednesday, in remarks to reporters in his
Pentagon office, Cohen said he had not made up his mind what to
recommend.
</P>
<P>
   His advice will be an important factor in Clinton's decision,
but the president also will take into account views of the rest of
his national security team, including Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has noted that even though Clinton must decide whether to
start the deployment process, his successor will be able to stop
it, modify the plan or take an altogether different approach.
</P>
<P>
   The initial construction work on an X-band radar in Alaska
cannot begin before summer 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The question for Clinton is whether to give the Pentagon the
go-ahead to award construction contracts to let site preparation
begin next year. If Clinton decides not to go forward, he will have
eliminated the possibility of having a national missile defense
ready by 2005, as now planned.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that target remains realistic would seem the first
question Cohen must consider.
</P>
<P>
   His recent comments give indications of doubt. In testimony
Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Cohen noted the
failure of the past two flight tests of the ''smart rock,'' or
missile interceptor, that is being developed to shoot down incoming
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps it has called into question the realism of the date,''
Cohen said. But he added he considers 2005 the target ''we ought to
continue to focus on'' in order to keep the work -- both the testing
and construction of the anti-missile system -- moving as fast as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Cohen were to determine that 2006 or 2007 is a more
reasonable target date, he might want to proceed immediately with
the first phase of construction in Alaska to lengthen the odds of
meeting that timetable.
</P>
<P>
   The weather on Shemya Island, in Alaska's Aleutian chain, where
the Pentagon plans to build the powerful new radar, is so foul that
construction is possible only a few weeks each summer. The radar is
needed to help the missile interceptors find their targets and to
distinguish decoys.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Wednesday that Gen. Larry Welch, head of a panel of
experts advising the Pentagon on the missile defense project, has
said Shemya's weather might unavoidably delay construction past
2005.
</P>
<P>
   During the 18 months since he altered the 2003 target deployment
year to 2005, Cohen often has said he believes a national missile
defense is justified by an emerging threat of attack by North Korea
or possibly Iran or Iraq. The urgency of the threat is among
Clinton's principal considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a threat, and the threat is growing,'' Cohen said on
Jan. 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seems to share that view.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is there a threat which is new and different?'' Clinton asked
at a May 31 news conference in Lisbon, Portugal. ''The answer to
that, it seems to me, is plainly, yes, there is, and there will be
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Another major factor in Cohen's decision is the technical
feasibility of the missile defense system under development. Many
critics in Congress and elsewhere contend it cannot be made to work
reliably.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen believes it can.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that the testing to date demonstrates the validity
that we are close to having a technology that can, in fact, defeat
a few dozen missiles fired by a rogue state, and that's the
criterion that I will look at,'' he said June 12. That was before
the latest test failure, July 7, the second consecutive setback.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Tuesday, Cohen acknowledged that the two
failures leave in doubt the feasibility question. He quickly added:
''I believe that the trend is such that these are problems that are
correctable.''

<HEADLINE> Back Sleeping, Flat Heads Linked  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP)-- Traci Fries never dreamed that by helping to keep
her baby safe from crib death she was contributing to a separate
and growing medical problem.
</P>
<P>
   From the nape of his neck to the top of his skull, the back of
10-month-old A.J. Fries' head is perfectly flat.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit, doctors told the Chicago mother, was putting A.J.
to sleep on his back -- the increasingly common practice credited
with a steep decline in crib deaths nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Fries, 26, says she noticed the problem not long after A.J.'s
birth last September and asked her pediatrician about it at every
checkup.
</P>
<P>
   ''The doctor kept saying, 'Oh, as he grows older it should fill
back out.' It never did.''
</P>
<P>
   She has since been advised to see a specialist to see if her son
needs to wear a special helmet to mold his head back into shape.
</P>
<P>
   Skull flattening can occur because newborns' skulls are soft and
malleable, which allows the growing brain to expand. The medical
name is positional plagiocephaly, a condition some pediatricians
had never heard of before the nationwide ''Back to Sleep'' campaign
that started in 1994 to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome, or SIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns over the rise in plagiocephaly, SIDS is still
the leading killer of infants in their first year. Some doctors
worry that parents' concern about flat heads may lead to a return
to stomach sleeping -- something experts stress should still be
avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I have to trade a decrease in SIDS with getting asymmetry
in the back of the head, that's a great trade,'' said Dr. Frank
Vicari, a pediatric plastic surgeon at Children's Memorial Hospital
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   While nationwide figures are not available, many doctors report
dramatic increases in flat-headed babies since the ''Back to
Sleep'' campaign started.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of children are affected, says Dr. Louis Argenta,
chairman of the plastic surgery department at Wake Forest
University and director of the North Carolina Center for Cleft and
Craniofacial Deformities.
</P>
<P>
   Lea Menchaca's plagiocephaly was noticed at the age of three
months, when her father was bathing her.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'Her head's crooked,' and I said it was no big
deal,'' said Lea's mother, Traci Menchaca, 29, of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Menchaca had a cousin whose baby was a stomach sleeper and died
of SIDS, so she was compulsive about making sure Lea, now 2, and
her older brother slept on their backs. But she ''completely
freaked out'' when a pediatrician referred her to a neurosurgeon
and a pediatric plastic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The specialists identified the problem and recommended a DOC
Band, an open-topped helmet approved in 1998 for treating
plagiocephaly.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, Cranial Technologies Inc. of Phoenix, says the
number of patients wearing the helmets has more than doubled since
they became widely available nationwide in 1997. Last year, 2,144
were used, at a cost of about $3,000 each, said spokeswoman Julie
Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Usually harmless and easily treated, plagiocephaly has led at
worst to needless tests, unnecessary operations and big expenses,
specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   It sometimes is mistaken for a far less common but much more
serious problem called craniosynostosis, in which bones in the
skull fuse prematurely. In that condition, surgery is usually
recommended to allow proper brain growth.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics is preparing a statement
aimed at helping doctors distinguish the two conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The academy also updated its sleep-position statement earlier
this year, acknowledging the reported increases in plagiocephaly.
It recommends periodically repositioning infants' heads while they
sleep and allowing ''tummy time'' when they're awake to help
prevent flat spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some parents have gone overboard and feel they should never
put their babies on their stomachs. That's not right,'' said Dr.
John Kattwinkel, chairman of the academy's SIDS task force.
</P>
<P>
   Argenta says parents who carry their infants around all day in
portable car seats contribute to the problem, giving the babies'
skulls little chance to maintain a rounded shape.
</P>
<P>
   Some plagiocephalic infants must wear plastic helmets for
several months, and in extreme cases surgery may be needed to
correct such things as misaligned ears, which may be prone to
infections, Argenta said.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Back to Sleep'' campaign has helped reduce the U.S. SIDS
rate by more than 40 percent, said Kattwinkel. SIDS deaths fell
from 4,660 in 1992 to about 2,800 in 1998, the latest figures
available, he said.

<HEADLINE> Heard the news? Bootleggers using hearing-impaired technology  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A system designed to help the hearing-impaired
at concerts has provided bootleggers with a new tool to make
illegal live recordings of exceptional quality, according to an
anti-bootlegging group.
</P>
<P>
   This latest wrinkle in the multimillion-dollar bootlegging
industry takes advantage of a federal law requiring arenas to offer
patrons use of an assistive listening device (ALD). Both advocates
for the hearing-impaired and arena operators were unaware of the
new theft technique.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know through criminal investigations and informants that
this is a common practice,'' said Frank Creighton, senior vice
president of anti-piracy at the Recording Industry Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   ''The quality is much higher than a typical bootleg,'' Creighton
continued. ''No question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bootleggers are using the devices provided for the
hearing-impaired to record near-pristine versions of concerts by
veterans like Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan plus a plethora of
new acts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every major act that's in the Billboard top 100 is getting
bootlegged in some manner,'' Creighton says.
</P>
<P>
   Bootleggers can simply request an ALD headset, which provides a
high-quality feed of a live show via a low-level FM frequency
broadcast inside a facility.
</P>
<P>
   The music pirates can then steal the headset feed, giving them
concert performances devoid of the usual bootleg problems such as
random crowd noise or distortion, Creighton said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the hearing-impaired were appalled by the new
pirating technique.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh my goodness! What concerns me is if this becomes so
prevalent that the service is dropped,'' said Mercy Coogan of
Gallaudet University, the Washington-based college for deaf and
hard of hearing students.
</P>
<P>
   ''That could prohibit a whole lot of hard of hearing people from
this very important mode of access.''
</P>
<P>
   Arenas are required to provide the ALDs under the federal
Americans with Disability Act, which marked its 10th anniversary
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the ALD bootlegs is an Aug. 22, 1999, Springsteen
concert from Boston's Fleet Center - one of the most popular
illegal recordings of the Boss' E Street Band reunion tour,
according to Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The three-CD collection is advertised as ''soundboard quality,''
with various mentions on the Internet that it was done via an ALD.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there (is) anybody who don't own a single boot, buy this,''
raved one bootleg buyer at a Springsteen site. ''The sound is so
good you'll think it's an official release!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Another enthusiastic reviewer offered this praise: ''The
instrument separation is outstanding and well-mixed, making this
set a joy to listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   The ALD rip-offs were news to officials at several major concert
venues from coast to coast, including the new Staples Center in Los
Angeles and the First Union Center in Philadelphia. ''We have the
devices, but I haven't heard of this,'' said Ike Williams of the
First United Center in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Delaney, spokesman for the Fleet Center, was also unaware of
this new twist. But when asked about the bootlegging potential, he
replied, ''Nothing would surprise me in this day and age.''
</P>
<P>
   Creighton says that arena policing is generally left up to bands
and their road crews; many groups, from the Allman Brothers to the
Black Crowes to the Dave Matthews Band, have encouraged their fans
to tape and trade live performances.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association only becomes involved once
the illegal material is manufactured and distributed, according to
Creighton. The association says that hundreds of millions of
dollars are lost annually through the various forms of bootlegging,
and this new technique should add to that total.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're plugging into soundboard feeds - high quality,''
Creighton says. ''Those types of recordings garner the largest
bidders in the bootlegging underground.''

<HEADLINE> Koreas Agree To Continue Talks  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North and South Korea took another
step toward reconciliation Sunday, agreeing to hold regular
high-level talks on bringing peace to their divided peninsula, the
world's last Cold War frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The progress was made at Cabinet-level talks in Seoul -- the
first time a senior North Korean delegation has visited the South
Korean capital since 1992. The two sides planned to wrap up the
talks Monday by issuing a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ministerial talks will keep continuing,'' said Kim
Sun-kyu, a South Korean delegate who serves as vice minister of
culture and tourism. ''Both sides have found that their positions
have many things in common but some working details need adjustment
in their language before an announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Koreas have been bitter enemies since the division of their
peninsula into the communist North and the pro-Western South in
1945. Their three-year war in the early 1950s ended without a peace
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, relations have begun to thaw. At a June
summit, the leaders of the two sides agreed to work toward
reconciliation and reunification.
</P>
<P>
   The talks in Seoul were the latest step in that process, and
chief North Korean delegate Jon Kum Jin was upbeat after two rounds
of discussions Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot resolve all problems in one meeting,'' he said at an
official dinner. ''However, if the North and South both work
together to implement the summit agreement, there will be no
problem that we cannot solve.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean official, Kim, said both sides agreed to
commemorate the June summit with a week of events around Aug. 15,
the day marking Korean independence from Japanese colonialism in
1945.
</P>
<P>
   Both Koreas usually celebrate the day with programs dedicated to
unification. This year, they will exchange 100 people each for
temporary family reunions, the first since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from both countries also came close to agreeing to
reopen border liaison offices a South Korean official said. The
liaison offices were shut down in 1996 because of political tension
after a four-year run. If reopened, they would serve as a permanent
channel of government dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member North Korean delegation, accompanied by 13
assistants and seven journalists, flew to Seoul via Beijing on
Saturday. To avoid political friction, no flags or other national
emblems were used during the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators had vowed to uphold the spirit of the historic
inter-Korean summit during the talks. The summit agreements call
for wide-ranging economic and other exchanges. The Koreas already
have stopped propaganda broadcasts directed at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conciliatory mood, South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung has said reunification could take two or three decades. He
has warned his military to stay on alert in close cooperation with
the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed here.
</P>
<P>
   The North's missile programs are a source of great concern in
the region and are a major reason for Washington's decision to
consider building a national missile defense system. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright raised U.S. worries about the North's
missile program at a meeting last week with North Korean Foreign
Minister Paek Nam Sun during an Asian regional security forum in
Thailand.

   Bootleggers can simply request an ALD headset, which provides a
high-quality feed of a live show via a low-level FM frequency
broadcast inside a facility.
</P>
<P>
   The music pirates can then steal the headset feed, giving them
concert performances devoid of the usual bootleg problems such as
random crowd noise or distortion, Creighton said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the hearing-impaired were appalled by the new
pirating technique.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh my goodness! What concerns me is if this becomes so
prevalent that the service is dropped,'' said Mercy Coogan of
Gallaudet University, the Washington-based college for deaf and
hard of hearing students.
</P>
<P>
   ''That could prohibit a whole lot of hard of hearing people from
this very important mode of access.''
</P>
<P>
   Arenas are required to provide the ALDs under the federal
Americans with Disability Act, which marked its 10th anniversary
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the ALD bootlegs is an Aug. 22, 1999, Springsteen
concert from Boston's Fleet Center - one of the most popular
illegal recordings of the Boss' E Street Band reunion tour,
according to Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The three-CD collection is advertised as ''soundboard quality,''
with various mentions on the Internet that it was done via an ALD.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there (is) anybody who don't own a single boot, buy this,''
raved one bootleg buyer at a Springsteen site. ''The sound is so
good you'll think it's an official release!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Another enthusiastic reviewer offered this praise: ''The
instrument separation is outstanding and well-mixed, making this
set a joy to listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   The ALD rip-offs were news to officials at several major concert
venues from coast to coast, including the new Staples Center in Los
Angeles and the First Union Center in Philadelphia. ''We have the
devices, but I haven't heard of this,'' said Ike Williams of the
First United Center in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Delaney, spokesman for the Fleet Center, was also unaware of
this new twist. But when asked about the bootlegging potential, he
replied, ''Nothing would surprise me in this day and age.''
</P>
<P>
   Creighton says that arena policing is generally left up to bands
and their road crews; many groups, from the Allman Brothers to the
Black Crowes to the Dave Matthews Band, have encouraged their fans
to tape and trade live performances.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association only becomes involved once
the illegal material is manufactured and distributed, according to
Creighton. The association says that hundreds of millions of
dollars are lost annually through the various forms of bootlegging,
and this new technique should add to that total.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're plugging into soundboard feeds - high quality,''
Creighton says. ''Those types of recordings garner the largest
bidders in the bootlegging underground.''

<HEADLINE> 1950s love story alive in Brooklyn  </HEADLINE>
By SHARON L. CRENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - To: Gorgeous you. Re: You.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night you asked me what I saw in you and remember, I was
tongue-tied?
</P>
<P>
   ''What is there about you that makes me walk two feet off the
ground?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim writes in perfect, measured script, pouring his whole soul
out on memo paper printed with the name Sussex, a defunct magazine
once published in New Jersey. A pretty girl with big blue eyes is
the object of his affection. Her name is Claire Suydam, and nobody
seems to know anything else about her except that someone named Jim
wrote letter after letter to her around 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ''With deepest love and affection,'' he signed one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hello, Angel Skin,'' begins another.
</P>
<P>
   The words are on display at the Blah-Blah Lounge, a restaurant
and bar on a tree-lined street of brownstones in Brooklyn. A
counter inside runs the length of the place, and the letters are
kept on top and under glass. Customers sip Belgian beer and
Glenfiddich scotch, sample the seared tuna and speculate about Jim
and Claire.
</P>
<P>
   To: The one girl in this world, he writes one Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Re: Us
</P>
<P>
   ''Good morning, Sweetheart,
</P>
<P>
   ''Again let me apologize for Saturday night, it shall be my last
drunk and also my last mention of such an unfortunate incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel that I have lost ground with you. There is (underlined)
a change that I sense, and it is all probably my fault and I'll
more than likely suffer because I was foolish enough to feel sorry
for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was not an entirely easy romance. Jim sprinkles the
letters with references to not being able to call at certain times.
One mentions a woman - a wife? - ''waiting with murder in her
rotten soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, on one Monday, Dec. 17, Jim pleads and promises a future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please, Baby, remember you belong to me and I belong to you -
and I'm sure (underlined twice) we are going to be very happy
together because I am going to make you very happy and contented.
I'll baby you, I'll work for you and I'll love you. You will be my
Dream Girl come true, my darling and my sweetheart. (I can cook,
too!)''
</P>
<P>
   It's signed, ''Bye for a while, Cuddle Bug, Your own private
Kissin' Bug.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no chronology to these notes, no recitation of
day-to-day events, no mention of the mundane whatsoever. And
because they are written on memo paper, enclosed in envelopes never
sent through the mail, there are no postmarks to measure passing
time. There are no letters from Claire, and no way to know if she
wrote any. Absent, too, are details about the wife or a possible
divorce. Maybe the murderous woman mentioned was a colleague? Never
know.
</P>
<P>
   A national search of directories, death records and the like
turned up only one Claire Suydam - in New England. She's not the
one. Sussex, the magazine where Jim pilfered stationary for his
private love notes, has since gone out of business. The letters
turned up in Lambertville, N.J., at a flea market, all neatly
folded in their original envelopes. They were gold to an aspiring
Brooklyn lounge owner, Cosmo Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ''My reaction to the letters in the beginning had nothing to do
with business,'' he said. ''I just love them.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know anything about Jim and Claire, but promises more
of their saga will be revealed someday. Only about a third of the
letters he bought for $100 are on display. The others he keeps
upstairs, waiting their turn. There are about 40 in all.
</P>
<P>
   The love story does have an ending, of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   On Valentine's Day 1952, Jim addresses Claire's letter to ''My
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is only one 'Claire' in this universe and I was lucky
enough to find her,'' it reads. ''I idolize you, Baby, you are my
very life, so remember, to me - you will always be my valentine,''
</P>
<P>
   Yours, Jim.

<HEADLINE> State to try again with enhanced auto inspection system  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - When the state switched to a new auto
emissions test at all its inspections stations at once, systems
broke down across New Jersey and motorists were stranded in winter
weather for as long as four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 13 was the first federal deadline the state missed. The
second federal deadline, for the end of June, was extended. On
Tuesday, the state will complete a much more gradual attempt at
changing all its inspection stations over to the new test to meet
the final deadline set by federal environmental authorities.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, the last seven stations begin taking reservations
for the advanced test, ditching the tailpipe test brought out of
retirement after December and joining the 25 others that have
started reusing it since January.
</P>
<P>
   State officials last week said they believe the reintroduction
of the enhanced test will proceed far more smoothly now. The first
time, the $500 million system was plagued with faulty and frozen
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate to say this having gone through the last six months,
but we have a high degree of confidence we'll be able to
accommodate motorists in a convenient way,'' state Transportation
Commissioner James Weinstein said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group, the California
company that built and operates the system, is prepared for the
deadline, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said reservations will help prevent the long lines
that resulted last time.
</P>
<P>
   Stations will accept eight appointments an hour at each lane.
Motorists can expect service within minutes of arriving of their
appointment, perhaps as soon as three minutes, although Weinstein
admitted that projection may be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection itself should take seven or eight minutes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone arriving without an appointment will be given three
options: filling the next available open slot, choosing another
non-appointment station, or going to a private garage for an
inspection, the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are confident the new system will work - based
on the success of an appointment-only system at two other stations
earlier this year, six months of experience with the enhanced
system at most of the stations, and the hiring and training of new
workers to staff the lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are going to be times when there will be lines at
inspection stations,'' said Parsons spokesman Carl Golden. ''But we
feel the things we've done go a long way toward assuring people
that the difficulties we experienced this past winter will not be
repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last week, waiting times were down to minutes at
some of the larger inspection stations that used the enhanced test,
Weinstein said. The wait time was 24 minutes in Randolph, 13
minutes in Eatontown and seven minutes in Wayne, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 96 percent of the state's 123 inspection lanes were
operating last week, indicating that nearly all the equipment was
in working order, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said he has been in contact with Gov. Christie Whitman
in recent weeks as the deadline neared. The governor and the
commissioner were among those criticized in a recent report
detailing Parsons' and the state's failures to implement the new
auto inspection system, which is designed to measure pollutants
more accurately and bring the state into compliance with federal
clear air rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a tough taskmaster on this,'' he said of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   To call for an appointment at one of the seven small stations,
call 1-888-NJMOTOR. The stations taking appointments are Montclair,
Westfield, Ridgewood, Cape May, Bridgeton, Salem, and Washington in
Warren County.

<HEADLINE> Cease-fire Provides Hope in Kashmir  </HEADLINE>
By ASHOK SHARMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- With Kashmir's main militant group having
declared a cease-fire, hundreds of joyous Kashmiris set out Sunday
for holiday resorts -- their first relaxed weekend outing in 11
years of fighting between Indian forces and separatist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire ''has taken some fear out of the minds of
people,'' said Ali Mohammed, a taxi driver, as he cleaned his
vehicle and waited to pick up passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Rasool was boarding a bus with his wife and two
children for the skiing resort of Gulmarg. ''I am confident that we
won't be attacked by either side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such peace of mind is unusual in this Himalayan province, the
flashpoint of tensions between India and Pakistan and the site of a
guerrilla uprising that has claimed more than 25,000 lives in the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   A 1972 line divides the mountainous province between India and
Pakistan, which have fought three wars since 1947 and skirmished
last summer. India controls two-thirds of Kashmir, Pakistan the
rest, and both sides claim the entire territory.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen separatist groups want Kashmir to be independent or
merge with Pakistan, and many have fought Indian troops for years.
But on Tuesday one of the groups -- Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, until now
branded the most dreaded militant group in Kashmir -- declared a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups have vowed to keep fighting. But the Hezb-ul
Mujahedeen cease-fire seems to be holding, raising hopes of India
and the separatist organizations opening a dialogue to settle the
dispute here.
</P>
<P>
   A series of quick diplomatic breakthroughs seem to have been
triggered by Hezb-ul Mujahedeen's cease-fire declaration. On
Friday, India's Interior Ministry invited all militant groups and
political leaders in Kashmir to hold discussions with the
government. Kashmir's top umbrella group of political and
separatist organizations accepted the invitation Saturday, and
India's top military commander in Kashmir said operations against
the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen had been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Saleem Hashmi, a spokesman for the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, said
Sunday that any talks on the future of Indian-ruled Kashmir should
be unconditional. The group will review its decision if New Delhi
sets conditions for talks over the disputed region, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends now on how India puts the blocks on this
foundation,'' said Yusuf Jameel, a local journalist. ''Since
nothing was emerging out of fighting, pressure from Western
countries seems to have worked on Pakistan and the militants.''
</P>
<P>
   But the contours of a possible solution are anybody's guess.
Some politicians want the existing cease-fire line dividing Kashmir
between India and Pakistan turned into an international border. The
state legislature in Kashmir wants the federal government to give
wide autonomy to the Kashmir valley, controlling only defense,
currency and communications. Several militant groups want India
agree to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir to ascertain the wishes of
people.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the resolution, the possibility of peace has some
Kashmiris looking to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope there won't me any more midnight knocks at my door by
the Indian security forces,'' said Faiz Ahmed, 28, a textiles
salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Others are hoping for the chance to make a living again.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism was the main source of income for most of the 5 million
residents of Kashmir, known as the Switzerland of the East. But
tourists, fearing attacks and kidnappings, have shunned Kashmir
since the insurgency broke out in 1989. Five years ago, four
western tourists were abducted by a pro-Pakistan militant group and
never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have grown old sitting at home without work,'' said
Mohammed, the 40-year-old taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mohammed and Ahmed live in the downtown district of Bahri
Kadal, which was known as India's Beirut after the outbreak of the
militancy. The militants openly challenged the Indian forces for
the first time in Bahri Kadal in December 1989, displaying their
guns and firing in the air while driving through the crowded
district.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Ghani Bhat, the chairman of the umbrella group
representing political and separatist organizations here, has said
the cease-fire announced by the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen and the positive
Indian reaction were prodded by interest from the West and China.
Analyst Ali Imran said the thaw follows what may have been heavy
maneuvering in the background by the United States after President
Clinton visited India and Pakistan in March.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is scheduled to meet
Clinton again during his official visit to Washington in September.
They are expected to discuss progress on the Kashmir issue.

<HEADLINE> Queen Mum at 100: An Icon in Silk  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The Queen Mother Elizabeth, 100 years old this
Friday, is not what she seems. Small, gray-haired ladies in
flowered dresses are not usually national icons, but this one is as
much a part of Britain's self-image as the Union Jack and the
Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   As mother of Queen Elizabeth II, her most significant public
activity for some years has been to accept bouquets and represent
the regal dignity of another age. But it was exactly this
unwavering standard that appealed to many Britons in the 1990s, a
disastrous and deeply undignified decade for the royal family and
the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems strange in a way that someone as diaphanous as the
Queen Mother -- all chiffon and sparkles -- should turn out to be a
pillar of strength to the monarchy,'' her biographer, Elizabeth
Longford, wrote in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the steel beneath the silk that the Queen Mother's
admirers value, especially those who remember her and her husband
King George VI during World War II. During the German bombing of
Britain, the two forged a bond of solidarity with the British
people that won her the steadfast loyalty of most of a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Her charm is a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The blue eyes still light up when she greets people, tilting her
head a bit and smiling up disarmingly from under the brim of her
inevitable hat. She totters a little now on her high heels, never
having given in to sensible shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But she gets around pretty well with the aid of a walking stick
or two, having undergone two hip replacements while in her 90s --
and incidentally winning more admiration for the grit she displayed
in walking out of the hospital unassisted.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mother has a genius for good publicity. Whoever she
might be in her private moments, the public woman doesn't get it
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''She displays an extrovert, theatrical sense that is almost
totally lacking in her elder daughter,'' royal biographer Robert
Lacey wrote in the Sunday Times. ''To express her emotion -- at an
unexpected round of applause, say, on entering a room -- she
flutters her eyelashes and places her hand over her bosom, a
gesture with which only she and operatic divas can get away.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been beguiling strangers this way for 90-odd years,
since her privileged childhood in a large and close-knit
aristocratic family at Glamis Castle in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the ninth of 10
children of the Scottish 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful child and lovely young woman with dark hair and
vivid blue eyes, she was admired by many of the young men of her
circle. When she accepted the third proposal of the king's shy
second son, the Duke of York, his friend the diarist Chips Channon
wrote, ''We had begun to despair that she would ever accept him. He
is the luckiest of men, and there is not a man in England today who
doesn't envy him.''
</P>
<P>
   A child of the Edwardian Age, she had tended wounded soldiers at
Glamis during World War I. During World War II, she became a
bulwark of support for her husband, who had been forced unprepared
onto the throne when his brother King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936
to marry the American divorcee Wallis Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   The monarchy was struggling to regain popularity during the
worst of the war as bombs were devastating British cities,
particularly London's poor East End. It was a widely published
comment of the queen's that seemed to turn the tide for the royals.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1940, after the king and queen survived a bomb
strike on Buckingham Palace, she said, ''I'm glad we have been
bombed. I feel I can look the East End in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   It was so certainly the right thing to say at the moment that it
has never been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   With the king's death in 1952 began their daughter's reign,
which has seen a half-century of huge social change. The telephoto
lens has peered into the monarchy and revealed the family inside to
be human. Royal divorce -- literally inconceivable before the war --
is occurring at about the same rate as everyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mother, whose social and political ideas are reported
to be conservative, does not make public comments about these
changes.
</P>
<P>
   She has remained at the center of royal life since the king's
death, instead of fading into the background as a dowager queen
might.
</P>
<P>
   She lives at Clarence House, less than 500 yards from her
daughter's Buckingham Palace home.
</P>
<P>
   The two queens speak to each other by telephone every morning --
a conversation that follows the switchboard's standard ''Your
Majesty? I have Her Majesty on the line, Your Majesty.''
</P>
<P>
   A fawning tabloid press has labeled the Queen Mother ''the
nation's favorite granny'' -- an image that fits nicely with the
sweet smiles and tea parties. But there is at least as much
evidence that she is a sophisticated and witty woman who prefers
gin to tea, loves the horse races and entertains in exactly the
sort of lavish style that the monarchy is trying to pare down.
</P>
<P>
   She is said to have a very large overdraft at her bank and to
tug heavily on the purse strings of her daughter, who has been
economizing and taking her cousins and children off the taxpayers'
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Verifiable information about the Queen Mother's opinions and her
character is hard to come by. A circle of loyal friends and staff
maintain the kind of discreet silence that most other royals can no
longer count on.
</P>
<P>
   What does emerge is the occasional fond anecdote: Told that her
meal was being delayed by a dispute among her staff, many of whom
are gay, the Queen Mother sent the message, ''My compliments to the
old queens down there, but this old queen is hungry and wants her
dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain -- she is a very strong-willed and
determined woman.
</P>
<P>
   The late Lord Charteris, the present queen's private secretary
for 27 years, once said of the Queen Mother, ''She has charm, is
steel tough and loves people. Without her there would be no
monarchy. She re-established the monarchy after the abdication and
made all the difference during the war: She is the most remarkable
woman ever and we adore her.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the palace inner circle, Charteris was no
disinterested critic, but his job put him in the ideal position to
know his subject.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers have been lavishing praise on the Queen Mother
steadily as her birthday approaches, but dissenting voices have
been heard.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Wheen, columnist in the liberal Guardian newspaper,
reminded readers that in the year before Britain went to war with
Germany, the king and his queen had been strong supporters of Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasing Hitler, although
it meant abandoning Czechoslovakia to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Andrew Roberts wrote in 1994 that in their attitude to
appeasement, the royal family were ''firmly in the mainstream of
British opinion at the time; what is interesting is how long and
how strongly they continued to paddle even after the current had
changed direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The other blot on the Queen Mother's image stems from the same
era: She is seen as unforgiving in her anger at Wallis Simpson and
King Edward VIII -- later the Duke and Duchess of Windsor -- whose
determination to marry had forced her reluctant husband onto the
throne.
</P>
<P>
   She is said to believe this led to the king's early death,
although he was suffering from cancer when he died.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that the break between the brothers never
healed because the duchess was denied the dignity of H.R.H -- Her
Royal Highness -- before her title, at the Queen Mother's
insistence.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has often protested that she is not as sweet a personality
as is popularly supposed, but this has invariably been put down to
modesty,'' Roberts wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The British public may never learn the whole truth, but most are
not likely to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Publicist Max Clifford, best-known as the negotiator of
kiss-and-tell sales to the tabloids, is an experienced judge of
fact and fable.
</P>
<P>
   With the Queen Mother, he told the Sunday Times recently, ''the
myth just goes on and on. It has not been destroyed by the reality,
because we don't know what the reality is -- and deep down inside,
we don't want to know.''

<HEADLINE> Water tests not foolproof indicator of bacteria  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Environmental officials working to keep Connecticut's
beaches
and lakes safe for swimming say they are hampered by an archaic
testing system and a myriad of pollution sources.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even when a swimming area is not closed, it may not be
completely safe, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''We might give people the impression that it's 100 percent
safe, that you can't get illnesses from the water,'' said Ernest J.
Pizzuto Jr., a Department of Environmental Protection official who
supervises testing of state-park swimming areas. ''That's not the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Testing usually occurs once a week, and the sampling indicates
the potential presence of certain harmful bacteria that come from
the digestive tracts of warm-blooded animals, including birds, dogs
and cats, farm animals and people.
</P>
<P>
   The tests, however, may not reveal the presence of other, more
dangerous parasitic organisms that can easily make people sick,
Pizzuto said. The testing system is also about 80 years old and
takes up to 24 hours to deliver results.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, the tests only tell officials whether there
is likely to be a problem, and authorities advise swimmers to avoid
swallowing water and minimize hand-to-mouth contact while in the
state's shoreline and inland waters.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials often close beaches after heavy rains without
waiting for test results. Dog feces, goose droppings or sewage can
easily be washed into swimming areas by stormwater.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not rocket science that leads you to be able to identify
some of the most probable causes of these problems,'' said Fred
Banach, an assistant director in the DEP's water management bureau
who oversees beach monitoring at state parks.
</P>
<P>
   With those precautions, ''in general, Long Island Sound is safe
to swim in,'' said Edward F. Rossomando, director of the Waterborne
Disease Center at the University of Connecticut Health Center in
Farmington.
</P>
<P>
   ''The signs and symptoms of a condition would be a rash or, if
water is ingested, gastrointestinal upset such as diarrhea,''
Rossomando said.
</P>
<P>
   People in good health should be able to shake off the symptoms
in 24 to 48 hours. Those more susceptible include infants, the
elderly and people with compromised immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Because people might not realize their upset stomach is the
result of having swallowed water while swimming, outbreaks are not
always reported, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless you get a whole bunch of people getting sick together,
we never notice,'' said Dr. Bob England, Milford's health director.

<HEADLINE> Mossad Turns to Want Ads for Spies  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Mossad is looking for a few good spies.
</P>
<P>
   Rattled by a recent series of high-profile bungles, Israel's
fabled intelligence agency plans for the first time to openly
advertise for help in Israeli newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   As a new generation of Israelis comes of age in an era of a
booming high-tech economy and opportunity, the Mossad finds it must
alter its traditional methods of recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mossad ad, previewed Sunday in Israeli newspapers, heavy
blue doors emblazoned with the state insignia of the Menorah, a
seven-branch candelabra, open over the words, ''The Mossad is
Opening Up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Only you, in your heart of hearts, know that you are capable
of much more, to think differently, to do more than you thought you
could,'' the ad says. ''We offer you a future and a horizon of
service in a field in which you will be able to contribute to what
is dearest to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Going public like this may seem an anathema to the previous
generation of tightlipped spymasters, for whom secrecy and national
duty went hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mossad chief Shabtai Shavit said it was hard to him to
get used to the idea of launching a public recruitment campaign.
Previously, the agency used vague and anonymous want ads. But he
acknowledged that present-day realities had left the agency no
other choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The differences between today's youth and youth in the past is
that in the past, we saw ourselves as people committed to the norms
and values of (national) service, of Zionism,'' Shavit told Israel
radio. ''Today's youth are motivated primarily -- and I think it is
positive -- by a sense of individual accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   While the vast majority of young Israeli men still do three
years of compulsory army service and young women serve just under
two years, a growing number seek to avoid the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Shavit bemoaned what he described as a growing lack of respect
for the country's security institutions, including the army, in a
society increasingly concerned with material success.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office, which oversees the elite spy
agency known worldwide for its bold missions, issued a statement
acknowledging that the lure of the high-tech and business worlds
had put a crunch on Mossad's ability to continue its tradition of
recruiting the best and brightest.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to compete in the employment market for the few
outstanding people suited for the Mossad, the Mossad realized it
should reach out to the target population using the modern language
of the world of mass media,'' the statement said. The ad, directed
at both men and women, also appears on the prime minister's office
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's office noted that other top intelligence
agencies such as the United States' Central Intelligence Agency and
Britain's M15 have already started such recruitment campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to advertising in the media, personal letters will
be sent to potentially suitable candidates, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Shavit said the Mossad had to keep up with changes in Israel's
society, changes which perhaps foreshadow a time when peace will
make national security concerns less important.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make it (the Mossad) compatible to a new era of
negotiations, of peace efforts and coexistence with our enemies and
maybe even ultimately an era of genuine peace,'' Shavit said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Continues Gun Buyback Plan  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will continue offering federal
money for local gun buyback programs, President Clinton said
Sunday, defying House Republicans who maintain that current law
doesn't allow it.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million ''Buyback America'' program is ''an important
part of my administration's comprehensive strategy to reduce gun
violence in America,'' Clinton said in a statement. He said it
would help prevent ''an untold number of gun accidents, suicides
and crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Department of Housing and Urban Development's
''clear authority to carry out this important program, the gun
lobby and other opponents of commonsense gun safety measures
continue to challenge this initiative,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Programs in at least 30 cities are on hold because of the
dispute between HUD and Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., chairman of the
House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the department.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposal is to fund this gun buyback program with drug
elimination funds,'' Walsh said Sunday in Philadelphia, where he
was to attend the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drug elimination funds are for eliminating drugs. ... Gun
buyback programs, whether you agree or disagree with them, do not
qualify under that funding scheme,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh contends that Congress' investigative arm, the General
Accounting Office, supports his position that the such spending is
not authorized by law.
</P>
<P>
   He told The New York Times that if the buyback program
continues, housing officials could be fined or even jailed. He
said, however, that he might not seek such penalties.
</P>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo scoffed at the notion that department
officials could be thrown in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have to bully people, because they are wrong on facts and
merits,'' Cuomo said in an interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 10-month-old program has paid out $3.5 million to
buy back more than 17,000 guns in 70 cities. HUD suggests a buyback
price of $50 a gun, and local businesses are encouraged to donate
gift certificates for food, toys and other goods to individuals who
turn in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have 100 cities across the U.S. who want to do buybacks.
These are the cities who want to do buybacks because it helps,''
Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has attacked the program as
wasteful and argues that it is impossible to calculate what impact
buybacks might have on crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think gun buybacks are sort of silly. They don't have the
desired effect,'' Walsh said. Criminals, he said, will not trade
their guns for groceries or tennis shoes.

<HEADLINE> Movie Crowds Go Nutty for Murphy  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eddie Murphy and the Klump clan feasted at
the box office this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy and his multiple roles in ''Nutty Professor II: The
Klumps'' lifted the comedy sequel to a No. 1 debut with $42.7
million over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was Murphy's best-ever opening, topping the $33 million for
''Beverly Hills Cop 2'' over the four-day Memorial Day weekend in
1987 and the $29 million three-day gross for ''Dr. Dolittle'' in
1998. The sequel also beat the $25.4 million opening weekend for
''The Nutty Professor'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy reprises his roles as portly, brilliant Sherman Klump and
his lowbrow family, along with Sherman's obnoxious alter-ego Buddy
Love.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other widely distributed debut movie, ''Thomas and
the Magic Railroad,'' had a modest opening of $4.2 million,
bringing its total since premiering Wednesday to $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The family movie, based on the children's books and a series of
short TV films, combines animated talking trains and a live cast
that includes Alec Baldwin and Peter Fonda. The film averaged
$1,994 a theater playing in 2,106 cinemas, compared with ''Nutty
Professor's'' $13,167 average in 3,243 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Opening at six theaters in New York City and Los Angeles, the
French film ''Girl on the Bridge'' debuted strongly with $70,000
for an $11,667 average. The movie stars Vanessa Paradis and Daniel
Auteuil in an odd romance about a luckless performer who rescues a
woman from suicide and puts her in his knife-throwing act.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nutty Professor II'' received mixed to poor reviews. Critics
praised Murphy's performances and the technical skill that allowed
his Klump characters to interact, but many reviewers found the
movie rambling and overly gross.
</P>
<P>
   ''With certain films, PG-13 comedies especially, you're never
going to please reviewers,'' said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution
for Universal, which released the movie. ''But let's face it,
audiences love this stuff. They want to be entertained, and Eddie
Murphy does it the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall gross for this weekend's top 12 movies was $117.6
million, down 15.5 percent from the same period last year. That
puts Hollywood just a fraction ahead of last summer, when movies
grossed a record $3 billion, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of
Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie-ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Considering last year's late-summer surprises ''The Blair Witch
Project'' and ''The Sixth Sense,'' which opened a year ago next
weekend, Hollywood will have a tough time staying on record pace,
Dergarabedian said. Those two movies alone accounted for 10 percent
of the summer 1999 box office.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's almost no way you can compete with a 'Blair Witch' and
'Sixth Sense' phenomenon like you had last year,'' Dergarabedian
said.
</P>
<P>
   The worse news for Hollywood is that average ticket prices
undoubtedly have risen again this year, meaning actual movie
attendance this summer is down slightly, Dergarabedian said.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend's top film, the ghost story ''What Lies Beneath,''
held strongly in second place with $22 million, down just 26
percent from its debut. The movie has grossed $68.5 million in 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   But ''Pokemon the Movie 2000'' skidded 68 percent in its second
weekend to $6.3 million, and ''X-men'' dropped 51 percent to $11.5
million over its third weekend. ''X-men,'' which has grossed $121.8
million, hit $100 million early last week, while ''The Patriot''
this weekend became the ninth movie released in 2000 to hit that
mark, pushing its total to $101.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,'' $42.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''What Lies Beneath,'' $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''X-men,'' $11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Scary Movie,'' $8.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''The Perfect Storm,'' $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Pokemon the Movie 2000,'' $6.3 million.	   7. ''Disney's The Kid,'' $5.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''The Patriot,'' $4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Thomas and the Magic Railroad,'' $4.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''Chicken Run,'' $3.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Gulfport projecting more casino-related money; Biloxi not so sure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GULFPORT, Miss. (AP) - City leaders here believe they'll see an
increase in the amount of money that casinos put into city coffers,
but in Biloxi the feeling is not mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get into trouble when you base your budget on projected
growth and you don't get it,'' said Biloxi Mayor A.J. Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfport Mayor Bob Short's proposed city budget for 2000-2001
includes a projected 4 percent increase in casino tax collections.
</P>
<P>
   However, Short said Gulfport would be OK if revenues fall short
because gambling accounts for a much smaller percentage of the
city's budget than Biloxi's. Gambling makes up 8 percent of
Gulfport's operating budget, compared to 37 percent for Biloxi.
Gulfport receives nearly $4 million a year in casino taxes. Biloxi
rakes in more than $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not dependent on casinos,'' Short said. ''Yes, they have
brought some revenue into our budget . . . But our budget depends
on sales tax and taxes on homes.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Gulfport's projection is that for the second
quarter of this year Grand Casino Gulfport, which generates most of
that city's revenue, reported a 22 percent increase in its gross
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Since gambling was legalized both cities have received millions
from the taxes. Biloxi has benefitted more. It has nine casinos,
compared to two in Gulfport. Holloway does not expect any new
casinos to be built soon.
</P>
<P>
   However, Biloxi does have some potential hot spots for new
casino developments.
</P>
<P>
   One is the beachfront property at the foot of Main Street
between the Beau Rivage and the Biloxi Smallcraft Harbor. This is
where Full House Resorts and Hard Rock Cafe had proposed a
development.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of potential casino sites on the Back Bay of
Biloxi, but there is no good road to provide access to the sites.
The city is buying land to build a better road.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Seeks U.S. Help  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's anti-corruption bureau is
asking Washington to help retrieve millions of dollars in state
wealth allegedly stolen by some of country's richest residents --
who then fled to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine months since the army took power from Pakistan's
civilian government, officials have recovered millions of dollars
in outstanding bank loans and payments made by corrupt politicians,
bureaucrats and businesspeople who bargained their way out of jail,
said the country's chief prosecutor, Farooq Adam.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is a poor country of 140 million people where the
average annual salary is $400. It needs the money back, Adam said
in an interview Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has agreed to send a legal expert to Pakistan
to pore over evidence accumulated by the army since it tossed out
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the guilty have been allowed to plea bargain, Adam said,
''because our first priority is the return in full of the losses
caused to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have been sentenced to heavy jail terms -- including
Sharif, who was sentenced this month to 14 years in jail on a tax
evasion charge and barred from politics for 21 years. The same
judge also sentenced a former Sindh provincial minister Farooq
Sattar to 14 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-corruption commission -- formally named the National
Accountability Bureau -- has targeted businessmen, politicians and
bureaucrats. But Adam said none of the charges have been
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the newspapers which have criticized us for all sorts of
things have never once accused us of political victimization,''
said Adam. ''We have acted only on the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say the National Accountability Bureau has
tackled the corrupt with laws that deny them their fundamental
rights. Under the law anyone suspected of corruption can be jailed
for 90 days without a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has also asked Britain to return suspects and has come
up with a list of 11 names. Unlike the United States, however,
Britain does not have an extradition treaty with Pakistan. So far,
he said, the British government has resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has not asked for the return of the most prominent
politician living in Britain, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto,
who was convicted in absentia of corruption during Sharif's tenure.
The government will wait until the Supreme Court, which is hearing
an appeal of her conviction, makes a decision before deciding
whether to seek her extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto says she is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back over the last nine months, Adam said ''we have
created an aura that corruption does not pay and that the
politicians, or bureaucrats or anyone who has robbed the country
blind can be held accountable at some point.''

<HEADLINE> Experts: Lockerbie Case Unharmed  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- One witness fails to show up in
court and is found lying unconscious in his apartment, surrounded
by bottles of booze. Another mistakes a Palestinian terrorist for a
Libyan defendant in a photo lineup. Yet another changes his story
so many times that prosecutors bail on him.
</P>
<P>
   With the first stage of the Lockerbie bombing trial finished and
the court in recess until late August, a cast of unreliable
witnesses has left the impression that the prosecution's case
against two Libyans has been fatally harmed.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts say the case playing out at a special Scottish
courthouse in the Netherlands is based not on witnesses, but on
circumstantial evidence -- and that there are reams of it.
</P>
<P>
   The trial opened three months ago, accusing Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 259 people in
the air and another 11 on the ground. The prosecution expects to
wrap up their case in September, and the defense is expected to
last for months as well.
</P>
<P>
   The two have pleaded innocent, blaming Palestinian terrorists
operating in Germany at the time of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   While the defendants' strategy is to cast enough doubt on their
culpability to win a dismissal, prosecutors have meticulously
assembled a case focusing on a mass of forensic evidence and
technical detail painstakingly gathered by investigators,
scientists, and intelligence agents. Some 140 people have testified
for the prosecution during the first 40 days of hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Circumstantial evidence can be more persuasive than one or two
eyewitnesses, said Scots law of evidence specialist Fraser
Davidson, ''when there's a lot of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors hope their case doesn't hinge on the testimony of
questionable witnesses like Swiss businessman Edwin Bollier.
</P>
<P>
   Bollier's Zurich-based firm MEBO supplied explosive timers to
Libya and the former East German secret police with links to terror
groups, and may have supplied the equipment that went into the
Lockerbie bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But Bollier's weeklong testimony was so contradictory that even
the prosecution challenged his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite all the bluster of Bollier, nobody has sabotaged the
(prosecution's) case,'' said Mark Mackarel, a lecturer in
international criminal law at the University of Dundee.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim Megrahi and Fhimah, who worked for Libyan Arab
Airlines on the Mediterranean island of Malta, were really spies in
the service of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the disaster, they allegedly placed a suitcase
containing a plastic explosive onto an Air Malta jet, with
so-called ''interline'' tags routing the bag on connecting flights
through Frankfurt to London and onto the New York-bound jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   Edinburgh University professor Robert Black, a critic of the
prosecution's handling of the case, notes that no direct proof of
the defendants' guilt has been presented.
</P>
<P>
   ''They haven't got anyone pointing and saying: 'We saw Megrahi
or Fhimah or both of them manufacturing the bomb or putting a
suitcase in the interline system to Frankfurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, problems with prosecution witnesses multiplied.
</P>
<P>
   On July 12, hearings were canceled after a group of Maltese
airport workers suddenly refused to testify for reasons that remain
unclear. Prosecutors, who cannot compel non-Britons to testify, are
trying to arrange a special hearing for them in a Maltese court.
</P>
<P>
   On July 25, Frankfurt airport X-ray operator Kurt Maier who
checked the interline bags to London on the day of the tragedy,
couldn't appear, according to prosecutors, because an alcohol
overdose left him in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   While other legal scholars agree that prosecutors have not yet
satisfied the standard for proof of guilt under Scottish law, they
downplayed the importance of the few muddled witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have combinations of evidence,'' said Clare Connelly of
Glasgow University law school. ''You've got hotel stubs and visa
stamps showing that the accused were in Malta at the relevant
dates. You have got connections between the first accused (Megrahi)
and MEBO and MEBO and Libya which haven't been denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Maltese shopkeeper Toni Gauci hemmed and
hawed as tried to remember for sure whether Megrahi was the man who
purchased clothing in his store 12 years ago -- clothing that was
found in the suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be worried if someone after 12 years is absolutely
certain,'' said Connelly. ''His confusion, his lack of certainty,
the openness of this man, seemed to be much more convincing.''

<HEADLINE> State police officers operate camp for poor kids  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GOODWIN
The Daily Gazette
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOWES CAVE, N.Y. (AP) - It's 9:15 a.m. and state Trooper Eileen
McCann is barking instructions to a group of campers mustered near
the entrance to Howe Caverns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hate for you to not follow instructions,'' McCann says
in a half-serious tone to 35 young girls about to descend into the
cavern, where the temperature is constantly 52 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told you it was going to be cold,'' she said. ''I don't want
to hear any complaints about the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to State Police Summer Camp, which serves poor children
from around the state. The State Police have run the camp at their
Albany recruit academy for 24 years, acting as tutors, mentors,
counselors and friends to hundreds of children.
</P>
<P>
   Besides offering a traditional vacation-style experience, the
program screens for eyesight and health problems, as well as signs
of abuse or neglect. It also aims to impress children with a
positive image of police.
</P>
<P>
   The camp costs children and families nothing. The nonprofit
Trooper Foundation picks up most of the cost. Businesses also
donate eyeglasses, cruises, and food.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're dealing with a lot of children that are in group homes,
foster homes or have single-parent families,'' said Sgt. John
Leavitt, who was directed the camp since 1984. ''That's what we're
going for.''
</P>
<P>
   Each week, officers from the agency's 10 regional troops gather
children, ages 9 to 12, from their regions and bring them to
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters are referred by social services agencies, orphanages
and by officers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, campers live in dormitories similar to those
occupied by academy recruits. Counselors try to teach
self-discipline and children rarely stray from that message,
Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We impress upon them that they are representing the state
police,'' said McCann, a former school teacher who joined the State
Police 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The troopers' aim is simple: provide the children with a
weeklong respite from what, in many cases, is a rough home life.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of these children have seen more violence than you or I
will see in our lifetime,'' said Leavitt, a 24-year state police
veteran. He is stationed at the academy year round and handles
trooper training.
</P>
<P>
   The first camp lasted two weeks with about 40 boys. The camp was
expanded to include girls in the 1980s, and it's been growing ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   This year's camp, which opened July 10, will run seven weeks:
three for girls, three for boys and one week for a co-ed group.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt said he expects 336 children this year.
</P>
<P>
   The campers' days are filled with trips to the Baseball Hall of
Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, and the Great Escape amusement park
near Lake George. Meals are served and campers are taken on field
trips to McDonald's and Friendly's.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt tries to cram as many activities in as possible. ''A lot
of these kids are starved for affection and we're giving them
affection,'' Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   One goal, Leavitt said, is to inform youngsters about police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's geared toward showing them our image is not just making
arrests,'' he said. ''Their prior contact with a police officer may
have been on a negative level. We're trying to make this a
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Campers frequently arrive shy and stand-offish; some are
homesick, Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the end of the week, some kids are crying because they
don't want to leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Mitchell and Tasha Thornhill, both 17, attended in 1996
and were invited back this year as counselors. They are the first
former campers invited to serve as counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best camp,'' Thornhill said. ''You only get to
come here once. All the other camps you can go to as much as you
want. That's how you know this one is the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many campers, Mitchell, who lives in the Bronx, said she
was suspicious of police when she first arrived. That changed
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt so proud when they asked me,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw how the state police help people, not just arrest
kids,'' she said. ''That's what changed my attitude about the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business when the children arrive is a
medical examination. In addition to illness and injuries, doctors
look for signs of abuse or neglect. Leavitt said evidence of child
abuse is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We investigate it,'' he said. ''This year, we've initiated a
complaint with the child abuse hotline.''
</P>
<P>
   Campers are given dental and eye examinations. Opticians give
free glasses to those who need them. Some needed glasses for a long
time, but don't get their first pair until at camp, Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some of their homes,'' he said. ''It was a question of food
(or) glasses.''

<HEADLINE> Ebola Bleeding Cause Discovered  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have identified the portion of the
Ebola virus that causes massive bleeding, the frightening hallmark
of the deadly disease that has begun appearing periodically in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ebola is not common or widespread, it has received much
attention since first being reported in 1976 because of the fear
generated by the heavy bleeding and the disease's 90 percent death
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers studying Ebola at the National Institutes of Health
found a sugar-containing molecule called glycoprotein sticking out
from the surface of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   In test tube experiments, they discovered a portion of this
protein caused it to destroy endothelial cells. Endothelial cells
line blood vessels, and by attacking them the protein caused the
vessels to leak, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The team, led by Zhi-Yong Yang and Dr. Gary Nabel of the NIH
Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, Md., reported their findings
in the August issue of the journal Nature Medicine, published
Tuesday. The study results were released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   No vaccine or specific treatment exists for Ebola, but the
researchers' finding may help point the way toward development of
new drugs or vaccines aimed at reducing or preventing the disease.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ebola generally has struck in remote regions of Africa.
The outbreaks included one in 1995 in Zaire that claimed 245 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is named for the Zairian river flowing through the
region where it first appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Strains of Ebola found in Zaire, Sudan and the Ivory Coast have
been fatal to humans. A separate strain affects monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studying glycoprotein found that the part of the
protein that becomes modified by sugars is toxic to cells infected
by the virus. When they made forms of the protein that lacked the
sugars, the protein no longer destroyed blood vessels.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Blamed in Violence  </HEADLINE>
By CARLA SALAZAR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Schoolteacher Maria Teresa Rosas peered up
Sunday at the fire-gutted ruins of a state bank where six people
died in anti-government riots. She knows who she blames for the
destruction: President Alberto Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knows full well that the constitution only allows two
terms. So what's he doing serving an illegal term as president?''
said Rosas, 49, who once supported the president for his crackdown
on leftist rebels and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   She, like many in this South American country of 26 million, has
turned against a president who rode popular support to victory in
1990 and a landslide re-election in 1995. Then, with critics
increasingly accusing him of authoritarian rule, he put himself
forward for an unprecedented third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The riots erupted on Friday as Fujimori was being sworn in, two
months after elections that opposition challenger Alejandro Toledo
boycotted saying Fujimori was trying to fix the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''What (Fujimori) doesn't realize is that more than half of Peru
doesn't believe in him any longer,'' said Rosas, studying the
sooty, shattered building where six security guards died.
</P>
<P>
   However, while the dead from the riots were buried Sunday,
pro-government media were putting blame for the unrest on Toledo,
who organized anti-Fujimori demonstrations by hundreds of thousands
of protesters Friday that the newspapers said resulted in mob
violence.
</P>
<P>
   A special prosecutor has begun probing the six deaths, 80
injuries and the torching of public buildings during street clashes
between riot police and demonstrators. Authorities said those
responsible could face charges ranging from disturbing the peace to
homicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are filled with indignation and utter condemnation for the
marches called by Mr. Toledo, which have resulted in the loss of
innocent lives, of those just doing their duty of guarding the
bank,'' said an executive of the burned bank, Juan Carlos Balarezo.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Saturday, Fujimori scoffed at opposition claims that
a march last week by tens of thousands was a march of ''peaceful''
resistance. He said organizers showed themselves for what they
truly are, forces for ''violence and chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Others disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alberto Marquez, a 42-year-old merchant, said Fujimori's
harsh criticism of Toledo was a government tactic to retain power.
''He is practically a dictator,'' said Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   Severino Castillo, a 52-year-old engineer in Ayacucho, condemned
the violence, which he said damages Peru's international standing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nonetheless, one has to make clear that a large part of the
population is, with good reason, demanding that the president
restore democratic governability,'' said Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   The Andean city of Ayacucho, 230 miles southeast of Lima, was
hit hard by violence by the Shining Path insurgency until it was
crushed by Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   Others said Fujimori was strong medicine for hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Sotomayor, 36, said he was pleased with Fujimori's first
decade in power as economic chaos and the Marxist insurgency were
both curbed. ''It would have been extraordinary if he had retired
after 10 years because he at least gave us peace and economic
stability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former president Fernando Belaunde Terry said another five years
of Fujimori was worrisome, citing a need for stronger democratic
institutions and full respect for constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very grave fault to try and extend one's mandate for
15 years'' said the 87-year-old Terry, who was toppled by the
military in 1968 -- the start of 12 years of military dictatorship.
He returned for a 5-year term after democracy was restored in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Levy Tones Down Threat to Quit  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's foreign minister on Sunday toned down
his threat to quit Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government, saying
that he would leave by midweek only if Barak does not make an
''effort'' to bring anti-Camp David hawks into government.
</P>
<P>
   David Levy opposed the far-reaching concessions Barak offered at
the U.S.-sponsored summit with the Palestinians and considered
resigning last week after the summit failed.
</P>
<P>
   Levy's resignation and the exit of his two-man faction from
Barak's One Israel party would be another blow to Barak's battered
coalition, plunged into crisis on the eve of Camp David two weeks
ago, when three hawkish parties quit in protest at the summit. That
left Barak with a minority government.
</P>
<P>
   However, Levy's Wednesday ultimatum was short of the resignation
Barak had feared. All Barak had to do was make an ''effort'' to
invited the hard-line Likud party into government for Levy to agree
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is reportedly against inviting the Likud into government,
believing that would cripple his efforts to close a peace deal with
the Palestinians within months. Although the most recent talks
failed, the sides have already resumed talks.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is probably safe for Barak to make an ''effort'' to
invite the Likud to join -- he knows he will likely be turned down.
Likud leader Ariel Sharon on Sunday repeated his steadfast
opposition to joining Barak's government, calling for early
elections.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, Barak indicated that he was contemplating an
approach to Sharon, comparing such a proposal to his efforts with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must make peace or at least an interim agreement with
opponents ... in order to go forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By setting a Wednesday deadline for the ''effort,'' Levy
committed himself to voting against a no-confidence motion on
Monday -- the last parliament session before it goes into recess.
</P>
<P>
   That means Barak will likely survive the no-confidence vote,
giving his government a lease on life at least until the Knesset
reconvenes in October.
</P>
<P>
   Barak broke long-standing taboos at Camp David by offering the
Palestinians concessions on sharing Jerusalem, handing over the
West Bank's strategic Jordan Valley, and allowing some Palestinian
refugees to return. The talks broke up after the Palestinians
insisted on full sovereignty in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's critics say that by showing Israel's full hand at Camp
David, and offering the Palestinians a degree of autonomy in
Jerusalem, he has given the Palestinians the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, whose constituency of Sephardic Jews -- those of Middle
Eastern, not European, origin -- is perceived as hawkish, balked at
the proposals and refused to accompany Barak to Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the foreign minister says Israelis need to stand
together, because the Camp David proposals has plunged their
country into crisis while Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat tours
Arab countries to shore up Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ''My position has been reinforced that what is needed at this
time is the establishment of a national unity government,'' Levy
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after meeting with Barak, Levy already sounded as if he
was ready to stay in government.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe (Barak) will make the supreme effort'' to meet his
demands, he told Israel radio.

<HEADLINE> Spain Mourning Slain Politician  </HEADLINE>
By MAR ROMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Thousands marched in silence in cities
across Spain on Sunday evening to mourn the slaying of a
politician, the latest death in a string of attacks blamed on
Basque separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Maria Jauregui, a 49-year-old Socialist Party politician,
was shot at close range Saturday by two men thought to be members
of the separatist group ETA. The gunmen escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest rally was in the northern coastal city of San
Sebastian, where 20,000 people walked through the center of town
behind a banner that read ''That's enough, ETA no''.
</P>
<P>
   The march brought together political rivals in a show of unity
against ETA, and was led by Jauregui's widow, Maria Isabel Lasa,
and his 19-year-old daughter, Maria.
</P>
<P>
   Other silent vigils were held in Madrid, Seville, Pamplona and
other Spanish cities to demand an end to separatist violence that
has killed nearly 800 people in a three-decade campaign for Basque
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who visited the Basque
region earlier Sunday to pay his condolences to Jauregui's family,
said attacks by ETA will not change the government's tough line on
the armed group and warned separatists that they ''have reasons to
be worried, very worried, and they will soon see why''
</P>
<P>
   Aznar's government refuses to talk with ETA until the
separatists lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II on Sunday joined the condemnation, denouncing
''the wave of terrorism lashing Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   Jauregui was killed Saturday when two men walked into a cafe in
the Basque region, where he was on vacation, and shot him twice in
the head. He was the seventh person killed in attacks blamed on the
armed group this year.
</P>
<P>
   ETA has allegedly increased its offensive this month, with at
least 10 attacks. The recent increase in attacks has inflamed anger
against ETA and criticism of the Basque regional government, which
is being urged to break ties with politicians close to ETA.
</P>
<P>
   ETA -- a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Liberty
-- has been fighting for an independent homeland in northern Spain
and southwestern France since the late 1960s. Basques have a unique
and ancient language and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Jauregui, who was once a militant of the Spanish Communist Party
and was detained during late Gen. Francisco Franco's 1939-75
dictatorship, served as the Interior Ministry's regional delegate
from 1994-96, coinciding with the last term of Socialist Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   During his two-year term, Jauregui backed the investigation of
death squads sponsored by the prominent Socialist officials that
targeted suspected Basque separatists in the early 1980s. Jauregui
had been living in Chile for the past three years as a director of
Aldeasa, a Spanish chain of airport duty-free shops.

   The diminutive guard for the Adirondack open women's basketball

better part of the last decade.
</P>

   Fiore, the all-time leading scorer at Canisius College and now
women's coach at Johnstown High School, scored 16 points and
Melanie Halker of Watervliet had 21 as Adirondack defeated New York
City 103-95 on Sunday in the championship game at Binghamton
University.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is awesome!'' said Fiore, whose 3-pointer with 7:04
remaining gave Adirondack a 75-67 lead. ''This one was tough. I've
been out of school for three years. Getting back into shape was
challenging. I don't have time to run and do all those things.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She finally got one,'' Adirondack coach Theresa Wenzel said.
''It had to do with teamwork and pure desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Holohan added 18 points, Mary McKissack had 12, and
Jolene Johnston 10 for Adirondack.
</P>
<P>
   Fiore, who did not play for Adirondack when it won gold in 1997,
said it didn't take long to realize that this team was different
from the other eight she had played on.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the first day of practice, this team came in and worked
as hard as it could,'' said Fiore, whose basketball low point was
losing the state championship on her home court at Queensbury High
School in 1992. ''Everybody got along very well. We worked
together. I don't know if I've ever been on a team where we've
worked that hard together. We knew that it was a special team, that
it was going to be tough to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, New York City made it difficult, building an early lead
behind the hot shooting of Cindy Johnson, who scored 19 of her
game-high 28 points in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   Antoinette Saitta had 18 points, Carolyn Harvey had 17, and
Kimberly MacMillan 12 for New York.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Catrina Washington with 2:29 left in the first
half put New York up 42-34, but two baskets in the final minute by
former Siena star Cori Drummond made it 42-40 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went in at halftime and said, 'You've worked too hard to
let it slip away. Stop playing scared and start playing like a team
instead of individuals,' '' Wenzel said. ''And that's what they
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied four times in the second half before
Adirondack went on an eight-point run. A lay-in by Drummond gave
Adirondack a 70-63 lead midway through the period and New York was
unable to rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''The second half we really picked up our defense,'' said
Halker, who also starred for Siena in college. ''She (Johnson) was
ready to win the game. In the first half, it was hard stopping her.
But in the second half we focused on her more.''
</P>
<P>
   Two free throws by Fiore, who missed only one of 12 foul shots,
gave Adirondack an 84-74 lead with 4:38 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''We couldn't get it together,'' said Johnson, who plays college
ball for Delaware. ''We fell apart with the offense. We weren't
running the plays the way we were in the first half, and I think it
fell apart a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Adirondack hit 13 free throws in a row in the final three
minutes to secure the victory, its second win over New York in as
many days. Adirondack won Saturday night 105-93.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we enjoyed playing that team again,'' Fiore
said. ''It's hard to play teams back-to-back, especially playing
them at eight at night and then coming back and playing them at
noon. We knew what they did, but they knew us, too. It came down to
who had the legs at the end of the game. Everybody was pretty
tired, but when you want something as badly as we wanted it you
don't think about being tired anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fiore, the elation of winning might have to last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if I'll play next year. This could be my last
one,'' she said. ''This was my goal and I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Adirondack women beat Central 5-3 for the ice hockey
gold on Sunday, the Adirondack men's ice hockey team wasn't so
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Needing just a tie against the Western region to earn its first
gold medal since 1987, Adirondack lost the seesaw game 5-4 when
Mark Langdon scored for Western with 14 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Western had built 3-0 lead in the first period on power-play
goals by Jeffrey Rasmussen, Nicholas Buser and James Lecuyer.
Adirondack then rallied on goals by Ken Porter, Brian Fage,
Jonathan Hill and Trevor Gilligan to take a 4-3 lead after two
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon's goal at 6:11 of the third made it 4-4. Then, with
nothing to lose and everything to gain, Western coach Peter
Schneider pulled goalie Kevin Amborski for an extra attacker in the
final minute.
</P>
<P>
   With 14 seconds remaining, Langdon scored again, this time off a
scramble in the crease in front of goalie Bryan McDonald to give
Western its first gold medal after four straight bronzes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big thing for the Western (team),'' Schneider said.
''It's always been a tradition for Western to have a good, strong
team here. The second period, Adirondack played great. It was
probably our worst period of the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Adirondack players thought the decisive play should have been
whistled dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason why it's such a heartbreak was we thought Mac had
it,'' Adirondack defenseman Tim Powers said. ''He had it for a good
two seconds and it kept getting jarred. That's the hardest way to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Amborski finished with 21 saves and McDonald stopped 33 shots.
The last one he never saw until the red light was on behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just popped out to me and I put it home,'' Langdon said.
''The whole third period we were dominating. They only had one shot
and we had 16. We knew we were going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The final medal counts by region ended like this: Western led
with 89 golds and 252 total; Central had 218 medals, 54 of them
gold; Long Island had 191, including 67 gold; Adirondack had 165,
including 50 gold; Hudson Valley had 158, including 52 gold; and
New York City had 154, including 70 gold.
</P>
<P>
   New York City continued its dominance in the open men's
basketball final with its third straight gold medal. St. John's
teammates Reggie Jessie and Anthony Glover combined for 37 points
in an 83-64 win over Western. Chad Thomas had 22 points for the
losers.
</P>
<P>
   In the scholastic men's title game, Central edged New York City
79-74 for its second straight gold medal and fourth in five years.
Curtis Allen had 23 points, Brian Montanaro 15, Matthew Gorman 13
and Michael Graham 10 for the winners. Johnny Sikiric paced New
York with 26 points and Kevin Bishop had 17.
</P>
<P>
   In the scholastic women's final, Western used its size inside to
dominate the boards, beating Central 66-60 for its third straight
gold. Central cut what had been a double-digit lead to 59-56 in the
final minute behind Laura Scordino of Vestal and Stefanie Collins
of Montour Falls, who each scored 17 points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But Eva Cunningham, who had 15 points for Western, hit six free
throws in the final 45 seconds to secure the victory. Shanna Cyrus
and Lindsay Brent each scored 16 points for the winners.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Valley team had a strong showing in scholastic
swimming. Leading the way were: Kiersten Koronowicz of Newburgh,
who had two individual golds in freestyle and four team silvers;
Chris Raniere of Florida, Orange County, who won four gold medals -
two individual and two team - and two silvers; and Nat Moore, also
of Newburgh, who won three golds and three silvers.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson Valley also won the gold medal in open women's field
hockey with a 2-1 overtime victory on Saturday over Adirondack.
Lifon Huynh of Patterson got the game-winner on a penalty stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In volleyball, it was more of the same of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   In the scholastic women's division, Long Island beat two-time
defending champion Western 3-2, 15-9 in the final game. Western has
been in the gold-medal game 18 straight times and has met Long
Island for the gold six straight times.
</P>
<P>
   In scholastic men's volleyball, Western won its fifth straight
gold, beating Long Island 3-0 in the finals. It's the longest
active team gold-medal streak in the Empire State Games, and Long
Island has been the victim each time.
</P>
<P>
   Western also made it into the open men's volleyball gold-medal
game by beating two-time defending champion New York City 3-2. But
Long Island won the championship 3-2 and also took gold in the open
women's division with a 3-1 victory over Central.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, Long Island won all five of its games, beating
Hudson Valley 8-4 for the gold medal. Matt Gidaly of Huntington hit
two homers and had three RBIs. Long Island broke a 4-4 tie with
four runs in the bottom of the fifth to give Nick Conte the win in
relief and pin the loss on Jime Mallon.
</P>
<P>
   Adirondack won the baseball bronze, beating Central 7-6 when
Derek Wayman of Ballston Lake hit a solo homer leading off the
bottom of the seventh inning. Wayman also had a three-run double
and Aaron Buckley of Port Byron drove in two runs as Adirondack's
gold-medal streak ended at three.
</P>
<P>
   Western third baseman James Kingley also starred - with his
glove - turning a triple play in a 4-2 loss to Central. He snared a
line drive with runners at the corners, stepped on the bag at third
and then threw to first to bring the crowd to its feet.
</P>
<P>
   Over the four-day, Olympic-style competition, 97 records were
set, all but 11 of them by Masters competitors. The biggest stars
were in the swimming pool: Sue Marvel set five records in the 80-84
age bracket; Raymond Radzivila set four in the 75-79 age bracket;
Jack Howell set four in the 70-74 age bracket; Mark Grashow set
five in the 55-59 age bracket; and Patricia Pagliarulo and Richard
Marchant, who each set four in the 50-54 age bracket.
</P>
<P>
   John Sheridan set Masters standards in the shot put and hammer
and Edwin Lukens did the same in the javelin for male competitors
at least 75 years old.

<HEADLINE> Ten Soccer Fans Detained in Sweden  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Police arrested 10 soccer fans after
about 100 people scuffled Sunday evening following a match between
two Swedish teams.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting broke out as fans of IFK Goteborg were heading to
buses parked outside the stadium after IFK defeated AIK Solna 1-0.
Police quickly separated the two groups and arrested 10 people for
rioting, spokesman Ulf Goeranzon said.
</P>
<P>
   Goeranzon said no injuries were reported and the other IFK fans
boarded the buses and returned to Goteborg, 300 miles southwest of
Stockholm. Solna sits just outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Police earlier had detained five people for disturbing the peace
and five people for drunkenness in connection with the game,
Goeranzon said, adding that more details were not available pending
questioning of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's scuffle followed some overnight fighting between fans
in which two people were arrested for assault.

<HEADLINE> Rhodes officially jumps into House race against Maloney  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - New York picked up its second black GOP
House candidate Sunday, as former New York Daily News vice
president for communications Adrienne Rhodes announced she will
challenge U.S. Rep. Carol Maloney, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that not enough is being done to inspire hope among
the youth of the city of New York or in America in general,'' said
Rhodes, 39, who grew up near Philadelphia in Haddonfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not enough is being done to instill confidence or gain civic
participation among the youth of the city of New York or in America
in general. I want to have a role in changing this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, who is white, is an eight-year incumbent in a district
that covers most of the East Side and portions of the West Side of
Manhattan, Astoria and Long Island City, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   New York now has two of the three black female House candidates
in the nation. Joan Johnson, 66, is seeking U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio's
Long Island seat while he challenges Hillary Clinton for the
state's U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will give one of the opening addresses for the
convention on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The other black Republican woman seeking a House seat is
Jennifer Carroll, a retired Naval officer challenging Democratic
incumbent Rep. Corrine Brown of Florida. The only black Republican
now in the House is Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma. There are 28 black
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes said the candidacies the black New York women should put
to rest the question of whether the Republican Party can be
inclusive to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is it that the Republicans have found two people who are
qualified and worthy of being positioned as nominees for Congress,
one 66 and one 39, from across the board?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe in personal effort, personal sacrifice and limited
government, and that is the core of the Republican philosophy,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes left The Daily News in February to set up her candidacy,
but did not officially accept the nomination to run against Maloney
until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have 20 years experience in communicating effectively, in
coalition building and in strategic planning, in focusing on
priorities and getting the job done,'' she said. ''That's what we
need in Washington today.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she will improve public education with solutions such
as more charter alternative schools. ''We need creative and
innovated approaches to education. We are failing our children and
ultimately, we're going to fail our nation if we don't fix that
problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, who received a bachelor's degree in marketing fashion
and related products at the Fashion Institute of Technology at the
State University of New York, had been a vice president at The
Daily News since 1993. She previously had been director of
communications at the United Negro College Fund.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes a Swipe at Cheney  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Lobbing a partisan spitball as Republicans
gathered for their nominating convention Sunday, President Clinton
said GOP vice presidential candidate Richard Cheney's long-ago vote
against recommending freedom for Nelson Mandela ''takes your breath
away.''
</P>
<P>
   At a luncheon that raised as estimated $250,000 for Democrats,
Clinton said Republicans are trying to appear more moderate than
they truly are.
</P>
<P>
   ''I bet butter won't melt in their mouths,'' at the Philadelphia
convention this week, Clinton said to delighted chortles from the
audience of personal injury lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, all the big publicity is about, in the last few days, an
amazing vote cast by their vice presidential nominee when he was in
Congress against letting Nelson Mandela out of jail,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That takes your breath away,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   As a Wyoming Republican congressman, Cheney voted against a
nonbinding 1986 resolution calling for Mandela's release and for
U.S. recognition of Mandela's African National Congress. Cheney
said Sunday his vote reflected the view then that the ANC was ''a
terrorist organization,'' not that he favored keeping Mandela in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton mentioned the Mandela matter by way of introduction to
his larger point. The vote, Clinton said, is less alarming than
what he claims is the GOP-led Senate's concerted effort to keep
minority judges off the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm worried about the people now that I've tried to put on the
court of appeals, who are African-American and Hispanic who are
being held in political jail because they can't get a hearing from
this Republican Senate,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And their nominee won't say a word about it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   At the lunch and a later address to about 3,000 people at the
Association of Trial Lawyers of America, Clinton held up the 4th
Circuit Court of Appeals as example.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court hears cases from Maryland, Virginia,
West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina -- a region with
more black residents than any other federal court jurisdiction. The
4th Circuit has never had a black judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been trying for seven long years to fix that, and they've
blocked every one,'' of his nominees, Clinton said. ''They're so
determined to keep an African-American off that they have allowed a
25 percent vacancy rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has nominated three blacks to be 4th Circuit judges but
none has been confirmed. Two nominations are still pending, but
there are no Senate confirmation hearings scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Warsh, a Southfield, Mich., lawyer in the crowd
Sunday, said that the slow pace to fill judgeships has created a
backlog of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Warsh noted the trial lawyers group has generally supported
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're saying he's speaking to the choir, you're right, but
the choir knows what's going on,'' with federal judgeships, Warsh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the Democrats have courted personal injury lawyers
in recent years, and reaped lucrative benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause, a nonpartisan group that advocates campaign
finance reform, calculates that trial lawyers gave $2.7 million to
Democrats in 1999. That is some 1,000 times more than trial lawyers
donated to Republicans last year, and twice the amount donated in
the same period during the last election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first president to address the trial lawyers'
annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers are grateful to Clinton in part because he insists
any proposal to reform Medicare must guarantee a patient can sue
over poor care. Also, the national multibillion dollar tobacco
settlement negotiated during his term represents a potential
windfall for personal injury lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush supports tort
reform that could limit the size of damages awarded in personal
injury cases.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinian Negotiators Meet  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Far-reaching proposals for a permanent
Israeli-Palestinian peace did not necessarily die when the Camp
David summit failed, negotiators said Sunday, launching efforts to
bring the two sides' leaders back together.
</P>
<P>
   When the summit failed last week, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said all proposals on the table -- including long-standing
taboo-breakers on control of Jerusalem, borders of a Palestinian
state and the future of Palestinian refugees -- were now
''invalid.'' But on Sunday, in their first meetings since the
summit, negotiators suggested the groundbreaking U.S.-brokered
proposals were still on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were many important things at the summit, and we must
preserve these and move forward,'' Israeli Police Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami said after meeting Mohammed Dahlan, a top Palestinian
negotiator, in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlan echoed: ''We want to protect what we achieved at Camp
David, we don't want to waste those discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahlan said he and Ben-Ami discussed plans to bring Barak back
together soon with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, although they
had not yet settled on a date.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the summit's failure, each side was surprised at how far
the other was ready to go in breaking taboos. Israel, for the first
time, discussed shared -- if limited -- sovereignty of Jerusalem with
the Palestinians. It also proposed compromises on accommodating the
Palestinian refugees created by Israel's independence war.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians discussed the prospect of allowing Israel to keep
lands it captured in the 1967 Mideast war -- the first Arab
negotiators ever to do so. Israel wants to keep about 20 percent of
the West Bank, where it has established high concentrations of
Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of Jerusalem finally broke the two-week summit in the
Maryland hills: The Palestinians were willing to settle for nothing
less than full sovereignty in the eastern half of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was especially adamant that Israel concede sovereignty
over a mosque compound in Jerusalem's walled Old City. The site is
considered the third holiest in Islam, but it also abuts the
Western Wall, a remnant of the ancient Jewish temple that attracts
hundreds of thousands of worshippers each year.
</P>
<P>
   According to an Israeli television report, Barak told Sunday's
weekly Cabinet meeting that Arafat turned down a U.S. plan that
would have answered most of Arafat's demands in east Jerusalem --
but would have delayed an agreement on the sensitive mosque
compound for 20 years. He also turned down a U.S. proposal to sign
an agreement ending the conflict now, leaving another two years to
work out a mechanism for sharing Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday in the official Palestinian Authority
newspaper, the speaker of the Palestinian parliament expressed
distrust of Israeli plans for Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Qureia said Israel offered the Palestinians custodianship
over Haram el-Sharif, the mosque compound, but insisted on
retaining sovereignty. If the Israelis maintained sovereignty over
the site, ''in a few years ... they can come and destroy or
demolish the mosque, and this is one of the most dangerous
proposals I have ever heard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fact that Jerusalem was even discussed at the
summit was already affecting how Israelis viewed the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Meretz, a party in Barak's coalition, announced that
Israel had ''no reason to control Arab neighborhoods in east
Jerusalem, nor Muslim holy sites in east Jerusalem.'' Meretz is the
most dovish of Barak's partners. Nonetheless, it was the first time
in Israel's history that a Zionist party renounced claims to any
part of east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, meanwhile, there were signs of increasing Palestinian
readiness to postpone a Sept. 13 deadline for statehood: visiting
Palestine National Council Speaker Salim Zanoun, until now the
Palestinian official who most adamantly insisted the deadline be
met, said the date was no longer set in stone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Declaring statehood in the designated time is not a
requisite,'' he said in remarks carried by Jordan's official Petra
news agency. ''If we felt that circumstances require that we
postpone that until the end of the year, we will do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure remained on Arafat elsewhere in the Arab world not
to cave on the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat met Sunday with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who
after the talks said that the basis for any peace settlement in the
Middle East requires ''complete Arab sovereignty'' over the city, a
member of Arafat's delegation said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who later went to Yemen, is on a tout of Arab countries
to drum up support for his stance in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Delasin Wins Giant Eagle Playoff  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOWLAND, Ohio (AP) -- Rookie Dorothy Delasin, competing without a
sponsor, became at 19 the youngest player to win an LPGA event in
25 years when she defeated Pat Hurst in a playoff Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 U.S. Women's Amateur champion birdied the last hole of
regulation to get into a playoff, then won with a par on the second
extra hole of the Giant Eagle Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The Californian sidestepped a half-dozen contenders in the final
few holes to pick up her first top-10 finish. She is the youngest
winner on the tour since Amy Alcott took the Orange Blossom Classic
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Delasin collected $150,000 -- almost $30,000 more than she had
picked up in her first 18 tournaments combined.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Arsenio, caddied for her. After Delasin made a
3-foot putt to win, her father held the flagstick over his head and
cheered loudly. After hugging Hurst, he wrapped up his daughter in
a bear hug and carried her around the green.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst, seeking her second win of the year, barely missed her
10-foot par putt -- catching the lip as the ball sped past on the
left side on the decisive hole. She had found trouble in the right
rough off the tee, then put her approach into the rough fronting
the par-4 hole. Her chip came up short, setting up the touchy putt
for par.
</P>
<P>
   Both players had parred the first playoff hole.
</P>
<P>
   Delasin, who had rounds of 71, 67 and 67 to finish at 11-under
205, began the day tied for seventh place and was a shot behind
Hurst and Laura Philo as she walked to the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   But Delasin made a 12-foot downhill birdie putt put to tie for
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst, who closed with a 2-under 70 after earlier rounds of 66
and 69, saved a spot in the playoff with a delicate, 5-footer for
par after first landing 60 feet away on the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Philo, playing in the group between those of Hurst and Delasin,
didn't fare as well. Tied for the lead when she teed off on the
final hole, she found the deep bunker with her drive and was forced
to blast out into the fairway. From there she hit her iron approach
pin high but into the left rough, then chipped to 5 feet and missed
the bogey putt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that sour ending to her 71, Philo shared third place
with Wendy Ward and Mi Hyun Kim. Ward shot a final-round 69 and Kim
a 67 to also finish at 207.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Redman, native who had a piece of the lead until Hurst
birdied at the 14th hole, double-bogeyed the 15th and bogeyed the
closing hole to cap a 74 that left her alone in sixth place.
</P>
<P>
   Se Ri Pak, who started the day tied for the lead with Redman,
faded with four bogeys in the last eight holes and had a 75.
</P>
<P>
   Delasin's golf bag was a small, thin nylon model with tripod
legs -- unlike the bulky leather models covered in advertising that
many of the other pros play.
</P>
<P>
   She wore no logos on her clothes, and there was no prominent
trademark on her ball, although she did draw a smiley-face logo --
with its tongue hanging out -- on both her visor and her ball.
</P>
<P>
   During the presentation of the first-place check and trophy,
Delasin began crying and got a nosebleed. She had to apply ice to
the back of her neck to stop the bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   The victory vaulted Delasin from 52nd to 22nd on the LPGA money
list.

<HEADLINE> US Soccer Loses To Norway  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The United States women's soccer team woke
up too late.
</P>
<P>
   Second-half substitute Cindy Parlow scored off a rebound from
short range in the last minute as the Americans lost 2-1 to Norway
on Sunday night in their final tuneup for the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Playing before 15,762 fans at Ulleval Stadium, a record turnout
for women's soccer in Norway, the Americans had another
disappointing outing after tying the Norwegians 1-1 thanks to an
own-goal by the hosts Thursday at Tromso, north of the Arctic
Circle.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last 20 minutes we had an urgency when we went down
2-0, but we need a bit more consistency with that, a little more
urgency on the ball and getting shots off and a little more
threatening,'' said Judie Foudy, who played for the 1996 Olympic
and 1999 world championship team.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach April Heinrichs, who scored twice in the first-ever
game between the two countries in Minneapolis 13 years ago, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They showed their urgency in the last 20 minutes, not in the
first 70,'' she said. ''It just shows once again how small the
margin is between the top five teams in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the U.S. team has showed when it does play with urgency to
attack to score goals, it's an exciting style, it's a fun style and
it's a winning style. The next step is just becoming more
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans lost their third match this year to Norway -- the
first two also by one goal in Florida in February -- and they go
into the Sydney Games with a 2-3-1 record against the co-Olympic
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Norway had the better chances in the first half, although U.S.
goalkeeper Siri Mullinix was never seriously tested. The best one
came in the 30th minute, when Dagny Mellgren headed just wide.
Three minutes earlier, Kristine Lilly's goal was annulled because
of offside.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Serlenga, who subbed for veteran Michelle Akers at the
start of the second half, had a powerful near-miss early in the
second half when she hit the right post with a 25-yard drive. Mia
Hamm set up the play with a nice cross to Brandi Chastain, who
tipped the ball on to the uncovered Serlenga.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans didn't get much closer to scoring after that until
the final minute of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Norway took the lead in the 62nd minute when Chastain and
Danielle Slaton were too slow on the ball, Mellgren chasing down
Monica Knudsen's lob pass and beating Mullinix with a shot to the
right corner.
</P>
<P>
   Norway went two up on an own-goal in the 81st minute, when
Christie Pearce tried to clear the ball in front of Mullinix but
accidentally shot it past the U.S. goalie.
</P>
<P>
   The two-game series was the first by a U.S. women's team in
Norway. The teams met for the first time in Scandinavia in the 1995
World Cup semifinal in neighboring Sweden, Norway edging the
Americans 1-0 before eventually winning the final against Germany.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 7, Royals 6, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG HORST
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Gerald Williams homered and hit an RBI
single in the 10th inning as Tampa Bay survived a bizarre eighth
inning to beat the Kansas City Royals 7-6 for a four-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays, who took a 6-2 lead into the bottom of the
eighth inning, won their fifth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Johnson led off the 10th with an infield single off Jerry
Spradlin (4-3). Two outs later, Johnson stole second, setting up
Williams' game-winning hit to left field. Williams has driven in 27
runs this month, setting a Tampa Bay record.
</P>
<P>
   Tanyon Sturtze (2-2) pitched the ninth and Roberto Hernandez
worked the 10th for his 20th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals rallied for four runs in the eighth helped along by
two passed balls, two wild pitches, two walks and a hit batter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon drew a leadoff walk off Doug Creek. Estaban Yan
came in and gave up a single to Rey Sanchez and the runners
advanced to second and third on a passed ball by John Flaherty.
</P>
<P>
   Yan then hit Mike Sweeney on the back of the right hand. Sweeney
left the game for pinch-runner Jeff Reboulet with a bruised hand.
</P>
<P>
   Damon scored on Flaherty's second passed ball of the inning, and
one out later, Joe Randa hit a two-run double. Mark Guthrie
relieved and struck out Mark Quinn before throwing a wild pitch
that sent Randa to third.
</P>
<P>
   After Dave McCarty was intentionally walked, Hector Ortiz tied
the game with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays took a 6-2 lead with a run in the seventh and two
more in the eighth. Jason Tyner, acquired Friday in a trade from
the New York Mets, had an RBI single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hit a solo homer, his 16th, off Jeff Suppan in the
fifth to give Tampa Bay a 3-2 lead. Williams has 62 RBIs in 78
games as a leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan had gone into the game tied with James Baldwin of the
Chicago White Sox for the league lead in homers allowed with 28.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays starter Steve Trachsel went seven innings, giving up
nine hits and striking out three without walking a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay scored twice with two outs in the first on an RBI
double by Jose Canseco and an RBI single by Jose Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City scored twice in the fourth on a run-scoring double
by Quinn and an RBI single by McCarty.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Damon's third-inning single was his 50th hit in July. He
became the fourth player in Royals history to get 50 hits in a
month, joining George Brett, Willie Wilson and Randa. He singled
again in the fifth. ... Dye returned to right field for the Royals
after sitting out Friday's game and playing DH Saturday following
the mild concussion he suffered when he crashed into the wall
Thursday chasing a fly ball.

<HEADLINE> Poll shows Clinton trailing Lazio  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - As a new poll showed voter support for her
Senate candidacy slightly slipping, Hillary Rodham Clinton visited
a Harlem church Sunday and urged the congregation to get out the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''What does it mean to be a good citizen?'' she told the
congregation of the Metropolitan AME Church. ''First, it means in
the most basic way, you have to vote. By not voting, we are walking
away from all the sacrifices everyone gave before to make it
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The new poll from Zogby International showed Long Island
Congressman Rick Lazio with a slight lead. The survey, published in
Sunday's New York Post, had Lazio, the GOP candidate, leading
Clinton 50 percent to 42 percent with a 4 percentage point margin
of error. Several of the most recent previous polls had shown the
two in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed Lazio with solid leads among upstate and
suburban residents while Clinton leads him in New York City 2-1.
Although she remains ahead among Jews, the poll showed her support
down to 48 percent, compared to Lazio's 36 percent. Past polls have
shown her support among Jews to range from 50 percent to 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom holds that Democrats need to get 60 percent
of the Jewish vote in a Senate race in order to win.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Sunday if she pays attention to polls, Clinton said: ''I
don't. Polls are snapshots taken from very different perspectives,
they go up and they go down and they really are not that important.
It's not even August yet. What's really important in this race are
the differences between us.''

<HEADLINE> Brewers' Sexson Looks To Flourish  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Richie Sexson took a look around the Milwaukee
Brewers cramped clubhouse, took a deep breath and smiled. Deep
down, he knew the scenery would have to change for his career to
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   A six-player trade between the Brewers and the Indians on Friday
sent Sexson from the thick of a pennant race in Cleveland to
rebuilding Milwaukee, the majors' second-worst team.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson made his Brewers debut on Sunday, going 0-for-3 with a
strikeout as Milwaukee's cleanup hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson has no complaints about the deal. In fact, he's overjoyed
to get the chance to play every day for a team that desperately
needs him to produce. In Cleveland, Sexson was often lost in the
shuffle of a formidable lineup, with All-Star Jim Thome in front of
him at first base, his preferred position.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is almost too perfect,'' Sexson said. ''I love the chance
to do what we're trying to do here with the new stadium and a young
team. It's the opportunity I really needed.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Brewers, Sexson's days of checking the lineup card are
over. He'll be manager Davey Lopes' everyday first baseman and
cleanup hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect big things out of him,'' Lopes said. ''We gave up
some very good pitchers for Richie, but he's capable of being a
big, big factor for us for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Big'' is the operative word around Sexson, 25, who at 6-foot-8
is believed to be the tallest player in Brewers history. Milwaukee
infielders Mark Loretta and Ron Belliard love the idea of throwing
to one of the majors' biggest targets at first base.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll make our defense better,'' Loretta said. ''His offense
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexson had 31 homers and 116 RBIs last season in helping the
Indians to the AL Central title. His production has dropped off
this year to 16 home runs and 44 RBIs, but he attributes his slump
to sporadic playing time at first and in the outfield, where he
struggled defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels good to know I'm going to be an everyday player,''
Sexson said. ''It's not something I'm used to. It's definitely nice
to be wanted. Every day (in Cleveland), I didn't know if a 2-for-4
day would keep me in the lineup or not. Not playing on a daily
basis was tough for me mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers, who scored runs in bunches last year but have
slumped to a majors-worst batting average of .244 this season,
wanted Sexson for his bat. They gave up three quality pitchers --
All-Star closer Bob Wickman and starters Jason Bere and Steve
Woodard -- to get Sexson and pitchers Paul Rigdon and Kane Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting fourth, Sexson will be sandwiched by left-handed power
hitters Geoff Jenkins and Jeromy Burnitz. Lopes thinks the middle
of his lineup may be set for several years, Burnitz's
barely-concealed desire to leave town notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got two young guys (Sexson and Jenkins) who are going to
be All-Stars very soon, and we've got an established guy (Burnitz)
who has been an All-Star in the past,'' Lopes said. ''I look around
the league, and I think we can compete with anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates Deal Christiansen to Cards  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals added a left-hander to
their bullpen Sunday for the stretch run, landing Jason
Christiansen from the Pittsburgh Pirates for minor league infielder
Jack Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen was traded not long after allowing four of the five
batters he faced to reach base in a five-run San Diego seventh
inning that helped rally the Padres to a 9-8 victory.
</P>
<P>
   While leaving the mound, a frustrated Christiansen flipped the
ball to manager Gene Lamont, who followed him down the tunnel to
the clubhouse as the two exchanged words.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did something you shouldn't do to a manager,'' Christiansen
said. ''You should never show up your manager. I did that when I
threw the ball in the air. It's tough for me right now. I just got
traded and the last thing he and I have to remember about each
other is that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamont wouldn't discuss the incident, but said, ''He's been a
good pitcher for us. He is a real commodity, a left-handed pitcher,
and we'll miss him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen was especially effective against left-handers the
last three seasons, but has struggled this season, going 2-8 with
one save and a 4.97 ERA in 44 games. He also had a seven-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been trying to get Christiansen for a couple of years,
and we were finally able to do it,'' Cardinals general manager Walt
Jocketty said. ''Obviously, we're in desperate need of a
left-hander. He's a left-hander with quality stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade came a day after the NL Central-leading Cardinals got
right-handed reliever Mike Timlin from Baltimore. Baseball's
deadline for making trades without waivers is 4 p.m. EDT Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two games, Christiansen allowed five hits and seven
runs in 1 1-3 innings. Before that, he was scored upon only once in
eight appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ''It definitely was a surprise,'' Christiansen said. ''The way I
pitched today, I was almost hoping I wouldn't be traded. I'm very
emotional right now. I'm excited and upset at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 22, is the second shortstop the Pirates have traded for
in three days. He was hitting .294 with six homers and 34 RBIs at
Double-A Arkansas and is a .323 career hitter in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ''His forte is catching the ball,'' said Pirates hitting coach
Lloyd McClendon, who managed Wilson in the California Fall League
last year. ''He was learning how to switch hit and I was very happy
with the progress he was showing from the left side.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has more pop from the right side and he's more of a contact
hitter from the left side. I would say he isn't very far away,
because he can really catch the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Pirates landed infielder Enrique Wilson and
outfielder Alex Ramirez from the Cleveland Indians for outfielder
Wil Cordero.
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen was 3-0 with a 2.94 ERA in 1997 and 3-3 with a 2.51
ERA in 19098 before slipping to 2-3 with a 4.06 ERA last season,
despite holding batters to a .199 average. He has had neck and back
problems the last two seasons and missed a week with neck spasms
earlier this season.

<HEADLINE> TV's Convention Excuse Is Shaky  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- TV networks point to declining ratings to
justify their decisions to air fewer hours of convention coverage,
but an academic analysis suggests they may be on shaky ground.
</P>
<P>
   Viewership for convention coverage has dropped, but so have
ratings for the evening news, as the TV audience is increasingly
divided among more options.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the conclusions of the Vanishing Voter Project
being conducted at the Joan Shorenstein Center for the Press,
Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   If networks cut their evening news as dramatically as they have
cut convention coverage, the news would last six minutes, said Tom
Patterson, who co-directs the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''In relative terms, the televised conventions are no more and
no less appealing to the public than other forms of public affairs
programming,'' the center concluded.
</P>
<P>
   This year, ABC planned an hour of convention coverage on Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday and two hours on Thursday. CBS planned parts
of hour-long magazines on Monday and Tuesday, a full hour Wednesday
and two hours Thursday. NBC promised the fewest hours: Nothing
Monday or Tuesday, an hour on Wednesday and an hour and a half on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. GOP insists lessened convention presence doesn't mean less power </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Four years ago, the Republican National
Convention was a New York party.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kemp was the vice presidential nominee, Al D'Amato was a
senator, then-Rep. Susan Molinari was a rising star in the party,
and Gov. George Pataki was still on his high after beating Mario
Cuomo. They all got national TV time.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the New York GOP will be hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional candidate Joan Johnson gets a minute of national
TV time Monday morning and U.S. Rep. Vito Fossella gets New York's
only prime time speaking slot on Wednesday. That's all that is
planned, unless U.S. Senate candidate Rick Lazio's quick visit to
the convention on Tuesday and the coverage it will garner counts as
national exposure.
</P>
<P>
   But just because they're not on television doesn't mean that New
York is any less important for the GOP, New Yorkers insist. ''As
you know, clout's not on the stage, clout's behind the scenes,''
New York City-based Republican adviser Jay Severin said.
</P>
<P>
   With the small number of convention speakers, D'Amato being
voted out of office, Molinari no longer a congresswoman, and the
man who was supposed to be the state's star attraction this year,
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, no longer in the Senate race
against Hillary Clinton, it would appear that New York is losing
its national political pull.
</P>
<P>
   ''I admit, on paper there is a stark difference from 1996,''
Severin said. ''There was more influence in Washington from New
York back then,'' Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, New York's more important than ever
before because Gov. George Pataki came close to being Bush's vice
presidential nominee, Severin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of that, every time a job comes up, his name is going
to be on the short list,'' Severin said. ''And everybody in the
state party's stock is going to go up because Pataki's stock is
going up.''
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact is that New York is one of the largest states in
the nation and can't be ignored, said Rep. John Sweeney, who came
down to Philadelphia Friday to throw the state's weight behind the
successful effort to block changes to the GOP primary schedule that
would have favored smaller states.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York, by the virtue that it's the third largest delegation
in the nation, by the virtue that George Pataki came down to the
wire as a vice presidential choice, by the virtue that Bill Powers
is still party chairman, for those reasons, New York is going to be
a major player in the Republican Party for years to come,'' Sweeney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't snub the state by not picking more New York
politicians as speakers, Sweeney said. Many states don't have major
speaking roles at all, he pointed out. ''We are a huge delegation
and we are important and vital for the Republican Party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that Bush is highly unlikely to win New York
from Vice President Al Gore, said Quinnipiac pollster Maurice
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that it's that New York is so much less
important as much as it's that the state is taken for granted by
the Democrats and pretty much conceded by the Republicans,''
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will use the state to raise money and get media attention
and that's about it, the pollster said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that right now, New York and the whole Northeast
causes barely a ripple in the Republican tide,'' Miringoff said.
''In 1996, D'Amato was still in office, and Pataki was still riding
the tide of having beat Cuomo. Molinari was a rising star and the
GOP wanted these people out there so the nation would know who they
are. They were looking for leadership. It's not that way now.''
</P>
<P>
   Utica-based pollster John Zogby does question why the
Republicans weren't using the convention to garner national
attention for U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, who took Giuliani's place in
the Senate race against Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The second biggest prize this year is Patrick Moynihan's seat.
One would think that they would be using this time to introduce
Rick Lazio to the nation and bolster the fact that that prize is
there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 10, Indians 7  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Rookie Luis Matos drove in four runs and tied a
team record with four steals as the new-look Baltimore Orioles
defeated the Cleveland Indians 10-7 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Mora singled home a run, Brook Fordyce had two hits in
his Baltimore debut and John Parrish earned his first major league
victory for the Orioles, who have initiated a youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui, playing his second game with Cleveland after being
obtained in a trade with Texas, hit his fifth career grand slam to
put the Indians up 4-2 in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Baltimore scored four in the bottom half and added four more
in the seventh to pull away.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish (1-1), making his second appearance, allowed four runs,
four hits and five walks in six innings, striking out five.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley (9-8) gave up four earned runs in 5 1-3 innings and
hurt himself with a costly throwing error in the Orioles' four-run
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Matos, called up June 18 from Double-A Bowie, stole second base
in the second inning, swiped two bases in the sixth, and tied Brady
Anderson's club record by stealing third in the seventh after
hitting a three-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Matos then scored on a sacrifice fly by Anderson to put the
Orioles up 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   Mora, traded to Baltimore Friday for veteran Mike Bordick,
singled in Matos in the sixth to put the Orioles up 5-4. Mora had
two hits.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar and Manny Ramirez homered in the ninth for the
Indians, who stranded 10 in their second straight loss. Cleveland
left 12 runners on base in a 4-0 defeat Saturday.

   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Sal Fasano homered twice and drove in a
career-high five runs as the Oakland Athletics spoiled Rolando
Arrojo's Boston debut by beating the Red Sox 5-2 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Heredia (13-7) pitched 7 1-3 strong innings to win his
fourth straight and give the A's a series split with the Red Sox,
one of their main rivals in the AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo (0-1), acquired Thursday in a seven-player deal with
Colorado, lost his fifth straight decision. He walked the bases
loaded in the second before giving up Fasano's first career grand
slam.
</P>
<P>
   Fasano added a solo shot in the seventh for his fifth homer of
the year and second career multihomer game.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra went 1-for-4, lowering his major-league
leading batting average to .392.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia matched his career high for victories, allowing two runs
on four hits. He struck out one and walked one. Jason Isringhausen
pitched the ninth for his 23rd save in 28 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Grieve, Miguel Tejada and Jeremy Giambi walked in the second
ahead of Fasano, who hit a 0-1 pitch from Arrojo over the
left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo allowed five runs, three hits and five walks in 6 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hatteberg led off the third for Boston with his seventh
homer, and Jason Varitek led off the fourth with his seventh homer
to make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had two runners on with one out in the eighth, but
relief pitcher Jeff Tam forced pinch-hitter Bernard Gilkey to
ground into a double play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: A's first base coach Mike Quade was ejected by first base
umpire Rob Drake after arguing a play that ended the bottom of the
fourth inning. Hitting coach Thad Bosley took his place on the
bases. ... Fasano's grand slam was the 10th by the A's this year,
tops in the majors this year and an ongoing franchise record. ...
Boston RHP Bret Saberhagen threw 68 pitches over four innings in a
rehab start on Sunday at Pawtucket. He allowed five runs on six
hits. ... A's OF Terrence Long had his 13-game hitting streak
snapped.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Warns on US Embassy  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- The leader of the militant Islamic group
Hezbollah warned the United States on Sunday against moving its
embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, saying attackers would send the
Americans home ''in coffins.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You (Americans) can move your embassy (to Jerusalem) and send
your diplomats there. But the honorable (Arab) people can turn your
embassy to rubble and return your diplomats in coffins,'' Sheik
Hassan Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the only logic that the Americans and the Israelis
understand,'' he said at a rally in the southern Lebanese village
of Jibsheet.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of supporters interrupted his fiery speech with cries
of ''Allahu Akbar,'' or God is Great.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Friday that he was considering moving the
U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem -- a proposal that
infuriated Arabs, many of whom saw it as proof of a pro-Israeli
bias by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians demand sovereignty over Arab east Jerusalem,
which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel
has long insisted that Jerusalem remain united under exclusive
Israeli sovereignty. Almost all countries have refused to move
their embassies to Jerusalem until the city's status is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicting claims over east Jerusalem were the main stumbling
block at the 14-day Camp David summit between Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, which ended
last week without agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group battled Israeli
troops occupying southern Lebanon from the early 1980s until May,
when the Israelis withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group fought Israeli
troops in southern Lebanon before they withdrew in May, ending an
18-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah was linked in the 1980s to a series of attacks against
American interests and personnel in Lebanon. It was believed to be
the umbrella group for pro-Iranian militants who claimed
responsibility for the 1983 suicide truck bombings of the U.S.
Embassy and the U.S. Marine base in Beirut, two attacks that killed
258 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, however, has never carried out bomb attacks within
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak, brownfields, China among Lautenberg's final projects  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - He has endorsed a successor (Democrat Jon
Corzine), chosen where to donate his papers (Rutgers University)
and had a train station in New Jersey named for him.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final months of an 18-year stay in Congress, Sen.
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., is projecting an image of a lawmaker with
much work left to do.
</P>
<P>
   He is pushing legislation in areas of particular interest to
him, including gun control, transportation and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're so close on a bunch of things,'' Lautenberg said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He is preparing to take a taxpayer-funded trip next month to
China and South Korea, insisting that he still has a role to play
on issues like international trade, human rights and national
security.
</P>
<P>
   Time is running short, however. The Senate is adjourned for
summer recess until Sept. 5 and is tentatively scheduled to finish
its work for 2000 one month later. After that, federal business
takes a back seat to presidential and congressional politics.
</P>
<P>
   Honored earlier this year by the National Association of
Railroad Passengers, Lautenberg hopes to cap off his longtime
support of Amtrak by winning support for a plan to raise $10
billion over 10 years for high-speed train lines around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., promised ''a big fight''
over any more funding for Amtrak before it fulfills its ''first and
quite substantial statutory obligation to operate free'' of
government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   But Lautenberg said the bill now has 50 cosponsors - half the
Senate - and becomes more tempting with every report of crowded
airport runways and flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about time we placed high-speed rail service in the same
category as other modes of transportation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg also holds out hope for an agreement that would lead
to the first national blood alcohol standard for drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted last month to set a national standard for a
0.08 percent blood alcohol content. Currently 32 states, including
New Jersey, enforce a less stringent 0.10 percent limit.
</P>
<P>
   The 0.08 provision, long championed by Lautenberg, is included
in a transportation spending bill. The counterpart bill in the
House does not include the provision, however, so it will be the
subject of negotiations between the two chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg continues to lobby to close the so-called ''gun show
loophole.'' Currently, only people buying guns from federally
licensed dealers have to undergo criminal background checks at gun
shows. Sales by private dealers are exempted.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg is also a principal backer of a bipartisan bill to
remove obstacles that have kept private companies from buying and
restoring contaminated ''brownfields'' properties. Vice President
Al Gore has adopted the measure as part of his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg has invited other senators to join him for his
congressional delegation trip to China and South Korea - as well as
to communist North Korea, if the government there gives clearance -
during the August recess. So far one colleague, Democrat Tom Harkin
of Iowa, has signed on for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on the verge of making big decisions over our
relationship with China, and I would like to see what I can find
out for myself,'' Lautenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Some retiring lawmakers have been criticized in the past for
last-minute trips funded by the government, but Lautenberg said,
''I hope you notice the kinds of places I'm going. This isn't a joy
ride.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins 4, Diamondbacks 3  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Kevin Millar's RBI double -- his fourth hit -- capped
a two-run rally in the eighth inning after Randy Johnson left the
game, and the Florida Marlins beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson departed with a 3-2 lead after seven innings and
throwing 145 pitches, but did not get his 16th victory. He struck
out 11.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez homered twice, giving him 22 this year, to drive
in all of Arizona's runs.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Mark Smith singled to start the eighth against Mike
Morgan (4-3). Preston Wilson lined out to shortstop Tony Womack,
who threw wildly to first trying to double up Smith, allowing the
runner to reach second.
</P>
<P>
   Derrek Lee's two-out single on a 3-2 pitch tied the game, and
Millar followed with a run-scoring double.
</P>
<P>
   Millar, who went 4-for-4, homered leading off the seventh
against Johnson. Marlins manger John Boles got nine right-handed
hitters into the lineup by starting Millar in left field for the
first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Almanza (3-0) pitched a perfect eighth. Antonio
Alfonseca worked the ninth for his 31st save, most in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson allowed seven hits and two runs, one on a wild pitch. He
reached double figures in strikeouts for the 16th time this season
and the 141st time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Florida scratched out a run in the first. Luis Castillo led off
with a double and stole third. With two out and Wilson at bat,
Johnson threw a 2-2 breaking pitch into the dirt, and when the ball
rolled behind catcher Kelly Stinnett, Castillo scored easily.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez made it 1-all with a leadoff homer in the fourth
against Ryan Dempster, then put Arizona ahead 3-1 with a two-run
homer in the sixth after Danny Bautista reached on an error by
shortstop Dave Berg.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster allowed five hits and three runs, two earned, in seven
innings.
Notes: Dempster is 1-9 lifetime in July with an ERA of 7.37. In
his other 45 games he's 16-12 with a 3.96 ERA. ... Gonzalez's
multi-homer game was the seventh of his career and his first since
Aug. 22, 1999. ... Arizona fell to 7-3 at Pro Player Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Rattles Japan Islands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A pair of strong earthquakes jolted a thinly
populated string of islands off Tokyo on Sunday, injuring one
person and triggering landslides, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The two quakes -- with preliminary magnitudes of 6.2 and 5.8 --
hit hardest on the island of Miyakejima, which has seen thousands
of tremors in recent weeks after a volcano there rumbled back to
life.
</P>
<P>
   A 58-year-old man was slightly injured when a household object
hit his head, said Miyakejima official Makoto Yoshio.
</P>
<P>
   The quakes, which were felt as far as central Tokyo, also
ruptured a water pipe and set off three landslides, Yoshio said. TV
footage showed cans that had been knocked off shelves littering the
aisles of a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The Meteorological Agency said there was no risk of tsunami
tidal waves whipped up by the seismic activity.
</P>
<P>
   The stronger of the two quakes struck at 10:25 p.m. The other
hit at 9:18 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Miyakejima, home to about 4,000 people, and nearby islands have
been rocked by more than 17,500 earthquakes in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake killed a fisherman in a
car buried under fallen rocks on the nearby island of Kozushima.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Oyama on Miyakejima has erupted several times in the past
60 years, including in 1983, but the blasts usually came quickly
and were over in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries as
it sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across
the earth's surface.

<HEADLINE> Workers Accuse Army of Cover-Up  </HEADLINE>
By TARA BURGHART
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Eighteen men who were sickened last year
while building an incinerator at the Umatilla Chemical Depot are
accusing the Army of hiding leaks of highly toxic nerve and mustard
agents on the day of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawyer, James E. McCandlish, said he wants an injunction
to halt construction of the incinerator in eastern Oregon near
Hermiston until certain safety protections are in place.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to file a lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court in
Portland asking for the injunction and seeking compensation and
damages for his clients, some of whom can no longer work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has been storing chemical agents at the depot since
1962, and says it has never had a release that threatened the
health of employees, the public or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Binder, an Army spokeswoman, said several agencies,
including the Army, the state, and the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, had concluded that chemical agents stored at
the depot did not cause the workers' sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one who has looked at that data, who is trained to
interpret that data, has concluded that the chemical agents stored
at depot were involved in the Sept. 15 incident,'' Binder said.
</P>
<P>
   Built during the Cold War, the Umatilla depot contains more than
3,000 tons of deadly nerve and mustard agents, or about 11 percent
of the nation's chemical-weapons stockpile. They are to be
destroyed after completion of the incinerator, scheduled for
October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The depot has been hit by problems in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 30, 1999, a system built to broadcast warnings of an
emergency at the depot sent out a false alarm. Not only was there
no leak, but the warnings -- blared out through loudspeakers -- told
people in Spanish to get indoors, but not in English.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there were at least 11 bomb threats called in over two
months earlier this year, temporarily halting work on the
incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   The 18 workers represented by McCandlish were among 34 who were
overcome by fumes on Sept. 15, he said. They work for a company
contracted by the Army to build the incinerator.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) -- Boston's Bret Saberhagen pitched four
innings and gave up five runs Sunday in a rehabilitation start for
Triple-A Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who has not pitched for the Red Sox this season
following rotator cuff surgery last November, allowed six hits
against Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good test for the shoulder,'' said Saberhagen, a
two-time Cy Young Award winner. ''For the most part, the arm felt
pretty good. I loosened up a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen last pitched on July 24 against Indianapolis. He
allowed two hits and no runs during that four-inning stint.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time his velocity was good early ... 88, 89 ... and it
stayed there,'' said Pawtucket pitching coach Rich Bombard. ''He
also threw some curveballs which had some bite and that's another
good sign.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who won 25 games for Boston over the 1998 and 1999
seasons, isn't quite sure which step he'll take next.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be there with Boston,'' he said. ''But
realistically, I've got to ask myself, 'Am I ready for that
challenge?' I've got to talk to (Boston pitching coach) Joe
Kerrigan and see what the big bosses think.''

helicopters, said national police chief Gen. Ernesto Gilibert. Some
troops also arrived on foot and clashed with rebels as they
approached the town.
</P>
<P>
   Gilibert said he had not received official word on whether any
of the 25 police in Arboleda had survived the attack launched
Saturday morning by hundreds of rebels of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have our hopes,'' Gilibert told journalists in the capital,
Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   But national police Col. Mario Gutierrez told The Associated
Press, ''It looks like there have been many killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack could be the bloodiest since the United States
approved $1.3 billion in aid to battle leftist rebels and other
armed groups who are involved in narcotics production. Controversy
has arisen over whether U.S.-supplied combat helicopters, which
provide security for planes fumigating drug crops in Colombia,
should be used in counterinsurgency operations.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said radio transmissions from the besieged police
officers had been cut after midnight, about 15 hours after the
attack began on Saturday morning. Rebels told a local
photojournalist who tried to enter the town Sunday morning that
they had killed 23 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Communications with Arboleda have been severed and there is no
way to verify this information, but we fear the worst,'' said
police Col. Norberto Pelaez, police commander of Caldas province,
where Arboleda is located.
</P>
<P>
   Low cloud cover prevented reinforcements from arriving until
late Sunday. Troops also spent hours hiking over twisting mountain
trails to Arboleda, located 90 miles northwest of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Curtis W. Kamman said Colombian security forces
weren't restricted to using the U.S.-made helicopters only in
anti-drug operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''These helicopters can be used ... to defend the police and
military forces if they are under attack in a zone where there are
anti-narcotics activities,'' Kamman was quoted as saying in an
interview on Saturday with ANCOL, the Colombian government's news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   However, Arboleda is not believed to be in a region producing
cocaine or heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say U.S. policy regarding military aid to
Colombia is growing increasingly blurry, and can lead to the United
States being drawn into the South American nation's 35-year civil
war. But others charge that restrictions on the U.S. support are
too tight.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's attack was similar to one mounted by the FARC on
July 15 on the southwestern town of Roncesvalles. The rebels
besieged the police station in the town, and after police ran out
of ammunition, the guerrillas allegedly executed 13 of the
officers. The deaths drew criticisms -- including in the U.S.
Congress -- that the Blackhawks, if used, could have saved the
policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new U.S. aid package, approved by Presidentl Clinton
on July 13, Washington will provide 60 more helicopters, including
Blackhawks and Hueys, to Colombian security forces.

<HEADLINE> Haitians Vote For Lower-House Seats  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Haitians in several districts voted
Sunday in runoff elections for 10 lower-house seats, despite most
political parties' call for a boycott and international threats to
suspend aid if questionable earlier results are not revised.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti already held first- and second-round voting in most of the
country on May 21 and July 9, respectively, with results so far
showing a strong victory for the Lavalas Family party of former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, winning both houses of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's voting will determine seven seats in the southern
Grand'-Anse district, where the first round of voting was delayed
until June 11, and three seats in other districts. The run-off is
necessary because no single candidate won a majority of votes in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has been without a parliament since January 1999, when
Aristide's hand-picked successor President Rene Preval shut it down
to end a power struggle with the majority party over charges of
election fraud in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Polls opened at 6 a.m. and closed 12 hours later. No violent
incidents were reported, but communications between the districts
and Port-au-Prince could not be established, and turnout was
unknown. The results are likely to be published within a week.
</P>
<P>
   These run-offs will be the final balloting in the parliamentary
elections, which have been plagued by delays, violence and disputes
over the results.
</P>
<P>
   In May 21, June 11, and July 9 elections, the Lavalas Family won
overwhelming control of both houses of Parliament, with 18 of 19
upper-house seats and more than 60 seats in the 83-seat lower-house
Chamber of Deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide's party also won 77 percent of city halls and a
majority of urban and rural councils.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Canada and the European Union have threatened
to cut aid if Haiti does not revise the elections results. Japan
last week suspended $13.5 million in aid to the impoverished
Caribbean nation over its political instability.

<HEADLINE> Pickens Arrives Early for Titans  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Carl Pickens is so anxious for a fresh
start, he arrived at the Tennessee Titans' practice facility early
on Sunday and found himself waiting outside a locked gate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was out there for about five minutes (before getting in),''
Pickens said. ''I'm ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The wide receiver agreed to terms on a five-year contract last
Wednesday but went home to prepare for the move to Nashville. He
was asked to return to Nashville on Sunday afternoon, and he showed
up a couple of hours early.
</P>
<P>
   He met with coaches and received a playbook. He also talked to
reporters for the first time since his contract was announced.
Pickens said that although he had a couple of other offers,
choosing the Titans was an easy decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys went to the Super Bowl last year,'' he said. ''My
best year was 7-9. The facilities, the team, the ownership.
Everything is positive, and the places I've been, I haven't seen
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of knew all along this was where I wanted to play. I
really didn't know these guys would be interested because they did
get so far last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans eyed Pickens since talk started last winter that the
Cincinnati Bengals wanted to release the disgruntled receiver. They
made him an offer the day after the Bengals finally released him,
following a settlement involving the NFL Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens said his biggest problem the past eight seasons was
being in the wrong situation. With the change in teams and scenery,
he now is looking forward to coming to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here I want to make the most of something good for a change,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time Pro Bowl receiver has the durability Tennessee
desperately needs for a receiver, which is the team's weakest area.
Yancey Thigpen has missed 13 games since being signed before the
1998 season to a five-year contract, and the Titans aren't sure
when he will be ready to play following ankle surgery in April.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens caught more passes (57) last season than any receiver
for Tennessee did.
</P>
<P>
   He is ready to get started and hopes to learn enough plays to
take part in the Titans' exhibition opener Saturday night against
the Kansas City Chiefs. Coach Jeff Fisher said he expects Pickens
to play at least the first quarter with the first-team offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't expect a problem,'' Fisher said.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars' Tackle Wiegert Injured  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Jacksonville Jaguars' ailing offensive line got
more bad
news when right tackle Zach Wiegert strained a ligament in his left
elbow during practice.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The injury toward the end of Saturday's afternoon workout forced
Wiegert to the sideline, joining injured right tackle Leon Searcy
(quadriceps) and left tackle Tony Boselli (knee).
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom Coughlin said X-rays were negative, and that Wiegert
suffered a ''pretty bad strain or sprain.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiegert came in for treatment four times Sunday and didn't see
enough improvement to be able to return to practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not looking real good,'' Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't venture a guess as to when Wiegert would return.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first weekend of NFL exhibitions continued Sunday
night with Philadelphia visiting Cleveland, and Pittsburgh at
Dallas. On Monday, New England plays San Francisco in the Hall of
Fame game in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games of the preseason, Atlanta beat
Indianapolis 20-13, and the New York Jets took New Orleans 24-20
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wiegert wore a brace on the arm most of last year because of a
similar injury.
</P>
<P>
   Wiegert was slated to play right guard this season, but moved
over after Searcy's injury last Monday. Searcy underwent surgery
last week and hopes to be back in three to four months.
Packers:
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Kivuusama Mays was waived by Green Bay on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mays, a special teams standout, was acquired by the Packers in
mid-December after being waived by the Minnesota Vikings because of
clashes with coach Dennis Green.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina product saw limited action on special teams
for Green Bay, but he failed to impress the team's defensive
coaches during the first two weeks of training camp.
Giants:
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dixon, the relatively unknown wide receiver from little
Lambuth University, is showing he can play. At least that's the
impression the New York Giants' third-round pick gave after an
intrasquad scrimmage Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon caught two passes for 42 yards, including a 25-yard
touchdown reception. He also dropped a potential 30-yard gainer,
had another long pass nullified when it was ruled that Mike Cherry
had been sacked. Dixon also scored during a kickoff return drill.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got incredible athletic ability, no doubt about it,''
quarterback Kerry Collins said. ''It's raw and we're going to have
to work with him on some of the skills he has. But as far as pure
athletic ability, he's the total package.''
Falcons 20, Colts 13:
</P>
<P>
   After going 13-3 in a magnificent turnaround last season, the
Indianapolis Colts opened the NFL exhibition schedule Saturday more
closely resembling the bumblers who went 3-13 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Two big mistakes proved costly in a loss at home to Atlanta, as
Falcons quarterback Danny Kanell threw for two touchdowns following
costly Indianapolis errors.
</P>
<P>
   His first touchdown pass, 14 yards to Brian Kozlowski in the
second quarter, was set up when Colts rookie David Macklin bobbled
a punt the Falcons recovered at the Indianapolis 25.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the score tied midway through the fourth period, a
personal foul on Billy Austin gave Atlanta the ball at the Colts'
13, where Kanell passed to Brian Finneran for the winning TD.
Jets 24, Saints 20:
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn Sanders' 1-yard run with 1:17 left capped a 72-yard
touchdown drive led by fellow rookie Chad Pennington as New York
overcame four turnovers in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets converted seven of 10 third-down plays and moved the
ball well all night as their quarterbacks -- Vinny Testaverde, Ray
Lucas and Pennington -- combined to complete 25 of 33 passes.
</P>
<P>
   Saints tight end Cameron Cleeland will miss the entire season
after tearing his left Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Haslett said Cleeland's Achilles' was ''torn in
half,'' and that starting safety Rob Kelly and cornerback Steve
Israel suffered broken legs that might also end their seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Cleeland, who caught 80 passes in his first two seasons with the
Saints, was hurt in the second quarter on a running play shortly
after he caught two passes.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly was injured on the fourth play from scrimmage, and Israel
was hurt on a kickoff in the third quarter.

<HEADLINE> White Sox Add Veteran Leadership  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Despite the best record in the American
League and a 9&AMP;frac12;-game lead in their division, the Chicago White Sox
saw an opportunity to get better just before the trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   So they took it.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, the White Sox acquired catcher Charles
Johnson and designated hitter Harold Baines from the Baltimore
Orioles for catcher Brook Fordyce and three minor league pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Experience,'' manager Jerry Manuel said before Sunday night's
game at Anaheim. ''I think the addition of experience to a very
young club. When you have looked at your club for over 100 games,
you should be able to recognize what you need to do to upgrade your
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Baines are scheduled to join the AL Central leaders
in Texas prior to Tuesday night's game against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's deadline for making trades without waivers is 4 p.m.
EDT.
</P>
<P>
   ''We added CJ, he's been a world champion,'' said Manuel,
referring to Johnson's role with the 1997 Florida Marlins. ''He's a
Gold Glove winner, he's a catch-and-throw guy who can block balls
well. He's always been a guy who can handle a pitching staff. And
it looks like Charles has found his batting stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 29, is hitting .294 with 21 homers and 55 RBIs. His
contract expires at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Baines, a 41-year-old left-handed batter, is hitting .266 with
10 homers and 30 RBIs in 72 games. He has already done two stints
with the White Sox, from 1980-89 and 1996-97. The team retired his
number in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got an All-Star catcher and another good player, a
dangerous hitter,'' White Sox outfielder Magglio Ordonez said.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel said he hasn't spoken with Johnson or Baines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't even get a chance to thank Brook for what he's done
here,'' Manuel said. ''We hate to lose him, he's been a big part of
the energy and chemistry here.''
</P>
<P>
   When told Fordyce made his debut for the Orioles on Sunday,
Manuel said: ''That's what I hear. They won. Way to go, Brook.''
</P>
<P>
   White Sox left-hander Mike Sirotka said he didn't believe
working with a new catcher would be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Charles brings some playoff experience,'' Sirotka said. ''His
offense will help as well as his defensive ability. Our staff is
pretty open-minded to working with him. He's caught a lot of major
league pitchers. He's going to be good at recognizing our strengths
and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly is a move that can't hurt us. I think it's a good
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox have one of the youngest pitching staffs in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Baines should add some punch to a team leading the
AL in runs scored and batting .290.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get a guy who's been through the wars, been to the playoffs
in Charles Johnson,'' White Sox reliever Bill Simas said. ''And
Harold Baines is a proven left-handed bat, which we didn't have. It
should help us a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The three pitchers traded to the Orioles in the deal were all
right-handers: Miguel Felix, Juan Figueroa and Jason Lakman.

<HEADLINE> Rams Injuries Worse Than Thought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- One day after St. Louis scrimmaged the
Tennessee Titans, Rams coach Mike Martz had good news and bad news
regarding his injured players.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, defensive tackle D'Marco Farr will be ready
for practice this week, along with defensive end Grant Wishtrom,
running back Derek Loville and starting left guard Tom Nutton.
</P>
<P>
   However, punter Rick Tuten is out with a muscle strain and will
not punt this week, and Martz said the Rams are looking to bring in
a veteran punter.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies who were injured last week will also be out longer than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Trung Canidate, the first-round draft pick who
suffered a high ankle sprain Friday, was thought to be out for two
weeks. Recovery time has been increased to four to six weeks, Martz
said. That puts Canidate out of commission for the start of the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little more severe than we originally thought,'' Martz
said at a news conference Sunday afternoon. ''It's a long shot that
he'll be ready for the regular season. We're not going to push
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie tackle and fourth-round pick Kaulana Noa, who dislocated
his wrist Friday, appears to be out for three months, instead of
six weeks as originally thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's more extensive damage than had been anticipated,''
Martz said.
</P>
<P>
   Farr, who begins practice this week, has been out while
recovering from knee surgery in June. Wishtrom has been involved in
limited work because of off-season shoulder surgery. Loville, who
missed a week with a hamstring injury, and Nutton, who was out with
ankle problems, were scheduled to practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Martz said he's still frustrated over the absence of cornerback
Todd Lyght. He is the Rams' transition player and the team has
offered him a one-year tender of $4.04 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's coming close to the time that will force us to do
something,'' Martz said. ''We might have to start to bring in some
corners because it could hurt this football team to not bring in
anyone else in case this lingers.''

Brady Anderson's club record by stealing third in the seventh after
hitting a three-run double. ... Brook Fordyce went 2-for-4 and
scored twice in his Orioles debut.
Yankees-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Joe Torre spoke with GM Brian Cashman Sunday morning
about whether the team will acquire a left fielder before Monday's
non-waiver trade deadline. ''I think something will happen, he
probably doesn't think it will happen. It's not something that's an
emergency situation, you don't want to be held up.'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins have won seven games when trailing after
seven innings, and are 15-13 in one-run games. ... Torii Hunter
started in center field for the second straight day since being
recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake City.
Devil Rays-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Manager Larry Rothschild rested 3B Vinny Castilla, 1B
Fred McGriff and OF Greg Vaughn. Castilla has a sore back.
Rothschild acknowledged that Vaughn was upset about not playing,
but said he wanted to give newly acquired Jason Tyner a start. ...
Rothschild said he had had conversations with pitcher Steve
Trachsel about pitching quicker. ''We revisited that
conversation,'' Rothschild said. ''You could do commercials between
his pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: C Jorge Fabregas will begin a rehab assignment with
Triple-A Omaha on Monday. He said his injured elbow was improving.
Fabregas said he expected to DH Monday and begin catching Tuesday.
... Carlos Beltran was headed to the Royals minor league camp at
Haines City, Fla., to rehab his bruised right knee. He was in the
clubhouse with his 2-month-old pet monkey, Mikaela. ''I brought her
in because Rey (Sanchez) wanted to see her,'' Beltran said. ''She's
like a baby. She drinks milk. When she does something bad and you
tell her 'no', she gets mad at you.''
Blue Jays-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: 1B Carlos Delgado is on pace to put up career numbers
in many categories this season. The Blue Jays slugger has 32 home
runs, 93 RBIs and is hitting a team-leading .364 through 105 games.
Delgado posted career-highs out of .292 in 1998 and 44 home runs
and 134 RBIs last year. ... The Blue Jays are 1-4 in extra-inning
games this season after Saturday's 6-5 loss in 13 innings in
Seattle. ... Ron Fairly, the Mariners television and radio color
commentator, was Toronto's first representative in the All-Star
Game in 1977, the Blue Jays' expansion season. Fairly, who played
21 years of professional baseball, is in his eighth season
broadcasting with Seattle and 21st overall.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners are 20-9 against AL East opponents,
including a 15-5 mark at Safeco Field. ... Seattle had posted the

high school coach, Rich Hoffman, threw out the first pitch for.
Rodriguez played for Hoffman at Westminster Christian High in
Miami, Fla.
Red Sox-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: 3B Ed Sprague is the Red Sox's emergency third catcher.
He's not against the idea, but he's not exactly a big fan of it
either. ''I haven't squatted in eight years,'' he said. ''I'm not
against the idea of going back there but I would hope that it
wouldn't turn into a habit. Let's put it this way, I'm not going to
be running down to catch guys in the bullpen.'' ... RHP Bret
Saberhagen gave up five runs in four innings of a rehab start for
Triple-A Pawtucket on Sunday. Manager Jimy Williams said that
doesn't mean he'll be with the Red Sox any time soon. ''I'm not
saying we're going to do anything,'' Williams said. ''If things go
well, we'll figure out what we're going to do after that.'' ... RHP
Hipolito Pichardo has a 1.91 ERA in his last 13 relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: RHP Omar Olivares is expected to make his second rehab
start on Wednesday, probably at Triple-A Sacramento. A's manager
Art Howe said Olivares will probably make three or four starts and
will return to the rotation in 10-14 days. ''We'll see how he feels
in the next few days and make a determination about the
situation,'' said Howe. ''When he's ready to come back, he'll pitch
in the rotation.'' ... RHP Jim Mecir, who arrived in Oakland an
hour after the start of Saturday's game, gives the A's more options
out of the bullpen. ''We'll mix it around a bit, and with the way
our starters have been going, I'm hoping we don't need a legitimate
long man.'' ... The A's have lost 10 games in which they have led
by at least three runs.
White Sox-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Charles Johnson and Harold Baines, acquired by the
White Sox late Saturday from Baltimore, are expected to join the
team Tuesday. ... Baines, 41, will begin his third stint with the
White Sox. He played with them from 1980-89, and again in 1996-97.
The team retired his number in 1989. ... Carlos Lee entered the
game hitting .368 on the road and .226 at home. His overall average
was .301. ... As a team, the White Sox entered the game hitting
.290 with an AL-leading 637 runs scored. The only other AL team
with more than 600 runs was the Oakland A's, who had 621.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Troy Glaus entered the game with a team-leading 31
homers, but was just 9-for-51 since July 15, dropping his average
from .303 to .280. ... Darin Erstad, who entered the game with a
big league-leading 167 hits and a .369 average, singled in his
first at-bat to snap an 0-for-10 streak. ... OF Ron Gant, acquired
from Philadelphia before the game for pitcher Kent Bottenfield, is
expected to join the Angels before Monday's game against Detroit.
Bottenfield left with a 7-8 record and a 5.71 ERA. ... The Angels
announced that Gant will wear No. 5 and catcher Bengie Molina, who
had been wearing that number, would change to No. 1. ... Entering
Sunday's action, Angels starters had combined for a 10.07 ERA in
the team's previous eight games, giving up 44 runs on 75 hits in 39
1-3 innings.

   DETROIT: Juan Gonzalez got the 1,500th hit of his major-league
career with a single Saturday night. He had 1,421 of his hits in
the 11 previous seasons with Texas, which traded him to Detroit as
part of a nine-member trade during the offseason. ... The six
first-inning runs scored by the Tigers on Saturday were their most
this season.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Ricky Ledee, acquired from Cleveland in a trade for 1B
David Segui on Friday, was in the Texas starting lineup for the
first time. He started in right field. He made his debut with the
Rangers on Saturday as a defensive replacement in right and then
flew out in his only at-bat. ... There was no batting practice
before Sunday's game because of Rangers Family Day 2000. During
pregame activities, the Texas coaches and players came on the field
with their families. The children then took turns batting, hitting
plastic baseballs thrown by coaches Dick Bosman and Bucky Dent.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Giants-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Manager Dusty Baker said he spoke to GM Brian
Sabean regarding possible player moves. ''Something's always
percolating,'' Baker said. ... RHP Joe Nathan, on the DL with
inflammation in his right shoulder, will throw on the side Monday.
''We can't rush him back because Russ (Ortiz) didn't pitch well.
It's not worth it,'' Baker said. Ortiz took the loss Saturday
against the Cubs. ... RHP Robb Nen needs one save on the final day
of July to set a record for saves in the month. Nen, who has 13
saves in July, shares the mark with Chicago's Rod Beck in 1998 and
Cincinnati's John Franco in 1988. The mark for most saves in any
month is 15, accomplished by John Wetteland in June 1996 and Lee
Smith in September 1993.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs are seven games below .500 for the first time
since May 2 (12-19). ... RHP Kyle Farnsworth became the sixth Cub
pitcher to record a save, joining Rick Aguilera, Felix Heredia,
Todd Van Poppel, Tim Worrell and since-departed Brian Williams. ...
Bench coach Rene Lachemann said the White Sox made a good deal
getting C Charles Johnson. ''He's probably the second best
defensive catcher in major league baseball to (Texas) Ivan
Rodriguez,'' said Lachemann, who was with Johnson in Florida. ''You
don't get a better person. I loved the kid. He's a kid you'd want
as your son.''
Reds-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Eddie Taubensee went 3-for-4 with a pair of RBI
doubles. Taubensee, who had his ninth career four-hit game Friday
and three more hits on Saturday, hit a run-scoring double in the
second and another in the fourth. He singled in the sixth for his
10th hit of the three-game series. Taubensee went 10-for-14 in the
series to raise his average from .239 to .264. ... 1B Sean Casey
doubled in the fourth to extend his career-best hitting streak to
21 games before leaving the game with a sore right leg. Casey, who
is day to day after fouling a ball of his leg Saturday, is hitting
.403 (31-for-77) with four homers and 17 RBIs during the streak.
... Dmitri Young, who replaced Casey at first base, hit his 12th
homer in the sixth. ... Rookie Rob Bell, recalled from Triple-A
Louisville on Wednesday, tied his career-high with nine strikeouts
in 7 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: LF Rondell White, the subject of trade rumors,
remained on the 15-day DL, missing his 18th straight game due to a
strained hamstring. ... The Expos lost their sixth straight to fall
a season-worst seven games under .500 at 47-54. Montreal is 16-31
(.340) since they were a season-high eight games over .500 for the
second time this season on June 5. ... Dustin Hermanson is 2-5 in
his last seven starts and just 3-6 since rejoining the rotation on
June 5, after saving four of seven opportunities while briefly
replacing Ugueth Urbina as the team's closer.
Diamondbacks-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Before Sunday's game, a double credited to Florida's
Mike Lowell on Saturday was changed to an error on Arizona right
fielder Danny Bautista. Lowell was awarded a sacrifice fly. ...
Saturday's two-hitter by three pitchers was the first for the
Marlins since Sept. 22, 1996, when Rick Helling and Chris Hammond
held Houston to two hits.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Byung-Hyun Kim's blown save Saturday was the fifth in
the past nine chances by Diamondbacks relievers. He was optioned to
Triple-A Tucson and Arizona promoted reliever Johnny Ruffin, who
hasn't been in the major leagues since 1996. ... Tuesday starts a
stretch of 15 home games in 21 games for the Diamondbacks.
Padres-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Kevin Walker leads NL rookies with 46 appearances. He
gave up hits to two of the three batters he faced Sunday, but
opponents are hitting .175 against him since May 26. ... The Padres
did something in their final game in Three Rivers Stadium they
couldn't do in their last game in Pittsburgh's Forbes Field: They
won. They lost 4-1 on July 27, 1969, in their last game in Forbes,
three months after playing their first game there. They lost 110
games as a 1969 expansion team. ... Dave Magadan popped out as a
pinch-hitter Sunday, but has hits in six of his last nine at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: John Vander Wal lobbied Pirates manager Gene Lamont
for more playing time after being traded by San Diego and got it,
and has responded with career highs in homers (15) and RBIs (55).
Vander Wal could be traded by Monday, but Lamont said, ''He surely
is a guy I would like to have around. He may not be a
seven-day-a-week player, but he's shown me he's more than a 1- or
2-day-a-week player.'' Vander Wal was 4-for-5 Sunday, lacking a
triple for the cycle. ... The Pirates have lost their last seven
Sunday games and are 3-13 on Sundays. Their only Sunday home
victory was May 14 against Milwaukee. ... OF Chad Hermansen sat out
three games at Triple-A Nashville after being hit in the helmet by
a pitch, but is expected to play again by Monday. The Pirates say
he does not have a concussion. ... Some teams called GM Cam Bonifay
to inquire about catcher Jason Kendall once his contract talks
reached an impasse, including the White Sox before they dealt for
Charles Johnson. ... Outfielders Adrian Brown (hamstring) and
infielder Enrique Wilson (right wrist) began their rehabilitation
assignments Sunday at Nashville. Wilson is expected to stay only a
couple of days. Wilson was at Triple-A Buffalo on a rehabilitation
assignment when the Indians traded him to Pittsburgh. ... Wil
Cordero was traded a few days after the Pirates began selling their
monthly stadium magazine featuring him on the cover.
Cardinals-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: The Cardinals are on a stretch that has them play 17
of 20 games on the road following the All-Star break. ... Darryl
Kile, Monday's scheduled starter at Montreal, is 6-3 with a 3.52
ERA in 11 starts at Olympic Stadium. ... The Cardinals were 17-8 in
April and 17-10 in June, but went 13-13 in May and are 10-15 in
July with one game remaining. ... St. Louis optioned RHP Gene
Stechschulte to Triple-A Memphis to make room for RHP Mike Timlin,
acquired Saturday from Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Manager Bobby Valentine said he won eBay bidding for a
1969 Bobby Valentine rookie uniform, when he played five games with
the Los Angeles Dodgers. Bidding closed during Sunday's game and
Valentine said he won at $2,000. ... Niela Agbayani missed her
husband's leadoff homer. She was getting food. New York has four
leadoff homers this year, including one by Agbayani on June 16 at
Milwaukee. Jon Nunally (May 3 at San Francisco) and Lenny Harris
(July 18 at Toronto) also accomplished the feat. ... The Mets swept
a three-game series from St. Louis at Shea Stadium for the first
time since April 21-23, 1992. ... Mets starters are 5-1 with a 2.61
ERA in their last 10 games.
Dodgers-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: The Dodgers were shut out Saturday for the third
time when Kevin Brown started. The team hasn't scored in three of
Brown's four losses. Brown has lost 1-0 to Atlanta, 2-0 to Texas
and 3-0 to Philadelphia. ... Jeff Shaw hasn't allowed a run in 7
2-3 innings since returning from the DL on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: SS Alex Arias rejoined the team Sunday after
spending two days in the hospital with stomach pains. Arias took
batting practice, and was available to play, but did not get in the
game. ... Phillies reliever Wayne Gomes, out since July 7 with a
strained right elbow, threw 22 pitches in a simulated game Sunday.
He will begin a rehab assignment on Tuesday with Triple-A Scranton
Wilkes-Barre. ... The Phillies signed seventh-round pick Tony
Cancio. The 6-foot-3, 225-pound first baseman will report to Gulf
Coast League.
Astros-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Poor fielding haunted the Astros again. A day after
committing four errors that led to three unearned runs, 1B Jeff
Bagwell, C Mitch Meluskey and 3B Chris Truby each made miscues,
leading to two Atlanta runs. ''Our pitching didn't look very good,
but that probably was partly because we made so many errors,''
manager Larry Dierker said. ''Their pitching looked excellent, but
they got excellent fielding to back them up.'' ... Houston will
wait until Monday to see whether RHP Shane Reynolds can make his
scheduled start Thursday at Florida. Reynolds left after one inning
Saturday with a tight back.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: SS Rafael Furcal hit .387 (12-for-31) with seven steals
and 11 runs scored during the nine-game homestand. ... RHP Stan
Belinda was in uniform Sunday. Rookie RHP Jason Marquis was
optioned to Triple-A Richmond. ... Atlanta, which opens a nine-game
road trip Tuesday in Arizona, went 7-2 on the homestand. The Braves
are 13-4 since the All-Star break. ... In the clubhouse after the
game, Hall of Fame pitcher Don Sutton, a Braves announcer since
1989, gave LHP Tom Glavine a bottle of champagne to acknowledge his
200th victory. ... CF Andruw Jones, who leads the Braves with 25
homers, is the only major leaguer to play in every inning of every
game this year. Sunday marked Jones' 277th consecutive game,
trailing B.J. Surhoff (417) and Sammy Sosa (332) for the active
lead. ... Jones, a two-time Gold Glove winner, has committed only
one error in his last 213 games.
Rockies-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: The Rockies' 10 runs on Saturday marked their 26th
double-digit offensive outing this season. The Rockies lead the NL
with 628 runs but are last in home runs with 103. Only two teams in
major league history have led their leagues in runs and been last
in homers. ... 3B Jeff Cirillo drew an intentional walk as a
pinch-hitter in the ninth Sunday. He is the Brewers' leading career
hitter with a .307 average -- 18 points lower than his average this
season.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: SS Mark Loretta, on the DL since June 2 with a broken
bone in his left foot, jogged for the first time on turf Sunday. He
is expected to start a rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A
Indianapolis this week. ... At 6-foot-8, Richie Sexson is believed
to be the tallest player in Brewers history. Although he was
acquired for his power hitting, he struck out twice and grounded
out twice but made several fine defensive plays at first base. ...
Brewers starter Jeff D'Amico ran his July record to 5-0 with an
0.76 ERA in a 3-2 win over Colorado Sunday. He also made his first
major league hit a memorable one, a fifth inning home run that tied
the game 1-1.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks' Kitna Throws Two TDs  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. (AP) -- Jon Kitna operated with the poise of a
seasoned veteran who was ready for the Seattle Seahawks' season
opener. Brock Huard looked like he still had a lot of learning to
do.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks scrimmaged for the first time at their training
camp Sunday, and Kitna, headed into his second season as Seattle's
starting quarterback, threw two quick touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   He had a 23-yard TD pass to wide receiver Justin Armour, and an
11-yard scoring pass to tight end Itula Mili in his first two
series against Seattle's first-team defense.
</P>
<P>
   Huard, a second-year pro who hopes to beat out veteran Glenn
Foley to be Kitna's backup this season, was sacked three
consecutive times when he got on the field at Eastern Washington
University's Woodward Stadium. Huard's offense failed to score a
touchdown against Seattle's second-team defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kitna definitely showed he's the leader of the offense,''
running back Ricky Watters said. ''He had control of the team, just
by the way he carried himself confidently. You see the way we were
going up and down the field. That has a lot to do with the
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna helped the Seahawks get to the playoffs last season for
the first time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first couple of drives I thought it went really well,''
Kitna said. ''I need to be more in control and be more of a leader
out there this year. That's one thing I've been trying to focus
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who started one game for the Seahawks and was Kitna's
understudy last season, did not participate in the scrimmage
because of a bad back. He suffered back spasms in the first week of
the team's training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought Jon was pretty controlled in there and ran the team
well,'' coach Mike Holmgren said. ''Our second unit looked like our
second unit. We had trouble pass protecting against our young
second linemen. Brock struggled a little bit today.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard, University of Washington's all-time passing leader, was a
third-round draft choice of the Seahawks last season. He didn't
play in a game as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see what I see,'' Holmgren said. ''You see a talented
young man who needs to play more. And if he gets a chance to play,
he needs to improve. That's what I'm going to be looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have one more week before their exhibition opener.
They'll be at Washington's Husky Stadium next Saturday night
against the Indianapolis Colts. Their regular season opener is
Sept. 3 at Miami.

<HEADLINE> Expos' White Says Cubs Negotiating  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Expos outfielder Rondell White said his agent
was talking to the Cubs about a contract extension amid signs
Sunday that Montreal and Chicago had reached agreement on a
tentative trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, there's something on the table, but if it's not right,
I'm not going to sign with the Cubs,'' White said after the Expos
lost to Cincinnati 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll take it from there and let them do what they're going to
do and see what happens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Teams can only negotiate with a player under contract to another
club by getting permission from the commissioner's office after a
trade agreement has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Cubs nor Expos would comment on whether there was a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will neither confirm nor deny that,'' Cubs general manager
Andy MacPhail said.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for making trades without waivers is 4 p.m. EDT
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   White's name has been prominently mentioned in trade talks. The
New York Yankees, Seattle, Atlanta and Milwaukee had been
interested, but may have backed off because of his injury-plagued
past.
</P>
<P>
   White, 28, has been on the disabled list since July 8 with a
strained right thigh. He hoped to be able to play either Tuesday or
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   White was hitting .307 with 11 homers and 54 RBIs before going
on the DL. Last year, he hit a personal-best .312 and played in a
career-high 138 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last little while, my agent and I have been talking
practically every five minutes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White's contract is set to expire this season, though the Expos
hold a club option for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the Yankees didn't because they want a player who can
play right now,'' he said. ''I guess a lot of teams want to win it
right now, they don't want a player who's hurt and his hamstring
might get pulled again. I think that had a lot to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of made it simple that my future's not with the
ballclub. That's a fact,'' he said. ''Tomorrow, I might still be in
this uniform. Tomorrow, I might not be. I'm just glad that
everything's coming down to an end so I know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs have made a late run to close within 8&AMP;frac12; games of St.
Louis in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I go anywhere, it's going to be a team that's going to win.
They're still rebuilding and everything, but you never know what's
going to happen,'' he said. ''I want to win. I'm tired of losing.''

<HEADLINE> Tougher Death Penalty Rules Wanted  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- National Urban League President Hugh B. Price
called on governments Sunday to institute a tougher ''beyond any
doubt'' standard of guilt for judges and juries in death penalty
cases to ensure the innocent aren't mistakenly executed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's barbaric for the state to kill someone who isn't a mortal
enemy. The folks on death row may not be angels but they are
children of God,'' Price told 1,500 people in a speech kicking off
his organization's annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the new burden of proof in death penalty situations,
Price voiced support for affirmative action, called for a new
commitment to preparing the nation's youth for high-tech employment
in the new economy and for blacks to use the nation's strong
economy as a springboard to economic self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must summon the will and the resources to mount the next
great surge toward the American mainstream,'' Price said. ''There's
never been a better time in U.S. history to make that move now when
unemployment rates hover at record lows.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Price called for a repeal or nationwide
moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   But if executions are not halted, Price called on politicians
''to muster the courage'' and stiffen the standard of guilt in
death penalty cases from ''beyond a reasonable doubt'' to beyond
any doubt at all.
</P>
<P>
   Of today's standard of guilt, Price said: ''I believe that
standard is too lax when someone's life is at stake. Politicians
know full well that some innocent people will be executed. But most
of them lack the courage to say what error rate they find
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Price's plan, if the judge or jury found some doubt
existed and the death penalty couldn't be imposed, they would have
the option of finding the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt and imposing a lesser sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the death penalty and how it is imposed has drawn
heightened public interest and even influenced presidential
politics in recent months with the execution of Gary Graham in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, defended Graham's execution, but critics said the
defendant's defense was doomed by incompetent counsel that failed
to uncover evidence that could have cast doubt on Graham's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   On education, Price said black America shouldn't settle for
second-rate education for its children and that inferior schooling
''leads to economic apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the information age, education unlocks the door to the
economic mainstream,'' Price said.

<HEADLINE> Spooner, Widoff claim Ironman titles in Lake Placid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) - In a thrilling battle, Canada's Melissa
Spooner out-dueled 41-year-old Julia Nievergelt to claim the
women's title at the Isuzu Ironman USA Lake Placid triathlon
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Widoff of Boulder, Colo., turned in a strong performance
in the marathon to claim the men's title.
</P>
<P>
   To win her third Ironman title, Spooner battled the gusty
Nievergelt throughout the 26.2-mile run, going shoulder-to-shoulder
for more than half of the marathon portion of the event.
</P>
<P>
   The Victoria, B.C., resident finished with an overall time of
nine hours 45 minutes and 57 seconds to beat Nievergelt by 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Nievergelt, of Medfield, Mass., logged her best Ironman finish
ever while Barbara Buenahora of Argentina was third. Mary Uhl of
Sante Fe, N.M., was fourth and Christine Heilmann, of Belmont,
Calif., was fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Widoff claimed his first Ironman title by winning the marathon
section in 2:55.53, catching fellow Boulder resident Tony DeBoom
who was staked to a 12-minute lead after excelling in the swim and
bike portions.
</P>
<P>
   Widoff's total time was 8:46:05.
</P>
<P>
   Severe cramping forced DeBoom to walk on the marathon, ending up
33rd.
</P>
<P>
   Jamey Yon of Charlotte, N.C., claimed second among the men
(8:56:34). Cameron Brown of New Zealand third in 8:58:31, his
second straight third place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Dethier of Luxembourg was fourth with Eric Bean of Freemont,
Calif., fifth.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 athletes competed in the Isuzu Ironman USA Lake
Placid triathlon, held for the second time, covering a 2.4-mile
swim, a 112-mile bike and a 26.2-mile run.

   KENNEWICK, Wash. (AP) -- Getting a break when the favored boat
broke earlier, Mark Evans drove E-Lam Plus to victory Sunday in the
Unlimited Hydroplanes competition on the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Budweiser, driven by Dave Villwock, was out early when it
suffered damage in an elimination heat. The boat's right sponson,
the pontoon-like structure that helps a hydroplane rise above the
water, was heavily damaged when Villwock had to veer right to avoid
being hit by Miss Freei.
</P>
<P>
   In the final, Evans ran second to Znetix, driven by Greg Hopp,
but Hopp was penalized a lap for running too slowly before the
moving start and was required to run an extra circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Second was Lowrey's Jeronimo, just ahead of Oh Boy! Oberto.

<HEADLINE> Fairs revamp water systems after deadly E. coli outbreak  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A year after the state's worst-ever E. coli
outbreak, fairgrounds previously using untreated drinking water are
revamping water systems to meet new state requirements.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it meant relying solely on municipal water supplies.
New water treatment systems were installed at other sites, like the
Washington County Fairgrounds in Easton where hundreds were
sickened and two people were killed by last summer's outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Following the outbreak, state Health Commissioner Dr. Antonia
Novello issued emergency orders banning the use of untreated water
at the Washington County Fairgrounds and six other agricultural
fairs.
</P>
<P>
   Chenango, Genesee, Tioga and Wyoming county fairs now use only
water from municipal supplies while the Madison, Orleans and
Washington county fairs have new water systems, said Health
Department spokeswoman Claire Pospisil.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been in contact with all of these fairs to ensure that
they are actually meeting the requirements,'' Pospisil said.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Tepper, the president of the state Association of
Agricultural Fairs, said what happened at the Washington County
Fair was a ''very isolated incident.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not anticipating problems'' at this year's events,
Tepper said. ''The precautions we're taking are really double
safeguards.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wyoming County Fair, which had used water from the Village
of Pike's water system for food preparation and well water for
everything else, has reworked its system after Novello's order,
said Mike Roche, the fair's general superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal water will be used for everything except flushing the
toilets during this year's fair, which runs from Aug. 12-19.
Regular samples are also being taken to make sure water stays
chlorinated and free of contaminants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The belief is that as long as the water sample comes back
negative for bacteria and as long as chlorine is there, it should
be doing its job,'' Roche said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Washington County Fairgrounds, operators dug two new
wells and permanently sealed all but one of eight old wells,
Washington County Fair spokesman Pete Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've gone above and beyond what the Health Department is
requiring us to do,'' Gregg said. ''We're confident it's
consistently going to give us good clean water. It's as good, if
not better than, any municipality system or even bottled water.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said the water treatment systems for the two new wells,
located at opposite ends of the fairgrounds, includes regular
chlorinations and ''microfilters,'' which screen out microorganisms
not killed by chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining old well was kept open for fire emergencies only,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, investigators at the Health Department isolated the
potentially deadly O157:H7 strain of E. coli bacteria from one of
the wells at the fair. However, a report released in March by the
department indicated that the source of the contamination could not
be determined conclusively.
</P>
<P>
   The report said samples from the septic system of a dormitory
located near the contaminated well tested positive for O157:H7, but
officials also did not rule out the possibility of cow manure
seeping into wellwater after a prolonged period of rain during the
fair 40 miles north of Albany in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said the new wells are surrounded by a ''buffer zone''
that will be fenced off, distancing the wells more than 260 feet
away from the nearest septic system or animal waste disposal area.
The new wells were also dug considerably deeper than the old wells,
tapping into an aquifer that is below the area's water.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said the water will be tested at regular intervals by fair
operators and state and county health officials before the
seven-day-long fair begins on Aug. 21. Water will be tested both
for contaminants and chlorination levels three times a day once the
fair starts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Health Department requires chlorine, which kills
bacteria, to be in contact with the water for at least 15 minutes,
Gregg said the fair's water will have a contact time of two days.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said operators decided to install the $100,000 water
treatment systems because it was too expensive to connect to a
municipal supply, the nearest of which is a few miles away from the
fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would probably cost a couple of million'' dollars, he said.
''It was really an impossibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Operators have been relying on treated water trucked into the
fairgrounds since the E. coli outbreak. The new system will first
be put to use in early August during an antiques show.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest test will come during the Washington County
Fair, and fair operators are ''concerned but optimistic'' about
turnout, Gregg said. He added that interest from vendors and
concession exhibitors is actually up this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that if we're effective in letting everyone know we
have a new water system, people will come back, because it's a
great fair.''

<HEADLINE> Polls Give Chavez Firm Advantage  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Exit polls indicated that Venezuelans
endorsed President Hugo Chavez's ''social revolution'' Sunday by
electing him to a new six-year term, consolidating Latin America's
second leftist regime after Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   An exit poll conducted by El Nacional, a leading Venezuelan
daily newspaper, gave Chavez 54 percent of the vote compared to 34
percent for his nearest challenger, former Zulia state Gov.
Francisco Arias Cardenas. Another exit poll by the Internet portal
terra.com.ve gave Chavez 57 percent to 39 percent advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Neither poll indicated its sample size or methodology.
</P>
<P>
   To the cheers of hundreds of supporters, a beaming Chavez cast
his ballot in a Caracas suburb as voting opened Sunday across
Venezuela. ''A new republic is being born,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   A new constitution Chavez pushed through after taking office
last year required public offices to be ''re-legitimized'' through
Sunday's balloting for the presidency, a new 165-member unicameral
legislature, governors, mayors and other offices.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who has completely overhauled Venezuela's institutions
during his short term, has asked voters to look past sharp rises in
crime and unemployment by re-electing him and giving his reform
movement a majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Most Venezuelans seemed to believe Chavez when he vowed to
refocus his revolution from its current emphasis on erasing the old
political order to what matters most to the people: jobs and
personal safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''These problems can't be fixed in one day or one year,'' said
Milagros Iguerara, a 50-year-old housewife standing in line to
vote. ''He is going to need five years or eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of strong support among the poor majority of Venezuela's
23 million people, Chavez, 46, has enjoyed a strong advantage in
the polls over Francisco Arias Cardenas, a former governor who
helped Chavez lead a failed 1992 coup attempt but who broke away
from the president this year. The country's poor overwhelmingly
have put their faith in Chavez's ''social revolution,'' while the
bulk of the middle and upper classes, frightened by Chavez's
attacks on business and his coziness with Cuba, support Arias.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is a testament to previous governments' failure to
provide a decent standard of living in the world's third-largest
oil-exporting country -- and a reminder that not everyone accepts
globalization and free markets as a model for society.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hugo, I am sure that nothing and no one can stop you now,''
Cuban President Fidel Castro told Chavez in a chummy telephone
conversation Saturday as Venezuelan journalists in Cuba interviewed
the Cuban leader.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Chavez wins, he could emerge from the voting with a
weaker mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the local races are closer than the presidential
vote, with many of Chavez's ''revolutionary'' candidates running
close races with incumbents from traditional parties.
</P>
<P>
   The president's movement is expected to win at least a simple
majority in the legislature. But Chavez may fall short of the
two-thirds needed to rubber-stamp presidential appointments and
proposed laws. And the governorships of nearly half of the
country's 23 states could go to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people waited in lines for hours in Sunday's hot
tropical sun to cast ballots filled with dozens of candidates and
parties. The national election board ordered polling stations to
stay open an extra two hours to accommodate the crowds and to
compensate for technical glitches that delayed voting in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Arias cast his ballot hundreds of miles to the west of Caracas
in his home state of Zulia, where he served twice as governor.
</P>
<P>
   The country's fate is now ''in the hands of God and the hands of
the Venezuelan people,'' Arias told reporters. ''At stake is our
way of life of liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias wants to reverse what he calls Chavez's militarization of
Venezuelan society and take a friendlier stance with business
leaders to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, through his fiery speeches attacking a ''rancid
oligarchy,'' has rekindled hope among Venezuelans who have seen
their standard of living steadily decline over the last two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Arias has tried hard to shake his image as the candidate of the
rich, but Chavez's depiction of him as a ''counterrevolutionary''
has played well in the slums and shantytowns that are home to most
Venezuelans.

<HEADLINE> Testaverde Impressive in Opener  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Vinny Testaverde passed his first test.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, playing in a game for the first time since returning
from an Achilles' tendon injury, completed 5-of-9 passes for 131
yards in 17 offensive plays Saturday night in the New York Jets'
24-20 victory over New Orleans in the preseason-opener.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen this coming in practice as his game has gotten
sharper,'' Jets coach Al Groh said Sunday. ''He gave me good reason
to anticipate that kind of performance. I was pleased for him that
this could be a source of real confidence to him.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, who ruptured his left Achilles' tendon in the
regular season-opener last September, threw a 75-yard touchdown
pass to Wayne Chrebet, and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   There were other positives at quarterback for the Jets, who were
unsure of their backup last year even before Testaverde's injury.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lucas, who won six of nine starts as Testaverde's
replacement last season, completed 10-of-11 passes for 88 yards and
a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Pennington, the Jets' 18th overall pick in the first round
of April's draft, entered the game late in the third quarter and
completed 10-of-13 passes for 87 yards. He engineered the Jets'
game-winning drive in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a position of strength we're dealing with right now,''
Groh said. ''Going into camp (last year) we had quite a derby going
on for the backup quarterback position. We never really said, 'This
is our No. 2 guy.' We hoped someone would materialize, but it never
came about until Dan (Henning) developed Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, we've gone to the other end of the spectrum here. Vinny
has certainly established that he's going to play up to his
expected level. Ray began to establish himself last year and
continued his upward climb (Saturday). And Chad got off to a good
start.''

Koreas To Reopen Border Liaisons
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Taking a big step toward reconciliation, North and
South Korea agreed Monday to reopen border liaison offices and reconnect a major
rail line across their heavily armed border. Negotiators from the two sides
announced the measures in a six-point joint statement issued at the end of three
days of Cabinet-level talks in Seoul. They also agreed to hold regular
high-level talks to implement an accord reached at a summit of their leaders in
June.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Several thousand activists in colorful costumes and
bearing signs and banners with diverse messages crowded downtown streets in a
mostly peaceful protest today on the eve of the Republican National Convention.
Several tense confrontations erupted between police and smaller groups of
protesters but they were negotiated with no arrests. However, protesters have
promised greater disruptions beginning tomorrow, and police have indicated they
won't be as willing to compromise. ''It's a cat and mouse game. It's going to go
on all week,'' police Commissioner John Timoney said.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Sen. John McCain urged his delegates today to cross over
and support George W. Bush's nomination for president, on the eve of the most
unified Republican National Convention in years. Democrats, concerned about the
GOP place in the spotlight and lead in the polls, set a multi-million dollar
barrage of television advertisements. Increasingly, they aimed sharp criticism
at vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney's conservative voting record while a
member of Congress. Bush described his vice presidential pick as ''a solid man,
a man of integrity'' as he continued a tour of battleground states.

Concorde Makes Emergency Stop
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British Airways Concorde flying from London to New York had
to make an emergency stop Sunday in eastern Canada after a crew member smelled
gasoline in the cabin, the airline said. Emergency vehicles were on alert as the
Concorde Flight 003 descended into the Gander, Newfoundland, airport but the
landing went ahead without incident, the Canadian Transportation Ministry said.
It was the second problem with one of British Airways' supersonic luxury jets
Sunday and the third in two days -- all after an Air France Concorde crashed
Tuesday outside Paris, killing 114 people. Earlier Sunday, another Concorde was
unable to take off from Heathrow because of a refueling problem, the airline
said.

Hezbollah Warns on US Embassy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- The leader of the militant Islamic group Hezbollah
warned the United States on Sunday against moving its embassy in Israel to
Jerusalem, saying attackers would send the Americans home ''in coffins.'' ''You
(Americans) can move your embassy (to Jerusalem) and send your diplomats there.
But the honorable (Arab) people can turn your embassy to rubble and return your
diplomats in coffins,'' Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said. President Clinton said
Friday that he was considering moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem -- a proposal that infuriated Arabs, many of whom saw it as proof of a
pro-Israeli bias by the United States.

Tougher Death Penalty Rules Wanted

   NEW YORK (AP) -- National Urban League President Hugh B. Price called on
governments today to institute a tougher ''beyond any doubt'' standard of guilt
for judges and juries in death penalty cases to ensure the innocent aren't
mistakenly executed. ''It's barbaric for the state to kill someone who isn't a
mortal enemy. The folks on death row may not be angels but they are children of
God,'' Price told 1,500 people in a speech kicking off his organization's annual
convention. Price also voiced support for affirmative action, called for a new
commitment to preparing the nation's youth for high-tech employment in the new
economy and for blacks to use the nation's strong economy as a springboard to
economic self-sufficiency.

<HEADLINE> Concorde makes emergency stop in Canada  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE RNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) - A British Airways Concorde flying from London to
New York had to make an emergency stop in eastern Canada after a
crew member smelled gasoline in the cabin, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency vehicles were on alert Sunday as the Concorde
descended into the Gander, Newfoundland, airport but the landing
went ahead without incident, Canada's transportation ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is purely a precautionary measure,'' said British Airways
spokeswoman Jemma Moore in London. ''The captain became aware of a
smell at rear of the cabin, and we never take any chances.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second problem with one of British Airways'
supersonic luxury jets Sunday and the third in two days - all after
an Air France Concorde crashed Tuesday outside Paris, killing 114
people. French investigators looking into the crash said Sunday
that flames spewing from the back of the plane were likely caused
by a major fuel leak.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers on Sunday's Concorde flight - including entertainers
Tony Bennett and George Benson - were told midway across the
Atlantic that an emergency landing was planned, according to
Norwegian businessman Jostein Svendsen who was on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Considering the Paris crash, of course quite a lot of
passengers got quite nervous and quite upset,'' said Svendsen in an
interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. ''But it wasn't full
panic, as you may expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's British Airways Flight 003, which had been scheduled to
fly from London's Heathrow airport to New York's John F. Kennedy
airport, was grounded in Gander pending safety checks. The airline
chartered a Boeing 737 to take the 57 passengers to New York on a
flight leaving at 2:45 a.m. local time (0515 GMT).
</P>
<P>
   British Airways engineers from New York were being flown in late
Sunday to inspect the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, a Concorde was unable to take off from
Heathrow because of a refueling problem, the airline said. That
flight to New York, scheduled to depart at 10:30 a.m., was delayed
for more than an hour. The airline called the procedure
''standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers were diverted to another plane, and the morning
flight arrived safely in New York, spokeswoman Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evening, fire trucks and ambulances were put on
standby at Heathrow after a Concorde flight from New York to London
experienced a mixture of fuel and air in the engine. A loud bang
was heard inside the jet, which was ''something like an engine
backfiring,'' a British Airways' spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Air France grounded its fleet of five remaining Concordes after
Tuesday's tragic crash. British Airways is the only other airline
that operate Concordes, and it resumed flights on most of its seven
supersonic jets the day after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the three recent incidents, British Airways expected to
continue operating regular service out of London and New York on
Monday, spokeswoman Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wouldn't be flying unless we thought it was safe,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking into Tuesday's crash, France's Transportation Ministry
said Friday that at least one tire had exploded on the plane's
undercarriage, ''which could have triggered a chain of events,
structural damages, a fire and an engine breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Accident and Inquiry Office, part of France's
Transportation Ministry, said that ''the flames seen after takeoff
did not come from the engine, but, in all likelihood, from a major
fuel leak.''
</P>
<P>
   Air France Flight 4590 went down Tuesday minutes after takeoff
when the jet crashed in a ball of flames into a small hotel in the
town of Gonesse, near Charles de Gaulle airport. All 109 people on
board were killed and five bystanders died on the ground.

<HEADLINE> Astros Deal Doug Henry to Giants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Reliever Doug Henry, who helped San Francisco win
the NL West in 1997, was traded by the Houston Astros to the Giants
on Sunday for pitcher Scott Linebrink.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, 36, was 1-3 with a 4.42 ERA in 44 appearances. He also
had one save, which came June 18 at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, the right-hander pitched two scoreless innings
in Houston's 6-3 loss at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Henry is expected to join the Giants on Monday for a series that
starts at Milwaukee. In 1997, Henry worked 75 games as a setup man
for San Francisco closer Rod Beck.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our familiarity with Doug and his track record makes this a
win-win situation for us,'' Giants general manager Brian Sabean
said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is one-half game behind Arizona in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's trading deadline for deals without waivers is 4 p.m.
EDT Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Henry is 29-39 with 82 saves and a 4.01 ERA in a 10-year career.
He also has pitched for Milwaukee and the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Linebrink, the Giants' second-round pick in the 1997 draft,
appeared in three games during three stints in the majors this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander allowed three earned runs in 2 1-3 innings with
no decisions, including two earned runs in one-third of an inning
Saturday against the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Linebrink, 24 in August, spent most of the season at Triple-A
Fresno, where he was 1-4 with four saves and a 5.23 ERA in 28
appearances.

   DAKOTA DUNES, S.D. (AP) -- Spike McRoy shot a final-round
4-under-par 68 Sunday to win the Dakota Dunes Open by one stroke
over Mike Schuchart.
</P>
<P>
   McRoy, in a three-way tie after the third round, finished the
$500,000 tournament with an 18-under 270 total. He earned $90,000,
the largest sum in the 11-year history of the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I played four good rounds this week,'' said McRoy, who had a
pair of 67s and a 68 in the first three rounds. ''I grinded it out
a little bit harder today. I played some good golf, but I was
due.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuchart had a 68 and was followed by Mike Emery (67), Garrett
Willis (67) and Jeff Hart (69) at 272. John Elliott (70) and Sonny
Skinner (70) were another two shots back.

<HEADLINE> Students Plan Off-Campus Bonfire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- A group of students trying to
continue Texas A&AMP;M University's annual bonfire tradition are
planning an off-campus bonfire this fall, in spite of a two-year
moratorium ordered after last year's deadly collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M officials are critical of the plan and say they will
not support an off-campus bonfire now or in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope anyone giving this consideration would think
about all the people this would affect and think of the
consequences,'' Texas A&AMP;M Vice President for Student Affairs Malon
Southerland said in Sunday's Bryan-College Station Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve people were killed and 27 others injured last November
when the four-story tower of giant logs collapsed during
construction. The bonfire had been a 90-year tradition lit before
the Texas A&AMP;M-University Texas football game.
</P>
<P>
   A commission appointed by the university to investigate the
deaths blamed flawed construction techniques and a lack of adequate
supervision of the students building the stack for its collapse.
University President Ray Bowen has said the bonfire will continue,
but not until at least 2002 and not without better supervision and
a professionally engineered design.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark, part of Keep the Fire Burning, which is planning the
alternative bonfire, said the students and community need to see a
bonfire burn in order to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what is prompting us to do this: The Aggie spirit and
love for bonfire can't be turned off,'' Clark said. ''When Dr.
Bowen released his findings, that was a challenge for us to come up
with a safe plan. ... If the engineers tell us there are problems
though, we will pull back and plan for 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group say they have been meeting with
professional engineers, lawyers, fire safety officials and local
property owners and have chosen Nov. 22 for the event. Past
bonfires have cost as much as $70,000, though group members said
their bonfire would be smaller. They hope to finance it through
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ''A bonfire off campus is not bonfire,'' Southerland said.

Chavez Elected Venezuelan President
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelans endorsed President Hugo Chavez's
''social revolution'' on Sunday by electing him to a fresh six-year term,
consolidating Latin America's second leftist regime after Cuba. With 77 percent
of the votes counted, 59 percent went to Chavez and 37 percent went to his
nearest challenger, former Zulia state Gov. Francisco Arias Cardenas. The
results were revealed late Sunday by the National Electoral Council hours after
they had been scheduled to be released. Celebrations broke out in the capital of
Caracas, with fireworks and revelers in the streets.

Koreas To Reopen Border Liaisons
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Negotiators announced Monday that North and South
Korea agreed to reopen border liaison offices and reconnect a major rail line
across their heavily armed border. The measures were announced in a six-point
joint statement issued at the end of Cabinet-level talks in Seoul. They also
agreed to hold regular high-level talks to implement an accord reached at a
historic summit of their leaders in June. ''The first step we've taken is very
good,'' said chief North Korean delegate Jon Kum Jin. ''We've demonstrated that
if we muster our strength and wisdom, we can make a big achievement.''

Activists Gather on Convention Eve

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Several thousand activists in colorful costumes and
bearing signs and banners with diverse messages crowded downtown streets in a
mostly peaceful protest today on the eve of the Republican National Convention.
Several tense confrontations erupted between police and smaller groups of
protesters but they were negotiated with no arrests. However, protesters have
promised greater disruptions beginning tomorrow, and police have indicated they
won't be as willing to compromise. ''It's a cat and mouse game. It's going to go
on all week,'' police Commissioner John Timoney said.

McCain Urges Delegates: Back Bush
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Sen. John McCain urged his delegates today to cross over
and support George W. Bush's nomination for president, on the eve of the most
unified Republican National Convention in years. Democrats, concerned about the
GOP place in the spotlight and lead in the polls, set a multi-million dollar
barrage of television advertisements. Increasingly, they aimed sharp criticism
at vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney's conservative voting record while a
member of Congress. Bush described his vice presidential pick as ''a solid man,
a man of integrity'' as he continued a tour of battleground states.

Concorde Makes Emergency Stop
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British Airways Concorde flying from London to New York had
to make an emergency stop Sunday in eastern Canada after a crew member smelled
gasoline in the cabin, the airline said. The 57 passengers, who included singer
Tony Bennett and guitarist George Benson, were told midway across the Atlantic
that the supersonic jet would have to be diverted -- giving them a scare in the
wake of Tuesday's crash of an Air France Concorde. Emergency vehicles were on
alert as the Concorde Flight 003 descended into the Gander, Newfoundland,
airport but the landing went without incident, the Canadian Transportation
Ministry said. Earlier Sunday, another Concorde was unable to take off from
Heathrow because of a refueling problem, the airline said.

Hezbollah Warns on US Embassy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- The leader of the militant Islamic group Hezbollah
warned the United States on Sunday against moving its embassy in Israel to
Jerusalem, saying attackers would send the Americans home ''in coffins.'' ''You
(Americans) can move your embassy (to Jerusalem) and send your diplomats there.
But the honorable (Arab) people can turn your embassy to rubble and return your
diplomats in coffins,'' Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said. President Clinton said
Friday that he was considering moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem -- a proposal that infuriated Arabs, many of whom saw it as proof of a
pro-Israeli bias by the United States.

   MONTREAL (AP) -- The Montreal Expos reached agreement to trade Rondell White
to the Cubs, provided Chicago can sign the outfielder to a multi-year contract
extension, The Associated Press learned. Neither the Cubs nor Expos would
comment on whether there was a trade, and White did not know the details. But a
source familiar with the deal, speaking on the condition that he not be
identified, said the Cubs would be allowed to negotiate with White until 10 a.m.
EDT Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The U.S. men's Olympic soccer team edged
English club Bolton Wanderers 1-0 Sunday night in an exhibition
game that served two purposes.
</P>
<P>
   It provided a chance for the American squad to get used to
playing together. And it gave coach Clive Charles one last look at
his roster before he trims it for the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Getting to play helped a lot, especially in the first half,''
said Charles, who will coach his first Olympics team.
</P>
<P>
   In that first half, the U.S. spent a lot of time in Bolton's
end, had several scoring chances and scored the only goal leaving
Charles with some tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Sasha Victorine beat Bolton goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen to a
loose ball in the goalmouth and shot it underneath him into the net
in the 19th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Charles has to pare the roster from 24 to 18 players by Aug. 14.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Fuel Leak Cited in Crash  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Investigators probing the cause of the doomed
Concorde flight said Sunday that the flames spewing out of the
aircraft most likely came from a major fuel leak and that they
believe they have found part of a fuel tank on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The supersonic jet crashed minutes after takeoff Tuesday from
Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, slamming into a hotel outside the
city and killing 114 people. Even as it was leaving the runway to
begin the deadly flight, fire could be seen pouring from the back
of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flames seen after takeoff did not come from the engine,
but, in all likelihood, from a major fuel leak,'' the Accident and
Inquiry Office, part of France's transportation ministry, said in a
statement Sunday. The statement said that ''one of the pieces found
on the runway seems to come from a fuel tank.''
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed, the find could bolster the theory that one or more
of the plane's tires ruptured on takeoff, spewing debris that
pierced a part of the plane near one of the engines and caused a
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Sunday a British Airways Concorde flying from
London made an emergency stop in Gander, Newfoundland, after the
crew smelled gasoline in the cabin, the airline said. The airway
made arrangements to fly the passengers -- including entertainers
Tony Bennett and George Benson -- on to New York.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third problem in two days involving a British
Airways' Concorde, the only other airline to operate the supersonic
luxury jets. Air France grounded its Concorde fleet following
Tuesday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evening, a loud bang was reported inside a Concorde
flight from New York to London, which later landed safely. Then
early Sunday, a Concorde was unable to take off from London's
Heathrow airport because of a refueling problem.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents come as French Transport Minister Jean-Claude
Gayssot called a meeting of international aviation experts on
Sunday to discuss new safety measures before letting Air France
resume its Concorde flights.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists from Air France and the French and British
transportation ministries were to begin meeting Monday ''in view of
an eventual resumption of flights'' of Air France's supersonic
jetliners, said Jacques Girerd, spokesman for France's civil
aviation authority. Experts from British Airways and from engine
builders Rolls Royce and Snecma were also expected to attend,
Girerd said.
</P>
<P>
   The Transport Ministry had said it would consult a report on the
disaster, expected at the end of August, before allowing Air France
Concordes to fly again. But flights could resume as early as this
week following specialists' talks on additional safety measures and
checks for the aircraft, an official from France's civil aviation
authority was quoted as saying in the Journal du Dimanche.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Concorde's relatively unblemished safety record,
blown-out tires have been blamed in the past for brushes with
near-disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board reported
five ''potentially catastrophic'' incidents resulting from
blown-out tires during Concorde takeoffs from June 1979 to February
1981. British Airways' fleet of seven Concordes has suffered about
12 blown tires since 1988, London's Sunday Times quoted an
unidentified executive at the airline as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The paper also reported that Britain's Civil Aviation Authority
issued emergency safety warnings in 1998 detailing problems with
the Concorde's engines. The problems included cracks in the engine
cooling rings, compressor discs and exhaust vanes, as well as
frayed wires. The cracks had caused ''significant damage'' to the
engine turbines that could cause an engine fire, the paper quoted
the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified British Airways executive told the paper that
the problems had posed no immediate threat to the planes' safety.
He said the warnings, which were also passed on to Air France and
the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, were acted upon.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, one of the British Airways Concordes was unable to
take off from London's Heathrow airport because of a refueling
problem, the airline said. The flight to New York, scheduled to
depart at 10:30 a.m., was delayed for more than an hour while the
airline switched about 50 passengers to another Concorde, which
flew them safely to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a problem with aircraft refueling, so the passengers
were put onto another Concorde aircraft which we always have on
standby,'' a British Airways spokeswoman said on condition of
anonymity. ''It was standard procedure.''

<HEADLINE> 8 Cops Found Dead in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Airlifted in U.S.-made combat
helicopters, Colombian troops flew to a remote mountain town Sunday
to battle rebels who attacked a police station and claimed to have
killed nearly two dozen officers.
</P>
<P>
   Just before dusk, 150 army troops and national police flew into
the town of Arboleda aboard Blackhawk and Huey helicopters, said
national police chief Gen. Ernesto Gilibert. Some troops also
arrived on foot and clashed with rebels as they approached the
town.
</P>
<P>
   The army confirmed the deaths of eight police officers and at
least two civilians, and said the death toll was likely to rise as
soldiers secure the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Troops ... found the bodies of eight police officers amid the
ruins of their barracks, which was totally destroyed,'' said Army
Col. Alberto Ardila, commander of the army's Eighth Brigade, which
went to the scene of the two-day rebel attack.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces found only three survivors of Arboleda's 25-man
police contingent, said Alfonso Rodriguez Guerrero, an officer at
national police headquarters in Bogota, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Troops and police reinforcements, operating in the dark in a
chaotic situation, were trying to determine the fate of the rest of
the besieged policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Ardila told local radio that two civilians were killed.
Rodriguez Guerrero put the number at three.
</P>
<P>
   The attack by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, was one of the bloodiest since the United States approved
$1.3 billion in aid to battle leftist rebels and other armed groups
who are involved in narcotics production.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has arisen over whether U.S.-supplied combat
helicopters, which provide security for planes fumigating drug
crops in Colombia, should be used in counterinsurgency operations.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said radio transmissions from the besieged police
officers had been cut after midnight, about 15 hours after the
attack began Saturday morning. Rebels told a local photojournalist
who tried to enter the town Sunday morning that they had killed 23
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Communications with Arboleda have been severed and there is no
way to verify this information, but we fear the worst,'' said
police Col. Norberto Pelaez, police commander of Caldas province,
where Arboleda is located.
</P>
<P>
   Low cloud cover prevented reinforcements from arriving until
late Sunday. Troops also spent hours hiking over twisting mountain
trails to Arboleda, located 90 miles northwest of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Curtis W. Kamman said Colombian security forces
weren't restricted to using the U.S.-made helicopters only in
anti-drug operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''These helicopters can be used ... to defend the police and
military forces if they are under attack in a zone where there are
anti-narcotics activities,'' Kamman was quoted as saying in an
interview on Saturday with ANCOL, the Colombian government's news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   However, Arboleda is not believed to be in a region producing
cocaine or heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say U.S. policy regarding military aid to
Colombia is growing increasingly blurry, and can lead to the United
States being drawn into the South American nation's 35-year civil
war. But others charge that restrictions on the U.S. support are
too tight.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's attack was similar to one mounted by the FARC on
July 15 on the southwestern town of Roncesvalles. The rebels
besieged the police station in the town, and after police ran out
of ammunition, the guerrillas allegedly executed 13 of the
officers. The deaths drew criticisms -- including in the U.S.
Congress -- that the Blackhawks, if used, could have saved the
policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new U.S. aid package, approved by President Clinton on
July 13, Washington will provide 60 more helicopters, including
Blackhawks and Hueys, to Colombian security forces.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 8, Rangers 7  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Dean Palmer hit a two-run homer and an
RBI single in the first two innings as the Detroit Tigers built a
big early lead and held on to beat the Texas Rangers 8-7 Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers scored six runs in the first inning for the second
straight night, even after their first two batters made outs. Juan
Gonzalez then had an RBI single, Palmer hit his 20th homer and
Shane Halter had a three-run triple.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, which earned a split in the four-game series, led 7-0
when Palmer's single followed Gonzalez's double in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who added an RBI double in the seventh after another
Gonzalez hit, wasn't part of the nine-player trade last November
that sent Gonzalez from Texas to Detroit. The Rangers traded Palmer
to Kansas City in 1997, and he signed with Tigers as a free agent
after the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was 3-for-5. The former two-time AL MVP finished
8-for-16 in his only trip to The Ballpark in Arlington this season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite struggling, Willie Blair (8-2) earned the victory by
pitching into the sixth inning. He gave up four runs on seven hits
and three walks before being pulled after former Tiger Bill
Haselman's leadoff single in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones got three outs for his league-leading 29th save in 30
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Texas starter Darren Oliver (2-6) lasted only two innings,
allowing seven runs on eight hits. The left-hander apparently isn't
recovered from the weakness in his left shoulder that sidelined him
for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from the disabled list July 20, Oliver is 0-2
with a no-decision and a 12.31 ERA (16 earned runs in 11 2-3
innings). This outing was his shortest since going just two innings
for St. Louis against Houston on Sept. 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton's second RBI single made it 7-3 in the fourth
inning, but the Rangers missed an opportunity for more when Rusty
Greer struck out with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The first hit for Clayton, whose seven-game hitting streak is a
season-high, came in the second inning. That followed a double by
Haselman that scored Gabe Kapler, who doubled to extend his hitting
streak to 14 games, tying a team high this season.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alicea had a sacrifice fly and Chad Curtis a pinch-hit RBI
single in the sixth for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Haselman's third hit, a bloop single to left, cut it to 8-6
before Mike Lamb's RBI groundout scored the final run in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Detroit scored six first-inning runs for the second
straight night, again without help from Damion Easley. The leadoff
hitter was 0-for-4 combined in his first-inning at-bats. ... Palmer
has 20 home runs for the seventh time. ... Kapler has an extra-base
hit in seven straight games, one short of a Texas record. ... With
a crowd of 40,167, the Rangers went over the 2 million mark in home
attendance for the fifth straight year and 11th time in 12 seasons.
... Blair is the first Detroit pitcher with eight wins. ... The
Tigers, who won 10-2 Saturday, are just 5-11 following a game in
which they scored 10 or more runs.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe May Seize White Farms  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HARTNACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- The government plans to redistribute
3,000 farms by the end of the year, government-run radio reported
Sunday, raising fears of a dramatically stepped-up move against
Zimbabwe's white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation said Ignatius Chombo,
minister of local government, made the announcement after a meeting
of ministers and officials responsible for land reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''The army will provide necessary transport and
infrastructure,'' Chombo was quoted as saying. But the ZBC did not
say from whom the farms would be acquired or what area they
covered. The report could not immediately be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Robert Mugabe has already said it
will confiscate 804 of the country's some 4,000 white-owned farms
and give the land to poor blacks, and Mugabe has said he wants to
redistribute many times more.
</P>
<P>
   A group representing white farmers was quick to condemn the new
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot think such an outrageous statement would be official
government policy,'' said David Hasluck, executive director of the
Commercial Farmers Union, who hopes to meet Mugabe on Monday to
discuss the land crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers' union has said it will join labor unions in a
three-day strike beginning Wednesday to protest political violence
and the occupation of more than 1,600 white farms by
government-backed squatters.
</P>
<P>
   A government spokesman speaking on state radio Sunday called the
land seizures ''irreversible'' and warned of unspecified action by
the government if the strike takes place.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government has reached the stage where it will not sit
idly by and watch as the country is pushed to the edge by people
with the hidden agenda,'' information minister Jonathan Moyo said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an election agent for the main opposition party was
stabbed to death in what is believed to be the latest attack
inspired by political violence plaguing Zimbabwe, an official for
the Movement for Democratic Change said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The badly mutilated body of Itayi Mugawu, who was agent for the
party's candidate in Harare's Dzivaresekwa suburb during
parliamentary elections last month, was dumped Thursday near his
home.
</P>
<P>
   At least 38 opposition supporters and five white farmers died in
violence revolving around the land occupations in the five months
leading to the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe calls the farm occupations a legitimate protest against
unfair control of land by a tiny white minority, mostly descendants
of British and South African settlers from Zimbabwe's days as a
British colony. White farmers control about a third of Zimbabwe's
productive land.

<HEADLINE> Browns 33, Eagles 22  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN AFFLECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Ty Detmer stole the spotlight from Courtney
Brown's NFL debut, throwing two touchdown passes as the Cleveland
Browns beat the Philadelphia Eagles 33-22 Sunday in the preseason
opener for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer completed 12 of 14 passes for 128 yards, and directed
three TD drives for Cleveland, all against Eagles reserves.
</P>
<P>
   He capped a 53-yard drive late in the first half by throwing a
2-yard TD pass to a wide open Mark Campbell that put Cleveland
ahead 14-10 with 1:56 left.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Grasmanis muffed the ensuing kickoff and the Browns
recovered at the Philadelphia 31-yard line. A pass interference
penalty put Cleveland on the Eagles 1 a few plays later, and rookie
Travis Prentice scored from there with 53 seconds remaining in the
half to give the Browns a 21-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On his last drive, Detmer went 4-of-5 and capped a 66-yard drive
with a 13-yard TD pass to JaJuan Dawson to give Cleveland a 27-16
lead with 5:17 left in the third quarter. Cleveland went for a
two-point conversion, but Detmer's pass fell incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the first overall pick in the draft, started the game. He
had no tackles but seemed to hold his own in about a quarter of
play. Although he was fooled by a fake on the game's first play -- a
9-yard completion from Donovan McNabb to Cecil Martin -- the
defensive end from Penn State also knocked down McNabb on one pass
rush.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Philadelphia was its starters outperformed
their Cleveland counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles defense held the Browns to 25 yards of offense in the
first quarter, and set up Philadelphia's first touchdown when Brian
Dawkins intercepted a pass by Tim Couch that deflected off Kevin
Johnson's hands. Dawkins returned it 44 yards to the Browns 4.
After an incompletion, McNabb threw a TD pass to Duce Staley.
</P>
<P>
   On Philadelphia's next possession, McNabb completed five
straight passes before misfiring on two, stalling the drive. David
Akers then kicked a 45-yard field goal to put the Eagles ahead 10-0
with 2:11 left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Akers also kicked a 37-yard field with seven seconds left in the
first half and Rich Maston added a 20-yard field goal with 8:25
remaining in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Koy Detmer answered his brother's last TD by throwing a 40-yard
TD pass to Alex Van Dyke on the Eagles' next play from scrimmage to
cut the Cleveland lead to 27-22 with 4:47 left in the third
quarter. The two-point conversion attempt failed.
</P>
<P>
   Couch started the game but only got the Browns moving after the
Eagles put their second-team defense in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second quarter, Couch scrambled 20 yards for a
first down, then threw a 47-yard pass to David Patten, who
outwrestled Allen Rossum to make the catch at the Eagles 2-yard
line. Patten had five catches for 95 yards on the night.
</P>
<P>
   Errict Rhett plunged into the line three times, finally scoring
to cut Philadelphi'as lead to 10-7 with 8:29 left in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Rahshon Spikes closed out the scoring with a 12-yard scoring run
with 8:43 left in the game. The Browns failed on another two-point
conversion attempt.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Browns and Eagles played in preseason last year.
Philadelphia won 30-17. The two will play in the regular season on
Dec. 10. ... Philadelphia was the first team Cleveland played when
it broke into the league in 1950. The Browns beat the
then-defending NFL champion Eagles 35-10. ... Just six of the
Browns who started last year's preseason opener started Sunday
night. ... Jon Runyan, who signed a $30 million deal with the
Eagles in the offseason, sat out Sunday's game with an injured
back.

<HEADLINE> Miami 64, Seattle 51  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Sheri Sam's 17 points and seven rebounds helped
the Miami Sol deal the Seattle Storm their third straight loss
64-51 Sunday night in a matchup of expansion teams.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle played without its two leading scorers, Edna Campbell
and Kamila Vodichkova. Campbell, averaging 13.9 points a game,
suffered a bruised left knee at the end of the Storm's game against
Phoenix on Friday, and Vodichkova, averaging nine points, has a bad
Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Miami moved out to a 20-8 lead midway through the first half,
controlled the boards and never let Seattle come close.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, which never trailed, collected 25 first-half rebounds to
Seattle's eight and led 35-20 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Seattle showed some life, going on a 10-0
run with 9:22 to play and cutting the Sol's 24-point lead to 14.
</P>
<P>
   But Miami recovered with 3-pointers by Jamie Cassidy and Katrina
Colleton, and although Seattle chipped away, it could not cut the
lead to fewer than 11.
</P>
<P>
   Marlies Askamp scored 16 points and Debbie Black added 11 for
the Sol. Quacy Barnes led the Storm, which fell to a WNBA-worst
4-23, with 16 points.

<HEADLINE> Vote Representation Out of Platform  </HEADLINE>
By SETH HETTENA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A plank calling for voting representation in
Congress for the District of Columbia, perhaps the most important
issue for the capital's fledgling GOP, was accidentally left out of
the Republican platform.
</P>
<P>
   ''It fell through the cracks,'' said James Lowe, the national
committeeman from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the capital's Republican delegation said the call for
voting representation in Congress has been included in every GOP
platform since 1972. Its absence from this year's platform went
unnoticed until any chance of easily amending the document had
lapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're upset that it was omitted,'' said Ann Heuer, head of the
15-member delegation. ''We're going to see if we can fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ginny Wolfe, speaking for the Republican National Committee,
said, ''It would be difficult to amend the document at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   The platform is being ratified Monday on the opening day of the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who serves as the district's
delegate in the House, can vote in congressional committees but not
on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The platform committee approved the document Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans do not support statehood for the capital but
bipartisan support exists for voting rights in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Schmid, an alternate for the district's Republicans, said
it was the delegation's top priority for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   District Councilwoman Carol Schwartz spent hundreds of dollars
of her own money printing up placards and buttons that read: ''Let
D.C. Vote. It's only fair.''

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Fire At Russians  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Backed by attack aircraft and heavy
artillery, Russian troops launched search and destroy missions
Sunday in Chechnya's southern mountains near the border with
Georgia, the military command's press service said.
</P>
<P>
   Combat jets bombarded suspected rebel positions in mountain
passes during the operation, the press service said, and mines were
placed on trails.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops are trying to cut off and annihilate remaining
bands of Chechen independence fighters in a military campaign that
began in September. Russia has occupied most of the rebellious
region, but small bands of rebels have kept fighting, using the
rugged southern mountains to hide their movements.
</P>
<P>
   Russia accuses Georgia, the only foreign country bordering
Chechnya, of letting fighters bring men and supplies across the
border, something Georgia denies.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have kept up hit-and-run attacks even in lowland
areas taken months ago by the Russians. On Sunday, officials said
rebels fired on Russian positions 11 times during the previous
night, including six attacks on federal facilities in the capital
Grozny, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   No casualties were reported, and a spokesman for the Interior
Ministry said the situation in the city was unchanged as a result
of the attacks and there was no need to tighten security.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been no instructions on this score and there is no
tightening of controls in the Chechen capital,'' the spokesman told
the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Forces in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan were put on
alert Sunday near the border with Chechnya amid fears of a new
rebel attack. The precautions were taken in the face of threats by
guerrilla leaders to launch attacks in those areas, the press
center told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out in a 1994-96 war with the rebels.
Moscow's forces went back into Chechnya after militants based there
raided villages in Dagestan in August, and after some 300 people
were killed in apartment bombings in Russia that government blamed
on Chechen terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Moroccan King Marks Year in Power  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLAS MARMIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- King Mohammed VI on Sunday marked his
first year on the throne with promises to move his North African
nation toward becoming ''a modern society'' by establishing rule of
law and reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old monarch inherited the throne on July 30, 1999,
after the death of his father, King Hassan II, who ruled for 38
years.
</P>
<P>
   Dignitaries and some of the world's last remaining monarchs
attended a celebration at the royal palace in Rabat, including the
Sultan of Brunei and Jordan's King Abdullah II.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech broadcast on national television, Mohammed VI told
his nation that reforms were among his top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   He called on politicians to end the partisan quarrels that
gridlock the government. He also said he will take measures to
strengthen rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   To ease mounting poverty, he said he wants to increase social
planning.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between rich and poor continues to widen in this North
African country of 30 million people, where the unemployment rate
stands at 20 percent. Economic growth is stagnant and drought is a
major problem for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, the king has followed in his father's
footsteps, maintaining alliances with the United States and France
and seeking to remain a force of reconciliation in the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In a message to the king, President Clinton said the United
States looked forward to ''several years of special relations''
with the king and with Morocco.
