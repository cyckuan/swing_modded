GINGRICH SAYS HE WALKED THE PLANK FOR HIS PARTY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich, in his first
extended remarks since announcing his departure from Congress, says
he decided to step down to avoid a divisive battle for his job that
might damage the Republican Party and its chance to regain the
White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make a decisive choice between my own interests and
what I believe to be the more important cause of the country and my
party,'' Gingrich told political supporters at a Washington hotel
Monday. ``On Friday it became clear to me that if I were to remain
in the House, I would be an excuse for divisiveness and
factionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideas are too big, the issues are too important for any
one person to put their office above the good of the country and
the party.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech before GOPAC, a political action committee that has
been a key part of Gingrich's election machinery, marked the first
lengthy comments by the speaker since he announced Friday he would
leave both his leadership post and his seat representing suburban
Atlanta. He resigned after Republicans lost five House seats in the
Nov. 3 election, rather than posting the gains party leaders had
promised.
</P>
<P>
   Before the speech, Gingrich, 55, warmly greeted Representative
Bob Livingston of Louisiana, a one-time political ally who helped
push Gingrich to retire by announcing his own candidacy for the
speaker's job on Friday. Livingston appeared to clinch the race for
speaker Monday, as the only other declared candidate dropped out.
In his address, Gingrich called Livingston ``the next speaker of
the House.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 45-minute address, Gingrich trumpeted the party's
successes of the past two decades and laid out an extensive agenda
for the Republican Congress. He appeared to address critics who
complained he had fumbled the election by focusing too much on the
possible impeachment of President Clinton and too little on winning
congressional achievements that would help Republican candidates at
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said the federal surplus, expected to total $1.6
trillion over the next decade, ``belongs to the American taxpayer,
not the Washington bureaucrats. ... Let's get it back home at a
rate faster than Al Gore and Teddy Kennedy can invent new
bureaucracies.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress should ``save'' the Social Security program,
which faces financial troubles early in the next century, by
allowing workers to pay their retirement taxes into individual
retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also said the surplus should be returned to voters
through tax cuts, including a 5 percent cut in capital gains taxes
and the elimination of inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Touching other traditional GOP themes, Gingrich also called on
Congress to boost spending for a system to defend against enemy
missiles and to create vouchers that allow parents to send their
children to the schools of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted from Alexis de Tocqueville and from the founding
documents of the nation. He offered no clues about his future
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the highlights of his own career, Gingrich said it was
``a tremendous honor'' to be the first Republican speaker since
1954 and the first to be reelected since 1928.
</P>
<P>
   To great applause, he displayed a copy of the original Contract
with America that appeared as an advertisement in TV Guide. He said
the Republican-led Congress had fulfilled the contract by passing
welfare reform, a balanced budget, IRS reform, antidrug
legislation, and a boost in military spending, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking before GOPAC, Gingrich returned to an organization
that played a large part in both his rise and his fall.
</P>
<P>
   The political action committee was created in 1979 by Republican
governors to help fund candidates for state offices. When Gingrich
took control in 1986, he turned its attention to congressional
races.

MCLAREN REJOINS BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Six weeks into the new season, the Bruins finally got
their old team back together, reaching agreement on a three-year
pact with Kyle McLaren that will pay the 21-year-old defenseman at
least $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, expected to be signed Tuesday when McLaren reports to
practice, includes reasonably achievable bonuses that could boost
the total value to $5.175 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an all right deal,'' said a relieved but subdued McLaren,
reached at home Monday. ``I don't think it's the best deal for me,
but it's something that I can accept for now. I'll accept it, but I
don't like the way it was negotiated at all.''
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to a three-year pact, McLaren surrendered his
opportunity to go to salary arbitration after the 1999-2000 season.
Had he not agreed to a three-year pact, however, McLaren wasn't
going to do better than a one-year deal at $800,000, a deal the
Bruins insisted be discounted for the month-plus of work he missed
while holding out.
</P>
<P>
   The sides had agreed to a one-year deal late last week, but it
fell apart when McLaren's lead agent, Doug Messier, insisted that
his client be remunerated for the lost wages. When talks resumed
Monday, following a phone conversation between McLaren and
assistant general manager Mike O'Connell on Sunday, the sides went
back to discussing a three-year pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting on the bus (prior to the game Sunday in North
Carolina), talking to him by phone, and I said, `Kyle, this is
getting ridiculous,''' said O'Connell. ``They weren't going to get
that money back unless they gave up something in return _ and what
they gave up is term. Once we had (three years), we could make
adjustments _ and that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren's options, beyond sitting out and forfeiting a year's
pay, essentially were nil. The NHL requested last week that IHL
teams stop offering holdouts safe havens, places to keep their
games warm and their bills paid while they continue contract talks.
McLaren also couldn't have joined the Canadian national team
unless, essentially, the Bruins agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't think that was going to happen,'' said McLaren.
</P>
<P>
   It now is up to Pat Burns and his coaching staff to decide when
McLaren gets back in the lineup. Including training camp, McLaren
has missed two months of active duty. He believes he'll be
game-ready in short order, but he'll leave that decision to Burns &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in pretty good shape, but I don't want to rush myself,
either,'' said McLaren. ``I guess I could be ready this Thursday,
or the weekend, but I'll see how it goes starting (today), and then
I'll let them know how I feel, and they'll let me know how they
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   According to O'Connell, the deal was not made with the idea of
signing McLaren and shipping him out in a trade. The Bruins see him
as a key element on their blue line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drafted him,'' said O'Connell. ``We know what we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Potentially, the deal represents nearly a threefold salary
increase for McLaren, whose original three-year deal expired in the
spring. Initially, he was aiming for the $2 million-a-year
neighborhood but had to settle for considerably less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy it's done,'' said McLaren. ``It gets me back on the
ice, playing for a team I love and a coach I love. But I still
feel, for what I've done the last three years, I could have done a
little better. But that's not the way Harry (Sinden) and Mike
looked at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing has left me with a bitter taste. This is
something that I'm never going to forget. Hopefully, I'll have a
long career and this is just a bump in the road. Hopefully, down
the road, I can earn the money, and deserve the money I think I can
get. I'm dedicated to my coach and my teammates, I'm glad to be
back. But this is going to leave something in my mouth the whole
season.''

 &HT;    TOP HOUSE JOBS TO BE DECIDED NEXT WEEK
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are descriptions of the major leadership posts
that Republican House members will fill at their Oct. 18
organizational meeting.
</P>
<P>
   These duties often shift slightly from one Congress to another,
depending on the personalities and experience of the people who
hold the jobs. But the general responsibilities are shaped by
decades of tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's salary is $175,000 and the majority leader's is
$151,800. All other leaders receive the standard House member's pay
of $136,700.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKER
</P>
<P>
   The only House officer mentioned in the Constitution, the
speaker presides over the floor proceedings, controls the
legislative agenda, recognizes speakers in debates, and has a major
role in appointing committees and chairmen. The speaker _ who need
not be a member of Congress _ also stands third in line for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will pick their nominee for the post Oct. 18, but
the final vote takes place after the full House convenes Jan. 6.
The vote for speaker is generally cast along party lines, a
practice that has guaranteed that the majority party controls the
speakership.
</P>
<P>
   MAJORITY LEADER
</P>
<P>
   Chosen by the majority party in the House, this top assistant to
the speaker carries much of the day-to-day responsibility for
scheduling, managing and promoting the party's legislation on the
House floor. He or she also acts as a primary public spokesman for
party positions.
</P>
<P>
   MAJORITY WHIP
</P>
<P>
   The job of the whip is to keep track of support for major
legislative issues and to make sure party members are present for
close votes. The whip is assisted by scores of deputies and
assistants who constantly count votes and lobby party members to
vote for bills strongly backed by the House leadership. However,
the whip has no formal powers to require party loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the post comes from ``whipper-in,'' a British
hunting term for the person who keeps foxhounds from leaving the
pack.
</P>
<P>
   CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN
</P>
<P>
   This post calls for keeping the House Republican membership,
known as the party conference, up to date on provisions of
legislation coming to the floor. The conference sets party rules,
builds unity through retreats and other meetings, sends out
research on major issues, and faxes news releases to the news media
giving the party's views.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
</P>
<P>
   A key figure in election efforts, this official has the job of
raising campaign funds and distributing them, chiefly on behalf of
the party's incumbents. The campaign chairman puts candidates in
touch with a network of political action committees from various
business and special interests.

 &HT;    From sodier's uniform to basketball uniform
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As a teenager growing up in Kefar Sava, a town
some 20 kilometers northwest of Tel Aviv, Israel, he heard Scud
missiles go across his house and destroy parts of nearby
neighborhoods during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later _ playing for the 18-and-under Israeli
national basketball team that was touring Europe _ he ended up at a
game in Mannheim, Germany, where a mob of skinhead thugs outside
the gym jeered him and his teammates, shouting, as he called it,
``threats and Nazi trash talk.''
</P>
<P>
   And just a couple of years ago, he found himself on nighttime
patrol along the streets of the conflict-torn Gaza Strip. These
were the same streets were fellow soldiers had been ambushed and
killed by Palestinian terrorists, the same streets where he himself
had had rocks and spit and insults hurled his way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for everything he's heard and seen and endured, nothing
made the Wright State basketball debut of Israel Sheinfeld any
easier last week. As the freshman sat in the Nutter Center dressing
room with his teammates and waited to play a meaningless exhibition
game against a loosely-knit club of local players, he was on edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had real butterflies,'' Sheinfeld said. ``I was nervous
about how I'd do playing college basketball in America. I wasn't
sure, 'Would I fit in over here?'''
</P>
<P>
   That night and again Monday in the Raiders'final preseason game
against Athletes in Action, Sheinfeld came off the bench and showed
a promising mix of inside bulk and a soft, left-handed touch. And
that has prompted Wright State assistant coach Will Rey to assuage
the big man's fears: ``He's going to fit just fine. Israel is real
conscientious and has a ton of potential, he just needs to get
comfortable with the speed and intensity of the game over here.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, instead of the hunter green of Wright State,
Sheinfeld was dressed in the dark green uniform of the Israeli
army. Rather than those black and white Nike Face-Up shoes of the
Raiders, he wore combat boots, a beret and carried an M-16 rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The guy the other Wright State players simply call ''Big Is''
spent three years as a soldier in the Israeli Army. But while
military service was his duty, American college basketball was his
dream. And because he was 6-foot-10, 250 pounds and had an
impressive basketball resume _ playing on national teams that
toured Italy, Greece, Bulgaria, Sicily, Yugoslavia and Macedonia,
as well as playing as an amateur on three different teams in the
first division of the Israel pro league _ switching uniforms wasn't
that tough when his military duty ended in March.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sheinfeld ending up at Wright State has been pure hoop
happenstance. His coaches had sent tapes of him to American
colleges, then talked him up at the basketball camps _ most notably
the Five Star Camps _ they participated in.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was set to go to Iowa, but it took a while to get his
transcript together after he left the army. The Hawkeyes said they
couldn't wait and signed a 7-foot- 1 All-America player instead .
</P>
<P>
   Sheinfeld finally took one recruiting trip _ a 48-hour whirlwind
visit to McNeese State _ but Lakes Charles, La., was too much of a
culture shock on his first visit ever to the United States. In
June, he returned to America for a look at Wright State, where
Raider coaches showed him the Nutter Center from a dozen different
angles, let him hobnob with a few players and, before he caught a
flight back to Tel Aviv, made sure they got his name on a letter of
intent.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Sheinfeld signed here when the University of Miami
(Fla.) made him an offer. ``It didn't matter because I gave Wright
State my word,'' he said. ``And I think Ohio and Dayton are best
for me and what I want to do. I like quieter places. If I went to
New York City, Boston or California, I might not concentrate on my
basketball like I should. Back in Israel, we consider America as a
promised land. This is like a dream coming here and I want to make
sure I do the best to make my dreams happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That the 22-year-old Sheinfeld is so able to look ahead, might
have something to do with what he can look back upon. His father
was a Russian Jew who experienced the bias and persecutions of the
pogroms in the Soviet Union. And several family members in the
generation before that were killed in the Holocaust. His mother's
family was driven from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Israel, which Sheinfeld _ using his fingers to
indicate quote marks _ calls ``a war country,'' meant developing a
special mindset: ``When you live somewhere where you never know
where the next act of terrorism might be, you get a certain point
of view on the world. It's not as carefree a life as America kids
live. For us, we go to a mall or a crowded spot and you always feel
a police presence. You never know when someone might try to hurt
people in a crowd. Lots of innocent people _ on both sides _ are
dying.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why now _ as Israeli and Palestinian leaders try to
cobble a Mideast peace accord against a backdrop of violence like
last Friday's deadly car bombing in Jerusalem _ Sheinfeld perches
himself in front of the television in the team's lounge: ``I try to
watch CNN to see what is happening. Peace is our only hope to
change things for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is now, as soon as Israeli boys and girls turn 18, they
are required to spend three years in the military, Sheinfeld said.
In his service, he learned to handle weapons like an Uzi, Galil,
M-16 and grenades and he spent his time in places like the Gaza
Strip. Eventually, he got reassigned to administrative work because
he was designated a ``special athlete.'' That enabled him to play
in the Israel league and represent his country in international
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all his experience, he said adjusting here has been
tough. When he first came came to Wright State 10 weeks ago, he was
terribly homesick. Since then, some Israeli military families who
are involved with projects at Wright Patterson Air Force Base have
taken him under their wing, inviting him for dinners of his beloved
schnitzel. Assistant coach Ken Barer, who is Jewish, has taken him
to the Beth Jacob synagogue on North Main.
</P>
<P>
   As for getting fully comfortable on the court, that may take a
little more time. ``Basketball is totally different here,''
Sheinfeld said. ``The speed and intensity are greater and I must
improve my strength, my technique. Coach Rey is a good big man
coach and he is building me over brick by brick. I want to be sure
I'm solid when he is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, anyone who saw Sheinfeld that day in Mannheim _ when
he used nothing but a basketball to dunk Nazi bile _ knows he
already is pretty solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coach had prepared us mentally and psychologically for
their hostility that day and I was ready,'' he said. ``I ended up
with 18 points, 10 rebounds and I made the game winning free throw
in the last second. It's the basketball moment I remember most...so
far.''

 &HT;    Kids' responses teach lesson about `Johnnies' of the world
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. _ A while back one of my columns raised the
question: Who failed Johnny? Was it his teachers? His parents? The
system? Or was it Johnny himself?
</P>
<P>
   There were no ponderous solutions offered. Obviously, if I had
inside knowledge as to why kids aren't making it in school, we'd
have no more failures, and the folks at Mt. Rushmore would be
blasting out a new face on the side of the mountain. Mine.
</P>
<P>
   Response to the ``Johnny'' article was substantial. Mail from
concerned parents and educators flooded in from every corner of the
country - all echoing the same theme: We must do something about
Johnny. But what? The writers weren't pointing fingers or laying
blame on any particular doorstep, and none had a cure-all for
education's ills. All we're frustrated with the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   One reader, a teacher of Navajo children in New Mexico, went a
step further. He had his writing class (a group he refers to as ``a
bright little crew of mixed 9th- to 12th-graders'') read ``Who's
Failing Johnny?'' and write a critique. He mailed the results to
me. What his students had to say about the ``Johnnies'' in the
system was too good not to be shared.
</P>
<P>
   Eutovia writes: ``I really don't know what can be done, but all
I know is that maybe if I don't turn in more assignments, then I
probably could fit into that same position.''
</P>
<P>
   Almeria: ``In my opinion Johnny is failing Johnny. The parents
should understand that their child is not making an effort in
class. The student may just be fooling around and talking in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The student probably doesn't even show up in class daily. That
is a problem teachers have to deal with. The teacher cannot teach
someone something if that person is not present to learn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson: ``Johnny is the one failing himself. It seems he does
not care about his education. He is not making any effort. On the
other hand his parents have the same attitude toward their child's
education. They are also not making any effort to be part of
Johnny's education. They get involved when it's too late. They get
mad and start blaming the teachers as well as how the school system
works, while they are the ones who are trying to help Johnny.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane: ``I think Johnny is failing himself, not because he's
stupid but just because he hasn't enough pride in himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should try to enforce school laws in the classrooms to
encourage and help students, not in a vain way but in a very
disciplined and courteous way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can be done now is probably nothing at the moment, but
what the future will bring nobody knows. We could hire new teachers
with more integrity, not like Mr. ; he's too scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellie: ``My peers just don't realize what a good education can
do for you. If I could only blame one source, it would be the
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how far a little support can go. I have a cousin
with the same problem and I know how frustrating it was for her. My
family spent many hours talking and listening. She had formerly
been in a place where little or no support was given. With the
change in the environment and support, she has changed. I have seen
what it can do, and this could be all that Johnny needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Amber: ``Well, I think that this short story is kind of weird.
It seems his parents don't care about Johnny's education. The
parents think the teacher is the one responsible for failing
Johnny. They don't think it's Johnny's fault
</P>
<P>
   for not doing the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents are setting a very bad example for Johnny. Who
knows - Johnny's kids might just be as bad as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany: ``A concerned parent should not wait until a child
fails to speak up. As for Johnny, he caused his grades to drop. His
nonchalant attitude must have been learned somewhere. Children will
pick up and learn anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon comes right to the point: ``...the parents can raise dust
and cuss at the teacher, but that won't help. The parents and
teachers can try to help all they want; it still won't help Johnny.
It's only up to him to get the grade he wants or deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, a word from their teacher: ``They (the students)
were unanimous in the conviction that more than anybody else,
Johnny is failing Johnny. They all knew Johnnies of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that one of these days I turn out a piece on
attendance though it's probably not the problem in Gibsonburg that
it is where he teaches. ``We run about 20 to 25 percent absence
each day. Then our constituents wonder why our poor kids are two or
three years behind grade level on all standardized
</P>
<P>
   tests. I computed, whimsically, that if we run 20 percent
absence for four years, then two to three years behind is about par
for the course. Twenty percent of 12 years is 2.4 years!''
</P>
<P>
   There are no easy answers to ``Who's failing Johnny?'' We're
educating more kids better than we ever did before, but we can't
overlook the fact that the wheels of education are not turning as
smoothly as they once did. Maybe it's just a case of figuring out
where to apply the grease.

 &HT;    Family wins car that's too fast to drive
 &HT;    By Mike Kelley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRIPPING SPRINGS, Texas _ Spencer Davis, being 3 years old,
really wanted the little Hot Wheels car model that came with a
container of a new Valvoline fuel additive. His dad, Scott, being a
dad, got it for him. This was in July.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until a couple of days later that Scott noticed the
contest entry form that came with the package. What the heck, he
thought. Might win something.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, that something was delivered to the Scott home
in Dripping Springs. It's a 750-horsepower Winston Cup Ford Taurus
_ grand prize in the Valvoline Race Car Sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Davises learned of the prize in September but were
skeptical. Even when Valvoline said the family would be flown to
Phoenix for last month's Winston Cup race, a friend warned that
there was probably a time-share pitch lurking nearby. In Phoenix,
Scott and his wife, Becky Davis, Spencer and 8-year-old Mary
Catherine met NASCAR star Mark Martin, who has raced the Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   What they'll do with the 200-mph car, the Davises don't yet
know. For the moment, it goes in the garage where Becky's Suburban
has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost my parking place,'' she says. They'll probably
display the car at the several tire stores Scott owns in the Austin
area.
</P>
<P>
   Driving it is not an option. It's not street-legal.
</P>
<P>
   And watching the 6-foot-3-inch Scott try to cram himself into a
car built for Martin, who is nine inches shorter, Davis'
brother-in-law Paul Wilson observed: ``He can't even drive it, poor
guy. It's every man's torture. Now he has the ultimate toy, and he
can't get in it.''

 &HT;    Addicts discover treatment, forgiveness in Delray, Fla.
 &HT;    By Seth Mnookin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ It's midnight on a Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred or so sweat-soaked, scantily clad dancers gyrate under
the glare of strobe lights, disco balls and smoke machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Central House,'' Katie, a 19-year-old from
Pennsylvania, says as someone walks through the door. ``Tickets are
$5, but if you're in treatment, we might be able to swing you a
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Central House, located on the Delray Beach-Boynton Beach border,
is an Alcoholics Anonymous clubhouse. It is home to dozens of AA
meetings each week _ for women, men, beginners, alcoholics only _
and recently has become the site of a monthly ``rave'' modeled
after the ones at big-city all-night dance clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Central House is also a focal point of an unusual and vital
community in southern Palm Beach County _ a community of recovering
alcoholics and drug abusers that by experts' accounts is
surprisingly large for the area's size and suburban character.
</P>
<P>
   That size has in part fueled the area's reputation as a magnet
for substance abuse treatment centers for Florida and the East
Coast, according to dozens of treatment professionals, law
enforcement officers and city officials. Experts consider it on par
with well-known treatment meccas such as Minnesota's Twin Cities,
home to the Hazelden clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Gross, a Delray Beach psychiatrist who has worked with
several of the programs over the past decade, says the sheer number
and variety of resources are crucial to the area's reputation as a
center of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are there a number of options for longer-term
treatment,'' Gross says, ``but there's a vertical hierarchy of
care. You can go from a detox to a hospital to primary treatment to
a sober house or a halfway house all within a couple of miles of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a lot of the people you deal with are going to know one
another. So there's a continuity available here which is extremely
important,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Delray Beach's six residential programs _ along with three
others that have residences or offices in both Boca Raton and
Delray Beach _ can at any one time house about 300 patients,
according to state officials. An equal number remain in treatment
on a daily basis while living in halfway houses or on their own,
records show. Delray Beach has a population of about 53,000 _
that's one person in treatment for every 88 residents, and that's
not including people living in sober halfway houses.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Miami has more than six times the population but
only about 1 1/2 times as many residential treatment centers.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every level of city official views the prominence of
Delray Beach's recovery community favorably.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community involvement in Delray is great,'' says Rick
Lincoln, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office's director of law
enforcement, who served two decades with the Delray Beach police.
``If we can take someone involved in drugs and get them to change
their life instead of throwing them in jail, that's a real
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the treatment centers are only one part of the community.
Often, addicts and alcoholics are sent to Delray Beach not to go to
treatment but to live in a halfway or sober house. There are more
than a dozen such in Delray Beach, ranging from the Lighthouse,
which holds AA meetings and has 60 beds to less formal arrangements
forged between groups of recovering people.
</P>
<P>
   David S., 29, is an example of someone who skipped treatment and
came to live in the Recovery Zone, a furnished sober house where
shared apartments go for $125 per week. ``I'd been in treatment for
two of the last eight years,'' David says. ``What else was I going
to learn in a residential treatment program?''
</P>
<P>
   David moved to Delray Beach about 18 months ago. Although he had
never been to Florida before, he had heard about the area during
his years bouncing in and out of treatment centers in New York.
And, now that he is here, he says Delray Beach is maybe the only
safe place for him right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You meet so many people in recovery here,'' David says as he
gets coffee at The Old School Bread Company, which has employed
several recovering addicts. ``See you at the 6:30,'' he says to a
young woman behind the counter, referring to a meeting that night.
At one nearby restaurant, John knows six of the eight waiters from
either treatment centers or AA meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment workers say the relationship between area businesses
and the recovering community is symbiotic. Most area treatment
centers require patients to get a job at some point. And newly
sober people are usually willing to work flexible hours and at a
relatively cheap wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers are really wonderful about hiring patients,'' says
Judy Crane, a counselor at Wayside House, an all-women's treatment
center. ``They know they're going to get a solid worker who's going
to be committed and is going to do their best.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employers, Crane says, look forward to working with
patients from treatment: One national company with its headquarters
in Delray Beach regularly hires patients from local treatment
centers for its in-house temporary agency. More than a dozen have
been hired permanently this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who live together and go to meetings together often end
up working together as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcoholics and addicts need to stay together,'' says Tony
Allerton, a recovering alcoholic with over a decade of sobriety.
Allerton should know: He runs one of the city's most active
clubhouses, Crossroads, which was founded in the early 1980s.
Crossroads holds as many as a dozen meetings every day.
</P>
<P>
   Allerton says the importance of community is best understood
through the ``disease concept,'' perhaps the central tenet of AA,
which holds that alcoholism and addiction are deadly, incurable
diseases. While alcoholism cannot be cured, its progress can be
arrested, according to AA, and the most important form of treatment
is talking with other recovering drug addicts and alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good comparison can be made with diabetics,'' Allerton says.
``A diabetic needs to have insulin daily. Our insulin is the
meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, you have all these people in the field: treatment
workers, counselors, and then patients,'' Gross says. ``And all
these people are all going to the same meetings, and seeing each
other all the time. And the effect is just amazing. Recovery is a
dynamic process. Time, redundancy and consistency are the most
important ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross says the fact that few people are actually from Palm Beach
County helps the recovery community. Recovering people can easily
avoid their ``triggers'' _ people, places and things that cause an
addict to possibly relapse _ are likely to be thousands of miles up
the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a number of individuals from the Northeast, even from
Europe, who come here because they have a real need to get out of
the environment where they were using,'' Gross says.
</P>
<P>
   Theories abound as to why Palm Beach County became home to such
an unusually large number of treatment centers. Some professionals
trace it to the southern migration of the first members of
Alcoholics Anonymous, founded in the 1930s. Another theory links
former Sen. Wilbur Mills' very public stay at the Palm Beach
Institute for alcoholism treatment and subsequent activism.
</P>
<P>
   Delray Beach's Drug Abuse Foundation, which began as an
outpatient counseling service in 1968, was one of the first to take
root in southern Palm Beach County. Central House was founded that
same year. By the 1980s, there was already a core of recovering
addicts and treatment centers that mushroomed, fueled by local
acceptance and insurance companies' willingness to pay up to $1,000
a day for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the sunshine is a factor,'' Gross says only
half-jokingly. ``I know a lot of people get seasonal depression, so
maybe all the sunlight here helps.''
</P>
<P>
   For people like John, a 30-year-old who has more than two years
clean, the reason doesn't really matter. John spends a lot of time
talking to people who have recently arrived in Delray Beach for
treatment. At a Central House dance, he took some time to chat with
a 19-year-old who arrived at the Renaissance Institute, a Delray
Beach-based treatment center, eight days earlier and already wants
to go back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do, stay in South Florida,'' John says. ``Stay in
Delray Beach. This place is unlike anyplace else in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   John first came to Delray Beach in 1994. A year later, John
figured he ``had everything all figured out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was staying clean, I had a job, my family was talking to
me,'' he says. ``I had it all together.'' So he decided to move to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Within months of leaving, John says he was using heroin again.
And within a year, he was back in a treatment center in Delray
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   He says, ``I just know it works.''

 &HT;    Lynn reviewing leader's salary after IRS note
 &HT;    By Don Horine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Donald E. Ross, president of Lynn University,
is one of the highest paid college presidents in the nation _ and
deservedly so, in the opinion of Lynn's board of trustees. But the
trustees are concerned the Internal Revenue Service may not agree.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' $320,965 salary in 1996-97 _ the last year reported _ was
higher than that of the presidents of Harvard, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and other larger, more prestigious private
universities.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees are reexamining the salary in light of a recent IRS
announcement. The IRS said it will assess stiff penalties against
officials of nonprofit organizations, including private colleges,
whose compensation is significantly higher than those of people
holding similar jobs at comparable institutions _ unless it can be
justified.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Lynn's board hasn't paid much attention to what
presidents of comparable colleges are paid, Chairman Hugh Carville
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in touch with our attorneys,'' Carville said.
``Our compensation committee is reviewing (the IRS ruling) right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross, 59, is the highest paid university or college president in
Florida. The next highest, University of Miami President Tad Foote,
earned $318,509 in 1996-97, the most recent year for which private
colleges and universities had to report their top officers'
compensation to the federal government. Lynn has 1,958 students. UM
has 13,422.
</P>
<P>
   John Lombardi, president of the 42,103-student University of
Florida, the state's largest school, earned $223,700 in 1996-97.
Lombardi's salary this year is $243,399.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn, UM and most other private schools won't reveal their
presidents' current salaries. The 1996-97 salaries are public
information because they are included in a federal tax report that
nonprofits must file.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' 1996-97 salary put him ahead of the presidents of many
private universities with national reputations other than Harvard
and MIT. Among them: Brandeis, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Dartmouth,
Duke, Emory, Georgetown, Northeastern, Northwestern, Southern
Methodist, Syracuse and Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Palm Beach Atlantic College in West Palm Beach,
slightly larger than Lynn with 2,122 students, paid President Paul
Corts $112,000 in 1996-97, along with $30,975 in benefits and a
$27,500 expense account.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his salary, Ross received $26,813 in benefits and
$160,656 for expenses, including an unspecified housing allowance.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' wife, Helen, who runs Lynn's summer camps, received
$101,798 in salary in 1996-97 plus $5,090 in benefits and $7,871
for expenses, according to federal tax forms.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the tax forms, the Chronicle of Higher Education
recently reported that 46 presidents of private universities and
colleges earned more than $300,000 in 1996-97. The highest paid,
according to that report, was Judith S. Rodin of the University of
Pennsylvania, at $498,536. Fifteen of the 46 made $330,000 or more.
Harvard President Neil L. Rudenstine earned $270,057. MIT President
Charles M. Vest earned $312,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' salary wasn't listed in the Chronicle report, which took
into account only schools categorized by the Carnegie Foundation
for the Advancement of Teaching as research universities, doctoral
universities, masters universities and colleges and baccalaureate
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn is listed as a business college by Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Ross declined to talk about his salary. In a letter, he pointed
out that Lynn is a private school and that its policy is not to
discuss publicly the compensation of its faculty, staff and
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 28 years as president of Lynn University including its
three international campuses, which, I believe, makes me the
longest-serving college president in the state of Florida, I feel
there are some matters best left to the university, its president
and its trustees,'' Ross wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Carville said he thinks Ross is well worth what he gets.
</P>
<P>
   ```We think he's more than worth what he's being paid,''
Carville said. ``The board probably would even pay him more if he
demanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Lynn, a trustee of the university and wife of Eugene
Lynn, after whom the school is named, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our school wouldn't be where it is today if it hadn't been for
Don Ross,'' she said. ``When you have good people, you take good
care of your people. Most presidents burn out after five or 10
years. He's had the energy and the belief to go as far as we have
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn would not divulge the criteria the board uses to set Ross'
salary.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Miller, acting director of the IRS' exempt organizations
division, said ``there is no hard and fast rule'' for judging
whether a college president's salary is at a proper level. However,
he said certain factors are taken into account, including pay of
presidents at comparable colleges, what duties the college assigns
to its president and how much money the college collects in a given
year.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, the IRS looked at whether nonprofit officials' pay
seemed out of line, but any penalties were assessed against the
organization rather than the official. Under a new law, the IRS can
assess a 25 percent excise tax on the amount of the compensation
considered excessive and require the excess to be returned to the
organization. If the excess isn't returned, the organization can be
subject to a 200 percent tax.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn has a career-oriented academic program, with bachelor's
degrees in 32 programs, master's degrees in 10 programs, and a new
doctorate program in educational leadership. It is an expensive
school _ tuition is $16,700, plus $6,250 for room and board and
$500 for fees.
</P>
<P>
   Ross put together a consortium that took over the school in 1971
when it was a Catholic junior college for women known as Marymount
and nearly $6 million in debt. Renamed the College of Boca Raton in
1974, the school continued to flirt with bankruptcy for several
years, but its fortunes turned around in the mid-1980s, thanks to
large gifts from wealthy Boca Raton philanthropists including
Eugene Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the school was named after Lynn and elevated to a
university. Since then, it has continued to prosper, raising $22.5
million for new buildings, including two residence halls, a
library, an international center and an academic building.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Ross has been aggressively trying to give Lynn
an international reputation. In 1991, he established a sister
school, the 350-student American College Dublin in Dublin, Ireland.
He is in the process of establishing another campus in Argentina
and has developed affiliations with universities in France, Russia,
Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' wife started the Pine Tree summer camps 19 years ago. In
1996-97, Lynn took in $1.5 million from the camps and conferences.

 &HT;    For techno whizzes, building robo Legos is a snap
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We gave three techies an extracurricular
challenge: see what kind of robot you can build in 24 hours. Using
a Lego set.
</P>
<P>
   Lego Mindstorms, the latest Lego product, is not the toy you
remember from childhood. With Mindstorms, you get to build and
program your own robot. Using Lego pieces and gears, a robot is
assembled, with an eraser-size microcomputer, the RCX, at its core.
Next, you write a program on your PC, using a CD-ROM that comes
with the set. Your PC beams the program to the microcomputer via a
special infrared transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   The box says it's for kids 12 and up, but we suspect it's a toy
aimed at computer-savvy grown-ups who remember playing with Legos
as children. Though the price tag is steep _ $200, with $50
accessory kits _ it's likely to sell well in Central Texas, where
many of our computer experts recall creating their first machines
with Legos' familiar plastic blocks. The tracking robot Created by
Matthew Lamari His title programmer, Charybdis Enterprises What his
robot did It followed a black track around a piece of paper, one of
the challenges Lego suggests to Mindstorm players. The robot had a
light sensor that could detect the difference between dark and
light paper; it followed the dark oval around the sheet. Lamari
played with Legos as a child, building a whole village out of
them(It had a gas station, houses and shops) and later built cars
and other vehicles with more advanced Lego sets. If he still had
some of his old Lego toys, Mindstorm's microcomputer would be great
for putting inside another creation, like a race car or a boat,
Lamari says. How long it took him to build it About six hours. What
else you should know I wouldn't have minded if somebody had given
me this when I was 12 years old. The musical robot Created by Randy
Spurlock His title senior staff software engineer, 3Dfx Interactive
What his robot did The robot played music, using its light sensor
to read stripes on paper that were varying shades of gray (each
shade indicated a different note.) It played Mary Had a Little
Lamb. That's a robotic talent that arose sheerly from Spurlock's
imagination; it's not a function Lego suggested. Spurlock's
8-year-old daughter, Sarah, named the robot Bobby. Like Lamari's
robot, Bobby could also follow a track around a sheet of paper.
Bobby had antennae, too. If you let him loose on the carpet, he'd
go in a straight line until someone touched one of his antennae,
and then he'd back up and go in a different direction. Bobby had
tank-style treads on his wheels, a suggestion from Spurlock's
10-year-old son, Chris. How long it took him An hour to build the
robot; five or six hours to program it. What else you should know
Spurlock is an old hand at Legos, having built many sophisticated
Lego toys for his kids. They include a helicopter, a race car with
gears that shift, planes and boats. He got tips on building his
robot from the World Wide Web, where aspiring robot-builders have
already put up sites. (Two sites to try are www.legomindstorms.com
or www.globalserve.net/ 7/8dastolfo/.) The ping-pong ball robot
Created by Thomas Dundon His title software engineer, Applied
Science Fiction What his robot did Dundon's robot was able to find
a ping-pong ball in a given area, beep when it found it and bring
it back to the central part of the machine with a long, extended
arm, beeping again when it was done.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Dundon aspired to build a machine that would launch
the ping-pong ball, find it, bring it back and measure how far away
it had been. He ended up not using the launcher, but he was close
to having the robot measure distance when we arrived. To his
credit, Dundon's invention doesn't much resemble any of the
suggested robots Lego shows you how to build in the instructions
that come with the toy. It's based on a projectile experiment
Dundon once used in physics class. How long it took him 12 hours.
What else you should knowUnlike Spurlock and Lamari, Dundon hadn't
ever played with Legos before. I played with Lincoln Logs as a kid,
he says. Was Lego Mindstorms fun? Oh, yeah, he says. Otherwise, I
wouldn't have stayed up all night working on it.

 &HT;    Dunbar house a haven for health
 &HT;    (EDS: cq Thursday 11-12)

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Paul Laurence Dunbar House in Dayton would
seem an unlikely place to hold a free community health screening,
until one learns more about the famed poet's life.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar, the son of slaves, watched his younger sister die at age
2 from a respiratory illness while his mother could apply only home
remedies. Dunbar himself suffered from recurring respiratory
problems for most of his 33 years, yet never saw a physician until
his childhood friend, William ``Bud'' Burns, became Dayton's first
black doctor in the 1890s.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of access to health care ``isn't so much racial today as it
is economic, but it's still a problem in the black community,''
said LaVerne Sci, historic site manager of the Dunbar House State
Memorial Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Sci said Dunbar would be proud that the museum is hosting the
Sixth Annual West Dayton Diabetes Day on Thursday. ``We want very
much to be a living museum with relevance to the community, and how
much more basic than taking care of health needs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The free event offers screenings for blood sugar, cholesterol,
blood pressure and glaucoma, plus a healthy soul food lunch. There
also will be foot care clinics, stress management advice and
referrals to community support groups that can help people manage
their diabetes. A limited number of participants will receive free
groceries and neck massages.
</P>
<P>
   The primary symptoms of diabetes include frequent urination and
excessive thirst and hunger. The rate of diabetes runs nearly 40
percent higher among blacks than whites, affecting more than one in
10 black adults. Complications of diabetes include blindness, heart
disease and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner diabetes is detected, the sooner people can begin
to make lifestyle changes that will help them live healthier and
happier lives with diabetes,'' said Joy Burgess, director of health
promotion programs at the Center for Healthy Communities.
</P>
<P>
   The center, Good Samaritan Hospital and the local chapter of the
American Diabetes Association will provide the health care
personnel at Thursday's screening.

 &HT;    _Saving grace: Ideas on setting aside money
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week came the puzzling news that Americans' ``personal
savings rate'' was a negative figure in September. We spent more
than we earned, measured by disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying methodology is a little quirky, and a one-month
statistic like this itself isn't very important. What is important
is the clear warning the numbers brought: Too many of us still
haven't gotten serious about saving and investing.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know how to motivate ourselves to get started. We don't
know how much we need to save. And we don't know how to find the
money to save.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves two core questions: How much should I save, and
where do I get it?
</P>
<P>
   The first may be the toughest one. In truth, there is no one
answer for everybody and no easy answer for any one of us. You have
to work it out for yourself, starting with a basic inquiry into
your goals, what they will cost, and how many years you have to
save and invest.
</P>
<P>
   The rule of thumb is this: Save 10 percent of your income for
your future needs. Personal finance guru Jane Bryant Quinn suggests
that you think of it as tithing. ``Most people can save up to 10
percent of their incomes and hardly notice,'' she writes. ``I can't
tell you why it works, only that it does.''
</P>
<P>
   But clearly that is more a technique than a plan. It moves you
along the way but won't tell you how close you're getting to your
goals.
</P>
<P>
   You can begin a more rigorous plan at the kitchen table, with a
pencil and note pad. List every goal you can think of, starting
with next year's vacation and working your way through college
costs to the really big one _ retirement. Next to each goal, record
an estimated cost and the number of months you have to save. Divide
each cost by the number of months and you have a savings goal for
each item.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously that works better for near-term, easily defined
expenses. but it's easier to evaluate the cost of your next new car
than the cost of retirement. For that, you will need some outside
help. Here are some resources:
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's book, ``Making the Most of Your Money,'' is packed with
sound advice.
</P>
<P>
   For a quick estimate of your retirement needs, check out the
worksheet at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .asec.org/toolshm.htm. You can order a written version of the
same thing, and other useful information, by calling the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission at 1-800-732-0330.
</P>
<P>
   Other useful worksheets are available at
http://www.accessatlanta.com/business
</P>
<P>
   /money&AMP;more/worksheets.html.
</P>
<P>
   The most important point is to start saving now, because that
will give you more time for your money to grow. The buzzword for
that growing process is ``the magic of compounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other techniques for finding the money to save,
and making yourself do it:
</P>
<P>
   _ Examine your spending and cut back on non-essentials. You
might rent a movie rather than go to the theater, for example, or
eat at restaurants less often.
</P>
<P>
   Think of saving as a necessity rather than an option. When you
pay the water bill and the phone bill, pay yourself, too. Think of
it as your retirement bill.
</P>
<P>
   It may help if you actually write a check and mail it to the
bank, just like any other bill. Another alternative is to set up an
automatic transfer from your checking account to a savings account
each month. Or you can set up a payroll deduction, putting money
directly into a savings account before you even touch it.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're putting away small amounts each week or month, drop
them into a bank account _ savings or money market _ that you won't
touch. You can move on to a long-term investment, such as a stock
mutual fund, when you have accumulated the minimum required to open
an account.
</P>
<P>
   If your company offers a 401(k) retirement plan, use it. You get
an income tax break. Even more important is the fact that most
employers will match at least part of your contribution. That's
free money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take advantage of any other available tax breaks, such as the
ones that come from contributing to an individual retirement
account. The table shows the astonishing difference that
tax-deferred savings makes over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   _ Save for specific goals.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ I thought that nothing could sap energy
or test patience like being the mother of two very small children.
</P>
<P>
   Then I came here.
</P>
<P>
   This squalid city, less than two hours from Miami by plane, is
the gridlock capital of the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent five-day trip, I saw potholes so deep that, as one
driver put it, ``you have to turn the headlights on to make your
way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, the narrow streets of crumbling concrete are choked
with rusting cars and trucks that barely move from dawn until dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there are no traffic laws. No traffic signs. No traffic
lights. Well, none that function. There aren't even central
dividers or lines down the middle of the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In general, chaos is king, with most drivers acting like they're
the only ones on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is simple: a population explosion, especially in
urban areas, has resulted in too many cars traveling on roads never
intended to handle such heavy traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the number of vehicles here has skyrocketed from
about 35,000 to nearly 120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's population is now 8 million, surpassing projections made
in 1980 for the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
   If current trends continue, the population will be almost 10
million by the year 2010 and 20 million by 2040, according to the
United Nations. The number of people living in Port-au-Prince will
be nearly 4 million by the year 2010, more than twice the number
today.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it appears traffic will only get worse before it gets
better.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten so bad that some Haitians voice a longing for the
days of the embargo between 1991 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the United Nations imposed a cut-off of trade designed to
force out a repressive regime.
</P>
<P>
   But the scarcity and expense of fuel smuggled in and sold for up
to $12 a gallon sure decreased traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in this crowded city is made to seem even more jumbled
by the plethora of vendors sitting on the ground alongside major
thoroughfares with their merchandise spread out before them.
</P>
<P>
   With an unemployment rate of more than 60 percent, people are
eager to hawk whatever they've got.
</P>
<P>
   They run alongside cars, tapping on windows, trying to persuade
those inside to make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the streets here are more like obstacle courses,
with drivers maneuvering their way around these salespeople, as
well as small animals, cavernous potholes, and broken-down trucks
and buses.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   There's also a strange mix of traffic outside the capital, with
the United Nations' beige peacekeeping vehicles zipping by farmers
pulling mules toting sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   There is some talk about finding a solution to the traffic
problem -- one suggestion has been to build a train that would
circle the city -- but little can be resolved without a working
government.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has been without a prime minister since June 1997, when
Prime Minister Rosny Smarth resigned following an election dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But, certainly, traffic is just the tip of a titanic iceberg
when it comes to irritations.
</P>
<P>
   The infrastructure that Americans take for granted -- safe
water, garbage disposal, and reliable electricity -- is a luxury in
Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents live in mud huts and are forced to haul water in
buckets on their heads for miles.
</P>
<P>
   Their children clutch ragged clothes around them that appear to
be at least four sizes too big.
</P>
<P>
   Even their pigs are skinny.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet never before have I encountered a people so unfailingly
optimistic in the face of mind-numbing adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enduring years of vicious dictators and devastating
natural disasters -- the latest being Hurricane Georges -- most
Haitians are kind, proud, pleasant, and willing to share all that
they have with a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   When there's no garbage pickup -- and there rarely is --
business owners simply sweep trash into piles along the street,
where it is burned.
</P>
<P>
   Even in rural areas, appearances are so important that peasants
sweep their yards until the packed soil is smooth as a paved
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, too, pride and resilience abound.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Haitians cheerfully balance two or three riders on
a bicycle when they don't own cars.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, visitors are greeted on the tarmac by a lively,
smiling four-man troubadour band.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Most notable, though, are the beat-up trucks known here as
``tap-taps'' that are painted with colors so bright they're almost
blinding.
</P>
<P>
   Above the windshields are slogans such as ``Merci Jesus'' and
``Assurance en Christ'' or various other exuberant expressions of
thankfulness.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the drivers who are truly awe-inspiring. Even in
hours-long traffic jams they rarely display even a hint of anger or
impatience.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Haitians have learned to maintain their composure even
when dealing with conditions that would surely send any American
over the edge in a few days' time.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say that Haiti's proud history drives the
population, pointing to the fact that, in 1804, the slaves brought
in to work the sugar plantations revolted and established the first
free black republic.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the Haitian people's indomitable spirit is
grounded on a foundation of strong religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   I only know that this country inspires both admiration and
frustration better than any other place I've known.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here lose their children to preventable diseases every
day, yet somehow they keep up their spirits,'' said one American
who lives here. ``Then, you have people in the United States, where
everyone has so much, who get depressed over a hangnail.''
</P>
<P>
   Try explaining that to small children. Talk about a lesson in
frustration.

 &HT;    For R. Kelly, challenges are welcome
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amazing what time away and a well-chosen
extracurricular project can do for you. Before the anthemic ``I
Believe I Can Fly'' from the ``Space Jam'' soundtrack earned him
three Grammys, R. Kelly was the million-selling, often
sexual-minded R&AMP;B singer sometimes condescendingly called ``the
Bump 'n' Grind Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Kelly's doing TV commercials. ``Titanic'' pop singer Celine
Dion has included their duet of his ballad ``I'm Your Angel'' on
her new Christmas album. And after a three-year hiatus, his third
solo album, ``R.,'' ships today triple-platinum (3 million copies).
</P>
<P>
   Notably diplomatic, Kelly, 30, skillfully dodges any opportunity
to slam the world of N'Synclike pop confections he now must compete
with for chart position. ``I respect entertainment however it
comes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to differentiate between working with Dion and
collaborating with hip-hop's Jay-Z and Noreaga on another ``R.''
single, ``We Ride,'' Kelly says, ``It's all the same because it's
all art. It's all music. And everybody is blessed with a talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Maybe Kelly becoming a born-again Christian has changed
him. It's quite the contrast _ a year ago he was crooning ``I'm
(expletive)- ing you tonight'' with the late rapper Notorious
B.I.G., and today he can be heard on Kirk Franklin's latest No. 1
contemporary Christian album, singing, ``I'm your brother, lean on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy phone conversation from his Chicago home, Kelly
explains:
</P>
<P>
   Q: So R., or is it Rob? What do you prefer people call you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just call me, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK, Robert, how do you jibe your much-publicized newfound
religion with some of your more provocative songs?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wouldn't say it's changed how I do music. Life itself, and
traveling the world, has a way of grooming you. When I found Christ
I became more focused on my life and my music is a part of my life.
. . . It affects things like `How much do I party?' `Who do I go to
McDonald's with?' It gets me in bed earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is (the album's first single) ``Half on a Baby'' an
expression you'd heard before or just something you made up?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's just something I made up. Just being silly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would guess that's what also made you yodel on one song?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, I just do whatever comes to mind. I love to go into a
territory that no man has ever gone musically. I love taking that
rocketship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The last time you hit the stage here was New Year's Eve at
the Tabernacle. Some people were upset you didn't perform.
</P>
<P>
   A: That was just a New Year's party. My whole (plan) was to come
to Atlanta, rent a place and have a party. If they expected a
performance . . . hey, I would have been mad, too. But that's what
happens when you become successful. People use your name, your
voice for all kinds of things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a lot of your recent interviews, you seem to be hesitant
about your success. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because it's not only about being successful but also
maintaining success. . . . When you do something like ``I Believe I
Can Fly,'' and you don't expect something big to happen, you have
to question it. And wonder whether you can top it. But I welcome a
challenge. I've decided to work extra hard. And when you stay
hungry, you stay fed.

descendants of Panola County, Texas, slaves are dedicating a
historical marker to the slavemaster who brought their families

slavemaster,'' admitted Barbara Jefferson-Bonner, a Panola County

supposed to be mean and cruel, but he wasn't that way.'' The marker
will be dedicated for Spearman ``Major'' Holland, who brought
Bonner's family here as slaves in the 1840s. (Jacobs, Longview News

   SELECTIVE-MUTISM (Albany, N.Y.) _ Sandra Williams has a bright
and talented 10-year-old daughter. The only problem is she won't
talk in school _ not to teachers or friends. ``The common reaction
is `What's wrong with that kid?''' said Williams. The answer is a
rare and little understood behavioral disorder known as selective
mutism. By SYLVIA WOOD.
</P>
<P>
   SPRING-FASHION (New York) _ During the fall season, Ralph
Lauren's winter whites didn't even make it to the selling floor.
All those luxurious seven-ply hooded sweaters and elegant creamy
cargo pants were pre-sold. So it's a sure thing that the women who
bought them will absolutely love the paper-white pieces in Ralph's
new spring collection. By CYNTHIA ROBINS.
</P>
<P>
   ROOT-CELLARS (Albany, N.Y.) _ While refrigerators are good for
day-to-day and even week-to-week storage, they can't accommodate
vast quantities of produce in bulk. If you are having a storage
problem, consider the natural refrigeration of a cellar. By FRANCES
INGRAHAM.
</P>
<P>
   WARDROBE-STORAGE (Albany, N.Y.) _ The season has changed and
with it our wardrobes. We put a great deal of money into clothing
and therefore must go to great lengths to take care of it,
especially vintage clothing or that one-of-a-kind piece, such as a
wedding gown. That is why safe and proper storage is essential. By
FRANCES INGRAHAM.

box set of studio gems, ``Tracks,'' he more than lives up to his
own exacting standards. The set contains 66 songs, spanning
Springsteen's 25 year career is an intoxicating collection,
populated with living, breathing human beings. By CRAIG MARINE.
</P>
<P>
   AUTHOR-SUCCESS (Houston) _ Anita Bunkley stopped putting off her
dream to be an author. Her experiences and those of other
successful women who often took risks to achieve their goals are
the basis of Bunkley's latest book, ``Steppin' Out With Attitude:
Sister, Sell Your Dream!'' with photo. By BARBARA KARKABI.
</P>
<P>
   CAMERON-FILM-PROFILE (Houston) _ When ``Titanic'' director James
Cameron went to Houston last week, it was as an actor. Cameron did
his acting as part of TheatreVision, a new process that enables
blind persons to hear audio descriptions of films via wireless
earpieces as they're shown in theaters. By BRUCE WESTBROOK.
</P>
<P>
   TYNER-MUSIC-REVIEW (Houston) _ It's an old story, in art as well
as in politics: The fiery young radical matures into a proud keeper
of the traditional flame. That would certainly seem to be the case
with jazz pianist McCoy Tyner. There's no question that Tyner has
mellowed since his percussive, keyboard-pummeling days with John
Coltrane's mind-expanding quartet of the early '60s. By RICK
MITCHELL.

 &HT;    Veterans Day not as solemn an observance as in years past(Eds:
fixes dateline.)
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's dusk, and a chilly wind is blowing as a patrol
of 19 stone-faced infantrymen trudge grimly up a grassy knoll,
headed for an ominous stand of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says a word, except National Park Service ranger Michael
Balis. He tells a group of tourists that the 5 million men these
stainless-steel statues on The Mall in Washington represent _ the
men who fought in the Korean War _ are now old, or dead. They are
falling much faster than they did in the war, when 36,916 Americans
were killed in three years of combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Korean veterans are now in their late 60s, 70s or 80s,''
says Balis. ``Unfortunately, we're seeing fewer and fewer, even
since this Korean War Veterans Memorial was dedicated three years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Which begins to explain why Veterans Day doesn't seem to be such
a big deal anymore. With America's last major war now 23 years past
_ and its biggest, most noble one 53 years past _ war veterans
aren't in the limelight as they once were. World War II may be a
hot movie topic, with last summer's hit ``Saving Private Ryan'' and
the upcoming, star-studded ``Thin Red Line,'' but remembering the
real vets, at least on their official day, seems a waning
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Thaddeus Sobieski, an Atlanta lawyer, was wounded as a
lieutenant on a chilly day in 1952, leading a company of
infantrymen on patrol. Now he heads the Atlanta chapter of Korean
War Veterans, and will take part with 40 others from the metro area
in Wednesday's Veterans Day parade in midtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappearing,'' he said. ``A lot of the guys I was with
have gone on to their rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger generations, he maintains, have a different view of war
and veterans, and that explains Veterans Day's lack of interest.
``The young people don't get it about ths country,'' he said.
``When I was a kid, it was Armistice Day, and we always had a
speaker from World War I.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Celente, publisher of the Trends Research Institute in
Rhinebeck, N.Y., agrees that Veterans Day is important mostly to
people whose numbers are quickly declining _ those who fought in
WWII and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veterans Day means so little any more,'' he said. ``Memorial
Day is a holiday, and starts off summer. On Veterans Day . . . most
people work _ and don't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   The Korean memorial, at least, was erected in time for most of
the veterans of that war to see. That may not be the case for their
older brothers and sisters who fought in World War II. Robert John
Slaughter, 73, a World War II combat veteran from Roanoke, Va.,
visited the Korean memorial recently. ``They have their memorial,''
he said of Korean War veterans, ``and we're still waiting for
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter worries that the year 2000 groundbreaking for the $100
million National World War II Memorial will come too late. ``There
won't be many of us left, and that's a shame,'' he says with a hint
of ire.
</P>
<P>
   World War II veterans are dying at a rate of 34,000 a month.
It's estimated only 7 million of 16 million men and women who
served in the war will be alive in two years, and 5 million by the
time their memorial opens on Veterans Day in 2002, assuming all the
money is raised in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing in one year as many as the 406,000 who died in
World War II,'' says Mike Conley, spokesman for group raising money
for the WWII memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Korean War veterans don't have an advocacy group tracking their
death rates, but being about five years behind the WWII vets, the
actuarial math isn't too hard to figure. Give or take, Wednesday
will be the last Veterans Day for maybe a half-million of the World
War II-Korean War generation of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Day was originally called ``Armistice Day'' for the day
World War I ended on Nov. 11, 1918. For years, speeches and large,
military-style parades highlighted the day in cities and towns
around the country. Those practices continued in the years
following World War II, when the holiday was renamed to honor
veterans of all American wars.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, Veterans Day has become less of a major public
event. From 1971 to 1977, at the height of the nation's angst over
Vietnam, it was relegated to a floating Monday holiday, to give
government workers a three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans succeeded in restoring the holiday's original timing.
Still, complains civil rights leader Hosea Williams of Atlanta, who
was severely wounded in Germany in 1945, Veterans Day has become
one of the least-observed American holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 73, will mark it with some of his 17 grandchildren at
Atlanta's Veterans Day parade, he said. ``I want them to know this
is an important day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Used to be Veterans Day was celebrated, respected, but it's
not anymore,'' Williams said. ``The average person in the streets
of America no longer shows any admiration for the suffering, the
dying, that went on to make this country what it is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of the way we died and struggled, many of my
friends, and the lack of respect, and that a generation of heroes
is disappearing so fast, it makes me sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter says there was a ceremony recently in Bedford, Va., at
a reunion of the 29th Infantry Division, the first to hit the
Normandy beaches on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bells toll for every man who has died in the past year,''
he says. ``It seems like the bell was tolling for half an hour this
year. Our job is to educate the public so this memorial will get
built in Washington, and to make the public remember the
sacrifices.''
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter is philosophical about the fact that the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial, near the Korean memorial and not far from the
planned location for the World War II Memorial, is still the most
visited in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a different kind of war,'' Slaughter said. ``It's
freshest in everyone's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   But while hundreds of mementos are left each day at The Wall,
only a few flags and wreaths are lain at the Korean memorial (which
also has a wall, not inscribed with names but with 2,000 haunting
images of ordinary GIs, real photographs sandblasted into the stone
and staring forever out of polished black granite).
</P>
<P>
   Because of demographics _ the aging and deaths of World War II
and Korean War veterans _ Veterans Day will attract the most people
to the Vietnam memorial, says National Park Service ranger Loren
Goering.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still come at all hours, in the middle of the night,''
he said. ``Many leave personal items. And every evening, we pick it
all up to save it.''
</P>
<P>
   Articles are often poignant _ old photographs, floppy jungle
caps, medals, birthday cards, letters, dogtags, newspaper articles.
On a recent night, several soft-bellied, gray-haired men wept as
they looked at a faded photo of two GIs that had been taken in
Vietnam. Another choked up as his young son touched the name of a
pal who'd died 29 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 23 years after the fall of Saigon, even that ritual is
beginning to fall off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vietnam veterans are getting older too,'' Goering said. ``It's
getting to be less and less of them coming.''

imprudent and wasteful. But the IMF failed to stem the Russian
collapse not because its reform package was flawed but because
Russia's domestic woes _ combined with its sensitivity to the
global slump in oil and commodity prices _ were too severe to
prevent market panic. Had the $22 billion IMF package for Russia
been as large as its $40 billion bailout of Mexico in 1995, it
might have helped.

   Today, quietly, without most Americans noticing, a revolution
has turned the U.S. defense industry upside down. The idea that
every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a profit but
lose a little bit of your military edge _ harks back to a time when
CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet technology,
and when the U.S. defense industry was sequestered in top-secret
grandeur, spending untold billions on weapons designed exclusively
for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to America's
Cold War allies.

grandeur, spending untold billions on weapons designed exclusively
for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to America's
Cold War allies.

 AMERICA FELL SHORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT 
</HEADLINE>
 
 &HT;    The following op-ed-length articles from the November/December
'98 issue of FOREIGN AFFAIRS, described in more detail below, have
moved on the wire _ in the ``k'' and ``a'' category codes _ from
The New York Times Syndicate.
 &HT;    _ They are also available in full-text versions, which range
from 2,500 to 6,000 words. _ By Ruth Wedgwood  
 &HT;    (1,200 words) An historic opportunity to shape the International
Criminal Court in America's image was lost. What the world has
instead is a court America cannot agree to _ at least not until its
good faith has been tested over years.
 &HT;     (Ruth Wedgwood is a professor of law at Yale University and a
senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.)

 ISRAEL AFTER HEROISM  
 By Eliot A. Cohen  
 &HT;    (1,300 words) Above all, the murder of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin in 1995 struck a blow at a major Israeli myth _ that no
matter how much bickering and bitterness pervade its politics, in
the end these are merely words, and the nation will stand together.

H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at The Johns

 THE IMF DID NOT PLAY RUSSIAN ROULETTE  
 By David D. Hale  
 &HT;    (1,400 words) Critics charge that the IMF's loans to Russia were
imprudent and wasteful. But the IMF failed to stem the Russian
collapse not because its reform package was flawed but because
Russia's domestic woes _ combined with its sensitivity to the
global slump in oil and commodity prices _ were too severe to
prevent market panic. Had the $22 billion IMF package for Russia
been as large as its $40 billion bailout of Mexico in 1995, it
might have helped.

Group and a consultant to the U.S. Defense Department.)

 GEORGE BUSH PUBLISHES MEMOIRS of HISTORIC ERA  
 By Michael Howard  
 &HT;    (1,300 words) No one is under oath when writing their memoirs,
but the joint account by former President George Bush and his
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has better credentials
than most. By the summer of 1989, events in Europe were moving so
fast that ``the vision thing'' became largely irrelevant. All the
United States could do, in Bush's words, was encourage, guide and
manage change. This required seat-of-the-pants planning, not a
vision of a new world order.

Yale Universities.)

 NATIONS HATE TO SAY `SORRY'  
 By Nicholas D. Kristof  
 &HT;    (1,500 words) Japanese people are famously polite, apologizing
at the start and end of every conversation and many times in
between _ which makes the reluctance to apologize for the war even
more remarkable. If the Japanese regularly apologize for being a
nuisance, even when they are not, why will they not show regret for
the slaughter of millions?

<TEXT>
<P>
   (1,450 words) The United States was built by immigrants who
shook off the disappointments of the old world for the hope of the

past. By now, this attitude should be history, but it's not.

 &UR; By Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Part I: RULES of the ROAD FOR AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To most Americans, the success or failure of U.S. foreign policy
no longer seems a matter of life and death. We invest fewer
resources in defense, diplomacy and development. But the demands
upon us have not lessened. The patterns of world affairs shift with
each spin of the globe. Rising dangers replace receding ones; old
problems reemerge. (slugged: BC-GOALS-ALBRIGHT-ONE-NYTSF)

while maintaining far tougher sanctions, including an investment
ban, against Burma. Some accuse us of having a double standard. But
that's not true. (slugged: BC-SANCTIONS-ALBRIGHT-TWO-NYTSF)

   &UR; Part III: FIVE MAJOR TESTS OF AMERICAN LEADERSHIP &LR;  &QL;

   Nations must unite in the struggle against terror. The U.N.
Security Council must deal firmly with Saddam Hussein's game of
threats and defiance. We must be resolute in our dealings with
North Korea. We must stand firmly behind implementation of the
Dayton Accords. The global community must redouble its efforts to
prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. (slugged:

   &UR; Part IV: FREEDOM IS AMERICA'S PURPOSE &LR;  &QL;

   We are the No. 1 debtor to the United Nations and the
multilateral development banks. We have been cutting foreign-policy
positions, closing diplomatic posts and shutting U.S. Agency for

   &UR; TODAY'S KOSOVO CRISIS IS HARDLY A SURPRISE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Warren Bass &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Documents relating to diplomacy in Bosnia _ including Richard
Holbrooke's memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996
official study of the process leading to the Dayton Accords of
November 1995 _ show that American officials were painfully aware
of the shortcomings of U.S. policy. Dayton's lessons are grimly
appropriate when considering the current violence in Kosovo.

   &UR; TACKLING INTERNATIONAL CORRUPTION &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   (1,300 words) After years of being tolerated with a mixture of
apathy, cynicism and denial, corruption is becoming a target of
serious international action. Today corruption is harder to hide,
as the wave of bribery scandals involving high-level officials in
Europe, Asia and South America demonstrates. (slugged:

   &UR; WHAT IF WOMEN RAN THE WORLD? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Francis Fukuyama &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,400 words) Male tendencies to band together for competitive
purposes, seek to dominate status hierarchies, and act out
aggressive fantasies toward one another can be rechanneled but
never eliminated. The world scene will always be populated by
states led by the occasional Mobutu, Milosevic or Saddam. Even if
the democratic, feminized, postindustrial world has evolved into a
zone of peace where struggles are more economic than military, it
will still have to deal with those parts of the world run by young,
ambitious, unconstrained men.

<P>
   Terrorism is not a new phenomenon. But today's terrorists, be
they international cults like Aum Shinrikyo or individual nihilists
like the Unabomber, act on a greater variety of motives than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   More ominously, terrorists may gain access to weapons of mass
destruction, including nuclear devices, germ dispensers, poison gas
weapons and even computer viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is the world's dependence on a nearly invisible and
fragile network for distributing energy and information. Long part
of the Hollywood and Tom Clancy repertory of nightmarish scenarios,
catastrophic terrorism has moved from far-fetched horror to a
contingency that could happen next month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States still takes conventional terrorism
seriously, as demonstrated by the response to the attacks on its
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August, it is not yet prepared
for the new threat of catastrophic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   American military superiority on the conventional battlefield
pushes its adversaries toward unconventional alternatives. The
United States has already destroyed one facility in Sudan in its
attempt to target chemical weapons. Russia, storehouse of tens of
thousands of weapons and material to make tens of thousands more,
may be descending into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the combination of new technology and lethal force
has made biological weapons at least as deadly as chemical and
nuclear alternatives. Technology is more accessible, and society is
more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate international networks have developed among organized
criminals, drug traffickers, arms dealers and money launderers,
creating an infrastructure for catastrophic terrorism around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings in East Africa killed hundreds. A successful attack
with weapons of mass destruction could certainly take thousands, or
tens of thousands, of lives.
</P>
<P>
   If the device that exploded in 1993 under the World Trade Center
had been nuclear, or had effectively dispersed a deadly pathogen,
the resulting horror and chaos would have exceeded our ability to
describe it.
</P>
<P>
   Such an act of catastrophic terrorism would be a watershed event
in American history. It could involve loss of life and property
unprecedented in peacetime and undermine America's fundamental
sense of security, as did the Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pearl Harbor, this event would divide our past and future
into a before and after. The United States might respond with
draconian measures, scaling back civil liberties, allowing wider
surveillance of citizens, detention of suspects and use of deadly
force.
</P>
<P>
   More violence could follow, either further terrorist attacks or
U.S. counterattacks. Belatedly, Americans would judge their leaders
negligent for not addressing terrorism more urgently.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of weapons of mass destruction being used against
America and its allies is greater now than at any time since the
Cuban missile crisis of 1962. It is a national security problem
that deserves the kind of attention the Pentagon devotes to threats
of military nuclear attack or regional aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The first obstacle to imagination is resignation. The prospects
may seem so dreadful that some officials despair of doing anything
useful.
</P>
<P>
   Some are fatalistic, as if contemplating the possibility of a
supernova. Many thinkers reacted the same way at the dawn of the
nuclear age, expecting doom to strike at any hour and disavowing
any further interest in deterrence as a hopeless venture. But as
with nuclear deterrence, the good news is that more can be done.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence role in preventing catastrophic terrorism is
complicated by ``placeless'' culprits, concealed weapons
development and unconventional deployments, all of which are hard
to monitor and preempt. In cyberattacks, for example, the
deployment of weapons can be entirely electronic.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government should therefore have the authority to
monitor any group and its potential state sponsors that might have
the motive and the means to use weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In order to detect such weapons anywhere in the world, the
United States should utilize remote sensing technology and
cultivate global sources of information. Necessary measures include
clandestine collection of open sources, such as foreign newspapers
and the Internet, as well as a full exchange of information with
key allies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year before its attack on the Tokyo subway system the
Aum Shinrikyo group had used the nerve gas Sarin in assaults on
civilians. Although the Japanese media had reported the news, the
U.S. government remained in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Washington not hear what Japanese law-enforcement
agencies knew, but the Japanese agencies themselves were not aware
of what other local organizations in Japan had uncovered. The
parties involved did not share the expertise to prevent another
attack.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, U.S. intelligence lacks a place to perform
comprehensive planning for the collection of information, where the
yields from overhead reconnaissance, electronic surveillance,
clandestine agents, law-enforcement databases and informants, and
reports from foreign governments can be sifted and organized for
maximum effect.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence job is hard but not impossible. The would-be
terrorists have problems as well. If they are supported by a state,
their organizations tend to be either large and leaky or small and
feckless. If they are not backed by a state, the group may be
small, feckless and pathological too.
</P>
<P>
   These realities form the opportunities for intelligence success.
The national security agencies can seize the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic law-enforcement officials, understandably, do not
actively pursue intelligence collection but focus their efforts on
informants or other evidence in investigating suspected criminal
actions. Civil liberties properly discourage them from going out
and looking for criminals before they have evidence of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, domestic law enforcement has many techniques
for gathering data, including lawful wiretaps and grand-jury
investigations. Much of what these efforts yield, however, is
closed off to the national security community by law or regulation
to safeguard constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   The United States needs a new institution to gather intelligence
on catastrophic terrorism _ a National Terrorism Intelligence
Center _ that would collect and analyze information so it could
warn of suspected catastrophic terrorist acts ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Since this center would have access to domestic law-enforcement
data, it should not be located at the Central Intelligence Agency.
Instead, the National Center should incorporate the highly
successful Director of Central Intelligence Counterterrorism
Center, which has a narrower mandate than this proposal, and be
located in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the center would be run by an operating committee
chaired by the director of central intelligence and including the
director of the FBI, the deputy secretary of defense, the deputy
attorney general, the deputy secretary of state and the deputy
national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The National Foreign Intelligence Program, which already
provides support for the FBI's National Security Division, would
cover the center's budget, while the National Security Council
would take up unresolved disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the center would come alternately from the FBI
and the CIA, and all intelligence organizations would provide a
specified number of professionals exempt from agency personnel
ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the center would combine the active intelligence
gathering approach of the national security agencies, which are not
legally constrained in their foreign investigations, with the
domestic authority and investigative resources of law enforcement
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   This combination is consistent with public trust and respect for
civil liberties. The center would have no powers of arrest and
prosecution and would maintain a certain distance from the
traditional defense and intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The center would also be subject to oversight from existing
institutions, like the federal judiciary, the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board, and the select intelligence committees
of Congress. Such a plan reconciles the practices of foreign
intelligence work with the restrictions that limit the reach of law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Catastrophic terrorism poses an eminent threat to America's
future. But the United States can fight back only if it sets the
right goals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 and 1941, the U.S. government pondered what kind of
forces it would need to wage a global war. The answers went so far
beyond the imagination that wry smiles and shaking heads in
Washington offices greeted the planning papers as they made their
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War saw a similar pattern of disbelief. The notion of
an intelligence system founded on photographic surveillance from
the upper atmosphere or outer space seemed outrageously far-fetched
in 1954, when the U-2 program was born. The films and cameras alone
seemed an overwhelming hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later the U-2s were flying; six years later
satellites were in place. Similar stories could be told about the
remarkable history of intercontinental missile guidance or the fast
deployment of more than a half-million troops and thousands of
armored vehicles to the Persian Gulf in 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   America can meet new challenges, but it must first imagine
success. Only then can it organize itself to attain it.

   Also new is the world's dependence on a nearly invisible and
fragile network for distributing energy and information. Long part
of the Hollywood and Tom Clancy repertory of nightmarish scenarios,
catastrophic terrorism has moved from far-fetched horror to a
contingency that could happen next month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States still takes conventional terrorism
seriously, as demonstrated by the response to the attacks on its
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August, it is not yet prepared
for the new threat of catastrophic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   American military superiority on the conventional battlefield
pushes its adversaries toward unconventional alternatives. The
United States has already destroyed one facility in Sudan in its
attempt to target chemical weapons. Russia, storehouse of tens of
thousands of weapons and material to make tens of thousands more,
may be descending into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the combination of new technology and lethal force
has made biological weapons at least as deadly as chemical and
nuclear alternatives. Technology is more accessible, and society is
more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate international networks have developed among organized
criminals, drug traffickers, arms dealers and money launderers,
creating an infrastructure for catastrophic terrorism around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings in East Africa killed hundreds. A successful attack
with weapons of mass destruction could certainly take thousands, or
tens of thousands, of lives.
</P>
<P>
   If the device that exploded in 1993 under the World Trade Center
had been nuclear, or had effectively dispersed a deadly pathogen,
the resulting horror and chaos would have exceeded our ability to
describe it.
</P>
<P>
   Such an act of catastrophic terrorism would be a watershed event
in American history. It could involve loss of life and property
unprecedented in peacetime and undermine America's fundamental
sense of security, as did the Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pearl Harbor, this event would divide our past and future
into a before and after. The United States might respond with
draconian measures, scaling back civil liberties, allowing wider
surveillance of citizens, detention of suspects and use of deadly
force.
</P>
<P>
   More violence could follow, either further terrorist attacks or
U.S. counterattacks. Belatedly, Americans would judge their leaders
negligent for not addressing terrorism more urgently.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of weapons of mass destruction being used against
America and its allies is greater now than at any time since the
Cuban missile crisis of 1962. It is a national security problem
that deserves the kind of attention the Pentagon devotes to threats
of military nuclear attack or regional aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The first obstacle to imagination is resignation. The prospects
may seem so dreadful that some officials despair of doing anything
useful.
</P>
<P>
   Some are fatalistic, as if contemplating the possibility of a
supernova. Many thinkers reacted the same way at the dawn of the
nuclear age, expecting doom to strike at any hour and disavowing
any further interest in deterrence as a hopeless venture. But as
with nuclear deterrence, the good news is that more can be done.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence role in preventing catastrophic terrorism is
complicated by ``placeless'' culprits, concealed weapons
development and unconventional deployments, all of which are hard
to monitor and preempt. In cyberattacks, for example, the
deployment of weapons can be entirely electronic.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government should therefore have the authority to
monitor any group and its potential state sponsors that might have
the motive and the means to use weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In order to detect such weapons anywhere in the world, the
United States should utilize remote sensing technology and
cultivate global sources of information. Necessary measures include
clandestine collection of open sources, such as foreign newspapers
and the Internet, as well as a full exchange of information with
key allies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year before its attack on the Tokyo subway system the
Aum Shinrikyo group had used the nerve gas Sarin in assaults on
civilians. Although the Japanese media had reported the news, the
U.S. government remained in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Washington not hear what Japanese law-enforcement
agencies knew, but the Japanese agencies themselves were not aware
of what other local organizations in Japan had uncovered. The
parties involved did not share the expertise to prevent another
attack.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, U.S. intelligence lacks a place to perform
comprehensive planning for the collection of information, where the
yields from overhead reconnaissance, electronic surveillance,
clandestine agents, law-enforcement databases and informants, and
reports from foreign governments can be sifted and organized for
maximum effect.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence job is hard but not impossible. The would-be
terrorists have problems as well. If they are supported by a state,
their organizations tend to be either large and leaky or small and
feckless. If they are not backed by a state, the group may be
small, feckless and pathological too.
</P>
<P>
   These realities form the opportunities for intelligence success.
The national security agencies can seize the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic law-enforcement officials, understandably, do not
actively pursue intelligence collection but focus their efforts on
informants or other evidence in investigating suspected criminal
actions. Civil liberties properly discourage them from going out
and looking for criminals before they have evidence of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, domestic law enforcement has many techniques
for gathering data, including lawful wiretaps and grand-jury
investigations. Much of what these efforts yield, however, is
closed off to the national security community by law or regulation
to safeguard constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   The United States needs a new institution to gather intelligence
on catastrophic terrorism _ a National Terrorism Intelligence
Center _ that would collect and analyze information so it could
warn of suspected catastrophic terrorist acts ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Since this center would have access to domestic law-enforcement
data, it should not be located at the Central Intelligence Agency.
Instead, the National Center should incorporate the highly
successful Director of Central Intelligence Counterterrorism
Center, which has a narrower mandate than this proposal, and be
located in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the center would be run by an operating committee
chaired by the director of central intelligence and including the
director of the FBI, the deputy secretary of defense, the deputy
attorney general, the deputy secretary of state and the deputy
national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The National Foreign Intelligence Program, which already
provides support for the FBI's National Security Division, would
cover the center's budget, while the National Security Council
would take up unresolved disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the center would come alternately from the FBI
and the CIA, and all intelligence organizations would provide a
specified number of professionals exempt from agency personnel
ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the center would combine the active intelligence
gathering approach of the national security agencies, which are not
legally constrained in their foreign investigations, with the
domestic authority and investigative resources of law enforcement
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   This combination is consistent with public trust and respect for
civil liberties. The center would have no powers of arrest and
prosecution and would maintain a certain distance from the
traditional defense and intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The center would also be subject to oversight from existing
institutions, like the federal judiciary, the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board, and the select intelligence committees
of Congress. Such a plan reconciles the practices of foreign
intelligence work with the restrictions that limit the reach of law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Catastrophic terrorism poses an eminent threat to America's
future. But the United States can fight back only if it sets the
right goals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 and 1941, the U.S. government pondered what kind of
forces it would need to wage a global war. The answers went so far
beyond the imagination that wry smiles and shaking heads in
Washington offices greeted the planning papers as they made their
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War saw a similar pattern of disbelief. The notion of
an intelligence system founded on photographic surveillance from
the upper atmosphere or outer space seemed outrageously far-fetched
in 1954, when the U-2 program was born. The films and cameras alone
seemed an overwhelming hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later the U-2s were flying; six years later
satellites were in place. Similar stories could be told about the
remarkable history of intercontinental missile guidance or the fast
deployment of more than a half-million troops and thousands of
armored vehicles to the Persian Gulf in 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   America can meet new challenges, but it must first imagine
success. Only then can it organize itself to attain it.

ARTIST ILLUSTRATING MOST INTIMIDATING CLASSIC OF THEM ALL: THE
BIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One afternoon more than a decade ago, illustrator and
book-artist Barry Moser paid a visit to Eudora Welty at her family
home in Jackson, Miss. Moser had never met the writer, so he took
along a mutual friend to make introductions, and a bottle of
something special to ease the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Welty,'' he said when they had been ushered into the
front parlor, ``I understand that you like bourbon whiskey.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty was frail with age, but she rubbed her hands together and
said, ``Oh, indeed I do!''
</P>
<P>
   They drank and talked for a while, their rich, Southern voices
stirring the air. Welty had spent her entire life in Mississippi,
and Moser had grown up in Tennessee, so there was common ground to
cover. Finally, the purpose of his visit came up: He proposed to do
woodcut engravings for a new edition of one of Welty's books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she said. ``Of all the things I've done, what are you
most interested in?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Robber Bridegroom,'' Moser told her, and she clapped her
hands and said, ``Oh, I'm so glad you said that!''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we agreed that's what we'd do,'' Moser says today from his
home in Massachusetts. ``And then I said, `Miss Welty, how much
input do you want on this? Do you want to see galleys, do you want
to see my sketches or what?' And she said, `Why no, Barry, I don't
want to see a thing. It's your book now.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most remarkable thing. Lesser writers want to tell
me what the images should be, what type to use, how big to make my
margins. But this was Eudora Welty, and she was turning her book
entirely over to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty was easy with him because she was already a fan of his
work. Moser, 58, has acquired many well-known admirers over the
course of his career, mostly because of the daring, intricate
engravings he has created for some of the most wonderful books in
all of literature. Even a partial list is exhilarating: He has
illustrated editions of ``Moby-Dick,'' ``The Scarlet Letter,''
Lewis Carroll's Alice books, ``Frankenstein,'' ``The Odyssey,''
``The Red Badge of Courage,'' ``Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,''
``The Call of the Wild'' and Norman Maclean's ``A River Runs
Through It.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these were designed and published by Moser in limited
editions through his own Pennyroyal Press. Handmade books, they
sold for more than $1,000 each, and ended up in museums and special
collections across the country. Most also were published in
moderately priced trade editions that are available today through
mainstream book stores (Moser's ``Moby-Dick'' is even in
paperback).
</P>
<P>
   Now, after four years of work, Moser is about to finish the
biggest project of his life _ a new edition of the most
intimidating classic of them all, the Bible. The Pennyroyal Caxton
Bible will appear next year with about 235 engravings, meticulous
production details and a heady price tag. A main edition of 400
copies will sell for $10,000 apiece. Moser will not talk about the
price of a ``special'' edition of 50 copies printed on handmade
paper for serious collectors. He hopes to see the Bible
mass-produced at a reasonable price for general consumers.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first illustrated by a single artist since 1865.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a nice letter from John Updike once,'' Moser says. ``He
wrote, `I'm glad to see that nothing daunts you.' But I think I'm
just not smart enough to be daunted. I know if I think about it,
I'll get real nervous. I had to accept this thing _ and this is
hard for me to say _ as simply another project. I know it's more
than that. Without even getting into the theological implications,
the Bible is the most important influence on the English language
as we know it. But I designed it, got a good printer and a good
typographer, and treated it as just another book.''
</P>
<P>
   Which does not, by any standard, indicate neglect. In addition
to the physical characteristics of his books _ the art of the book,
about which Moser speaks with something approaching rapture _ he is
known for the idiosyncrasies that mark many of his projects. Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   _He puts his own face into each of his books, ``either directly
or metaphorically,'' he says. ``I've done two editions of `The
Odyssey,' and in the first one I was Odysseus. It can be that
straightforward, or it can be something as small as the face on a
brooch on a woman's bodice.''
</P>
<P>
   _He cribs from the real world. His Jesus Christ is based on the
face of a New York City waiter. But the most flamboyant example is
``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,'' in which Moser serves up a rogues'
gallery from the presidency of Ronald Reagan. Nancy Reagan is the
Wicked Witch, her husband is the Wizard, Caspar Weinberger guards
the gates of Emerald City, and Alexander Haig is a soldier of Oz.
Moser did this because of his distaste for Nancy Reagan's public
persona, and besides, he says, ``I thought it would be fun.'' He
enjoyed it so much that he went on to use Lee Iacocca as the
disembodied head of Oz, and Lillian Carter as the Witch of the
North.
</P>
<P>
   _Moser persuaded Maclean to let him illustrate ``A River Runs
Through It'' by proposing to space his engravings _ a repeating
order of three small images followed by one larger one _ so that
they mimicked a line from the book about the cadence of fly
fishing: ``It is an art that is performed on a four-count rhythm
between 10 and 2 o'clock.'' Maclean, who was known to be a
curmudgeon, was less than welcoming at first, but, Moser says, ``he
was so impressed that I knew that line, and when he understood that
I wanted to achieve that same four-count beat, he said `OK, you can
do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _Moser will deny that he has a favorite among his books, but he
dwells with obvious emotion on one of his least successful
projects, Mary Shelley's ``Frankenstein, or the Modern
Prometheus.'' He does not admire the illustrations as much as the
book itself _ ``the images and the type,'' he says, ``work together
as well as anything I've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more, he is drawn to the story. Moser was brought up in a
Tennessee family that he describes as ``rabidly racist,'' and when
he first read ``Frankenstein'' he found a moral message in its
pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a profound sympathy for the monster,'' he says.
``Whether his story is a metaphor of power or a metaphor of racism,
he is persecuted because he is different, because of his size and
looks. With my background, I found real meaning in that.''
</P>
<P>
   He works in a rarefied atmosphere, surrounded by the smell of
ink and the cachet of thousand-dollar books, but Moser's life is
anchored in reality. A phone conversation with him is carried on
against an odd background _ opera music at first, and then what
sounds like the bleating of goats. He lives in a farmhouse and has
creatures to feed, which is why he has taken on more projects than
he can count, many of them children's books for which he makes
watercolors. He has been chided, on occasion, for being too
prolific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a mortgage and I've got dogs and I've got daughters
and I've got granddaughters and God Almighty there's a birthday
every month, it seems like,'' he says. ``I've got to make a living.
There are very few things that have been presented to me that I
felt I simply couldn't do. I would not agree to do a text that was,
in my sense of the universe, immoral. I wouldn't do `Mein Kampf' .
. . or something that was racist.''
</P>
<P>
   Has he ever regretted taking on a project?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, several times,'' he says. ``Inevitably the ones I've had
that feeling about are the ones that make money. Those that are
least appealing to me are the ones that the public . . . finds most
interesting. What that says, I do not want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   He is sure of this: Barry Moser has been a lucky man. He almost
abandoned woodcuts a while back because of a worldwide shortage of
boxwood, the best material for engraving blocks. The invention of a
resin that produces similar results saved the day. Even more
remarkable was his fortune in finding a patron for his Bible. Bruce
Kovner, a New York investor and collector of books, has put up the
money for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of it is not lost on Moser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been keeping a journal while I worked on the Bible,'' he
says, ``and I constantly come back to asking this question: Is it
possible? Is it possible that a reprobate like myself, a miscreant,
could possibly live in a state of grace? And the answer, it seems,
is yes. It's possible. Because I do.'' &QL;

IN LOOPY WAY, `MOODY' SOLVES THE MYSTERY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
MOODY FOREVER 
by Steve Oliver (St. Martin's Press, $22.95) 
 
 By CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've had your fill of iron-jawed private eyes who solve
most problems by whacking somebody in the chops, perhaps
angst-ridden investigator Scott Moody will be more to your liking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, ex-mental patient Moody (who first appeared in Oliver's
mystery, ``Moody Gets the Blus''), earns a living driving a cab in
a suburb of Spokane, Wash., and working as a reporter for a small
paper.
</P>
<P>
   As if those careers weren't enough in themselves to make him
depressed, he's suffering from an obsession with death and regret
over his broken marriage and not spending as much time as he'd like
with his little daughter, Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he does have a rich girlfriend, Xanthia, and his life is
going about as well as could be expected until he happens to be the
cabby who ferries Xanthia's father home from the airport one rainy
night, only to see the father stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
   Moody is a suspect in the murder, although the case against him
seems weak. Then, Xanthia finds out her father had been worth $70
million. She didn't know her father had had that much loot and
wonders where the money came from. She hires Moody to backtrack on
her father to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Moody isn't exactly a clever gumshoe. He just wanders around,
follows up strikingly unpromising leads, pulls surveillance on
suspects when he can't think of anything else to do and is lucky
enough to run into people who can help him figure out what he wants
to know.
</P>
<P>
   He also periodically buys guns through Ira Sugarman, a dowdy
private eye who helps him out. Sometimes, Moody arms himself as
protection against possible violence. Sometimes, he does so with an
eye toward exacting revenge on those who have wronged him. In
either case, given Moody's unstable mental status, this desire to
stock up on armament is a bit unsettling if you take the story
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Moody's hit-and-miss searching leads him to an
institution known as the Longevity Institute near Palm Springs,
Calif., and the solution of the mystery about Xanthia's father.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, ``Moody Forever'' is a pleasantly loopy
mystery, although things work out in ways that are far too pat.
This probably won't trouble readers who see the story as a romp.
Those readers will no doubt react favorably to Moody's amiability.
Others may find him too passive. At any rate, ``Moody Forever''
offers an interesting excursion into the offbeat. &QL;

<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; FALL OF THE PHANTOM LORD &QL; 
 &UR; Andrew Todhunter (Anchor, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   The man on the cover is rock climber Dan Osman, and he is
hanging by his fingertips over a whole lot of nothing. What's more,
he's happy about it. Osman is known for leaping from a 700-foot
bridge in Northern California, to be stopped 660 feet below by a
slender rope attached to his body harness. Is he frightened when he
does this? He is terrified, but that's the point. Climbers of
Osman's caliber are smitten by their own panic. They face it,
examine it, push through it and in the end return to prove
themselves again and again. In that sense, this is an introspective
and sometimes disturbing book, especially for those of us who
prefer to keep our feet on the ground and cannot understand the
urge to do otherwise. But Todhunter's elegant, understated style is
very effective in profiling this unique breed of people. Elite
climbers, as he portrays them, are incredibly skilled but not
necessarily heroic. Osman is a father and is sometimes conflicted
about risking his life again and again. He even admits that he
admires people who are not driven to put themselves at risk, ``who
are secure enough in themselves to be able to say, `You're not
getting me out there. I'm fine right here.' '' This book, which
began as an article for ``Atlantic Monthly,'' is a look at a way of
life that is built around the pursuit of fear. You don't have to
join Osman on the bridge to be fascinated. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; RUSTIC STYLE &QL; 
 &UR; Ralph Kylloe (Abrams, $39.95)
</P>
<P>
   Let's call this one ``Decorating With Twigs.'' We've received a
rash of similar books lately, the most noteworthy being Ann
Stillman O'Leary's ``Adirondack Style'' or, as we like to call it,
``Decorating with Bark and Moose Heads.'' These volumes feature a
veritable orgy of forest-related interior design ideas, including
the strategic placement of deceased animals, canoes suspended from
the ceiling, fishing tackle and snowshoes displayed Matisse-like on
walls, and complex chairs made out of branches and antlers. The
latter look so vastly uncomfortable _ the word ``impale'' comes to
mind _ that we wondered for a while if this might be a parody. No
such luck. It's for real, even the preserved-animal umbrella stand,
the banister of burled lodgepole pine (imagine a goiter epidemic),
the cowboy boots utilized as display objects. And more moose heads
than we care to count. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MY YEAR OFF &QL; 
 &UR; Robert McCrum (Norton, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   McCrum was 42 and editor-in-chief at the British publishing firm
of Faber &AMP; Faber when he woke up one morning and could not get out
of bed. His wife was away, and McCrum was forced to roll onto the
floor and drag himself commando-style across the bedroom and down
the stairs to a phone on the living room floor, where he summoned
help. The process took hours, and McCrum's description of it and of
the odd thoughts that ran through his head make vivid an experience
that is only abstract to most of us: McCrum had suffered a stroke.
``I had crossed by night from what Susan Sontag calls `the kingdom
of the well' to `the kingdom of the sick,' '' he writes, ``and,
though I still had no name for this new country I was in, it was
dawning on me that I was no longer the person I'd been 24 hours
ago.'' Through diary entries, literary ruminations, droll
observations and plain-spoken medical passages, he traces his
illness and his convalescence, acknowledging periods of despair,
frustration and self-pity. What saved him, he says, was the
extraordinary help of his wife and family. ``In my more melancholy
moments,'' he writes, ``I felt that the lesson in love I was
getting perhaps justified the appalling physical cost.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; DINING OUT &QL; 
 &UR; Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page (Wiley, $29.95)
</P>
<P>
   That's ``New York Times'' restaurant critic Ruth Reichl on the
cover. As you can see, she is incognito. But look closely. Is she
enjoying that coq au vin? Is she leaning forward in pleasure or in
disgust? Is she gearing up for the kill or the coronation? There
are all kinds of power in the world, but one of the most curious is
that of the restaurant critic, who can make or break an
establishment with a single review. Dornenburg and Page have
interviewed critics, chefs and restaurateurs across the country to
get a feel for what most people view as one of the most enviable
jobs in the world. The book reads, at times, like an oral history,
with quote after quote served up without much in between. That's
laziness on the part of the authors and makes for some babbling on
the part of the interviewees. But the subject matter is
irresistible. How do critics conceal their identities when they're
on the job? What are their pet peeves? How much weight does a
critic give to food, ambience, service? What do the best critics
think of each other? What are their backgrounds? And our favorite:
What are the weirdest things they have ever eaten? A partial list:
ant eggs, alligator, fried grasshoppers, unborn calf ravioli,
stingray burritos, snake bile wine and roast duckling brains.
Dinner, anyone? &QL;

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ I thought that nothing could sap energy
or test patience like being the mother of two very small children.
</P>
<P>
   Then I came here.
</P>
<P>
   This squalid city, less than two hours from Miami by plane, is
the gridlock capital of the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent five-day trip, I saw potholes so deep that, as one
driver put it, ``you have to turn the headlights on to make your
way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, the narrow streets of crumbling concrete are choked
with rusting cars and trucks that barely move from dawn until dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there are no traffic laws. No traffic signs. No traffic
lights. Well, none that function. There aren't even central
dividers or lines down the middle of the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In general, chaos is king, with most drivers acting like they're
the only ones on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is simple: a population explosion, especially in
urban areas, has resulted in too many cars traveling on roads never
intended to handle such heavy traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the number of vehicles here has skyrocketed from
about 35,000 to nearly 120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's population is now 8 million, surpassing projections made
in 1980 for the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
   If current trends continue, the population will be almost 10
million by the year 2010 and 20 million by 2040, according to the
United Nations. The number of people living in Port-au-Prince will
be nearly 4 million by the year 2010, more than twice the number
today.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it appears traffic will only get worse before it gets
better.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten so bad that some Haitians voice a longing for the
days of the embargo between 1991 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the United Nations imposed a cut-off of trade designed to
force out a repressive regime.
</P>
<P>
   But the scarcity and expense of fuel smuggled in and sold for up
to $12 a gallon sure decreased traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The scene in this crowded city is made to seem even more jumbled
by the plethora of vendors sitting on the ground alongside major
thoroughfares with their merchandise spread out before them.
</P>
<P>
   With an unemployment rate of more than 60 percent, people are
eager to hawk whatever they've got.
</P>
<P>
   They run alongside cars, tapping on windows, trying to persuade
those inside to make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the streets here are more like obstacle courses,
with drivers maneuvering their way around these salespeople, as
well as small animals, cavernous potholes, and broken-down trucks
and buses.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   There's also a strange mix of traffic outside the capital, with
the United Nations' beige peacekeeping vehicles zipping by farmers
pulling mules toting sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   There is some talk about finding a solution to the traffic
problem -- one suggestion has been to build a train that would
circle the city -- but little can be resolved without a working
government.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has been without a prime minister since June 1997, when
Prime Minister Rosny Smarth resigned following an election dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But, certainly, traffic is just the tip of a titanic iceberg
when it comes to irritations.
</P>
<P>
   The infrastructure that Americans take for granted -- safe
water, garbage disposal, and reliable electricity -- is a luxury in
Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents live in mud huts and are forced to haul water in
buckets on their heads for miles.
</P>
<P>
   Their children clutch ragged clothes around them that appear to
be at least four sizes too big.
</P>
<P>
   Even their pigs are skinny.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet never before have I encountered a people so unfailingly
optimistic in the face of mind-numbing adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enduring years of vicious dictators and devastating
natural disasters -- the latest being Hurricane Georges -- most
Haitians are kind, proud, pleasant, and willing to share all that
they have with a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   When there's no garbage pickup -- and there rarely is --
business owners simply sweep trash into piles along the street,
where it is burned.
</P>
<P>
   Even in rural areas, appearances are so important that peasants
sweep their yards until the packed soil is smooth as a paved
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, too, pride and resilience abound.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Haitians cheerfully balance two or three riders on
a bicycle when they don't own cars.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, visitors are greeted on the tarmac by a lively,
smiling four-man troubadour band.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Most notable, though, are the beat-up trucks known here as
``tap-taps'' that are painted with colors so bright they're almost
blinding.
</P>
<P>
   Above the windshields are slogans such as ``Merci Jesus'' and
``Assurance en Christ'' or various other exuberant expressions of
thankfulness.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the drivers who are truly awe-inspiring. Even in
hours-long traffic jams they rarely display even a hint of anger or
impatience.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Haitians have learned to maintain their composure even
when dealing with conditions that would surely send any American
over the edge in a few days' time.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say that Haiti's proud history drives the
population, pointing to the fact that, in 1804, the slaves brought
in to work the sugar plantations revolted and established the first
free black republic.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the Haitian people's indomitable spirit is
grounded on a foundation of strong religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   I only know that this country inspires both admiration and
frustration better than any other place I've known.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here lose their children to preventable diseases every
day, yet somehow they keep up their spirits,'' said one American
who lives here. ``Then, you have people in the United States, where
everyone has so much, who get depressed over a hangnail.''
</P>
<P>
   Try explaining that to small children. Talk about a lesson in
frustration.

SPRINGSTEEN SPINS AN INTOXICATING, LIVELY ALBUM IN `TRACKS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe the only way to judge Bruce Springsteen's new four-CD box
set of studio gems is to see if it stands up to his own sense of
what constitutes a good song.
</P>
<P>
   In Springsteen's new package, ``Tracks,'' he more than lives up
to his own exacting standards. The set contains 66 songs, spanning
Springsteen's 25 year career _ from the first recording he ever did
at Columbia, ``Mary Queen of Arkansas,'' on May 3, 1972, to ``Give
It a Name,'' a beautiful song he wrote in August. It is an
intoxicating collection, populated with living, breathing human
beings.
</P>
<P>
   The set includes 56 previously unreleased master recordings,
largely from Springsteen's ``The River'' and ``Born in the U.S.A.''
period, with 10 other masters that were featured as B-sides of
singles, some released only in Europe. Many of the songs will be
familiar to Springsteen devotees from live performances. Others
just seem to come out of nowhere, and their discovery is worth
sifting through the more than four hours of music.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen's gift has always been his ability to stay grounded
in the real world _ a conscious decision made following his rapid
rise to fame with ``Born to Run.'' He saw the path others had
chosen before him _ Elvis, Dylan _ and figured he wasn't going to
isolate himself or implode.
</P>
<P>
   He brings a sensitivity to writing about issues that affect the
working class, without being patronizing or preachy. His admitted
admiration for Chuck Berry makes him strive to find the perfect
detail that brings a song to life, the way Berry could conjure up
``coffee-colored Cadillac'' to draw a listener into a song.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to name every good effort on the 66-song package would be
impossible; better to focus on a few. Take for instance, the
original track of ``Born in the U.S.A.'' Recorded during the
``Nebraska'' sessions _ which consisted mainly of Bruce, an
acoustic guitar and a tape recorder _ this version is stripped so
bare of the musical embellishments of the album version that there
is no way in the world a Republican politician would mistakenly use
this as a campaign slogan. Presented in its original form, the
pain, anger and frustration of a nation's self-betrayal is stark
and brutal. Sometimes less is more.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Born in the U.S.A.'' is not the strongest anti-war song in
the set. That honor goes to ``Shut Out the Light,'' an agonizing
tale of a hero's return to his small town home and the difficulty
he faces, knowing things will never be the same for him after what
he has seen and done. It's like ``A Farewell to Arms'' in less than
four minutes _ and you can hum it.
</P>
<P>
   But fear not _ this is not four hours worth of major bummer. The
cars and the characters and the adventures are all in evidence.
It's amazing that some of these tracks never made the earlier cut.
</P>
<P>
   The songs are not presented strictly chronologically, so there's
no real need to listen to them sequentially. It's fun to just put
on the CDs and listen at random, waiting to strike gold and knowing
you will.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best song on the set is ``Cynthia,'' an infectious
little pop tune from 1983 that may be the most perfect recorded
expression of how a beautiful woman can change the lives of those
around her, for no other reason than that she exists.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nonthreatening, nonsexist admiration that celebrates the
simple joys that can be found every day. Ultimately, this is what a
listener gathers from Springsteen, and that is a tremendous gift.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Although refrigerators are good for day-to-day
and even week-to-week storage, they can't accommodate vast
quantities of produce in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   If you are having a storage problem, you just might look at the
natural refrigeration of a cellar. A root cellar is used for
storage of many fresh, raw, whole vegetables and fruits for several
months after their normal harvest in a cold, moist atmosphere. Most
fruits and vegetables require storage in about 35 to 40 Fahrenheit
and a relative humidity level of between 65 and 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a newer home, you might want to partition off a
section on the north or east corner of the basement, one with no
heating ducts or oil or water pipes, to create a root cellar, or
else dig one next to an existing cellar wall.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, a root cellar was dug into the earth for food
storage. It was a common practice in America between the 17th and
19th centuries to locate the root cellar right under the house.
This was convenient: Early kitchens were often located in the
basement level and this permitted easy access to the produce
without having to go outside through the snow to fetch items that
were put up for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   But some root cellars were dug into a hillside several feet from
houses.
</P>
<P>
   The natural insulating properties of earth would keep food
products at the right temperature without freezing during winter
and keep them cool during the warm months. Root cellars also
provided proper ventilation, which helps control humidity and ward
off odors.
</P>
<P>
   Root cellars, like pantries and storerooms, keep light to a
minimum, unlike today's kitchen cabinets and refrigerators, where
food is constantly being exposed to light, which accelerates the
ripening process.
</P>
<P>
   Root cellars were created in various sizes, depending on the
amount of food to be stored. Some are just closet-like in shape,
with shelving on the upper part and a larger space on the bottom
for bushels of produce; others are the size of a room, with shelves
for canned goods and squash, and beams for hanging onions.There
also may be a work table in the center for gathering produce. Large
open spaces also would accommodate slated bushels and bins for
items such as potatoes and apples. Other crops, including carrots,
beets and celery, were often stored under the dirt floor.
</P>
<P>
   In a root cellar, celery can last between two to three months,
onions from five to eight months, carrots from three to five months
and potatoes from five to eight months.

   Japan's Machiko Sekido, 46, a divorced mother and manager of a
Tokyo art gallery: ``In the bubble era,' people bought whomever was
the popular artist. They would pay a billion Yen and not think
about it. But compared to then, the number who buy is declining.
People don't need art.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's Lee Du-Ho, 27, a caretaker in Seoul's Sosomun
Park, where 150-200 homeless have been living in tents: ``It's very
hard to see these people outside living so badly. I'm trying to
tighten my own belt because my salary has been cut, but this makes
me realize I have to save money so I won't ever live like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's Liza Dhatta, 24, an office-worker in Kuala Lumpur who
has taken a 10-percent pay cut and been downgraded to a less
interesting job: ``This recession is interfering with people's
ability to get married. It costs too much money to have a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's Ahmad, 15, a ninth-grade student in the Tangerang
region, who says he's afraid his parents may be forced to pull him
out of school to save $1 a month in school fees:
</P>
<P>
   ``My father lost his job driving a pedicycle taxi. My mother
tries to make up by selling traditional medicines, but it's hard.
The last time we had meat was nine months ago, at the time of a
Muslim festival.''
</P>
<P>
   China's Li Yong, 25, a recent college graduate looking for a job
in Beijing: ``Our economy is a little more chaotic than we are
accustomed to. The rate of unemployment has risen. For me, it means
that the authorities did not assign me to a work unit after my
graduation. Even so, I'm sure there will be a position, if I try
hard enough.''

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Shellshocked by an Asian financial
crisis that seems to have no end, Asians are in a sour mood as they
await this week's visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The near future for Asia looks as bad as this year. Maybe worse.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, the potential locomotive of Asian economic recovery, is
stranded in its worst post-World War II recession and keeps
slashing imports from the rest of Asia. Now, even China's
long-vibrant economy seems on the verge of stagnating.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who will host Clinton
and 20 other Pacific Rim leaders at an economic summit here, has
vilified Western institutions in caustic language seldom heard from
a world leader since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming the Asian crisis on ``Western capitalist greed'' and
financial bungling by the American-backed International Monetary
Fund, Mahathir accused the West of ``a desire to dominate the
Asians and stop them from developing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other participants in the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) will be more polite-tongued than
the crusty Mahathir. But Clinton is likely to find other leaders
just as obstinate, especially on ticklish trade issues like Japan's
renewed efforts to shield markets against American exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inexcusable for the second-largest economy in the world
and the largest economy in Asia not to fulfill its
responsibilities,'' complained U.S. Deputy Trade Representative
Richard W. Fisher this month, after Japan informed Washington it
couldn't keep its promises from an earlier APEC summit to cut
Japanese tariffs on forest products and fish.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton will find in his week-long trip to Malaysia, Japan
and South Korea, the region's leaders remain baffled about why the
16-month-old Asian crisis has endured so long and caused so much
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of millions from Indonesia to South Korea are confronting
another year of unemployment and economic shrinkage -- still
without a safety net. A Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. study projects that
per-capita income will decline next year in India, Hong Kong, the
Philippines, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Asia has been hit with a ``financial typhoon'' that left behind
a trail of devastation ``far greater than anyone imagined,'' said
Singapore's Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong this month. Goh added that
while there are some signs the storm's force has lessened, he sees
a 20 percent chance that Asia will suffer a ``second typhoon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can avoid a depression, but I think the credit
crunch will continue,'' ventured think-tank economist Susumu
Takahashi in Japan, where consumer spending has just fallen for the
11th month in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, where homeless executives can be found sleeping
in Seoul public parks, social worker Park Eun-Kyung of World Vision
Korea said she hopes the economy will hit bottom next year.
``People say this is the worst disaster since World War II,'' she
said.

   BEIJING _ The stalls at Beijing's ``Russian market'' are bulging
with bright down jackets, fur coats, ski pants, wool sweaters,
hats, muffs and gloves to warm up winter in the Russian icebox.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing lacking are Russian buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales are down more than 90 percent,'' said Zheng Jiaodi, a
Chinese entrepreneur catering to Russian clients who until this
summer used to take containers full of goods back to Russia for
retail sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started getting bad when the Russian money began to
depreciate,'' said Zheng, who is shocked at the sudden collapse of
one of Beijing's most bustling, lucrative specialty markets.
</P>
<P>
   Zheng, 33, has more at stake than just the women's coats and
jackets hung ceiling-to-floor in her cubicle of a shop. She rents
an entire building and sublets space to 17 other wholesalers also
dependent on the Russian trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this period, the income won't even cover the rent. There's
no way out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sales slump in the warren of stores and open-air stalls
densely packing this market is one symptom of how the Asian
economic contagion has spread. And it raises questions of whether
China still may catch the malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's wide-ranging economic problems produced a meltdown in
August -- the sudden devaluation of the ruble and a moratorium on
foreign credit repayments. In a world economic atmosphere already
burdened by the Asian crisis, the International Monetary Fund and
big industrial countries couldn't stop the Russian crash. Jittery
foreign investors stampeded not only to exit Russia, but to get out
of emerging markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's fall has landed one more punch to China's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in Russian purchases comes on top of declining demand
from the Asian countries in economic distress for more than a year.
At the same time, currency devaluations in Thailand, Indonesia and
South Korea have made China's products less competitive in markets
elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, these factors pulled down China's exports in
September by 6.7 percent compared to the previous year. In July and
August, before Russia's crisis boiled over, China's export drop had
been 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Chinese exports grew 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hit by falling exports, China has seen its 10 percent-a-year
magic growth over the last two decades decelerate to a
comparatively sluggish 4-7 percent in 1998. To prevent sliding into
a Japanese-style recession, China has resorted to massive state
spending on infrastructure projects and has backed off attempts to
reform China's old, inefficient industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial unknown is whether China will be forced to devalue
its currency in an attempt to revive exports. China has vowed
dozens of times not to devalue. But if its exports to Russia and
Asia keep slumping, it might have to reconsider -- a move that
could ignite a fire sale of competitive devaluations throughout
Asia and delay the region's recovery for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Russian buyers doesn't cause trouble merely for
the sellers in this one corner of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Li Shu Yi peddled a variety of goods including traditional
Russian black fur hats at her open-air stall one recent afternoon.
Her Chinese-produced knock-offs were so good they even had a
Russian-language label saying ``made in Novosibirsk,'' a major city
in Siberia. But she wasn't selling much.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Russian customers) used to order goods worth a million
renminbi (nearly US$125,000) at a time, but no more,'' Li sighed.
``The manufacturers of the hats have many goods stored in their
factory that they can't sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the hat factory outside Beijing, Chinese factories that
would be pumping out coats and sweaters for the Russian market have
a hard time keeping workers busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to bring big problems to China,'' she
said. ``Sure I worry. This should be the hot season, but it's very
bad.''

miles west-northwest of Jakarta.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIARA PAYUNG, Indonesia _ Hundreds of thousands of children in
once-prosperous villages like this are dropping out of school and
going hungry as Indonesia lurches into a Great Leap Backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go to school any more,'' says Supendi, a skinny
13-year-old boy with festering sores on his leg.
</P>
<P>
   Until six months ago, he attended the local public school that
required a fee of 3,000 rupiahs (US$.40 cents) a month. ``My mother
doesn't have enough money to pay the fee,'' says Supendi, who like
many Indonesians uses a single name.
</P>
<P>
   So the boy lounges away the muggy midday heat by crouching on a
tin-roofed porch and listening to the barefoot men talk about ``the
old days'' just one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's when ordinary people could afford to eat lamb or chicken
at least three times a week, recounts one of the story-tellers. His
name is Mista, and he is a 23-year-old laid-off factory worker.
</P>
<P>
   Mista lost his $25-a-week job in a chocolate factory six months
ago. He says he doesn't blame the factory for firing him, nor does
he expect to get hired back. ``The company had to buy materials
from abroad, and it got too expensive,'' Mista says.
</P>
<P>
   It's only been a year since this fast-growing, seemingly stable
nation of 212 million people was dragged down by the riptide of the
Asian economic crisis. In that time, the world's fourth-most
populous country has seen its economy shrink by about 55 percent,
inflation shoot up to 80 percent a year and its banking system go
into virtual paralysis where no loans are made or collected.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia is the country worst hit by the Asian economic crisis.
Its suffering will cast a long shadow over the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum this week, as Indonesia and the region's
other leaders press for measures to make sure that their people
never endure a similar descent into hardship.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank specialist Richard Newfarmer estimates that school
enrollment throughout Indonesia has already dropped from 78 to 54
percent, as parents like Supendi's find even the nominal school
fees too high to bear.
</P>
<P>
   In two years the number of Indonesians living below the poverty
line has shot up from 20 million people to an estimated 100
million, dragging Indonesia down to a level of impoverishment not
known here since it was an underdeveloped backwater in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Mista says he, his wife and two-year-old daughter haven't eaten
meat in three months. Today they eat rice from the market and
fruits that they can find growing wild, like jackfruit. ``That's
the cheapest, at least it's filling.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kiara Payung (population 10,400), children don't suffer the
distended bellies and spindly limbs that have marked the
near-starvation of refugee camps in Sudan or Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   But Tintin, the village pregnancy nurse, has just reported to
the district health office that in August she came across 12 cases
of malnutrition among children she treated who were under five
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Her colleague Suharto(CQ), a district civil servant in charge of
welfare, estimates that unemployment in Kiara Payung has risen from
40 percent to at least 75 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The district health office says that another 35 malnutrition
cases were reported in four nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the deprivation of the Asian crisis looks less
acute in the capital Jakarta -- even in neighborhoods that were
torn apart by last May's anti-Chinese riots that burned scores of
Chinese-owned shopping plazas and killed nearly 1,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   F. M. Mendrofa, who has reopened his furniture store in the
burned-out Ciledug Plaza riot corridor, complains that banks won't
loan money, prices of materials have skyrocketed, and ``everything
is unstable.'' Somehow, says Mendrofa, he manages to sell about two
mattresses every day.
</P>
<P>
   For the poorest city-dwellers, the only way to avoid hunger has
been to resort to ``informal'' occupations that most Indonesians
consider degrading, like singing for a few rupiahs beside cars at
stoplights. Or hunting for metal and plastic bags at the Jakarta
municipal dump. Somehow, they are surviving.

 &HT;    JAPAN: RECOVERY SLOWED BY FEAR OF SHOPPING, DREAD OF FIRING
 &HT;    With ASIA-SUMMIT-$ADV15; Photos placed in the International
folder on the Cox Server.
 &HT;    For Use Sunday, Nov. 15 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The personnel director of a major Japanese construction
company started his fourth whiskey-on-the-rocks, as he explained
his own gloomy role in the recession that stubbornly blocks Asia's
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission is to do the firing. If I don't do it, I will be
fired,'' said Tomihei Sudou, who was unwinding with three
colleagues at a shopping complex restaurant after a recent Saturday
of work.
</P>
<P>
   In 18 years he has fired ``not even 10 people'' at his
Tokyo-based firm, which has a payroll of 15,000 workers. In the
next three years, he must get rid of 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some will quit or retire on schedule. But many, many more Sudou
will have to sweet-talk, cajole or coerce into leaving, defying the
once inviolable Japanese jobs-for-life tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is an essential reason for Japan's persisting recession --
fear over who next will be squeezed out of the nation's weakened
industries, fall victim to the highest surge of bankruptcies since
World War II, or see wages or annual bonuses trimmed further.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Japanese start spending again, returning confidence to
their own corporations and recreating vital markets for neighboring
countries, Asia will be unable to heave itself up and out of the
regional economic crisis now deep into its second year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the health of Asia's economy -- and indeed the world --
depends on Japan,'' President Bill Clinton recently said, urging
the Japanese to move faster to rekindle the world's second largest
economy.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 18 months of recession, Japan finally adopted
crucial bank reform legislation last month. Making $361 billion
available to debt-ridden banks, its goal is to get banks lending,
this time with some supervision. Only time will tell whether it is
enough to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to what the Japanese government was like before, we
actually did pretty well,'' legislative leader Okiharu Yasuoka said
in countering the critics. Yasuoka, who steered the bank bill
through parliament, said that further plans include massive tax
cuts, mortgage rate reductions and public spending that would
target nontraditional areas such as information technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the government starting this, it should create a rhythm on
the consumer side and begin the spending,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speeding consumer rhythm beyond a sluggish waltz will not be
easy.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics wonder whether the banks will do better with the new
government money, after losing hundreds of billions in unpaid
loans, and question whether public spending will be wasted away.
Confidence in government continues to slide, with 56 percent of
Japanese polled last month giving the ruling politicians a negative
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Few Japanese are going hungry or homeless, but many have seen
living standards drop more than in any economic downturn since
World War II. Others are too anxious to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Takashimaya Co. Ltd., retailer to royalty and regular Japanese
since opening in 1831, had to cut 2,800 personnel over the past
three years. It staffed a long-planned new department store by
moving 550 workers from other sites and using 500 temporary
workers, said spokesman Tetsuo Yamaguchi.
</P>
<P>
   Retail woes began in earnest when the government raised Japan's
consumption tax from 3 percent to 5 percent in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales declined dramatically. After that in Japan, we had more
and more bad news,'' Yamaguchi said. In the first half of October,
sales dipped 10 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, intense shoppers crowd store aisles throughout Tokyo.
But Yamaguchi said they buy small and less. The furniture
department at one of his stores, for example, was literally empty
of customers on a recent Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the New Tokyo restaurant, located near the new Takashimaya
store, construction executive Sudou and his three buddies
exemplified the problem.
</P>
<P>
   One friend wanted to buy a car, but felt he couldn't. Another
said Japanese have stopped taking out loans for big purchases or
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Their salaries haven't much changed, they said, but the bonuses
that differentiate employees have. Sudou said his was down about 25
percent, or about $9,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That cuts into discretionary spending that once buoyed Japan's
economy and the economies of regional neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some good things have come out of this,'' Sudou said. ``Now we
have discount stores.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the world dials 911 these days, it's
increasingly the president of the United States who answers the
call.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary year of global crisis management, President
Clinton has helped broker agreements aimed at ending bloodshed in
Northern Ireland, Kosovo and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   He's struggled, with mixed results, to counter efforts to build
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and Iran, worked to hold
together a scheme that keeps in check North Korea's atomic
ambitions, and urged India and Pakistan to step back from their own
unnerving game of nuclear saber-rattling.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month he dispatched emergency aid to the victims of
flooding in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday he arrives in the Malaysian capital of Kuala
Lumpur, where, meeting with his counterparts in the 21-nation Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC, he'll try to help
guide the region out of its economic malaise before the financial
contagion afflicting East Asia and Russia cripples growth and
undermines wealth at home.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, whether it's a measure of the man and the limits of his
office, a testament to the times or simply the complexities of the
issues he's bound to address, not even the president of the United
States can claim to have brought peace to troubled lands, stability
to roiling markets or comfort to a world still menaced by powerful
weapons in dangerous hands.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as the White House has become the global crisis
center, the more intractable challenges of the late 20th Century
have become as much a reminder of the boundaries of American power
as of its possibilities. For Americans, and the growing number of
others who depend on them, the sobering truth is that not all of
these problems can be solved: some must simply be managed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the nature of things in the world today,'' Clinton
said in a press conference last month. ''Not everything we have to
do is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of what historians have labeled ''The American
Century,'' the White House has confronted its share, and often
more, of the world's problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since the Cold War ended, though, the pace of the
global challenges set before American presidents has quickened,
even as the variety of those tasks has grown.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons have to do with technology, global integration and
the epic realignment of power and influence resulting from the
collapse of the Soviet empire.
</P>
<P>
   The first two trends have broadened the scope and lowered the
threshold of what constitutes a global crisis, even as the third
has made world problems breaking out virtually anywhere a uniquely
American concern.
</P>
<P>
   With other countries routinely looking to the last remaining
superpower before committing their own resources to address a
problem, the United States is often pivotal, if not, as U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright likes to say,
''indispensable.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the ability of the United States, or any one nation, to
fully resolve complex global crises is being diminished.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long ago, for example, that the United States and half
a dozen other industrialized democratic countries could control
most of what mattered in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   That's no longer true.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in air travel, computers and telecommunications
have helped make possible the emergence of a truly global economy,
while the collapse of the Soviet empire, and the failings of world
communism more broadly, have led dozens of formerly
centrally-controlled states to harness their workers and enterprise
to the border-less marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   There are now perhaps 60 countries, that are important
participants in world investment and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   That's presented enormous opportunities to the United States,
which will do some $2 trillion worth of two-way trade in goods and
services this year.
</P>
<P>
   Economic problems in far away lands, however, can have
unprecedented impact on jobs and wealth in this country, presenting
the White House with new headaches in uncertain times.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more complicated in the sense that a lot more countries
are really important,'' said Fred Bergsten, director of the
Institute of International Economics, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, instead of convening a meeting of the Group of Seven
finance ministers to fine-tune world growth, ''You have to worry
about what happens to a Thailand or an Indonesia,'' Bergsten said.
</P>
<P>
   Not every participant in the global economy, moreover, plays by
the same rules.
</P>
<P>
   Rampant corruption rotted the foundations of Indonesia's growth,
while organized crime has undermined Russia. Cozy links between
money and politics meant easy credit for a generation of
well-connected Japanese companies until the bubble of instability
that system created popped a decade ago, plunging Japan into
recession. Malaysia is retreating from the global economy, imposing
currency and investment restrictions meant to limit its exposure to
the risks of unbridled markets.
</P>
<P>
   All of that makes it difficult for the United States to repair
the damage done to each country's economy, or mitigate the threats
posed to Americans, by policies and practices Washington opposes
but has a finite ability to change.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the rise of free-market economics has put the
management of much of the world economy, by design, outside of the
domain of public policymakers and increasingly in the hands of
investment bankers, currency traders and even shareholders of
global corporate empires.
</P>
<P>
   ''The non-state actors, the private interests, play a larger
role,'' said Paul Papayoanou, assistant professor of political
science at the University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not really controlling the economy, they're acting on
market forces,'' he said. ''But a lot of their actions affect the
international economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hand-in-glove with those developments has been the emergence of
a truly global community linked by television, telephone and
computer communications.
</P>
<P>
   That's expanded the realm of crisis. In the global media
village, it's harder than ever to turn a blind eye to the suffering
of others, whether the cause of the trauma is genocide in Rwanda,
political violence in Yugoslavia or the death and devastation
caused by floods in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly true for Americans, who, in winning the Cold
War, picked up global responsibilities not yet fully grasped.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did the Soviet Union break up at the end of 1991, for
example, than its collapse triggered the eruption of ethnic and
civil conflicts, such as those that tore apart the former
Yugoslavia, once a Soviet satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago the United States led a massive NATO
peacekeeping force into the former Yugoslav province of Bosnia to
stop Europe's worst bloodshed since World War II. The United States
has yet to knit back together the social and legal order, however,
that permitted Serbs and non-Serbs to coexist and cooperate as they
did under the old Soviet-backed system.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, White House officials admit that U.S. troops could
remain in Bosnia for years to prevent the outbreak of renewed
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, Soviet and American responsibilities were
understood as clearly as their respective areas of control; there
was seldom any question over whether it was Moscow's job or
Washington's to take care of a given crisis, or to simply let it
drift.
</P>
<P>
   ''That tended to calm things, to make them easier to understand
and manage,'' said Ed Haley, professor of international relations
at Claremont-McKenna College, in Claremont, Calif. ''What's changed
is now Russia isn't a player at all.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Russia may have lost its ability to help deal with global
problems, but it has retained some capacity for preventing
solutions, or at least muddying the chances for their success.
</P>
<P>
   For months, in 1995, the United States and its NATO allies put
off decisive, and ultimately necessary, military action against
Serb atrocities in Bosnia, out of deference to Russia's historical
ties to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Russian sentiment had had similar effects in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, where Serb troops have waged a year-long
campaign of terror against the ethnic Albanian majority; and in
Iraq, which has spent much of the year in violation of its 1991
pledge to grant United Nations inspectors access to alleged
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who pulled back from the brink of threatened strikes
against Iraq in the face of Russian objections last winter, is once
again weighing such attacks. And, once again, his strategic
calculus must include the sort of Russian opposition that can make
it hard for the United States to use the tools of its own choosing
to act on clear-cut policy aims.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means the United States has to engage in threats and side
payments,'' said Papayoanou. ''There's sort of a bargaining process
that goes on with countries like Russia and China to get them to
follow a line of some other policy.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   As crisis management increasingly involves other nations or
entire regions, or resources beyond the means of the United States
alone, it has become the president's job to try to muster global
support, through the use of multilateral institutions such as the
United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the
International Monetary Fund or the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States has the dominant voice in each of those
institutions, it must often compromise its aims or its methods to
build needed support among other member-nations.
</P>
<P>
   For a country that still defines success as total victory -- on
budget and on time -- the process of negotiating global consensus
can seem endlessly, painfully ponderous.
</P>
<P>
   ''We, rightly I think, constantly try to avoid unilateral
action, constantly try to build a group,'' said Haley. ''It's both
hard-headed and decent. It just gets horrifying sometimes before
the good can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly integrated world of growing complexity and
evolving risks, the White House finds itself managing crisis upon
crisis in hopes of reducing trauma and tragedy, even when it cannot
do away with them altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all the world hopes for when it dials 911, but there
are times when that's as good as it gets.

<P>
   SEOUL _ Koreans groping through the deep waters of economic
collapse divide recent history into two eras -- before and after
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``When restructuring started after the IMF, I never thought I
would be on the lay-off list. I had been working for the company
for 10 years,'' said Cho In-Ho, 51, a gaunt and sorrowful man still
unnerved over losing his job as a senior manager at a book
publishing company last February.
</P>
<P>
   Quarrels at home led to divorce. Now Cho sleeps on a blanket on
the spotless yellow linoleum of a homeless shelter begun in May by
a Buddhist order and the city government.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is not a scene of starvation and rampant poverty. It
is the story of a proud and new middle class suddenly gutted.
</P>
<P>
   A one-time ``Asian tiger,'' this country has been deeply
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has tripled in a year and is expected to quadruple
to 2 million, a rate of 10 percent. Gross domestic product is
predicted to contract 6.5 percent this year, then another 2 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At least one-third of Korea's conglomerates, known as chaebol,
are bankrupt or surviving on government emergency loans.
</P>
<P>
   Through unrelenting work, Koreans pulled up gross domestic
product per person from $1,200 to $14,200 in less than two decades.
The fruits of that labor are disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Wounded spirits are not confined to 3,000 homeless in 80
emergency shelters, established to collect the fallout from
punishing financial and monetary controls the IMF imposed in its
$58 billion bailout package last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually a banker is a middle class, stable job,'' said Shim
Il-Sun, the president of a federation of banking unions, who has
seen 35,000 bank workers lose jobs since the IMF stepped in. ``Now
there is fear, psychological frustration, loss of social status.
The middle class is going to collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the city, store placards announce IMF going-out-of
business sales. Subway computer ads cite the IMF bogeyman, warning
readers to learn new job skills or risk sacking. Koreans routinely
refer to life as it was before, versus what it has become since the
diminishing, daily life changes the IMF wrought one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, an international lending agency in which the United
States plays a major backstage role, tries to save financially
stressed nations from defaulting on international obligations. To
get bailout loans, countries usually must swallow economic
austerity policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say the IMF made the situation worse, with demands for
high interest rates and open markets,'' said Marion Kim, editor of
Civil Society, a publication of the Citizens' Coalition for
Economic Justice here.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the other conditions that the IMF mandated we
approve. But people think we didn't have to go through all this
hardship,'' said Kim, whose grassroots activist group wanted the
IMF agreement renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Unionist Shim questioned the IMF call for immediate and drastic
actions, which closed five big banks and contracted operations at
many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social unrest is a profound concern,'' said Yoo Jang-Hee,
economist and dean of graduate international studies at Ewha
Women's University in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   He and others believe the country's essentially democratic
processes have helped defuse social disruption, but wonder what
will happen as more Koreans exhaust their savings and patience.
</P>
<P>
   Some already are forced into desperate solutions such as Dong
Myung Children's Home, a cheerful, noisy mix of kids and toys and
hamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Vice president Kim Kwang-Bin said his complex of apartments soon
will be 20 children beyond the capacity of 65, now that the city
asked orphanages to temporarily help overwhelmed families.
</P>

KEEP YOUR CLOTHING SAFE, HAPPY DURING THE WINTER

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The season has changed and with it our wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   Today's active lifestyles dictate that we have clothes for every
function for work and play. We put a great deal of money into
clothing and therefore must go to great lengths to take care of it,
especially vintage clothing or that one-of-a-kind piece, such as a
wedding gown.
</P>
<P>
   Wardrobes call for safe and proper storage.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Barber, president of Closet Crafters in Albany, said the
most important thing to keep in mind when storing clothes is to
eliminate what you won't put on anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should you take up and waste valuable space with clothes
you never wear?'' Barber said. ``Then you should think about what
you are going to store and where. Many times, people will store
files in their bedroom closet, as well as winter coats. You have to
make the proper room to store clothing properly and functionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber said that the layout of the closet will also depend on
whether it's to be male- or female-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, the actual architectural constraints of the
structure are an afterthought,'' Barber added. ``You should work
with the architecture rather than against it.''
</P>
<P>
   A moderate-sized closet can be transformed into a functional
closet without actually increasing its size by using various
storage systems, from portable organizers to built-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Barber noted that laminated storage systems take up more space,
and therefore ventilated steel units should be used for small
closets of 48 inches or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ventilated steel is also the least expensive of the three
storage options of laminated, ventilated steel or ventilated wood,
which is beautiful and warm-looking,'' Barber said. ``Ventilated
systems are not adjustable, like the laminated systems. But then
again, how many times do people adjust the shelves in their closets
once they are installed?''
</P>
<P>
   Within these modular systems, there are all kinds of storage
options, such as tie and scarf racks; drawers with dividers to keep
small items, such as socks, organized; acrylic shelf dividers to
keep folded clothes from toppling over; and laundry hamper, jewelry
drawers and various level hanging compartments to accommodate
dresses, trousers, and skirts and coats.
</P>
<P>
   There are also several different options when it comes to
storing shoes, each depending on the amount of space you have.
Shelves and racks are popular, where shoes are stored side-by-side,
but it's the shoe cubbies that save on space.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a 3-to-1 ratio in space savings, when it comes to
using shoe cubbies,'' Barber said. ``In a shoe cubbie, you store
your shoes toe-to-heel, like in a shoe box, except that unlike a
box, your shoes are all visible.''
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is the closet door. Do you want a bifold
door or a swinging or sliding pocket door? Should the door swing in
or out? Also remember that a solid swinging door offers an
opportunity to use it for extra hanging space for ties, belts,
jewelry or hats.
</P>
<P>
   A well-organized closet can range in cost from as little as $150
to more than $6,000, depending on the size, materials, bells and
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Some other helpful hints:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the closet clean and use sealable bags and storage boxes
to deter moths. Use cedar scent for proper protection and make sure
the container or plastic bag is airtight, with no rips or holes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always dry clean or wash any item to be stored to rid it of
mildew spores or insect eggs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't leave clothing in plastic dry cleaner bags for long-term
storage because they can discolor garments.

<P>
   CAPE TOWN _ Peter stole a bicycle from John.
</P>
<P>
   Time passed. Peter said, ``Let's talk about reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   But John replied: ``I need the bike back first.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Mxolisi Mpambani, pastor of St. Michael's church in the
nearby township of Guguletu, told that ``short story'' earlier this
year at a symposium here on the prospects for reconciliation in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   It remains a parable for the times, as the country digests the
seminal 3,500-page report released in late October by the
government-appointed Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Most
blacks are demanding restoration of their dignity and compensation
for their suffering before they agree to reconcile with whites.
</P>
<P>
   Capping a 2 1/2 - year investigation, the commission called the
racial caste system of apartheid ``a crime against humanity,'' but
also condemned the ruling African National Congress for killings,
torture, and other excesses in its long fight to topple the former
white minority regime.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's findings were excoriated from both ends of the
political spectrum, with former President F.W. de Klerk calling the
report a ``simplistic, orthodox revolutionary'' rendering of a
complex history, and ANC leader Thabo Mbeki, the heir apparent to
President Nelson Mandela, labeling it ``wrong and misguided.''
</P>
<P>
   If those statements represent the bookends of political
rhetoric, many observers concluded that the commission must have
gotten the story about right. Moreover, complaints that painful
truths uncovered by the panel had actually exacerbated race
relations, or that it had failed to achieve reconciliation, seemed
to ignore the basic tenet that truth is a necessary precursor to
healing. And the commission was expected to promote reconciliation,
not achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   But it's apparent there is still a long way to go, because no
serious dialogue is occurring between blacks and whites, no search
for common ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do think that what's happening in South Africa is an
object lesson that all of us can learn from,'' said James Gilligan,
an instructor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and author of
the book ``Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic,''
published last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by all the controversy surrounding the final
report _ de Klerk and the ANC saying the TRC's efforts were a
failure. I see the exact opposite. It's because of that that it's a
success,'' said Gilligan. ``What it means is that people are
arguing verbally rather than taking up arms and shooting each
other.... So many people thought there would be a bloodbath there.
What's miraculous is that has not happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilligan added that ``state secrets make a society sick.'' It
was imperative, then, that the Truth Commission undertake its
investigation of apartheid to let South Africa face the future with
a clear knowledge of its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned to look at each other's eyes here,'' said Albie
Sachs, a noted anti-apartheid activist who lost his right arm in
1988 when his car was bombed by security forces; he now serves as a
justice on the Constitutional Court. ``Otherwise you can't get a
country. We're not South Africa yet. We're becoming South Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
All-race elections bring
</P>
<P>
   changes great, small &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four-and-a-half years after historic all-race elections brought
Mandela and his ANC to power, South African life is undeniably
different. There are the obvious things, like the presidential
mansion in Pretoria. It was called Libertas when the whites
governed. Today it's called Mahlamba'nlopfu, which in Shangan, now
one of the country's 11 official languages, means ``dawn of a new
era.''
</P>
<P>
   Parliament is considering dropping Afrikaans as the country's
second language, since it is mostly vilified as the tongue of the
former ``oppressors.'' English will be the main language for
official business. Plans then call for a politically-correct
rotation of the other 10 languages for one month each.
</P>
<P>
   Today, ``transformation'' is the watchword across South Africa
as the new government seeks literally to transform the country's
institutions from closed apartheid structures to open organizations
serving the black majority. Blacks, at least, feel they now have
more of a stake in their own country. Before the elections, for
example, 80 percent of residents in Soweto, the township outside
Johannesburg, refused to pay their electric bills. Now up to 70
percent pay.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when Mandela's government assumed power, it promised to
quickly improve the lives of the black masses by building one
million new houses in five years and bringing clean water to every
South African by 2001. But progress on those fronts has been slow.
</P>
<P>
   The government has brought water to 2.7 million people of the 14
million who had no service in 1994; of 6 million houses which did
not have electricity then, officials estimate that 70 percent will
be wired by the end of next year. But it had built less than
one-fourth of promised houses by the end of last year. Most schools
are overcrowded, lack sufficient textbooks, and have poor
sanitation. Unemployment, meanwhile, stands at 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But crime is perhaps the country's most pressing problem. South
Africa remains one of the most violent societies in the world, with
a murder rate eight times higher than that of the United States.
Rape has risen 18 percent since 1994, assault by 7 percent, and
robbery by 68 percent, according to the South African Police
Service. Vast sections of Johannesburg are considered unsafe ``no
go'' areas by whites.
</P>
<P>
   At times the country seems held together mainly by the sheer
force and dominance of the Mandela mystique. There is a pervasive
view that only Mandela and his enormous reservoir of good will have
protected the country from simmering discontent at the slow pace of
change, and that without him, tension might have reached a full
boil.
</P>
<P>
   So the task for the lesser-known technocrat, Mbeki, is
considerable. He and the ANC face the challenge of all successful
revolutionaries: to assume the banal responsibilities of governing
_ and deliver.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Racial tension
</P>
<P>
   continues to grow &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many think South Africa is more racially tense now than it has
been at any time since the 1994 elections. That sense of
polarization will probably increase in the coming months as the
rhetoric grows more pointed leading up to the next general
elections, expected in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of alienation in this society is so deep, we can
never address all of that,'' said Charles Villa-Vicencio, a
professor of religion and society at the University of Cape Town
who presided over the writing of the Truth Commission's final
report. ``We can agree to coexist. Perhaps once we get that right,
we can think of reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  For now, blacks and whites seem to be talking past each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recurring and deeply felt refrain (among blacks) is that
whites ... and others `previously advantaged' have failed abjectly
to treat reconciliation as a two-way street, and have failed to
understand what is meant by transformation of the society,'' wrote
Shaun Johnson, editorial director of the Independent Newsapers
chain, last December. ``They are seen to want nothing but to get on
with their lives.... This is taken to be shockingly ungrateful,
unrepentant, arrogant and _ the warning note is shrill _
unacceptable behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly alienated whites, meanwhile, feel that
transformation, far from behind schedule, is already running amok.
They cite the crime wave, the declining value of the rand, and
``declining standards'' in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing conviction, wrote Johnson, that being white
is a ``new Mark of Cain, a historical reversal of what blackness
used to mean, and certainly not what whites understood by the
rainbow motif. Many whites believe the only politics being offered
to them is the politics of prostration, and people who believe they
have no alternatives are likely to lash out defensively or lapse
into selfish cynicism rather than participate in the search for
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Blacks seem to be increasingly impatient with the rhetoric of
reconciliation, and are demanding that their economic lot be
improved. ``Saying sorry is not enough,'' said Rev. Mpambani.
``Perpetrators must take responsibility and do something for the
victims. Like pay for their schooling or otherwise financially
support them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mandela himself has made it clear that the revolution in
South Africa did not end with the 1994 elections, and that there
can be no reconciliation without transformation. Other black
leaders make the point more bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the National Assembly in May, Mbeki said ``South
Africa is a country of two nations. One of these nations is white,
relatively prosperous.... The second and larger nation of South
Africa is black and poor.... And neither are we becoming one
nation. Consequently, the objective of national reconciliation is
not being realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer this situation persists ... the more entrenched
will be the conviction that the concept of nation-building is a
mere mirage, and that no basis exists, or will ever exist, to
enable national reconciliation to take place. I am convinced that
we are faced with the danger of a mounting rage to which we must
respond seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing white businessmen in February, Mandela's former wife,
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, warned that a ``second revolution'' was
sweeping the country. ``The truth and reality in South Africa today
is no longer European or white, but African and more often black,''
she said. ``Unless the African is placed at the center of
transformation and the national agenda, our country will not be
stable or productive.''

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR JOCKS ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Hubert Locke is playing the jock card. Like many
supporters of affirmative action, he was disappointed when the
white electorate voted to kill affirmative action by passing
Initiative 200. He was incensed that within 24 hours of the vote,
the University of Washington announced that it was dropping color
as a criterion in its undergraduate admissions process.
</P>
<P>
   Without factoring in disadvantages that are connected to color,
campus officials estimate that 24 percent of this year's
African-American, Latino, and Native American first-year students
would not have been admitted. African-Americans make up 3.4 percent
of the state's population and 2.8 of the students at the University
of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Locke, a professor in the graduate school of public affairs, is
a 23-year veteran of the university and someone known for not
letting racism go gently into the night. He wants to see how
serious the school really is about the matter. He says that if the
university is going to deny education to students of color, it
should also lock out African-American athletes whose high school
academic record would not otherwise have gotten them in the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these people who are so enthusiastic about I-200, I want
to poke around and uncover what we really are saying around here,''
Locke said. ``We must be admitting athletes under special
provisions when they would otherwise never meet the normal academic
criteria for entering the school. If we're going to be consistent
across the board, we need to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, what we are really saying is that we don't want
black students who are trying their hard-est to overcome obstacles
in their lives and know fully that a college degree is a pathway to
success. I'm thinking particularly of black males. We are on the
verge of saying we don't care anything about black males as regular
students who are trying to lift themselves up through academics,
yet we go to great lengths to get black males to come here to play
football and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying, we don't want black men as students, but we want
you as gladiators to serve our rooting interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Myron Apilado, the university's vice president for minority
affairs, is worried that students of color, fearing a hostile
campus, will not even apply for admission, resulting in a drop of
perhaps as much as 40 percent in minority admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-American, Chicano/Latino, and Native American students
were only 9 percent of the student body anyway, so you have to ask
why are these voters so desperate to get rid of them,'' Apilado
said. ``We've graduated over 5,000 students who came here under
affirmative action, including Norm Rice,'' the former mayor of
Seattle, who is African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``These students were qualified to be here, but many of them do
not do as well on standardized tests as white students. Race has
never been the only criterion for getting them in, they had to have
the grades to make us think they could make it here. We're going to
find any way we can to keep the numbers up, using things like low
income, the neighborhood, or the kind of school they come from,
whether they have a single parent, being first generation to go to
college, coming from a reservation, anything we think is an
obstacle to having high test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can't kid ourselves. Race plays a factor, often a
negative factor in test scores, and to now ignore that means we
will have a drop no matter what we do. It is diabolical. The day
after I-200 passed, I had students come up to me to ask me if their
tutoring programs were going to be taken away. What is it that
makes voters want to scare these students and block them when no
one can pretend that the playing field is level?''
</P>
<P>
   The reason might be that even though African-American, Latino,
and Native American students are a small number here, the national
proponents of I-200 never really cared all that much about
Washington state in the first place. This state, which is 84
percent white, was merely an easy steppingstone to build momentum
and intimidate states with much higher percentages of
African-Americans and Latinos, such as Florida, Michigan, and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It was so easy a steppingstone that not only did 80 percent of
Republicans and 66 percent of white men vote for I-200, but so did
half of white women, 54 percent of union members, 62 percent of
independents, and 41 percent of Democrats. Locke said the voting
was a measure of how racism trumped all defenses of affirmative
action, most notably the benefits for white women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of race was injected into this city in a way that I
have not seen for a quarter-century,'' Locke said. ``The number of
African students at this university is already at an obscenely low
number, and now people want to challenge even that. I don't pretend
that affirmative action is the only way to make progress, but one
has to remember that we are only a generation removed from where
universities like this were an all-white preserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nonsense to think that we had decades of segregation and
that all of a sudden, after this small window of opportunity, we
will voluntarily maintain the numbers of black students and black
faculty. On this issue, people will do only what the law compels
them to do. If it compels them to do nothing, they will do
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, perhaps, recruit black men for the football team.

HYDE STILL DOESN'T GET IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The big guy from Woodale, Ill., could really use
some help. Anybody with a way out of the impeachment quagmire
should give him a buzz at 1-800-HYDE.
</P>
<P>
   Post-election and post-Gingrich, the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee has more freedom but also more responsibility.
So far, though, Henry Hyde is acting more like he's trying to duck
and temporize. Talk about not getting it.
</P>
<P>
   It's said there was an election recently, in which strong
signals about priorities were supposedly sent here. So what do the
ostriches in the nation's capital plan to focus on for the next two
months? House Republican squabble politics and impeachment. They
are, without a doubt, related.
</P>
<P>
   Post-election, for starters, there are five fewer Republicans,
and most incoming freshman Republicans got elected by running away
from impeachment and expect their lame-duck colleagues to dump this
evidentiary and political mess by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Post-Gingrich, Hyde no longer has a rabid GOP leadership on his
back, and the distractions of the succession struggle only increase
his running room. The trouble is that Hyde's name keeps popping up
in this struggle _ both as a possible draftee for a leadership job
and as a broker. So far, however, all Hyde has done with his
running room is run in place.
</P>
<P>
   Holding action No. 1 was his dispatch of 81 foolish yes-or-no
questions to the White House. He may eventually get some replies,
but even Hyde knows the silly demand for monosyllables will not and
should not be met.
</P>
<P>
   Holding action No. 2 was the scheduling for Nov. 19 of testimony
from his only planned ``fact'' witness _ the controversial
prosecutor who developed the case under suspicious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is true, as some winking Republicans suggest, that Hyde
is setting Ken Starr up for a fall or a swan song. But for those
trying to take this seriously, the idea that an impeachment case
can be made solely on the testimony of its leading advocate based
on uncross-examined testimony from conflicting witnesses is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath all this is a simple fact, partisan in nature because
it is partisan in reality: The Republicans don't have the votes in
the House to impeach on this case, but they can't stop themselves
yet; and some leading Republicans confide that they may not have
the votes in the super-partisan Judiciary Committee, either. In
military strategy patois, the GOP has no exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And the inclination at the very top of the White House for the
moment is not to provide them with something they are unwilling to
provide for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the president has a more than convenient hook for
holding back, the repeated statements of big-shot Republicans
before and even after the election that formal censure or any other
extra-constitutional maneuver is not an option. The idea is simply
to take them up on it.
</P>
<P>
   The leading proponent of this GOP line on the inside has been
Majority Whip Tom Delay of Texas. On the outside, it has been
former Vice President Dan Quayle. This position had its origins
back in the silly days when the conventional wisdom among press and
pols alike was that impeachment was ``inevitable,'' that any deals
or plea bargains should come at the virtually certain ``trial''
stage in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that nothing was ever inevitable, not before
the election and certainly not now.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the election, there was nothing approaching a
two-thirds majority in the Senate for tossing Clinton out of
office. With the substitution of such GOP freshmen as Jim Bunning,
Peter Fitzgerald, and George Voinovich for experienced
Clinton-bashers Al D'Amato, Lauch Faircloth, and Dan Coates, that
fact of life is only underlined. Already, GOP veterans like Senate
Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch are saying more or less
publicly that the facts of evidentiary and political life in the
Senate ought to affect the facts of life in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But the absurdity instead grinds on. Hyde has himself rejected
stopping the madness, which threatens to become his madness, by
saying the issue of a punishment deal is above his pay grade. Not
anymore. Hyde has also said he does not want to bring impeachment
articles to the House floor that cannot attract bipartisan support.
The truth is they can't without major new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, when the votes on the inquiry were taken to
position members for the election Gingrich thought the GOP would
win, the highwater mark was 226 Republicans and 10 Democrats (five
of whom were against any inquiry) opposing the Democrats' limited
resolution, which Hyde has now in effect accepted post-election.
</P>
<P>
   But actual impeachment based on the Lewinsky case wouldn't come
close to attracting that number. Some true believers on the right
want to take the vote anyway, but no sane Republican leader would
expose members who may be vulnerable two years hence to a vote that
would have no purpose beyond spite.
</P>
<P>
   In this chaotic conundrum, there is little the White House can
do to help beyond not gloating about the election and staying
low-key on impeachment process issues _ in short, waiting for
sanity to emerge. It may take a while. Meantime, nobody named
Clinton is going to ``get away'' with anything. The ``public
rebuke'' of which Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut
spoke in August still waits in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   It would help, though, if the bitter, battling Republicans could
show at least a tad more negotiating maturity in this new
environment than Paula Jones has.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The taxicabs were downstairs lined up at the curb and
idling outside Exchange Place as Boston lawyer Lyman G. Bullard Jr.
watched a host of sports figures and bankers sign the legal
documents he had crafted for months.
</P>
<P>
   The cabs waited to carry the signatories _ including officers of
a syndicate of banks, the sports and concessions behemoth Delaware
North, the Boston Bruins, the Boston Celtics, and Bullard _ to the
announcement of one of the biggest sports deals in the city's
history.
</P>
<P>
   What would eventually be called the FleetCenter was about to be
born on the strength of a $120 million line of credit negotiated by
Bullard. And until moments before the announcement he was still
dispatching his duties as midwife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to get something done in Boston ... for Boston,
that a lot of people had walked away from,'' Bullard recalled in a
recent interview, some six years after the deal was signed. ``I was
still nervous at the end, and I had a weird thought: What happens
with the cabs if someone decides not to sign? Who tells them we
don't need them anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard, 43, has been involved in some of the largest sports
financing deals of the decade and, by all evidence, he is one of
the top sports lawyers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1991, Bullard has been a counsel in establishing a
total of $1.01 billion in lines of credit for sports enterprises.
He has helped pioneer the use of lucrative television contracts to
leverage long-term lines of credit, which enables the teams to have
cash on hand, based on the television networks' guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the FleetCenter, Bullard has fashioned the structure and
financing that secured a stable financial future for the Baltimore
Ravens after their controversial exodus from Cleveland as the
Browns. He also negotiated last summer's arrangement of a $425
million line of credit for Major League Baseball that banking
sources call one of the largest of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Bullard helped structure a bid for the new Cleveland
Browns that the National Football League eventually awarded to
another bidder, Cleveland-area banker Alfred Lerner, for $530
million _ the most ever for a professional sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyman has clearly established himself with a lot of the
financial personnel in the leagues as someone who is at the very
top of the list of lawyers with a lot of expertise,'' said Dan
Williams, the managing director of corporate finances at Fleet
Bank. ``He's one of a group of lawyers known by all of the
executives with the leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Success for Bullard, though, has also afforded him a keen
perspective on the future of professional sports. As he looks at
the evidence of the continually escalating costs of sport that
cross his desk, Bullard says that the sports fan, jock, and father
in him cringes. He wonders whether some of the big-money deals are
getting too rich for the good of the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``While $500 million for the Browns is just a huge price to pay
for any sports franchise, it clearly was not too much to pay,''
Bullard said. ``Lerner's a very smart guy and he was willing to pay
for it, and my guys (the lawyer Lawrence Dolan and his brother
Charles, a founding owner of Cablevision Systems Corp. ) were right
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it just shows that over the next decade, fewer and fewer
individuals are going to be able to buy these sports teams, and
that more and more companies _ especially media companies _ are
going to be the ones competing to buy these teams,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When corporations buy teams as part of an integrated business
strategy, it will be interesting to see what it does to salary
structures and other things, especially when the ownership may not
need the team to make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard approaches sports business from the perspective of a guy
who has actually played the games. In fact, 20 years later, he
remains no small legend among the followers of hockey at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Beanpot Tournament in 1977, Bullard, a
senior, was the captain of the soccer team and perhaps one of the
best tennis players on campus. He also had gone out for the junior
varsity in hockey. On the eve of the Beanpot, with injuries racking
the Crimson, coach Bill Cleary made a surprise call to Bullard's
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck in the Beanpot, coach,'' Cleary has quoted Bullard
in the many subsequent retellings of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you like to wear a Harvard shirt in the Beanpot?''
Cleary said he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a good enough story at that,'' Bullard
recalled, his exuberance only a little less diluted two decades
after the fact. ``But then I figured in on some good plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Good plays? The truth is that Bullard, playing as a forward,
scored one goal and assisted on another, with 29 seconds left in
the game, that beat Boston University 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he graduated from Boston College Law School in 1984
and was admitted to the bar, sports still enthralled him. While
doing some legal work with the old Shawmut Bank, he got an early
suggestion of how he could combine his passion and his profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fellow there, David Splain, had a couple of sports matters
before him and he told me, `Lyman, I know you played hockey and you
like sports, why don't you get involved with this?''' Bullard
explained. ``I really saw the visibility and the flash that sports
would bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, he found himself in the middle of major deals.
</P>
<P>
   During the months of all-day work preceding completion of the
FleetCenter deal, Bullard said he learned some valuable lessons
about how focus and a continuously positive attitude can bring
deals to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when you deal with the different leagues you
get bogged down in a lot of detail, and it's easy to lose focus and
get overwhelmed, because they each have their rules and
requirements that just adds to what is already a fairly complex
situation. But not with Lyman,'' said Pat McAuliffe, an executive
vice president in charge of Fleet's sports lending group.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time he is keeping on course and moving along, he
doesn't lose focus on those devils in the details that he is
addressing and protecting his parties from any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The lessons about fortitude and comity that Bullard learned in
the FleetCenter deal served him well. The $185 million line of
credit that he secured _ as both a counsel to Fleet Corporate
Finance and in his capacity as adviser to Ravens owner Art Modell
was as difficult and complicated as the Browns's exit from the
south shore of Lake Erie was unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL told us it just couldn't be done,'' Williams said.
``It was very difficult to line up the various requirements of
lenders, and insurers, and the need to address some rather complex
tax laws. I would describe it as a Rubik's cube: Every time you put
one problem back into place, something came out on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Lyman is very adept at making people feel very comfortable
with a very complex set of circumstances,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the college kid who leapt for joy at Harvard's Beanpot
victory 20 years ago lurks in the heart of this high-powered
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are one of the new owners, you charge local companies
more and more for the stadium suites, and fewer and fewer fans are
going to be able to afford to go to games,'' Bullard said.
``Increasingly, the next generation of kids will see more and more
games on television and fewer and fewer in person than we did. And
what's their commitment going to be, soon?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that works,'' Bullard said, with a shrug. ``But that's
where we're headed.''

FLEET'S STRATEGY ON FUNDS PAYS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sales practices at BankBoston Corp.'s mutual fund operation
are being investigated by the Massachusetts Securities Division.
The bank has yet to name a replacement for the unit's chief, who
left in August. The director of sales quit last month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, literally a stone's throw away, Robert L. Ash, who
heads Fleet Financial Group Inc.'s growing mutual fund business,
says Fidelity and Putnam and Merrill Lynch are the competition, not
BankBoston. Still, the contrast is stark these days.
</P>
<P>
   While BankBoston dawdles, Fleet is putting up big numbers. In
the first nine months of this year, sales of Fleet's Galaxy Funds
family were up 120 percent over a year earlier to $649 million, or
more than for all of 1997. Monthly retail sales of Galaxy funds to
retail customers are averaging $72 million compared with $32
million a year ago. Fleet opened 70,000 new Galaxy accounts in the
first nine months of the year compared with 30,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the irony: BankBoston is being investigated for allegedly
goosing fees by moving customers out of its no-load funds and into
Fidelity and Putnam funds that charge higher fees, while Fleet has
built its success on just the opposite strategy. Fleet has waived
the load, or sales charge, on its Galaxy funds for retirement
accounts, thus encouraging customers to switch into them.
</P>
<P>
   The move has cost Fleet substantial fee income in the short
term, but has created a remarkable turnaround for the Galaxy funds.
Before waiving the loads, 90 percent of all of the new mutual fund
dollars brought in by Fleet went into third-party load funds like
Fidelity and Putnam. Now 85 percent of that money is going into
Galaxy funds.
</P>
<P>
   The pricing strategy has been the key, though the investment
performance hasn't hurt. Of Fleet's 29 Galaxy funds, most rank in
the top quartile or half of their peers over the last one to three
years, according to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks fund
performance. The largest Fleet fund, the all-purpose Galaxy Asset
Allocation, ranks 50th of 191 such funds over the last year and
38th of 143 funds over three years.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of the Fleet strategy is Bob Ash, who had to
convince his bosses, Fleet chairman Terry Murray and vice chairman
Gunnar Overstrom, to forgo the short-term fees for the promise of
getting the long-term assets under management. Those inside Fleet
say this was no easy sell. The reason: Waiving the fees has cost
Fleet about $4 million this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   But Ash came with strong credentials _ built outside the bank
and outside of banking. He had been chief executive of AIG Asset
Management Services, where he worked for one of the toughest
executives in financial services, AIG chief executive Maurice
Greenberg. He had also headed mutual fund sales for Kemper
Financial Services. He was a man who had retired early because of
prostate cancer, but who was all too glad to have Murray talk him
back into a job 14 months ago after he had recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Ash's bet is essentially that Fleet will be better off waiving
the 3.75 percent load if it can get, and retain, the assets and
annual management fees. Ash argues that retirement money, unlike
taxable accounts, is not going to be chasing the latest hot fund.
In addition, bank customers themselves are more likely to remain
with Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retirement money stays put,'' Ash says.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Bathon, president of Financial Research Corp. in Boston,
says Fleet has prospered because it brought in people like Ash and
his deputy, Linda Goodwin, with solid mutual fund experience
outside the banking world and let them do their jobs. Bathon offers
high praise for Fleet: ``They can actually be compared to other
mutual fund groups,'' not other bank funds.
</P>
<P>
   Of BankBoston, he says: ``Their retail efforts are not in the
same league.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the mutual fund business is just a tiny piece of
what either of these banks do. BankBoston has put most of its
energy into building its widely admired Latin America franchise and
the recent acquisition of investment banking heavyweight Robertson
Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston acknowledges that Fleet is ahead in the mutual fund
business. Fleet has about $16 billion in mutual fund assets,
BankBoston has $9.5 billion. BankBoston saw 15 percent sales growth
in the last year; Fleet is growing at 100 percent-plus. BankBoston
has 50 brokers in branches; Fleet has 275 and plans to move that to
1,100 in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business is at the top of our list we intend to grow,''
says Kathleen McGillycuddy, BankBoston's head of global treasury
who oversees the business. She says the bank hopes to fill both
vacancies at the top soon.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Guillette, a consultant with Cerulli Associates in
Boston, says both Fleet and BankBoston still have the same problem
plaguing most banks in their mutual fund operations: too much money
in low-fee money market accounts and too little in equity funds,
which have higher fees.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of all the Fleet money was in money market
accounts at the end of September and just 33 percent was in
equities, the bank says. BankBoston was even worse: 69 percent was
in money markets and just 18 percent in equities. By comparison,
Fidelity has just 19 percent of retail assets in money markets,
Cerulli says.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, says Cerulli, Fleet has just $6 billion in equity and
bond assets, but that is good enough to rank number nine among all
banks. BankBoston has just $2.8 billion. (Reality check: A nice
midsize Fidelity fund like Dividend Growth has $7 billion in assets
alone.)
</P>
<P>
   As the state Securities Division pushes its inquiry of
BankBoston, it is reportedly looking into a change in the
compensation system in 1997 that may have encouraged its sales
people to push third-party funds over the bank's own 1784 Funds.
Ash, the Fleet executive, says he isn't worried about his own sales
reps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no incentive for them to do what was happening at
BankBoston,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, on the other hand, says it can't comment. There is a
pending inquiry.

The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of a revived stock market: deals to buy money
management shops seem to be making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Affiliated Managers Group of Boston struck its second deal in
three weeks Monday, agreeing to buy a majority interest in Rorer
Asset Management of Philadelphia for about $65 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Rorer manages $3.7 billion for institutions and wealthy
individuals. Affiliated will purchase 65 percent of the firm and
Rorer managers will keep the rest. It will join 12 other Affiliated
investment firms that manage a combined $53 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Affiliated agreed last month to buy a controlling interest in
Davis Hamilton Jackson &AMP; Associates of Houston, manager of about $3
billion, for an undisclosed amount of cash.

 CAPE TOWN: ... or productive.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its final report, the Truth Commission agreed, declaring:
``The huge and widening gap between the rich and the poor is a
disturbing legacy of the past, which has not been reduced by the
democratic process. It is morally reprehensible, politically
dangerous, and economically unsound to allow this to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Desmond Tutu, the conciliatory archbishop who chaired the
commission, marvels at the patience blacks have shown. ``They still
get up from their shanty settlements,'' Tutu said in a speech to
South African journalists last year. ``They go to work for white
people in affluent suburbs, and at night they return to the squalor
of their homes, their unlit streets, no running water, no clinics,
no schools, no decent homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They actually go back to all that,'' he continued, ``and they
don't say `to hell with it,' and go on a rampage in the largely
white pockets of comfort and affluence. And all some whites do is
moan about this and that, really about their loss of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Among whites, what needs to be purged is any lingering feeling
that apartheid was a well-meaning policy that supported the greater
good of all groups under ``separate development'' _ any sense it
was a noble idea which foundered only in its implementation,
according to Kader Asmal, Louise Asmal, and Ronald Roberts, authors
of ``Reconciliation Through Truth: A Reckoning of Apartheid's
Criminal Governance.'' ``Such views are a final desecration of
those who fell victim to apartheid's willful violence,'' they
write.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
White far right warily
</P>
<P>
   keeps tabs on developments
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Watching developments ominously on the white far right are men
like Pieter Johan Verster, former commander of the
euphemistically-named Civil Cooperation Bureau, a secretive unit of
the former regime's Special Forces which carried out operations
against enemies of the apartheid state. Verster was called before
the Truth Commission at a closed hearing and made statements that
some commissioners considered seditious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sitting here as an officer of the former South African
Defense Force, a commanding officer in charge of sensitive
operations, and I have a real problem with the approach that there
was supposed to have been a negotiated settlement between the
former government and the ANC,'' Verster said, according to a
transcript of the hearing given to the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of people who feel exactly the same way as
I do. That is the current view of moderate people who have never
seen any signs of real negotiations which have addressed the needs
of soldiers and people who acted in a covert way in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   On the center-right is Constand Viljoen, former head of the
South African Defense Force from 1980 to 1985 and now head of the
Freedom Front party, which has nine seats in parliament. Viljoen,
who has worked quietly with Mandela and the ANC to keep a lid on
the far right, is nonetheless extremely critical of the direction
toward which the country is moving, especially the effort to
eliminate Afrikaans as an official language.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not in line with reconciling and protecting the rights
of minorities,'' Viljoen said. ``We are a very important white tub
in Africa, and we want to remain in Africa. But there is very
little hope right now.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Tony Leon, leader of the liberal Democratic Party,
``99 pecent of whites in South Africa have `truth fatigue,' and
would like to just get on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Truth Commission's Villa-Vicencio dismissed the complaints
of most whites as those of ``spoiled brats'' coming late to the
realization that it is time to share the wealth. But he said it is
important to devise ways to make whites feel more invested in the
new South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society is infinitely better now, but the weakness is whites
feel they don't have any obvious role to play in the creation of
that new society,'' Villa-Vicencio said. ``We have to make whites
feel that they can join in the building of the new nation. When I
was helping in the struggle, I was a comrade. Now I'm a white male.
That's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Being called a white male, in the now-universal parlance of
affirmative action, &UR;  &LR; may trouble Villa-Vicencio and others, but it
is reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know we're going through a period where we have to
redress past imbalances, and the sooner we do it, the better,''
said Colin Eglin, a longtime member of parliament and senior figure
in the Democratic party who helped draft the new constitution.
``But the scale of what's going on here is incredible. Most
majorities set a goal of integrating minorities at a level of 15 to
17 percent. Here the minorities have handed over power to the
majority, and now the majority is seeking to integrate 65 percent
of the people into existing institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   While most whites seem opposed or indifferent to the work of the
Truth Commission, a small number are striking the kind of
conciliatory tone the commission and the black majority have
sought.
</P>
<P>
   Brian and Joyce Williams of Johannesburg were two of a few
hundred whites who wrote the Truth Commission to ask for
forgiveness. ``We both in our respective ways grew up as privileged
people without ever seriously wondering why `white' was so
privileged and millions of our fellow darker-skinned South Africans
were born without the same privileges,'' they wrote. ``We wish to
apologize to the nation and to the commission for being so blind,
deaf, and dumb, and to thank you for bringing about our liberation
to be true South Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   But Professor Mahmood Mamdami, head of the African studies
department at the University of Cape Town, said such sentiments are
rare, and that the commission focused too much attention on the
extremes of the apartheid conflict rather than on the vast number
of ordinary white ``beneficiaries'' of the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TRC has looked at apartheid through the lens of political
activism on the one hand and state agents on the other, excluding
the vast middle,'' said Mamdami at the reconciliation symposium
here in March. ``What was distinctive about apartheid was the link
between the perpetrators and the beneficiaries. The TRC's challenge
was to get the beneficiaries to join the victims in outrage at the
perpetrators, or at least to get beneficiaries to see their own
social responsibility. But they have failed in this. Most
beneficiaries are still unaware they were beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission has been criticized on other fronts, most notably
for being too slow in ensuring that victims of human rights abuses
receive reparations. The panel has also been chastised by those who
argue that granting amnesty to the perpetrators of some of
apartheid's worst atrocities is too high a price to pay for the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission also has had some spectacular successes in
bringing closure to crimes most had long since despaired of
solving, and in giving cathartic voice to thousands of victims of
apartheid, empowered for the first time to tell their stories in a
series of public hearings, before the country and the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TRC has touched the lives of the majority of the people in
South Africa, because the history of this period was more than
blurred _ it was falsified,'' said George Bizos, a lawyer who has
represented Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid leaders.
``Torture and murder were decreed by the security forces. Were it
not for the TRC, the apologists for apartheid would contend that
there is no evidence to substantiate that. After all, even the
evidence given at Nuremberg did not prevent some Germans from
denying the atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   In its final report, the Truth Commission made a series of
recommendations to promote reconciliation in South Africa. They
include: asking apartheid's beneficiaries to contribute to the
alleviation of poverty, possibly through a ``wealth tax'';
introducing community policing to cut crime; prosecuting, where
appropriate, those who the commission found to have committed human
rights violations; and establishing clinics and services to help
heal victims and perpetrators. It also called for a
``reconciliation summit'' to take place at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Countless obstacles to genuine reconciliation in South Africa
remain. But many observers here are cautiously optimistic that the
work of the commission will jolt the country into creating a new
paradigm for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a pathology here that other countries
haven't had to deal with,'' said Kader Asmal, an ANC cabinet
minster and one of the authors of ``Reconciling Through Truth.''
``But if we get it right, it's of epochal importance. It's a new
culture we're developing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Added John Battersby, editor of the Sunday Independent
newspaper: ``I think it will take 10 to 15 years to integrate this
process. People are far too close to it now, both black and white.
The real challenge here is, can you build a nation out of
incredibly diverse people? The Truth Commission is key to creating
this sense of commonality.''

FAMILIES FIND FULL DISCLOSURE DOESN'T HEAL ALL WOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BEN BRADLEE JR.  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; GUGULETU, South Africa _ In the wrenching healing process from
the legacy of apartheid, the case of the so-called Guguletu 7
accomplishes as much as can be hoped for in this country.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, 1986, seven young men were shot to death by police
in this black township outside of Cape Town. The case got
international attention and soon took its place alongside the
Sharpeville massacre, the murder of Steven Biko, and other
upheavals as another ugly milestone of the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   Two inquests in 1986 and 1989 absolved the police of any
wrongdoing and concluded that the killings were part of a
legitimate ``anti-terrorist operation.'' But two-years ago, the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission _ charged by President Nelson
Mandela to uncover what really happened under apartheid _ developed
new evidence that the Guguletu 7 had actually been lured to their
deaths and ambushed in an operation ordered by security forces in
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has touted the case as a centerpiece of its
efforts to learn how killings actually took place, to bring closure
to families of the victims, and where possible, to achieve a
measure of reconciliation between the families and those who
committed the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many kinds of victims in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with limited time and resources, the commission knew from
the start that it could not hope to solve, or even investigate, all
the murders of the apartheid years. So it concentrated on a limited
number of cases _ some high profile, others less so _ that told
larger stories.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many of the 22,000 people whom the commission
decided were victims of gross rights violations, and thus eligible
for limited reparations, never learned what happened to their loved
ones. Others missed the deadlines imposed by the commission to
apply for victim status, thereby losing the opportunity for
compensation and closure.
</P>
<P>
   Still others, most notably the Biko family, learned a lot about
what happened to their relatives when the killers confessed while
applying for amnesty. But they found the notion of setting admitted
killers free intolerable, and they demanded that the perpetrators
be denied amnesty and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like the other mothers, Eunice Miye remembers exactly how she
learned that her son, Jabulane, had been killed 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching TV that night and they said `seven guerrillas
from Russia were killed in Guguletu,''' Miye said in an interview
here. ``When the pictures came on, I saw my son lying dead. I saw
he had on the same clothes he had on that morning.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Truth Commission started to investigate, an important
early lead involved the tracing of a license plate on a police van
used at the Guguletu shootings to Vlakplaas, the notorious security
forces base outside of Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   But the key discovery, found inside a cabinet at police
headquarters in Cape Town, was a video taken by police during and
after the killings. It showed close-ups of the bullet-riddled
bodies, and a dramatic scene where one of those killed, Christopher
Piet, was attached to a rope and dragged away.
</P>
<P>
   Then a black policeman from Vlakplaas, Sergeant Thapelo Mbelo,
confessed his pivotal role in the operation to investigators: He
had posed as an African National Congress commander sent to train
the seven men to fight in the resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Mbelo and others prepared them for their first operation:
a plot to ambush a bus that ferried police through Guguletu. But of
course Mbelo and others had told police of the plan, and when the
seven men were dropped off, about 25 officers were laying in wait
and opened fire on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slaughter,'' said Zenzile Khoisan, the Truth
Commission investigator who led the probe of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The video was played at a hearing on the Guguletu 7 case at
which relatives of the victims testified. ``They asked us if we
wanted to see it and we said yes,'' said Irene Mxinwa, whose son
Simon was killed in Guguletu. ``But we didn't know how bad it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cynthia Ngewu, Piet's mother, saw a close-up shot of her
son, she threw her shoe at one of the 23 officers who have been
implicated in the case.
</P>
<P>
   After she and Mxinwa composed themslves, they agreed to meet
with Mbelo. ``He asked forgiveness,'' said Mxinwa. ``He said he did
all these things, but he couldn't help it, and we must forgive him.
We did forgive. We hugged him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miye refused to meet Mbelo. ``I can't forgive him,'' she
said. ``It's a wound you can never cover.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helping to deal with families whose cases were either not
investigated as thoroughly as the Guguletu 7's or not investigated
at all, is Khulumani, a Johannesburg-based victim-support group.
Officials there say the commission promised more than it could
deliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm the director of a company and I can't finish the job,
I've got to hire people and work overtime,'' said Maggie Friedman,
an American whose South African lover, David Webster, was shot and
killed by security forces in 1989. ``Expectations were raised too
high from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Khulumani official, Duma Khumalo, has been trying,
unsuccessfully, to obtain help from the commission for people like
Elizabeth Mkhwanz, of Evaton, a township south of Johannesburg. She
said her son Steven was beaten, tortured, and finally shot to death
by police in 1992. In an interview, Mkhwanz said she stopped
reading the newspapers or watching television after her son was
killed, and hadn't heard about the Truth Commission. As a result,
she missed the deadline to apply for victim status.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the majority in South Africa, life goes on,'' said
Khumalo. ``Those who've suffered will suffer some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Other families who lost relatives in the apartheid years have
learned much from the Truth Commission, but say they are not
prepared to forgive those who have confessed to the killings, and
they strongly oppose amnesty for them.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is that of Stanza Bopape, a 27-year-old activist
from Mamelodi, a township on the outskirts of Pretoria. In June
1988, he was arrested in Johannesburg and taken to John Vorster
Square police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Police said at the time that Bopape had escaped while being
driven to another location, but he never contacted family members,
and he was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in December 1996, after receiving subpoenas from
investigators and as the deadline for seeking amnesty approached,
10 police officers, including then commissioner Johannes van der
Merwe, applied for amnesty and admitted that Bopape had died while
being interrogated.
</P>
<P>
   They said because Bopape was uncooperative, that he needed to be
given ``a little fright.'' So he was strapped to a chair and given
electric shock treatments. But he soon slumped over, dead. They
claimed that he was given only two or three jolts at levels that
should not have been fatal, so they suspected he may have suffered
from a heart ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid that reaction to the death-in-detention might have caused
further unrest at a particularly unstable time, the police said
they took Bopape's body to the northeastern part of the country and
dumped it in the Komati River. The body has never been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The Truth Commission considers the Bopape case to be one of the
most important it investigated because of the top-to-bottom
involvement of the Security Police in his death and its subsequent
coverup. But Bopape's familiy is opposing amnesty for the 10 police
officials in the belief they are still not telling the whole truth.
They say Bopape had no history of heart problems and suspect that
he was beaten and tortured to death. They believe his body was then
exploded, not dumped in the river, to conceal evidence of a beating
or torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very sad because there's not been full disclosure,''
said Michael Bopape, Stanza's brother. ``They've admitted they
killed him, but they haven't told us how they killed him. These
guys should be arrested to serve as an example for people holding
top positions in government. So it can't happen again. So my
father's soul will rest in peace.''

`COST' MAKES WHIPPING BOY OF ITS SUBJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
AT ANY COST 
Jack Welch, General Electric, and the Pursuit of Profit 
By Thomas F. O'Boyle 
Knopf, 464 pp., $29.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first hint of trouble in Thomas O'Boyle's book comes on the
very first page. In his author's note, he points out that the
subject of his book, Jack Welch, chairman of General Electric Co.,
refused to cooperate with the project. But not to worry, O'Boyle
tells the reader: ``I have done everything in my power to write a
balanced and fair account.''
</P>
<P>
   And the check is in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Any Cost'' is actually a remarkably one-sided book about
Welch's tenure at GE. To call it a hatchet job would be too kind.
Ax murder would be closer to the mark. O'Boyle has made Welch the
poster boy for modern capitalism and all the ills that accompany
it: downsizing, deal-making, ethical violations, pollution. If the
book had come out a few months later, O'Boyle probably would have
blamed Welch for the Asian financial crisis and the collapse of the
ruble.
</P>
<P>
   When Jack Welch took over GE in 1981, he inherited a
slow-moving, bureaucratic company. Its old-line manufacturing
businesses were under intense pressure from rivals both in this
country and abroad. Welch rolled up his sleeves and went to work.
He chopped the work forces of traditional businesses _ light bulbs,
power systems, and appliances _ because he recognized that in a
global economy only low-cost producers can survive. At the same
time he moved GE into service businesses like entertainment and
finance that promised greater growth and higher returns. Welch
didn't invent the forces of modern capitalism. He anticipated them.
And he put his company in a position to profit from them.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers speak for themselves. Between 1982 and 1997 GE's
stock price rose 1,155 percent. The company's earnings have grown
at a steady 10 to 15 percent clip per year. Bill Gates may be
America's best known corporate leader, but in business circles,
Jack Welch is probably more admired. Gates has achieved great
success by doing one thing well. Welch has created winners in at
least half a dozen separate fields.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas O'Boyle isn't impressed. He dismisses Welch's foray into
finance _ probably his greatest triumph _ in a few paragraphs. The
money business may be profitable, but to O'Boyle it is nothing more
than ``glitz,'' ``financial engineering,'' and ``gamesmanship.''
The author has practically nothing to say about GE's
accomplishments in aircraft engines or medical devices because they
don't fit his central thesis: that under Welch, GE has abandoned
all research, technology, and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Boyle has plenty to say about the problems of the Welch years.
Unfortunately he frequently blows them out of all proportion. He
calls the failure of a new GE refrigerator in the 1980s ``one of
the greatest fiascoes in modern engineering.'' Was it really? The
author spends a full 50 pages describing the government's attempt
to prosecute GE for price fixing in the industrial diamond
business. Yet at the very end of this tedious account we learn that
the courts threw out the case. So why are we reading so much about
it?
</P>
<P>
   O'Boyle does raise some legitimate issues. More than 100,000 GE
jobs have been axed under Welch, in a series of downsizings that
have devastated old industrial towns like Pittsfield and
Schenectady, N.Y. Did Welch need to be so hard-nosed? Could the
transformation of GE have been accomplished in a more humane way?
</P>
<P>
   It is also fair to ask how much blame Welch should bear for some
of the ethical lapses that have happened on his watch, especially
in the defense business. While Welch has never told his employees
to break the law, the high-pressure culture he has created may have
encouraged some of his underlings to cross the line in pursuit of
greater profits. As O'Boyle puts it, ``Some clearly felt that
cheating was the only way to deliver the numbers needed to protect
their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the business press, Jack Welch receives very different
treatment. Over the past 17 years, he has probably been on more
magazine covers than Cindy Crawford. The accompanying articles are
nearly always fawning. He is inevitably praised for his acumen. His
words are treated like pronouncements from on high.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, a book will come along that provides a balanced account
of Jack Welch. Suffice to say, this isn't it.

FLEECE IS THE WORD, KILLY IS THE NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE HATFIELD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One word can almost sum up the trend in 1998/99 skiwear: fleece.
</P>
<P>
   That soft fuzzy stuff that used to come only on teddy bears now
covers the skier inside and out, and not just because it's cute and
comes in bright colors and feels like you're wearing your jammies.
Fleece, made as ski equipment, say in the women's jacket of
Polartec 300 made by The North Face, is warmer than many other
natural materials. It comes in all weights and is used to make
everything except ski boots: hoods, headbands, neck warmers, inner
jackets, outer jackets, vests, gloves, liner gloves, one-piece
underlayers.
</P>
<P>
   And if your whole ski jacket isn't fleece, portions of it may
be. This is the season of kaleidoscopic fabrications on single
garments; i.e. fleece in the places where you most need softness
and warmth such as around the neck, rubberized fabric at the elbows
where you most need stretch, ventilated breathable fabric under the
arms, and, for fashion alone, leather or fur trims at some
necklines and wrists.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to parkas and pants, Jean-Claude Killy is the name
to remember. While hordes of athletes throw their names onto
clothing lines, Killy backs his up with a promise: You will be
warm. Known for his three gold medals at the '68 winter Olympics,
Killy was familiar with that bone-chilling cold that can hit a
skier during the not-so-great conditions that sometimes exist in
ski country, and he has put plenty of study and technology into his
fabrics to keep out that nasty cold. Notable are the
diagonally-placed synthetic down fibers inside his parkas for men
and women, that led Randy Bisson, assistant manager of the Ski
Market on Commonwealth Avenue, to promise that Killy parkas are the
warmest in the store this year _ and the most popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killy is flying out of the store,'' says Bisson, and when one
looks at the color splashed on the walls and hangers, one
understands the appeal to that sense, too. With black as the basic
jacket, and black practically the required color for pants and
accessories, brights in new tones are on the parkas. Surprisingly,
for the women, an acidic lime green is one of the more popular
shades, followed by a strong marigold yellow that Killy calls
``chrome.'' There's red, and blue, and the women's parkas, puffy
but not gigantic and slimmed down from past seasons but covered in
hardware such as giant zippers, are $174.99, while the man's, most
often in black, with ``pit'' zippers for ventilation even under the
arms, and heat-taped seams, which provide superior water
resistance, are $588. The big difference in price is not just
because the men's jackets are bigger. They're more technical, with
different sections of the parka in different technical
fabrications, some more water-resistant or stronger or warmer than
others.
</P>
<P>
   The North Face has a man's jacket with a powder shirt in one
garment for $395 at the Ski Market, which features a double storm
flap under the arms and a velcroed articulating hood that contours
to the head, so that when you turn your head, your face is not
facing the inside of your hood.
</P>
<P>
   Marmot makes vests that can be zipped right into the jacket by
means of a second zipper under the first. This is layering taken to
the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The best value in the Ski Market is the Columbia parka. If you
buy one jacket for $183, you're actually getting two, because there
is a removable nylon and fleece shell under the jacket.
</P>
<P>
   A black waterproof, breathable, high-backed, double suspender
Gore Tex pant for men is $180 and actually has a drop seat, Dr.
Denton-style, for faster bathroom visits with all those clothes on,
and Bisson notes that this has been an extremely good selling
feature.
</P>
<P>
   The regular fleece gloves are $29 at the Ski Market, but this
year there is a North Face Windstopper fleece glove with Gore Tex
layer for $47, or a thicker fleece glove for $55.
</P>
<P>
   Bisson urges people who can't keep warm on the slopes to come in
for a total body lesson, which starts with the underwear dictum:
never cotton. ``It sits, soggy and cold, next to your skin when
wet,'' he says as he leads you over to the Lycra poly blend tops
and bottoms in sleeveless, tank or long-sleeved styles, all of
which constantly wick the moisture from your body. With ``Wick &AMP;
Dry'' ski socks, at $12 per pair, he dares you to come back and say
you were cold this winter on the slopes. Snowboarders, by the way,
can this season find plenty of socks and gloves, in addition to
parkas and pants, made just for their sport.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest news at Bogner is the hugely popular ``Fire &AMP; Ice''
line of snowboard and skiwear for the college-aged and younger
skier. This line is slimmed down from the formerly oversized
styles, especially in snowboard clothing, and it's a technical line
with bonded seams and very warm and thin water- repellant fabrics.
The prices are not as shocking as the adult Bogner, either: A parka
in the Fire &AMP; Ice line is $228. Colors are ecru, cornflower blue,
navy and white, and sometimes all of these colors or several of
them are blocked into one garment, as in the $158 Italian fleece
jackets (yes, Bogner is as committed to fleece as the others; their
fleece, however, is even more luxurious to the hand than most). The
pant in this line is lined but not bulky, with nylon polymide and
is waterproof and insulated. It has a flat front like a jean and a
straight leg with a boot cut, for $198. Sleek zippered black cable
sweaters with fleece sections are popular, as are the
black-and-white color blocked parkas and the chenille and wool
fabric blocked sweaters. Wool sweaters with stripes across the
chest are $128 at Bogner. A snowboard pant, big but not oversized,
with a white stripe piped down the black legs, is $178.
</P>
<P>
   Big Ice is, ironically, the littlest Bogner in the place. It's a
whole line for the littlest skier, sized for the 3-12-year-old, and
its trim just hints of Bogner classic style, with a snowflake or a
reindeer embroidered here or there rather than splashed all over.
Matching fleece mittens, gloves, and hats are part of the parka and
pant and sweater Big Ice line, and it follows the same baby
blue/ecru/white shades as the Fire &AMP; Ice line for big brothers and
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   You can still get your high style at Bogner and its
corresponding price, if that's your thing on the slopes. The adult
``Burnout'' pattern is flocked velvet or floral jacquard Ultrasuede
in the same cornflower blue and ecru as the younger lines. As with
the other lines, there are matching fleece pieces for these parkas
and pants and one-piece suits. ``Sonia'' is a smooth black
microfiber jacket of polyurethane with a tunnel drawstring at the
waist for a fitted look. It's $758 unless you want a huge brown fox
fur detachable collar and cuffs; then it's $1,098. There's a White
Buffalo theme from New Mexico, with stars and a buffalo embroidered
on the parkas and a huge ``Legends of the White Buffalo'' logo on
the back. The equivalent of fur trim for men who wish to make a
fashion statement is leather, and there is plenty of it at Bogner.

<HEADLINE>
FOUR AREAS FROM THE NEXT OLYMPIC STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking back at the Olympics I have covered as a skiwriter, from
Lake Placid to Nagano, only a couple _ Lillehamer and Albertville _
were not preceeded by much anxiety over snow conditions. And often,
the worries were justified.
</P>
<P>
   From the warm Chinook winds that threatened to melt the Calgary
ski runs to the monsoon weather that tried to wash away last year's
Nagano games, no area seemed without threat. Even Europe during
World Cup season sometimes has snow droughts that force venue
shifts and postponements.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the Olympic Committee picked Utah as the site of
the 2002 Winter Games, nearly everyone on the scene had the same
thought: ``What a perfect venue Salt Lake City would be!''
Especially for skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Questions of transportation (airports right downtown) to
infrastructure (much of it already built) aside, the Rockies in
general, and Utah particularly, have the most predictably perfect
snow of anywhere in ski country. Anywhere you can get to without a
band of Sherpas, that is.
</P>
<P>
   It has been called ``champagne powder'' and ``cold smoke,'' but
whatever its name, the snow that falls on the Utah Rockies is as
close to perfect as ski snow gets. The occasional drawback is that
it snows so much so fast that skiers can't reach the areas. Roads
closed; snow falling too fast to plow _ that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   True, Colorado, from Vail to Aspen to Steamboat to Arapahoe, is
usually credited with having cornered the most truly great ski
areas in the United States, nor is Colorado (Montana, Idaho, New
Mexico) shabby in the snow department.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Utah is considered a near perfect
international ski venue should be instructive to skiers making the
annual trek west for a Rocky Mountain vacation. Even within all
that perfection are a couple of polar opposites: Indeed, Utah
skiing seems to divide between the relentlessly rough Alta and
Snowbird and the terminally suave Deer Valley.
</P>
<P>
   If readers' surveys are any measure of how aging boomers, who
dominate the ski travel business, like their skiing, think smooth,
think plush, think rich. Deer Valley, where ski checking valets
greet you at every doorway, comes up near the top of most lists.
</P>
<P>
   Attendants fairly flock to your group and all its gear when you
arrive, and the place treats you like a celebrity from that moment
on. Which is also how the resort approaches its snow, grooming it
to a smoothness rarely matched in Utah or any other state. Top
service and grooming, whatever it costs, have been Deer Valley's
plan from the start, and the plan works. Few skiers who go away
having spent rigorously complain. They know what the area is all
about and they want some.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that there's anything namby-pamby about the
skiing. Yes, it's groomed to a fault so that skiers on the long
blue cruisers can achieve sensations of flight. But this mountain
has some oomph to it as well. Steep and deep bowls of powder,
bumps, and steep chutes are also features to keep the top-level
skiers challenged for a week's vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Deer Valley in any way small or limited. With 1,750 acres
and a 3,000-foot vertical drop, the area has as much variety for
mixed ability groups as any area in or outside the Rockies with the
exception of Vail and Whistler. This season, two new areas _ Deer
Crest and Empire Canyon _ open up over 500 acres of new terrain
ranging from moderate blue cruising to steep glades and chutes.
</P>
<P>
   The food is exactly what you'd expect from Deer Valley _
exquisite, expensive, and in the estimation of loyalists worth
every penny. The lodging is top drawer as well.
</P>
<P>
   If banning snowboards seems snobbishly backward in this age of
detente, so be it. Deer Valley is unashamed of its position, and
misplaced boarders will be given free ski rentals for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Park City's great advantage as an Olympic venue is its
proximity _ via good roads _ to the Salt Lake City airport. This
hometown of the US Ski Team boasts a fine ski area _ especially
with this year's additions _ in an area that has an off-slope buzz
to it. With much of the state's skiing still rather spartan in
terms of restaurants and shopping opportunities, Park City has all
above amenities and will most certianly continue to develop with
the Olympic games just 38 months away.
</P>
<P>
   About six miles out of town, at an place once called Park City
West, then Wolf Mountain, is a remarkable ski area. The Canyons is
typical of Les Otten's American Skiing Co. approach to such
projects: The stated aim was to create not just the biggest ski
area in Utah, but the biggest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While The Canyons currently falls just short of that goal, its
2,700 acres of varied terrain unfolds only when skiers lift above
the rather unimpressive front face of the lower slopes, which is
all one sees from the road.
</P>
<P>
   But even here, the first phase of an ambitious base village is
in place, and ASC this season has added two high-speed quads and a
triple chair, as well as Sun Lodge at mid-mountain.
</P>
<P>
   As the gondola lifts above the lower face, the Canyons spreads
out in a spectacular array of peaks, chutes, and open bowls that
will give skiers the entire smorgasbord of experiences, from the
blue cruisers of Snow Canyons to some dense gladed skiing through
Escapade Woods. And, by the way, the Canyons not only allows
snowboards but has built a terrain park. The Canyons, which
averages 325 inches of snow anually, is an easy 30-mile trek from a
national airport.
</P>
<P>
   Many skiers in the advanced range count Alta among their
favorite areas on Planet Ski. In terms of buff conditions and
service _ or even night life _ Alta is the alter ego of Deer
Valley. In fact, the infrastructure at Alta reminds one of a trip
back in time, and the grooming is barely noticeable. But the snow
is as near perfect as snow can be, and grooming matters little.
Alta is deep and steep, with natural chutes and bowls. It is for
good solid skiers who can do powder and broken snow skiing, or are
serious about learning them. This is the area where photos are shot
of skiers wearing bandanas over their mouths to keep them from
drowning in powder, or so the legend goes.
</P>
<P>
   The downside to Alta, aside from a lack of grooming and modern
lifts, is that snow is sometimes so abundant the road up Little
Cottonwood Canyon is inaccessible. Skiers put up with some
deprivation to ski Alta, but as Chris Holbrook puts it: ``All the
better to focus on what you go there for _ serious skiing.''

A RETURN TO WORLD WAR II SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Historic Tours, one of the companies that offer tours to World
War II battle sites, is planning tours on the 55th anniversary of
the D-Day invasion of France's Normandy Beach next year. Another
such company is Galaxy Tours, which has seen an increase in
inquiries about its World War II programs.
</P>
<P>
   Some 90 percent of Galaxy's tour participants are veterans, but
Hal Ryder, president of the company, said, ``In recent years, we
have had an increase in nephews of veterans; now the veterans are
calling, asking to take their grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   In Honolulu, perhaps the most famous symbol of the war's ending
is about to open to the public. The Battleship Missouri Memorial
will open Jan. 29 on the 55th anniversary of the ship's launch.
</P>
<P>
   While the Missouri didn't enter service until near the war's
end, it secured its place in history on Sept. 2, 1945, when on its
deck the Japanese signed surrender papers. During the war, it
served in the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa and also as the
flagship for Admiral William ``Bull'' Halsey.
</P>
<P>
   Some have criticized having the Missouri in Pearl Harbor across
from the Arizona Memorial, which honors the thousands of military
who died within the Arizona and other ships during the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. But the USS Missouri
Memorial Association, caretaker of the battleship, has pledged to
preserve the solemnity of the Arizona Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri will be placed with its bow pointing toward the
Arizona, and all activities will be focused around the midsection
of the Missouri to minimize noise distractions to the Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   When the Missouri opens to the public, visitors will be able to
view historical displays, including the horse saddle Halsey kept in
his quarters. The quarterdeck where the surrender took place will
not be altered, nor will it have interpretive signs _ visitors will
be left to contemplate the significance of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis Adventures in Hawaii is now taking reservations for
tours of the battleship. Tours begin at $12 for adults to $49 for a
deluxe tour that includes transportation from Waikiki, services of
a guide, and lunch. For information, call toll-free 877-644-4896.

   For information on visiting World War II sites in Europe, call
Historic Tours in New Jersey at 877-WW2-TOUR, or Galaxy Tours in

   Vacations used to mean escaping job stress and relaxing, but now
more and more Americans are using their vacation time to help
others. The number of volunteer vacationers has skyrocketed.
Cross-Cultural Solutions, a nonprofit organization that offers
short-term volunteer programs in India, is adding a Ghana program
for January. Volunteers will work for three weeks or more with
local social service programs in villages in the eastern plains of
Ghana, a region steeped in West Africa's vibrant traditional
culture. From fostering small-business programs for women to
teaching English in schools, volunteers can make substantial
contributions. Other areas of work include health care, the arts,
and recreation. No volunteer experience is necessary. The Ghana
program is $1,850 and covers all expenses. Air fare is additional.
The program fee and air fare are tax-deductible for US residents.

Calendar, with information on fairs, festivals, and special events.
There's an easy, quick reference guide for planning weekend
getaways. The calendar includes 12 watercolor illustrations by New
England artist Pat Ryan Perkins. Also available is a Southeastern
Lighthouse Calendar and Mid-Atlantic Weekenders Calendar. Each
calendar is $12.95, and all are available in stores or from Kanin
Press, PO Box 1174, Portsmouth, NH 03802 (add $5 for shipping and

VISITING ST. BENEDICT'S BASEMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SUBIACO, Italy _ If the guy had stayed underground, well ....
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says Brother John with a chuckle, ``if he had, I
wonder where ... where, indeed, would we be now?''
</P>
<P>
   Tall and good-humored, a gray-haired man in a long black robe,
Brother John O'Shannassy, a Benedictine monk from Australia, has
lived in this monastery called Santuario Sacro Speco (Sanctuary of
the Holy Grotto) on a rugged Subiaco mountainside for half his
life, 35 years. He knows his life would have been very different if
the man in the cave _ St. Benedict _ had remained there as a hermit
instead of taking his faith on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Not only Brother John's life. Once Benedict, who lived in these
parts between 480 and 527, eventually to be canonized, went public
early in the 6th century, he began making the rules of prayer,
study, and work for an austere monastic vocation. After he
established 13 monasteries in Italy, housing 12 monks apiece, a
long Christian clerical line _ the heavenly blues brothers? _ began
marching through the centuries. Other orders followed the
Benedictine example, a franchise chain effect. Although there were
monks scattered out and about, before Benedict, he was the first to
organize them. A sort of beatified Jimmy Hoffa?
</P>
<P>
   My interest in the Benedictines began a few years ago, since a
tolerantly operated monastery, Christ in the Desert at Abique,
N.M., allowed me (of undetermined faith) to spend time there,
recharging neural batteries as a room-and-boarder. The boss, Abbot
Philip, suggested, ``The next time you're in Rome you ought to
drive out to Subiaco. Although our principal monastery is farther
north at Monte Cassino, Subiaco's where it all got started.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Benedict went underground?
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly. To get away from it all in his remote cave, meditate,
and pray in severe solitude. But God had other plans for him after
three years of that. He wasn't meant to be a career hermit.''
</P>
<P>
   That remark brought to mind Brother Aquinas, who had been the
contented house hermit at Christ in the Desert. Living by himself
in a hut in the Chama Canyon wildernesss over the river from the
monastery, he used to row across to show up for early morning Mass,
a hooded figure departing as quietly as he arrived. But Aquinas, a
computer pro as a civilian, is now wired to the world at his
keyboard station in Santa Fe, helping design Web sites, a source of
monastery income. ``God's will at the moment,'' is his belief. He
has even been bustled off to Rome to advise the Vatican on webbery.
</P>
<P>
   The story amuses Brother John: ``There are no computers in our
life here, thank God. Yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes about 90 minutes to make the pleasant journey by auto,
southeast from Rome through low green hills. Somehow we got lost.
But in the village of Roviano a jovial, toothless old woman
identifying herself as Signora Salvatore stopped weeding her garden
long enough to give directions in Italian that we could understand.
Down a rutted lane, through olive groves, until the main highway
reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Passing one of Roman Emperor Nero's villas, left as rubble by a
long-ago ``terremoto'' (earthquake), we entered the town of
Subiaco, went over the arching San Francesco stone bridge where
fisherman lazed, then uphill, through a marble arch and into church
property. Immediately prominent was the five-story bell tower of
Santa Scholastica, an 11th-century abbey named for Benedict's
sister, and distinguished by a beautifully walled and columned
cloister.
</P>
<P>
   The car stops here, at the foot of a steep beige brick stairway
through clusters of oaks to Sacro Speco _ the faded brick church
and monastery _ scrunched against a limestone cliff, and hanging
over a narrow, deep gorge in the Simbruini Mountains. A masterpiece
of plucky, keep-the-faith medieval construction, it is a monument
to Benedict's memory and his youthful spelunking.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily we encountered Brother John because the other half-dozen
monks, friendly enough, speak only Italian for which neither my
friends, Aurelio and Sampson, nor I am prepared beyond the usual
how-do-you-do's and the weather.
</P>
<P>
   As he shows us around the 14th century church, and a passageway
that skirts it _ up pops the devil: a fresco confronting anyone
using the passage. ``The message is,'' John says with a smile, ``if
you avoid the chapel and Mass, you go to the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedict's basement, of course, is the main attraction, the
grotto that was the solitary residence of the subterranean saint.
Down, down winds the stairway below the main church. Down through
anterooms, the lower church, and St. Gregory's Chapel. And down
some some more to rock bottom. Illuminating the way are Biblical
mosaics and frescoes. The prize is a life-sized (hardly 5 feet)
portrait of St. Francis, done in 1223, the only one known to be
painted while he lived. Francis supposedly performed a miracle
here, inducing roses to grow on thornbushes where Benedict threw
himself to atone for almost succumbing to a physical temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bill Clinton should try that in the White House rose
garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Francis's roses come out in our garden every year,'' says
John, ``but you won't be excommunicated if you don't believe the
story.'' He points to a nativity scene. ``Doesn't Joseph look sad?
Must be the rising cost of living and another mouth to feed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, on another wall, St. Lawrence's face is pinched in a
viselike headgear _ ``doing penance'' is the explanation _ that
looks like earphones. ``Maybe listening to a Bach Mass?'' says
Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   The naturally jagged ceiling of the grotto seems a bank of low,
heavy clouds. Seated within the roughly-walled gray chamber is
Benedict in snowy marble contemplating a cross and a wicker basket
of the same stone.
</P>
<P>
   John explains, ``A monk named Romanus kept him alive by lowering
food in a basket through an opening in the ground. Pretty sparse
fare most of the time probably. I doubt that it was ever tasty
pasta, lasagna, or prosciutto.''
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio responds, ``I don't think saints in caves ever had to
watch their waistlines.''

TO AN EXECUTIONER, KILLING WAS PART OF THE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BEN BRADLEE JR.  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa _ Eugene de Kock was apartheid's
chief executioner, licensed to kill as the commander of an elite
death squad and terrorist unit based at Vlakplaas, a farm outside
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``Prime Evil'' by compatriots because of his lust for
violence, de Kock was once the most decorated member of the South
African Security Police. Before arriving at Vlakplaas in 1985, he
was a commando in the bush war against Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. He
led the team that bombed the African National Congress's London
office in 1982 and commanded Pretoria's most notorious
counterinsurgency unit in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, following a 21-month trial, de Kock was found guilty of
89 crimes, including six murders, one attempted murder, two counts
of conspiracy to commit murder, and 66 counts of fraud. He was
sentenced to 212 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is hoping to be freed, or face a greatly reduced
sentence, by applying for amnesty to the country's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission. The commission just finished a 2
1/2-year investigation into crimes of the apartheid era, but its
amnesty committee continues its work. It has the power to free
those it finds have testified truthfully about politically
motivated crimes.
</P>
<P>
   De Kock's amnesty application consumes 4,000 pages and covers
more than 120 ``incidents'' in which he was involved. Some
investigators have linked him and his men to well over 100
killings, but de Kock says the figure is closer to 65.
</P>
<P>
   In his trial, and in testimony at various amnesty hearings of
the Truth Commission, the 49-year-old de Kock has emerged as the
foremost symbol of the horrific excesses of the white-minority
regime. Wearing glasses with thick lenses, his straight dark hair
plastered on his head, de Kock speaks in a monotone that belies the
dastardly deeds he recounts.
</P>
<P>
   Among his sensational disclosures: naming more than 20 senior
military and police officials, and former presidents P.W. Botha and
F.W. de Klerk, all of whom he asserted either ordered or approved
of his operations.
</P>
<P>
   De Kock's defense that he was following orders echoes arguments
made by Nazi war criminals in Nuremberg, and even by American
soldiers at the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, which have been
rejected by the world community.
</P>
<P>
   But since the end of his trial, de Kock seems to have succeeded
in changing the initial perception of him as the psychopathic devil
incarnate. Now, even many blacks see him more as a sympathetic fall
guy.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the shifting emotions about de Kock first surfaced
last year during a memorable amnesty hearing at a community center
in Port Elizabeth, an industrial city on the Indian Ocean that had
been a flashpoint in the anti-apartheid resistance.
</P>
<P>
   In a potentially incendiary setting, de Kock appeared before
hundreds of people amid tight security. But then a strange thing
happened. After listening to de Kock describe how he had committed
murder and mayhem on orders from those who had now abandoned him,
the crowd burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were hearing the truth articulated for the first time
and it was like a breath of fresh air,'' said Dumisa Ntsebeza, a
commission member who served as head of the panel's investigative
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Added Denzil Potgieter, a mixed-race member of the commission
who sits on the amnesty committee that will pass judgment on de
Kock: ``He's been a very popular figure whenever he appears. He's
gotten applause and had people eating out of his hand. I would have
thought it unthinkable that people would not have wanted to kill
him on sight, so it's been quite amazing to see this reception.''
</P>
<P>
   In its final report issued in late October, the Truth Commission
praised de Kock for being the prod that forced other members of the
security forces to come forward and tell their stories in hope of
obtaining amnesty. ``The ironic truth is that what brought them to
the commission was the fullness of the disclosures made by an
individual often painted as the archvillian of the apartheid era _
Mr. Eugene de Kock,'' the report said. ``Whatever his motives, the
commission acknowledges that it was largely he who broke the code
of silence.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   De Kock, who stuttered as a child, was raised in the
Johannesburg suburb of Brits, the son of an ardent nationalist who
was a court magistrate. He was taught by his father and others that
``We were at war. We were taught that the man who shoots first will
win,'' he once testified. ``Shoot second and you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In court and before the commission, de Kock has described in
vivid detail some of the killings he carried out in his 15 years in
the security forces. He once helped murder a suspected informer
with a shovel, another with a pool cue; others he suffocated with
the inner-tubes of tires.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1988 incident, de Kock said he and a team of operatives
waited in ambush for a group of Pan Africanist Congress fighters to
cross the border into South Africa from Swaziland. When a van
appeared carrying those he assumed were the targets, de Kock
emptied his Uzi at the car, killing a man and two women, each of
whom was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   A third woman, who survived the initial flurry but was wounded
and begging for her life, was finished off on the spot. But de Kock
and his team soon realized the wrong people had been shot. So they
returned to the same spot several nights later and killed four
more.
</P>
<P>
   De Kock said he and his men used James Bond-like gadgets such as
booby-trapped bombs hidden in radios, tape recorders, or pens, and
mailed the devices to ANC targets living in exile in neighboring
countries. Once they tested a booby-trapped set of earphones by
blowing off the head of a pig before sending another pair to an ANC
lawyer, who was decapitated by the exploding earphones.
</P>
<P>
   De Kock maintained he wasn't all bad. Describing a raid into
Lesotho in which he and his men killed a dozen ANC exiles, he told
how an infant belonging to a slain woman and her husband had
survived the attack. De Kock scooped up the baby boy, placed him in
an adjoining room, and called the police to have the child picked
up.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't all darkness and death at Vlakplaas, either. There
were also memorable braais, or barbecues, in which de Kock and his
men would unwind, get raunchy, and drink until they retched. ``We
had only the best at Vlakplaas,'' de Kock said, referring to the
liquor they consumed.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of Vlakplaas was exposed in 1989, but it was not
disbanded by President de Klerk until 1993. De Kock rails against
de Klerk: ``I regard him as one of the greatest cowards the country
has ever produced,'' he said at his trial. ``He sold out certain
members of the security forces to the ANC.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, referring to President Botha as well, de Kock added:
``They want to eat lamb, but they don't want to see the blood and
guts.''
</P>
<P>
   De Kock was arrested in 1994 as he tried to flee South Africa
for Portugal, where his wife and children were waiting for him. He
had sold his house, was carrying phony passports, and had already
opened several Swiss bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In his application for amnesty, de Kock wrote: ``I am not a
psychopath, but merely a product of a certain kind of ... training
I received, which was mainly of a military nature, and which
flourished and developed in the apartheid milieu in which I found
myself at that time.''

D.C.'S NEW MAYOR: HE'S NO BARRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his natty gray suit and signature bow tie,
Anthony A. Williams is as politely buttoned-up as they come,
distinctly and almost purposefully out of place in the rough and
tumble of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the last week of his campaign here for mayor, he still
appeared uncomfortable in the role of political supplicant. ``I
need your support,'' he would mumble in a barely audible voice,
stiffly working the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   But they loved him anyway. They loved him because he is
unpolished, because he is as straight as the pinstripes in his
suit, because he is entirely lacking in the charisma and
flamboyance that sustained his predecessor, Marion Barry, through
years of political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 47, is the un-Barry mayor-elect, a Harvard-trained
African-American lawyer and policy wonk, Washington's new hope for
a city that wants to regain the power to govern itself. With the
defeat of Senator Lauch Faircloth, a North Carolina Republican and
staunch opponent of home rule for Washington, political observers
say it is a realistic hope.
</P>
<P>
   Williams joins the growing ranks of a new generation of young,
highly educated, big city black mayors with a conservative edge
that includes Dennis Archer of Detroit, William Campbell of
Atlanta, and Michael R. White of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was propelled to victory in all 140 voting precincts
over moderate Republican Carol Schwartz by collective exasperation
with potholes that aren't filled, schools that don't teach, and
police who don't patrol.
</P>
<P>
   But ironically, Williams &UR;  &LR;  was elected despite a shift in power
away from blacks, who lost their majority on the city council for
the first time. The black population has fallen by 20 percent in
the past decade, and now makes up only 60 percent of the District,
while white, Hispanic, and Asian populations are all rising.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's election marks the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
   Barry, who bowed out of the election after 16 years as mayor,
inspired enormous pride in the District, championing home rule,
thumbing his nose at a Republican Congress he believed to be racist
and dictatorial. He is credited with having opened local government
to disfranchised blacks for the first time, enlarging the middle
class, caring for the elderly and, at one time anyway, expanding
city services.
</P>
<P>
   But his is a mixed legacy. Known for his arrest while smoking
crack, his racially divisive rhetoric, and political rehabilitation
as a sinner redeemed, Barry also shamed the city. It was on his
watch that the District hit an all-time low two years ago with
hemorrhaging budgets and a dysfunctional bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up, Congress reduced Barry's role to one of ceremonial
ribbon-cutter, canceling his budgetary powers and creating a
financial control board _ with Williams as its chief financial
officer _ to manage the District.
</P>
<P>
   Williams quickly did what many thought was impossible: He reined
in spending, cleaned house, and put tax collectors to work. This
year, he returned a $184 million surplus, scoring big points with
Congress _ and District voters, who began a movement to draft him
into the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been more enthused about Tony than any other candidate
since 1968,'' said Max N. Berry, a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected the newcomer tarred with the label of
``carpetbagger'' for recently moving into the district to beat the
home-grown politicians who had been waiting in the wings for years
to run when Barry stepped down. But, in a late entry into the
primary, Williams pulled a major upset by defeating six candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my job, they didn't,'' was his mantra.
</P>
<P>
   Williams grew up in Los Angeles, the child of Postal Service
workers. Adopted at the age of 4, friends say he flourished with
the nurturing of his hard-working parents. He is an avid
birdwatcher and outdoorsman with his wife, Diane, and their
daughter, Asantewa, 24.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, where he worked for the city on affordable housing
after graduating from Harvard, his co-worker, John Huggins, said
Williams was known for his humor, brains, and devotion to serving
low-income communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a visionary,'' said Huggins. ``He doesn't just see the
bricks and mortar, he sees the buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has three Ivy League degrees and is an experienced
public servant, having worked as executive director of the St.
Louis Community Development Agency, deputy state comptroller of
Connecticut, and chief financial officer of the US Agriculture
Department before running the control board. But does he have what
it takes to be more than a bean-counter?
</P>
<P>
   ``His vision is evolving. In some areas it's clear, but in
others he still needs work,'' said outgoing Mayor Barry. ``He is
going to have to get some charisma or he won't be around for long.
Also, courage and perseverance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams already has displayed his mettle with the control
board, doing what Barry never could, including firing city workers.
He didn't, however, help his cause by having police escort the
employees from their desks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't just be a technocrat mayor,'' noted Tom Sherwood,
author of ``Dream City,'' a Washington political history.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers point out that the District still has no
full congressional representation or control over its own budget
and judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some real worries that he becomes the greatest colonial
governor ever,'' said Mark Plotkin, a political commentator on
Washington public radio. ``He's so accommodating and savvy about
knowing what the masters want in Congress ... that he doesn't fight
for what we want: an expansion of home rule.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Williams is counting on his good relations with the
Republican Congress to further the cause as he tries to turn the
city around.
</P>
<P>
   He has pledged to unite the city as he pushes for economic
development by streamlining and improving government services, the
tax code, and public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody in City Hall told Tony he could get anything done,
make any idea a success, if he learned to think Irish,'' remembered
Stephen Coyle, Williams's boss at the Boston Redevelopment
Authority. ``Maybe that's what Boston gave him, the appetite and
capacity to resolve community problems, and this long and secret
journey of his to learn to think Irish.''

MIT WIRES YOUTHS FOR ACTION, WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It's a tough job, trying to create the
future.
</P>
<P>
   You have to do things like ride a small boat through flooded
villages in Bangladesh. Or get pulled off a train by authorities in
China, who confiscate your software because they're suspicious of
what it might contain. Or even have your equipment blown up by
terrorists when they bomb a US embassy in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at MIT's Media Lab thought such efforts were worth it,
though. In the most ambitious undertaking of its kind, they have
connected 3,000 10- to 16-year-olds around the world _ some in
remote areas that had not even been wired for telephones before _
through a specialized computer network.
</P>
<P>
   The objectives, said Media Lab officials, were as ambitious as
the logistics: to promote international dialogue, develop ideas for
advancing technology, and, in incremental but demonstrable ways,
instigate programs that could change the world. Most pointedly, the
idea was to aim at those targets by empowering young people through
computers, especially in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The yearlong endeavor will culminate with a week of meetings at
MIT of about 90 participants, elected electronically by their
peers, beginning Sunday, Nov.15. They will discuss their results;
learn additional computer skills and other methods to pursue their
individual interests; and share their views with representatives of
various governments, educational institutions, and high-tech
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is for this to be a wedge,'' said Justine Cassell,
assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and director of the Media Lab's multimillion-dollar Junior Summit
project. ``We obviously can't reach every kid in every country ...
but the participants can, and already have, moved this into their
communities and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pune, India, for instance, 14-year-old Pooja Girish Aphale
used her international e-mail link to solicit ideas on how to
improve the lives of poverty-stricken ``rag pickers.'' Then she
started several local drives to get food and medicine to these poor
Indians, who derive their nickname from their search for food and
other necessities on trash-collection days in affluent
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Luca Avadani, a Bucharest, Romania, resident who was accepted
into the Junior Summit even though he is only 9, has a more global
and long-range pursuit. He has been working, along with his fellow
students on-line, to put together a proposal and solicit funding
for a Children's World Bank that would subsidize nutrition,
education, and other programs intended for kids.
</P>
<P>
   On a loftier level, sponsors said they hoped to starkly
illustrate how computers are causing national borders to blur, and
perhaps accelerate their disintegration by promoting dialogue among
disparate young people for whom this relatively new technology will
be an integral fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   Like most technology researchers, the MIT officials point out
that children are rarely brought into the creative process on
computer use or development, even though they are widely believed
to have a natural affinity that allows them to think in innovative
ways. Furthermore, the officials believe too little basic research
has been done into children's use of computers or into their
long-term effects, so both those issues are being tracked by
Cassell and her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the first digital generation, I believe we kids have a
lot to offer and show the world,'' Eduardo de Oliveira Rodrigues
Neto, a 15-year-old participant from Brazil, wrote in an e-mail
interview with the Globe last week. ``We are the base of the
future, it is today's kids that is going to shape tomorrow's
future. Our knowledge and experience will be crucial to further
development inside the informatics field.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating a process through which the participants could make
contact proved a daunting task in itself, but it has already led to
significant technological achievements. To begin with, not all the
nations' phone lines could handle the data flow for Internet
access, so a ``common denominator'' e-mail system was devised that
gives everyone a high-speed way to stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most important breakthrough, however, has been a
translation system by which participants can type messages in their
native languages, send them, and have them converted
automatically &UR;  &LR; into one of five languages (Chinese, Spanish,
French, English, or Portuguese) within 10 seconds. MIT officials
said the overwhelming majority of users know at least one of those
languages, but multilingual participants sometimes have to help
those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the officials said, more than 25,000 e-mail messages
have been transmitted during the life of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has been able to crack the multi-language,
multicultural barrier like this before,'' said Annette Tonti, a
business consultant hired by the Media Lab to be executive producer
of the Youth Summit. ``Having a kid from China talking to someone
speaking Hindi in Bangladesh is pretty powerful ... and it
obviously has potential applications of all sorts.''
</P>
<P>
   While Tonti hailed the project for its pure research component,
as well as for its potential in furthering cross-cultural
communication, she also made it clear that she foresees rapid
applications in the business world. Indeed, she said she plans to
advise clients on how they can create better international
communications systems _ particularly by employing the Media Lab's
innovative translation technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Junior Summit was the brainchild of Isao Okawa, chairman of
the CSK Corp. in Japan, the parent company of Sega Enterprises Ltd.
Asserting that children's views about technology had not been
sufficiently considered, he launched a small-scale project in 1995
that ended with 41 kids from around the world meeting in Tokyo that
November.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, he asked Nicholas Negroponte, Media Lab director, to
embark on a far more ambitious effort, which Okawa's firm and
several others have helped to fund. Applications went out to
educational, governmental, and service organizations that deal with
children; by November, 8,000 responses had come in from 139
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell said entries were judged on the basis of such criteria
as ``passion'' and ``strength of ideas,'' but not access to
computers. So 67 computers had to be shipped or hand-carried to
places where there were none at local schools or other
institutions, and other necessities like telephone lines had to be
arranged; at one site in rural China, a satellite phone was
provided because land lines were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   While only 1,000 entries were accepted, that translated into
3,000 participants because some applications included several
friends or classmates. Moreover, all the computers in the system
were placed in schools or other community buildings, rather than
homes, so that other students and residents could use them or
contribute to the international dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Adult facilitators were provided, along with guidance on
discussion topics and technical questions, but the participants
were assured that all their communication would be confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have learnt the real meaning of sharing and caring,''
wrote Aphale, the Indian girl, in response to an e-mail asking what
she had learned from the project. ``I did not just send messages
and receive them, but I exchanged heartfelt ideas and feelings. The
Junior Summit is like a global family and not just usage of
advanced technology.''

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: TRACKS 
Bruce Springsteen 
Columbia 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boxed sets flood the market every fall, with new ones coming out
seemingly every week. But none tells more about the inner workings
of an artist than ``Bruce Springsteen: Tracks,'' already being
called the Holy Grail of boxed sets. It's easy to see why, because
it boasts a staggering 56 previously unreleased songs that track
Springsteen from a cocky Bob Dylan acolyte to a mature,
self-realized artist with an acute ear for promises broken and
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   What's apparent is that Springsteen left more good songs off his
studio albums than most composers write in their entire recording
careers. No wonder he's agonized so much over his albums. He's had
to make hard choices in deleting some absolute gems, which are
finally collected in this project. Sure, there are some songs that
should have been left in the vaults _ but most will be an
ear-opening experience for anyone with the faintest love of the
prolific poet-rocker from the New Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
   The box, released Tuesday (11/10) with a suggested price of
$69.98, charts Springsteen's vast improvement as a singer and
composer. The third and fourth CDs (containing music from his
``Born in the U.S.A.'' period up to today) especially show a
remarkable consistency. The first two CDs are spotty, featuring a
lot of bar-band filler that simply points the compass to where he
was going. The last two more than make up for any lost time.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen has been accused of not rocking enough in the '90s,
of being too reflective, but that image is smashed by such
previously unreleased '90s tunes as ``Leaving Train'' (which sounds
like Steppenwolf meets Pearl Jam) and the blazing ``Seven Angels,''
with slashing electric guitar courtesy of Springsteen himself.
</P>
<P>
   The reflective side is covered as well, on '90s standouts such
as ``Lover Man'' (about a romantic reconciliation told through a
woman's eyes), ``Loose Change'' (about the aftermath of a one-night
stand with a woman in a ``friendly bar''), and the poignant
``Brothers Under a Bridge,'' about a group of scarred Vietnam
veterans who live as exiles in the California mountains.
</P>
<P>
   This last song was a feature of Springsteen's ``Tom Joad'' tour
of two years ago. It shows how Springsteen has tinkered with and
updated his own work through his 25-year career. There's another
previously unreleased song with the tellingly similar title of
``Brothers Under the Bridges,'' from 1983. It also centers on a
group of castoffs drinking beer and wine under bridges _ but the
Vietnam angle, and the deeper focus, were added later.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, this box shows Springsteen borrowing from
himself to craft something better later on. An early tune,
``Seaside Bar Song'' from 1971, has the line ``The highway is alive
tonight,'' which later turned up on the epic ``Born to Run.'' The
early piano ballad ``Iceman'' has a verse that later was folded
into ``Badlands'': ``I wanna go out tonight/I wanna find out what I
got.''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen has been finding that out ever since his solo
audition for Columbia's legendary talent spotter, John Hammond, in
1971. That audition was taped and appears here for the first time.
A nervous but not-to-be-denied Springsteen barrels through his
colorful story songs ``Mary Queen of Scots'' (``I'm just a lonely
acrobat, the live wire is my trade''), ``It's Hard to Be a Saint in
the City'' (where he manages to rhyme, however awkwardly, the words
cobra, Casanova, and supernova), and the fast-paced ``Growin' Up,''
with the marauding line ``The flag of piracy flew from my mast.''
It was youthful, brash, at times brilliant, and enough to get him
signed.
</P>
<P>
   This first CD in the box, though, has a high cringe factor as
well. Springsteen's folk-rock bravado, and his rock-and-classic-R&AMP;B
elements, are in place, but his voice warbles on a number of tracks
and there are some embarrassing lines like the unctuous ``Ooh, ooh,
ooh, I want to rendezvous!'' and ``You got to tell the girl you
need her _ you got to give her a great big kiss!'' Still, the
innocence is endearing.
</P>
<P>
   The second CD is much better. It consists of the unreleased
album Springsteen made around the time of ``The River,'' in 1980.
His songcraft is deepening, as in the bittersweet ``A Good Man Is
Hard to Find,'' about a forlorn Pittsburgh woman; and ``Stolen
Car,'' about a dreamer whose love is squashed, whereupon he takes
to _ where else? _ the highway. It's the pop-music equivalent of
John Updike's ``Rabbit, Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Then comes some priceless material left off the 12
million-selling ``Born in the U.S.A.'' album (1984). There's an
acoustic title song that is a long way from the anthemic version
finally released. And there are hard-rocking, treasure-trove songs
showcasing the E Street Band, such as ``Johnny Bye-Bye'' (about
Elvis Presley being found ``slumped up against the drain with a
whole lot of trouble running through his veins''), ``Cynthia'' (a
flat-out song of female admiration), ``Frankie'' (about spending a
night at the drive-in with his lover), and ``TV Movie,'' in which
he laughs about someone wanting ``to make a TV movie out of me''
(it has a cynicism about the media that would show up later on ``57
Channels'').
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen's ability to limn small-town dreams is vividly
portrayed in 1983's ``Car Wash,'' about about a woman who works at
one and dreams of a million-dollar recording contract. And his own
dreams are nurtured in 1987's ``The Wish,'' a deeply personal song
about Springsteen's mother buying him his first guitar (``a
Japanese guitar'') as a Christmas present.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen's E Street Band has been a memory for a decade now
(though there's talk of a reunion tour next summer), but what most
surprises on the boxed set is the quality of Springsteen's nearly
one-man-band, previously unissued studio songs in the '90s. He adds
E Street synth-keyboardist Roy Bittan and late drummer Jeff Porcaro
to some tracks, but he's solo on others, such as the brilliant
``Going Cali,'' about a man who heads to the West Coast only to
meet a woman in a California desert bar and have a son with her.
It's typical of how much Springsteen respects the ever-changing,
ever-unpredictable side of human nature. It remains an essential
cornerstone of his art, as this must-have boxed set affirms.

WINTER WHITES ARE BACK FOR SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ During the fall season, Ralph Lauren's winter whites
didn't even make it to the selling floor, according to Mary
Hamilton, the boss lady at the San Francisco Polo Store.
</P>
<P>
   All those luxurious seven-ply hooded sweaters and elegant creamy
cargo pants were pre-sold. So it's a sure thing that the women who
bought them will absolutely love the paper-white pieces in Ralph's
new spring collection, which are basically the same stuff _
beautifully tailored cargo pants, T-shirts, military short jackets
_ done up in lighter, airier, season-appropriate fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren showed his collection in SoHo last week in a warehouse
kitted out all in black with padded, flax-linen benches for the
press and friends. It got people in the mood to see more pared-down
neutrals that are so easy on the eye and easy on the body. The
flax-colored linen skirts rippled away from the body, topped with
loosey-goosey tunics in the same hues but contrasting textures.
Linen herringbone pants, readaptations of last season's hipster
pants (some cargo pantss, some not) were worn with no belts.
</P>
<P>
   Then the color arrived. Bubble-gum pinks, lily-of-the-valley
leaf greens, vivid purple, marigold yellow, all worn with a
brightened up Army-issue green, which Ralph calls olive. Olive
cashmere and silk shells, silk tanks, cashmere hooded tops and a
ubiquitous poncho (the only misstep in the collection), which had
some hardened New Yorkers hooting at the thought of flipping on a
cashmere poncho. It probably would feel divine.
</P>
<P>
   This is a mistake-proof collection of wearable clothes with a
few outstanding pieces: the fabulous gray strapless cashmere dress
from the fall collection (the one that was photographed right and
left and cost $15,000) was redone in floaty, sheer, creamy-white
organza for spring; an ivory silk faille anorak worn over a white
silk roll-neck sweater and silk faille pants; a skimpy,
cling-to-the-body front-zip ``hoodie'' worn over an ivory cotton
gabardine skimmer dress and another hooded sweater, all done up in
candy-pink cashmere. Delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kors, meanwhile, like Ralph, specializes in the American
uniform _ sportswear that is adaptable and collectible. However,
Kors' collection was tightly focused and limited to a few signature
pieces: classic Bermuda shorts (narrow, like a pair of pipe-stems
cut off to knee length), the camp shirt, the figure-loving sheath
and the anorak. What he did with them, however, was far from
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Kors saves his best ideas for Celine, his pricey
French line, but here, he has translated some of the popular
qualities that have revived that house. For instance, the
juxtaposition of luxurious material with sportif shapes. He paired
a long white cashmere ``pull'' with a graphic, giraffe-printed calf
skirt and then turned the black undershirt into an accent piece
above a deep chocolate-mahogany pailette skirt. The prettiest
outfit? Another glitzy skirt of marble cream pailettes worn with a
heather gray cashmere undershirt.
</P>
<P>
   His pants were, in the main, rip-stop taffeta, which works up
like parachute nylon but has a luxuriously shimmery finish. One of
featured items was a black silk rip-stop taffeta anorak, worn like
a short, flippy dress on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Kors' collection was deceptively simple _ his color palette was
playful and serious at the same time _ for instance, orange with
olive (a lot of olive), stone worn with white (the anorak done up
in stone suede is a real keeper) and a few pieces in cinnabar for
variation, like the anorak worn with silk hopsack shorts that could
go to lunch anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Turning from well-tailored casual to the glitz of Hollywood, old
and new ... namely, Bob Mackie, who is back with a very Texas
collection _ Easter egg colors weighted with beading and floating
panels of chiffon _ and Kevan Hall, who has created one of the most
beautiful collections seen thus far for Halston.
</P>
<P>
   The black-and-white Halston showroom was lined with a double row
of chairs on each side and populated with fans who gave Hall a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does appreciative applause break out in the middle of a
show, but it did at Halston, where a classic white cotton man's
shirt atop a long platinum beaded skirt got gasps and claps. (One
wonders if Hall saw Sharon Stone at the Oscars in one of her
husband's white dress shirts and a lavender Vera Wang sarong?) The
collection started out with the sexy, clingy, bias-cut gowns that
the original Halston was so famous for. Matte jersey or cashmere
was shaped as if it had been created on the body to begin with.
With a color palette inspired by coral reef hues, Hall featured
aqua, shark (his name for the platinum), sand, coral (which was
ginger rather than orangey pink), black and white.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the dresses had laser-cut holes in them and were so
tight that only women _ like Ashley Judd, say _ with a penchant for
no underwear would be very comfortable wearing them. With the
exception of one slinky white job with teensy stars slicing through
to the skin, the idea didn't fly. It looked like a moth on speed
had gotten to the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   What did work were the show-stopping pave-sequin dresses and the
gowns strewn with luminous abalone pieces. A silver-satin evening
suit _ with a tube top so encrusted with abalone that it looked
like an abandoned wreck as seen underwater _ was an original spin
on gussied-up sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   Hall has definitely turned up the heat for Halston with one
sizzling bunch of neoclassic, collectible dresses.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wish I could say the same for Bob Mackie. His Vegas roots need a
touch-up. Some of his clothes were so predictable, they made
glitter look tired. A few dresses were a breath of fresh air: The
sexiest in the line is a little Marie Antoinette number with not a
sequin, rhinestone or bugle bead in sight. Instead, it is a
magnificent celadon faille gown with a flowered, brocaded corselet
bodice cut so low, I heard one woman say: ``No wonder they got in
so much trouble in 18th century France _ the neckline dumped their
poitrines right into the soup.''
</P>
<P>
   The black-and-white group looked best, with a flippy little
cocktail number _ black chiffon skirt with sewn-down hip pleats and
flouncy hem topped with a black-and-white beaded bodice _ scoring
the most points.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Mackie does tend to go off the deep end. A gray
chiffon off-the-shoulder top looks like it came right off the back
of Ann Panagulias when she sang ``Lulu'' 10 years ago. Mackie
adapted the Act I ``pierrot'' costume for commercial consumption,
pairing it with jeweled silver lace pants. Very Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the entire first row of a prominent section at the
smallish Forum venue was taken up with Neiman Marcus buyers direct
from Texas. One of them _ all blond hair, teeth, headband and sable
coat _ never got off her cell phone. But then, nobody ever said you
can't be chic and gauche at the same time.

HOW THE ENGLISH FELL FOR AUTUMN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why is fall the only season we have two different words for?''
a friend asked recently. Good question, and whatever the answer, we
know this one can't be blamed on journalists: Fall may be a better
headline word than autumn, offering both brevity and punnability,
but both terms were around long before newspaper editors got their
grubby hands on them.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to put the question might be, Why don't we have two
words for every season? Given the mixed parentage of English, it
would be no surprise if the Norman conquerors had brought their Old
French versions of the other three seasons along with autompne (as
it was spelled then), just as they brought liberty and marriage to
a language that already had freedom and wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, though, if the English refused to Frenchify their winter,
spring, and summer, they seem to have embraced autumn warmly.
Chaucer uses autumn in 1374, but the Oxford English Dictionary
doesn't have an example of fall used to describe a season till 1545
_ and even then, it's still a phrase, faule of the leafe, rather
than a single word.
</P>
<P>
   Fall itself was, of course, an English word before the Norman
Conquest, and if it wasn't used to describe autumn in the years
before 1066, another word must have been current _ perhaps one that
proved less appealing to the Anglo-Saxon ear than the newly
imported autumn. (I'm hoping some generous medievalist will e-mail
with the answer.) In any case, the two words flourished side by
side for more than 400 years _ and then, on the way to the 20th
century, a funny thing befell fall.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bill Bryson, author of ``The Mother Tongue,''
England suddenly fell out of love with fall in the late 19th
century. Americans went on using it, but as autumn came to dominate
in England, the Brits forgot that fall had ever been their word,
and began to think of it yet another crude American aberration.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a letter to The Guardian in London, asking the same
question my friend posed, puts it this way: ``Why does autumn have
a separate American name, while the other three seasons don't?''
And a writer to The Financial Times, also in London, despairs at
finding the phrase ``later this fall'' in the London-based
newspaper: ``Later this what?'' he demands. ``Britain may be about
to surrender what's left of her democracy and independence, but to
see our version of the English language entering the autumn of its
days is sad indeed.'' After such an energetic display of ignorance,
it's surprising _ well, a little _ to find this linguistic
doomsayer identifying himself as the editor of a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, poor fall. Admitted only reluctantly into its native land,
thrown overboard a few centuries later in favor of a French
arriviste, then dismissed as a colonial vulgarism. Now that is sad
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Invitation to a hanging
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Diana Lamb of Brewster for letting us know _ just in
time for the holidays _ that festoon is no mere synonym for
decorate, but has a specific meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb objected to a writer's description of a poster festooning a
wall: ``Festoon means `to hang or form a decorative chain or strip
in a curve between two points,' she writes, as in preparation for a
festive event. The dictionaries at hand concur, though they do
mention one less cheerful definition: In dentistry, festoon
describes the curve of the gum around the neck of the tooth.) So
festoon the halls with swags of greenery _ there's another word
with the same curvy connotations _ but stick to push-pinning when
it comes to posters.
</P>
<P>
   Another usage misdemeanor, this one in an advertisement, was
noted by Hal Appleton of Watertown: ``Without a family portrait, it
wasn't just their mantle that was empty,'' reads the copy. The
shelf in question _ the one above the fireplace _ is usually
spelled mantel. In the hierarchy of language crimes, this one ranks
low because mantle, meaning cloak and a host of other things, and
mantel, the fireplace ledge, are not truly different words, just
variant spellings. But most of the people who hang their stockings
by the chimney next month will hang them from the mantel. Santa may
or may not be checking his list for spelling errors, but cautious
celebrants should probably stick with the mantel majority.

LESSONS FROM GLENN'S MISSION -- AND ECHOES OF THE BIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
 &HT;    
 (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York Times
Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative CONNIE
WHITE in Kansas City at (800) 444-0267 or (816) 822-8448, or fax

 &HT;    
 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    John Glenn has proven, once again, that he is capable of
extraordinary feats. In humble fashion he explained his recent trip
into space as a giant step for geriatric science.
 &HT;    Through his experiments aboard Discovery, scientists will gain a
better understanding of what happens to the body in zero gravity
and, hopefully, the results will provide a better understanding of
the aging process.
 &HT;    As a larger segment of society grows older, such geriatric
studies are increasingly needed.
 &HT;    In Judaism there is a proverb, ``As men age, their opinions
change.'' (Talmud Shabbat 152). For example, we have seen the
former president, George Bush, fulfill his wish to skydive. Glenn
got his wish to skydive in the other direction, upward into space.
 &HT;    These men, who have achieved stability and greatness,
nevertheless are still looking for challenges. Their opinions about
fulfillment change regularly.
 &HT;    One of the most important lessons we can learn from the Glenn
space mission is how to maintain integrity yet still get along with
younger and less-experienced people.
 &HT;    Imagine if Glenn had tried to pull rank on his fellow space
companions, saying,``I am a senator, a war hero and an experienced
space veteran. I will not listen to a younger commander. My age and
rank puts me way above you.'' The mission would have failed.
 &HT;    In acknowledging that regardless of his attributes he still must
listen to ground control and respect his fellow space companions,
he again proved to be a hero. He helped make the mission a success
by recognizing his limits and carrying out his role.
 &HT;    Society has long worshipped youth, often forgetting the older,
experienced and wise people. For many, the elderly represent a
burden on society. Too little respect has been given to this
growing sector.
 &HT;    But now things are changing. Glenn has raised the consciousness
of senior citizens by telling them to become vibrant and to demand
a part in this active world. He has shown the way for all citizens.
 &HT;    His message is to keep on having hopes and dreams.
 &HT;    I especially liked Glenn's answer regarding God and prayer.
Asked whether he prayed in space, Glenn replied:
 &HT;    ``I pray every day, and I think everybody should. I don't think
we can look at Earth every day -- to look out at this kind of
creation and not believe in God is, to me, impossible.''
 &HT;    In the Bible, Moses was 80 years old when he became a heroic
leader for his people. Legend has it that Moses went up to heaven
for 40 days and nights. He didn't even have a space suit and he did
fine in the zero gravity. His age caused no restrictions.
 &HT;    He led the Israelites into the desert and was a fearless
commander for 40 years.
 &HT;    It has been said that a good man, like fine wine, becomes better
as time goes by. Yes, it caused a great splash in 1962 when Glenn's
space capsule landed in the Atlantic. But last week he made an even
greater splash by returning safely again from space.
 &HT;    He has become an inspiration to those in the graying and
twilight age. He has shown there is no real gap between the young
and the elderly and that people are only as old as they feel.
 &HT;    Maybe the younger generation will learn a thing or two about the
capabilities and possibilities of their older generation.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    John Glenn has proven, once again, that he is capable of
extraordinary feats. In humble fashion he explained his recent trip
into space as a giant step for geriatric science.
 &HT;    Through his experiments aboard Discovery, scientists will gain a
better understanding of what happens to the body in zero gravity
and, hopefully, the results will provide a better understanding of
the aging process.
 &HT;    As a larger segment of society grows older, such geriatric
studies are increasingly needed.
 &HT;    In Judaism there is a proverb, ``As men age, their opinions
change.'' (Talmud Shabbat 152). For example, we have seen the
former president, George Bush, fulfill his wish to skydive. Glenn
got his wish to skydive in the other direction, upward into space.
 &HT;    These men, who have achieved stability and greatness,
nevertheless are still looking for challenges. Their opinions about
fulfillment change regularly.
 &HT;    One of the most important lessons we can learn from the Glenn
space mission is how to maintain integrity yet still get along with
younger and less-experienced people.
 &HT;    Imagine if Glenn had tried to pull rank on his fellow space
companions, saying,``I am a senator, a war hero and an experienced
space veteran. I will not listen to a younger commander. My age and
rank puts me way above you.'' The mission would have failed.
 &HT;    In acknowledging that regardless of his attributes he still must
listen to ground control and respect his fellow space companions,
he again proved to be a hero. He helped make the mission a success
by recognizing his limits and carrying out his role.
 &HT;    Society has long worshipped youth, often forgetting the older,
experienced and wise people. For many, the elderly represent a
burden on society. Too little respect has been given to this
growing sector.
 &HT;    But now things are changing. Glenn has raised the consciousness
of senior citizens by telling them to become vibrant and to demand
a part in this active world. He has shown the way for all citizens.
 &HT;    His message is to keep on having hopes and dreams.
 &HT;    I especially liked Glenn's answer regarding God and prayer.
Asked whether he prayed in space, Glenn replied:
 &HT;    ``I pray every day, and I think everybody should. I don't think
we can look at Earth every day -- to look out at this kind of
creation and not believe in God is, to me, impossible.''
 &HT;    In the Bible, Moses was 80 years old when he became a heroic
leader for his people. Legend has it that Moses went up to heaven
for 40 days and nights. He didn't even have a space suit and he did
fine in the zero gravity. His age caused no restrictions.
 &HT;    He led the Israelites into the desert and was a fearless
commander for 40 years.
 &HT;    It has been said that a good man, like fine wine, becomes better
as time goes by. Yes, it caused a great splash in 1962 when Glenn's
space capsule landed in the Atlantic. But last week he made an even
greater splash by returning safely again from space.
 &HT;    He has become an inspiration to those in the graying and
twilight age. He has shown there is no real gap between the young
and the elderly and that people are only as old as they feel.
 &HT;    Maybe the younger generation will learn a thing or two about the
capabilities and possibilities of their older generation.

BRADLEY'S EXPERIENCES ARE REAL PAGE-TURNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not the ``I'm Running For President'' manifesto, and not
just because he's already written it. Two years ago, Bill Bradley
wrote, ``Time Present, Time Past,'' a look back on his three terms
as a US Senator from New Jersey. That book should be a primer for
every would-be office-seeker in the land, because it is a
distinctly nonideological treatise that has resonance for everyone
from a staunch Christian far right winger to a Trotskyite.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know why Bradley should be president, read that
book.
</P>
<P>
   And if you want to know whether he will run for the office, hang
on a little longer. He says he will let us know by the end of the
year, and it will be dependent on two factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``One,'' he explains, ``with whatever ability and experience I
have, am I the person who can do the most to improve the quality of
life for Americans at this time? Does the man match the moment?
Number two, do my wife and daughter want to join me in a jump off a
50-story building?''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Time Present, Time Past'' he makes it clear that he has
profound reservations about subjecting himself and his family to
the type of intense personal scrutiny running for a modern-day
presidency requires _ not that he, unlike some high-ranking
officials we can name, really has anything to hide.
</P>
<P>
   The once and perhaps future politician remains a private citizen
for the time being, and now he comes before us wearing a different
hat. Bill Bradley, Princeton '65, Olympic gold medal winner, Rhodes
scholar, possessor of two NBA championship rings (1970, 1973), and
1982 Hall of Fame inductee, has written a love letter to basketball
titled, ``Values of the Game,'' (Artisan Press, New York City), and
it is every bit as prescient, thoughtful, and just plain valuable a
work as you'd expect from a man who never approaches any task
without a full commitment.
</P>
<P>
   There is irony in the timing. The book comes out while NBA
owners and players squabble over how to whack up billions (plural)
of dollars in revenue, even as the game in question is sadly
deteriorating on an annual basis. Once that inane dispute is
settled, both sides will be left facing the brutal reality that
their game stinks, at least in comparison to what it could, and
should be. The plain truth is that neither the generic modern
player nor the generic modern owner will read ``Values of the
Game'' and understand what Bradley is getting so worked up about.
</P>
<P>
   The chapter titles alone indicate how gloriously utopian
Bradley's basketball vision is: ``Passion,'' ``Discipline,''
``Selflessness,'' ``Respect,'' ``Perspective,'' ``Courage,''
``Leadership,'' ``Responsibility,'' ``Resilience,'' and
``Imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   His first thought was to link the basketball to the politics and
then to real life. ``Then I realized I didn't need the politics,''
he explains. ``The basketball stood on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bill Bradley book is a Bill Bradley book. There is no ``as
told to.'' During his final season with the Knicks, he wrote,
``Life on the Run,'' which ranks with Jim Brosnan's ``The Long
Season,'' and Ken Dryden's ``The Game'' as the best inside-out
examinations we've ever been given of what team dynamics are all
about and what it (itals)really(unitals) means to be a professional
athlete. That was 22 years ago, and who among us is the same as he
was 22 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing this was great fun for me,'' Bradley says. ``I'm 22
years older. There are things in this book I couldn't have
understood 22 years ago. I could have written about discipline and
selflessness, but I could not have properly addressed resilience,
inspiration, perspective, and passion. This book reawakened some
things in me that had been dormant for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman senator, Bradley felt it was vital to distance
himself from his basketball past. Fully cognizant that his great
name recognition made it possible for him to get elected to such a
high office at a very young political age, he likewise realized
that, once in office, knowing how to come off a screen wasn't going
to be of much value in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't initiate any basketball conversations for at least
two or three years,'' he reveals. ``I don't think I was defensive
about it, but I wasn't going to trade on it. After four or five
years, I reverted to my natural instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   His most recent connection to the game took place during the
last two years, during his residency as Stanford's visiting ``Payne
Professor.'' He renewed an old affinity for the college game,
becoming a friend and unofficial adviser to both the men's and
women's teams. He says that two of the men's players _ sharpshooter
Ryan Mendez and banging forward Pete Sauer _ ``remind me a little
bit of me'' and he maintains that All-American Katy Starbird ``is
the closest thing to John Havlicek I've ever seen, right down to
the upright run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Values of the Game'' is a spectacularly illustrated book, and
any questions about where the Boston Celtics as an institution fit
in the Bradley scheme of things can be answered by enumerating the
number of photos in which a Celtic, or the Celtics, are placed in a
favorable light (14). Of course, we are now talking about the
Celtics that were, not the ones that are, and it is entirely in
keeping with Mr. Bradley's gentlemanly demeanor that he allows the
reader to make this deduction.
</P>
<P>
   At age 55, Bradley is very much at peace with himself. He has
been an athlete, he has been a public servant, and he has been a
private citizen. He is not remotely conflicted. If he ever does
wind up living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, it will be as
athlete-husband-father-Hall of
Famer-politician-negotiator-diplomat-fan-normal human being. He
will not find it necessary to apologize for having been a jock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am comfortable with the duality of my life,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Read ``Time Present, Time Past'' to see if you like what the
senator has to say. Read ``Values of the Game'' to see if you like
what the Hall of Famer has to say.

COUNTING THE SPOONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So the Republican Party is going to try pragmatism. Get ready
for plenty more tears. The party surely will find a way to
recapture its soul, but first its next generation of leaders is
going to have to run off a generation of nuts and hustlers who
attempted to hijack it.
</P>
<P>
   While they are at it, party leaders might take a lesson from
Masssachusetts, where the GOP just sold a governor and a lieutenant
governor to the electorate in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
They would have had three of the four top statewide offices if
Treasurer Joe Malone hadn't decided to challenge the victorious
Paul Cellucci to a primary battle. To what should we ascribe the
local GOP's success?
</P>
<P>
   The taste for divided government is only part of the answer.
Like any competitor, a political party must differentiate its
product. Republicans historically have positioned themselves as
being more market-oriented, more vigilant, and, well, more
(itals)disinterested(unitals) than the Democrats _ the party of
good housekeeping vs. the party of social progress. With
Republicans, you're not supposed to have to count the spoons (so
often).
</P>
<P>
   Bill Weld was himself an exemplar of this sort of honest,
competent Republican, and his administration had more than its
share of others. They were successes and failures, long-tenured and
short: administration and finance secretaries Peter Nesson, Mark
Robinson, Charles Baker, economic development Secretary Dan
Gregory, to name only some of the most prominent.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Weld himself, though, you couldn't find a better
example than Mitchell Adams, who announced last week he would step
down after eight years as commissioner of revenue. He is joining a
firm, Healthwatch Technologies, that scouts Medicare payments for
fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   No agency of state government is more tender than the Department
of Revenue. It has awesome power to know the income and wealth of
every citizen of the Commonwealth, to rule on the metaphysical
distinctions of the tax laws, and to demand compliance to its
interpretations. Like any police force, the DOR attracts its share
of zealots, trimmers, and would-be crooks. Michael Dukakis had Ira
Jackson, but twice in the previous 20 years, major housecleanings
had been required.
</P>
<P>
   So how did it do under Adams? ``Excellent,'' says Harold
Hestnes, a senior tax attorney at Hale and Dorr. There was no
breath of scandal during his eight years. His senior deputy,
Frederick Laskey, has advanced to become secretary of
administration and finance. And in terms of operations, ``which is
what he concentrated on, it probably became the model for the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the work force declined steadily through attrition
under Adams, _ from nearly 2,000 persons in 1992 to fewer than
1,500 today. Meanwhile, revenues soared 50 percent thanks to
economic growth, and so did assessments and collections of
delinquent taxes. Meanwhile, staffers pushed aggressively into new
technologies: telephone filing, electronic funds transfer, and
imaging. Revenue productivity more than doubled to $9.5 million per
employee this year.
</P>
<P>
   What about the politics underneath? That's another matter.
Massachusetts gained a black eye nationally in 1996, when a survey
of top tax accountants and large corporations by CFO magazine rated
the state 49th among the states in terms of fair and predictable
tax administration, ahead of only Louisiana. The next year it
dropped to last.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Outdated legislative check-reins account for most of the
turmoil, says Adams. Massachusetts is the only state in the nation
where tax officials lack the authority to settle bills without the
attorney general's review, and corporations must pay their tax
bills upfront before appealing them. A certain aggressive culture
of enforcement is part of the problem as well, as the Globe's Brian
Mooney documented in an investigation last year.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Adams repeatedly lobbied the Legislature to change
the law. And he hired a leading maven of corporate law, Donald
Evans, as first deputy commissioner and general counsel, to develop
a more global view. Did he succeed in changing the culture? Only
time will tell. But there were at least as many spoons in the
drawer as when he came.
</P>
<P>
   Weld chose Adams because he knew and trusted him; they had been
friends since Harvard College. Adams in turn was willing to put his
reputation on the line. It helped in his job that Adams went home
at night to his partner of 18 years, Kevin Smith. Mitchell Adams
was not a Republican _ ``hell, I raised money for McGovern.'' He
simply worked and lived like one.
</P>
<P>
   And no appointment that Paul Cellucci makes will signal more
about his administration than the choice he makes to replace Adams
at the Department of Revenue.

PATRIOTS COACH HAS FEW OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The call is out now. From Portland to
Providence, the good people of New England sound like George III.
They are calling for the heads of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   They want Willie Clay out. They want Bruce Armstrong and Max
Lane and Todd Rucci and Zefross Moss out. They want Chris Canty
out. They want a dozen guys out of the tub and onto the club.
</P>
<P>
   As the new millennium and the Buffalo Bills both approach, the
people of New England want only one thing of their Patriots today.
They want them to go to war or go to hell. But is a troop change
before battle the answer to the problems that have beset and
bedeviled these Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but more to the point is this: Does General Pete
Carroll have enough troops to effect such changes?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the first question is that reinforcements
certainly would help, but the answer to the latter negates that
because the answer to the latter question is simpler.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that there are no reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse _ and lately it's been worse _ Carroll is
playing the best players he has. Sunday in Buffalo, he will replace
Canty with Steve Israel at right corner, and that may help, but
Canty is far from the only problem Carroll is facing.
</P>
<P>
   His troops have lost three of their last four battles and barely
escaped a skirmish in Indianapolis with their scalps intact. They
have not played well in a long time, and that applies to nearly
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, those troops have suffered enough casualties to keep Alan
Alda's ``MASH'' unit in reruns for five years. As of this morning,
more than a dozen Patriots are in the infirmary: Vincent Brisby
(finger), Troy Brown (ankle), Terry Glenn (hamstring), Shawn
Jefferson (ribs), Tony Carter (knee), Chad Eaton (thigh, back),
Chris Slade (knee, ankle), Brandon Mitchell (broken foot), Henry
Thomas (ankle), Willie McGinest (groin), Mark Wheeler (knee), Larry
Whigham (knee), and Todd Collins (groin), to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   There was once a coach here who said, ``In football season,
football players play football.'' This was the same coach whose
injury reports were always shorter than a haiku. But he is gone,
and the infirmary is full again, just as it used to be when the
Patriots regularly went 6-10.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Carroll either has been unlucky in this matter or
needs to have the whirlpool drained, but either way nothing he said
Monday indicated that much is likely to change on the medical
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``The list is long,'' Carroll said. ``I haven't got a whole lot
of good reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll met with his band of weary warriors the morning after
Sunday's 41-10 rout because, he said, ``Today was a day to
challenge our players individually.'' He went on to say, ``That
challenge has been issued.''
</P>
<P>
   One hopes that didn't mean the announcement of a Scrabble
challenge Wednesday night after practice, followed by ice cream and
cake, but whatever it means, it isn't likely to mean that many
heads will roll, because other than Israel for Canty, what is
Carroll supposed to do?
</P>
<P>
   Replace Bruce Armstrong with Ed Ellis? Not if he wants Drew
Bledsoe to stay off the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Replace Max Lane with Damon Denson or Todd Rucci with Heath
Irwin or Zefross Moss with Scott Rehberg? Not unless he wants to
replace Robert Edwards with Sedrick Shaw _ permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Replace Willie Clay with Chris Carter or the long absent Tebucky
Jones? Not unless he wants to bet the over this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   So what is Gen. Carroll to do when he challenges his troops?
What can he really say? With what can he threaten them? No more
Dairy Queen after practice?
</P>
<P>
   There is, frankly, little he can do but hope his troops have
pride enough to fight harder and heart enough for the lame and
infirm to take their cue from Jefferson, Slade, Thomas, and Eaton,
who are all playing with injuries that would have the common man on
disability for a month.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he can do nothing. It is too late for the general
or his lieutenants to rally the troops. The troops have to rally
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest pitfall we can get into as players is to say,
`It's not our fault,''' said Bledsoe. ``We're being prepared. It
falls on us to go execute.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fall into that trap (of blaming the coaches), it
snowballs because the minute you shift that blame you have an
excuse to let yourself off the hook. If you do that, you won't do
what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What the troops have to do is obvious. They have to do their
jobs, earn their money, and fight back even if their groin aches or
their hamstring is tighter than a violin string.
</P>
<P>
   They have to fight back, because there are no reinforcements
coming to bail them out. Either they fight now with what they have
or they end up like Custer's troops. And, as Carroll knows all too
well, Custer's troops weren't the only ones who went down at Little
Big Horn.
</P>
<P>
   The troops took the general with them.

HYDE STILL DOESN'T GET IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The big guy from Woodale, Ill., could really use
some help. Anybody with a way out of the impeachment quagmire
should give him a buzz at 1-800-HYDE.
</P>
<P>
   Post-election and post-Gingrich, the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee has more freedom but also more responsibility.
So far, though, Henry Hyde is acting more like he's trying to duck
and temporize. Talk about not getting it.
</P>
<P>
   It's said there was an election recently, in which strong
signals about priorities were supposedly sent here. So what do the
ostriches in the nation's capital plan to focus on for the next two
months? House Republican squabble politics and impeachment. They
are, without a doubt, related.
</P>
<P>
   Post-election, for starters, there are five fewer Republicans,
and most incoming freshman Republicans got elected by running away
from impeachment and expect their lame-duck colleagues to dump this
evidentiary and political mess by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Post-Gingrich, Hyde no longer has a rabid GOP leadership on his
back, and the distractions of the succession struggle only increase
his running room. The trouble is that Hyde's name keeps popping up
in this struggle _ both as a possible draftee for a leadership job
and as a broker. So far, however, all Hyde has done with his
running room is run in place.
</P>
<P>
   Holding action No. 1 was his dispatch of 81 foolish yes-or-no
questions to the White House. He may eventually get some replies,
but even Hyde knows the silly demand for monosyllables will not and
should not be met.
</P>
<P>
   Holding action No. 2 was the scheduling for Nov. 19 of testimony
from his only planned ``fact'' witness _ the controversial
prosecutor who developed the case under suspicious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is true, as some winking Republicans suggest, that Hyde
is setting Ken Starr up for a fall or a swan song. But for those
trying to take this seriously, the idea that an impeachment case
can be made solely on the testimony of its leading advocate based
on uncross-examined testimony from conflicting witnesses is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath all this is a simple fact, partisan in nature because
it is partisan in reality: The Republicans don't have the votes in
the House to impeach on this case, but they can't stop themselves
yet; and some leading Republicans confide that they may not have
the votes in the super-partisan Judiciary Committee, either. In
military strategy patois, the GOP has no exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And the inclination at the very top of the White House for the
moment is not to provide them with something they are unwilling to
provide for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the president has a more than convenient hook for
holding back, the repeated statements of big-shot Republicans
before and even after the election that formal censure or any other
extra-constitutional maneuver is not an option. The idea is simply
to take them up on it.
</P>
<P>
   The leading proponent of this GOP line on the inside has been
Majority Whip Tom Delay of Texas. On the outside, it has been
former Vice President Dan Quayle. This position had its origins
back in the silly days when the conventional wisdom among press and
pols alike was that impeachment was ``inevitable,'' that any deals
or plea bargains should come at the virtually certain ``trial''
stage in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that nothing was ever inevitable, not before
the election and certainly not now.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the election, there was nothing approaching a
two-thirds majority in the Senate for tossing Clinton out of
office. With the substitution of such GOP freshmen as Jim Bunning,
Peter Fitzgerald, and George Voinovich for experienced
Clinton-bashers Al D'Amato, Lauch Faircloth, and Dan Coates, that
fact of life is only underlined. Already, GOP veterans like Senate
Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch are saying more or less
publicly that the facts of evidentiary and political life in the
Senate ought to affect the facts of life in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But the absurdity instead grinds on. Hyde has himself rejected
stopping the madness, which threatens to become his madness, by
saying the issue of a punishment deal is above his pay grade. Not
anymore. Hyde has also said he does not want to bring impeachment
articles to the House floor that cannot attract bipartisan support.
The truth is they can't without major new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, when the votes on the inquiry were taken to
position members for the election Gingrich thought the GOP would
win, the highwater mark was 226 Republicans and 10 Democrats (five
of whom were against any inquiry) opposing the Democrats' limited
resolution, which Hyde has now in effect accepted post-election.
</P>
<P>
   But actual impeachment based on the Lewinsky case wouldn't come
close to attracting that number. Some true believers on the right
want to take the vote anyway, but no sane Republican leader would
expose members who may be vulnerable two years hence to a vote that
would have no purpose beyond spite.
</P>
<P>
   In this chaotic conundrum, there is little the White House can
do to help beyond not gloating about the election and staying
low-key on impeachment process issues _ in short, waiting for
sanity to emerge. It may take a while. Meantime, nobody named
Clinton is going to ``get away'' with anything. The ``public
rebuke'' of which Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut
spoke in August still waits in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   It would help, though, if the bitter, battling Republicans could
show at least a tad more negotiating maturity in this new
environment than Paula Jones has.

LAWYER LYMAN BULLARD EXCELS IN CLOSING SPORTS DEALS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The taxicabs were downstairs lined up at the curb and
idling outside Exchange Place as Boston lawyer Lyman G. Bullard Jr.
watched a host of sports figures and bankers sign the legal
documents he had crafted for months.
</P>
<P>
   The cabs waited to carry the signatories _ including officers of
a syndicate of banks, the sports and concessions behemoth Delaware
North, the Boston Bruins, the Boston Celtics, and Bullard _ to the
announcement of one of the biggest sports deals in the city's
history.
</P>
<P>
   What would eventually be called the FleetCenter was about to be
born on the strength of a $120 million line of credit negotiated by
Bullard. And until moments before the announcement he was still
dispatching his duties as midwife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to get something done in Boston ... for Boston,
that a lot of people had walked away from,'' Bullard recalled in a
recent interview, some six years after the deal was signed. ``I was
still nervous at the end, and I had a weird thought: What happens
with the cabs if someone decides not to sign? Who tells them we
don't need them anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard, 43, has been involved in some of the largest sports
financing deals of the decade and, by all evidence, he is one of
the top sports lawyers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1991, Bullard has been a counsel in establishing a
total of $1.01 billion in lines of credit for sports enterprises.
He has helped pioneer the use of lucrative television contracts to
leverage long-term lines of credit, which enables the teams to have
cash on hand, based on the television networks' guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the FleetCenter, Bullard has fashioned the structure and
financing that secured a stable financial future for the Baltimore
Ravens after their controversial exodus from Cleveland as the
Browns. He also negotiated last summer's arrangement of a $425
million line of credit for Major League Baseball that banking
sources call one of the largest of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Bullard helped structure a bid for the new Cleveland
Browns that the National Football League eventually awarded to
another bidder, Cleveland-area banker Alfred Lerner, for $530
million _ the most ever for a professional sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyman has clearly established himself with a lot of the
financial personnel in the leagues as someone who is at the very
top of the list of lawyers with a lot of expertise,'' said Dan
Williams, the managing director of corporate finances at Fleet
Bank. ``He's one of a group of lawyers known by all of the
executives with the leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Success for Bullard, though, has also afforded him a keen
perspective on the future of professional sports. As he looks at
the evidence of the continually escalating costs of sport that
cross his desk, Bullard says that the sports fan, jock, and father
in him cringes. He wonders whether some of the big-money deals are
getting too rich for the good of the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``While $500 million for the Browns is just a huge price to pay
for any sports franchise, it clearly was not too much to pay,''
Bullard said. ``Lerner's a very smart guy and he was willing to pay
for it, and my guys (the lawyer Lawrence Dolan and his brother
Charles, a founding owner of Cablevision Systems Corp. ) were right
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it just shows that over the next decade, fewer and fewer
individuals are going to be able to buy these sports teams, and
that more and more companies _ especially media companies _ are
going to be the ones competing to buy these teams,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When corporations buy teams as part of an integrated business
strategy, it will be interesting to see what it does to salary
structures and other things, especially when the ownership may not
need the team to make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard approaches sports business from the perspective of a guy
who has actually played the games. In fact, 20 years later, he
remains no small legend among the followers of hockey at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Beanpot Tournament in 1977, Bullard, a
senior, was the captain of the soccer team and perhaps one of the
best tennis players on campus. He also had gone out for the junior
varsity in hockey. On the eve of the Beanpot, with injuries racking
the Crimson, coach Bill Cleary made a surprise call to Bullard's
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck in the Beanpot, coach,'' Cleary has quoted Bullard
in the many subsequent retellings of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you like to wear a Harvard shirt in the Beanpot?''
Cleary said he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a good enough story at that,'' Bullard
recalled, his exuberance only a little less diluted two decades
after the fact. ``But then I figured in on some good plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Good plays? The truth is that Bullard, playing as a forward,
scored one goal and assisted on another, with 29 seconds left in
the game, that beat Boston University 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he graduated from Boston College Law School in 1984
and was admitted to the bar, sports still enthralled him. While
doing some legal work with the old Shawmut Bank, he got an early
suggestion of how he could combine his passion and his profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fellow there, David Splain, had a couple of sports matters
before him and he told me, `Lyman, I know you played hockey and you
like sports, why don't you get involved with this?''' Bullard
explained. ``I really saw the visibility and the flash that sports
would bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, he found himself in the middle of major deals.
</P>
<P>
   During the months of all-day work preceding completion of the
FleetCenter deal, Bullard said he learned some valuable lessons
about how focus and a continuously positive attitude can bring
deals to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when you deal with the different leagues you
get bogged down in a lot of detail, and it's easy to lose focus and
get overwhelmed, because they each have their rules and
requirements that just adds to what is already a fairly complex
situation. But not with Lyman,'' said Pat McAuliffe, an executive
vice president in charge of Fleet's sports lending group.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time he is keeping on course and moving along, he
doesn't lose focus on those devils in the details that he is
addressing and protecting his parties from any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The lessons about fortitude and comity that Bullard learned in
the FleetCenter deal served him well. The $185 million line of
credit that he secured _ as both a counsel to Fleet Corporate
Finance and in his capacity as adviser to Ravens owner Art Modell
was as difficult and complicated as the Browns's exit from the
south shore of Lake Erie was unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL told us it just couldn't be done,'' Williams said.
``It was very difficult to line up the various requirements of
lenders, and insurers, and the need to address some rather complex
tax laws. I would describe it as a Rubik's cube: Every time you put
one problem back into place, something came out on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Lyman is very adept at making people feel very comfortable
with a very complex set of circumstances,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the college kid who leapt for joy at Harvard's Beanpot
victory 20 years ago lurks in the heart of this high-powered
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are one of the new owners, you charge local companies
more and more for the stadium suites, and fewer and fewer fans are
going to be able to afford to go to games,'' Bullard said.
``Increasingly, the next generation of kids will see more and more
games on television and fewer and fewer in person than we did. And
what's their commitment going to be, soon?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that works,'' Bullard said, with a shrug. ``But that's
where we're headed.''

FIORENTINA PAYS PRICE FOR FAN INTERFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florence's soccer fans had a bittersweet Sunday. Fiorentina
regained first place in Italy's Serie A with a 4-1 victory over
Venezia, but a disciplinary committee ruling eliminated the club
from the UEFA Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorentina appeared to be on the way to the Round of 16 after
defeating Grasshoppers, 2-0, in Zurich and taking a 2-0 halftime
lead in the second leg, which was being played in Salerno. But a
fan tossed an explosive device _ called a ``bomba di Maradona''
after the former Napoli star _ which injured an official.
</P>
<P>
   The match was abandoned, and the committee ruled Fiorentina the
loser, 3-0, reasoning that the home team was responsible for the
behavior of its fans at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans who caused problems were supporters of neither
competitor. In fact, they were suspected ``tifosi Salernitani'' who
had declared themselves enemies of Fiorentina because of the
Florentines' relations with a Salernitana rival. The ``bomb''
apparently was meant for Fiorentina players, a mitigating factor
that led the committee not to further penalize the team.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in the Machiavellian manifestation of city state
clashes and intrigue is the fact that the match was being played in
Salerno to provide aid to flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would choose Lo Stadio Arechi again,'' Fiorentina president
Vittorio Cecchi Gori said. ``Certainly, the act of one person
cannot place a black mark on a region so rich and beautiful. It was
an isolated act by someone crazy that does not have anything to do
with sport.''

   &UR; Bruce Arena's  &LR; US national team debut was conducted in a
low-profile setting, before 15,074 spectators at Spartan Stadium in
San Jose Friday night. There was no television coverage of the 0-0
draw with Australia, though the match will be shown today by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Arena has won only once in his last four games, including losses
to Columbus in the MLS playoffs and Chicago in the MLS Cup final
with D.C. United. He will juggle his duties by guiding D.C. United
against Vasco da Gama of Brazil in the InterAmericana Cup at RFK
Stadium Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But with the likely postponing of the Confederations Cup,
scheduled Jan. 8-20 in Guadalajara and Mexico City, Arena and the
US could be scrambling for games. Mexico has proposed delaying the
tournament until August, since France was withdrawn, to avoid
conflicting with European club schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Likely foes for the US in coming months could be Belgium and
Holland, who are exempt from qualifying as co-hosts of the Euro
2000 Championships.
</P>
<P>
   US Soccer Federation officials also could consider the example
of clubs in the Spanish Liga, which have collected millions of
pesetas from gate receipts for victims of Hurricane Mitch, and
Peru, which will send its national team to San Salvador for a Nov.
27 friendly at Estadio Cuscatlan.
</P>
<P>
   A tournament involving Central American nations would go far in
promoting the national team image. Or the MLS could organize a
tournament involving Central American clubs. This would keep MLS
teams active and encourage interaction between the league and
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's leading scorer,  &UR; Raul Diaz Arce &LR; , &UR;  &LR; has returned
to El Salvador and likely will play for the national team against
Peru.

   Boca Juniors president  &UR; Mauricio Macri  &LR; has said he will not
transfer  &UR; Guillermo Barros Schelotto  &LR; or  &UR; Martin Palermo &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
have been attracting attention from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But Macri likely will be unable to prevent Palermo from
departing, since the striker's pass has been valued at $25 million
_ a rec-ord for an Argentine player.
</P>
<P>
   Palermo, who was purchased from Estudiantes de La Plata for $4
million, has scored 34 goals in 45 games for Boca Juniors. He leads
Argentina's Primera Division with 14 goals, two off the record set
by  &UR; Roberto Sosa  &LR; of Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata before
departing for Udinese in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa converted a last-minute goal for Udinese in a 2-2 tie with
Juventus Sunday.

Salas doubles up

   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's Chilean striker,  &UR; Marcelo Salas &LR; , &UR;  &LR; has decided not to be
governed by his principles regarding citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Salas was praised during the World Cup for having refused to
apply for Spanish citizenship because he considered himself a
Mapuche Indian, a group that had been victimized by the
Conquistadores.
</P>
<P>
   But Salas has now adopted a pragmatic policy. He plans to obtain
a double passport, canceling his foreign status in European Union
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a problem for me, as I am not renouncing my Chilean
nationality,'' Salas said. ``If having a double passport, Italian
or Spanish, helps me and Lazio, I will not object. And why would I
renounce Spanish citizenship? For historical reasons? Certain
things even now are passing. And should we say that a Spaniard
should be treated badly in Chile, because many centuries ago
certain things happened? No, it doesn't really seem right to think
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Salas, who was transferred for $21.5 million to Lazio this year,
certainly has made an impression on coach  &UR; Sven Goran Eriksson &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``I compare him to  &UR; Gerd Muller &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the great German striker of
the '70s,'' Eriksson said. ``But Salas is technically and
tactically more complete.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The pain in Spain
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Real Betis's problems continue in Spain. Betis is
third from the bottom of the Liga after losing, 1-0, to Espanyol.
Betis president  &UR; Ruiz de Lopera  &LR; invested more than $65 million
into players, including $35 million for Brazilian midfielder
 &UR; Denilson  &LR; and nearly $20 million for  &UR; Benjamin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; making him the
most expensive Spanish player ever.
</P>
<P>
   But Betis struggled this season, winning only once under its
first three coaches, two of which were fired.  &UR; Vicente Cantatore
 &LR; resigned after starting the season with a 1-4-1 record.  &UR; Javier
Clemente &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the national team coach in the 1994 and '98 World Cup
finals, changed the Seville club's alignment, placing Denilson
behind lone striker  &UR; Oli &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and won in his debut before falling to
Espanyol.

   Mallorca leads the league by a point over Real Madrid. Mallorca

   Since 1938, Bolivia has had 15 national team coaches, all
foreigners. The latest is  &UR; Hector  &LR; `` &UR; Bambino &LR; ''  &UR; Veira &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 52, who
coached River Plate, San Lorenzo, and Boca Juniors in Argentina.
Veira's contract is worth about $500,000 annually for four years,
and if Bolivia qualifies for the 2002 World Cup, he could obtain a
bonus of $1 million. These are incredible numbers for one of the
hemisphere's poorest nations ... The MLS does not appear interested
in pursuing many African players, which could be a mistake, judging
by the success of  &UR; Sean Bartlett &LR; . In the MLS's first season,
former Colorado Rapids coach  &UR; Bob Houghton  &LR; recruited Bartlett from
the African Nations Cup tournament in South Africa. The MLS
profited by selling Bartlett for $1 million to FC Zurich, the
highest price the Swiss club ever has paid for a player. Bartlett
leads the UEFA Cup in scoring with six goals, going into a Nov. 24
visit to AS Roma ... While the NBA's Celtics remain locked out, the
original Celtic is going strong. Celtic overcame Glasgow rival
Rangers' nine-year hold on the Scottish Premier League championship
last year. After a slow start this season, Celtic appears
rejuvenated after taking a 6-1 victory over Dundee FC. Dutchman
 &UR; Wim Jansen  &LR; guided Celtic to the title last season, then resigned.
General manager  &UR; Jock Brown  &LR; eventually hired a replacement, the
Slovakian Dr.  &UR; Jozsef Venglos &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but Celtic struggled in Scotland
and was eliminated from both the Champions League and UEFA Cup.
Brown resigned after Celtic fell to FC Zurich. Now, Canadian
 &UR; Fergus McCann &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the club chairman who helped launch Celtic into
the modern world of finance and television, also plans to leave.

ODOM DOES IT ALL IN DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Let it be recorded that in Lamar Odom's first
collegiate game, 38 representatives from 20 NBA teams came to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Let it also be noted that in his first collegiate game, Lamar
Odom had a double-double _ by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   And let it be known that in his first collegiate game, Lamar
Odom scored the last basket of the evening, giving the University
of Rhode Island a pulsating 87-85 victory over Texas Christian.
</P>
<P>
   All of this played out Monday before a small gathering at
Providence Civic Center in an event called the CoSIDA Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Few debuts have been as anticipated as that of the Rams'
6-foot-10-inch sophomore whose academic travails have been
well-documented the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Odom do in his coming-out party? Oh, just make 6 of
13 shots for 19 points, pull down a game-high 14 rebounds, and hand
out 9 assists. And hit the winning shot with 5.4 seconds remaining
in a game that had the intensity of an NCAA regional final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen points, 14 rebounds, and 9 assists?'' said URI coach
Jim Harrick, looking at the stat sheet. ``He almost had a
triple-double. Goodness gracious.''
</P>
<P>
   That Odom is even at URI is amazing considering it took him two
years to meet NCAA academic standards; he had six-figure offers
from the CBA and a professional league in Greece; and NBA people
already believe he may be the No. 1 pick in next spring's draft.
</P>
<P>
   For Odom, the event was dreamlike as much as a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real nervous coming into the game,'' he said. ``It was a
relief (just getting to play). As the game went on, I felt more
comfortable. Got into it more.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom may have felt nervous, but he didn't look it. Not when he
had 13 points and 10 rebounds in the first half as URI took a
10-point lead over the Horned Frogs, who were ranked 25th in the
preseason Associated Press poll and had a genuine attraction in
forward Lee Nailon, a first-team preseason All-American.
</P>
<P>
   And not at the end, with the game tied at 85. Odom came out of a
timeout with 24 seconds left, a smile on his face as he calmly
waited until the 11-second mark before making a move to the basket
that ended with the ball spinning in and the Rams prevailing.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of preseason, there was much speculation about where
Odom would play for Harrick. He is big and agile enough to play the
3 spot, or even 4 or 5, but he also is quick enough to play point
guard.
</P>
<P>
   One scout who watched Odom in preseason workouts said, ``He's a
15,'' meaning he could play all five positions.
</P>
<P>
   After starting point guard Preston Murphy went down with a
severe ankle injury, Odom moved into Murphy's role, running the
offense with the precision of a three-year veteran, instead of a
19-year-old kid making his college debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is very, very easy for him,'' said Harrick with a
smile and a shake of the head.
</P>
<P>
   Odom made it look easy and made it sound easy. When asked how he
felt playing point guard, he smiled and said, ``Good. As a point
guard and as a leader on the team, I felt comfortable doing
things.''
</P>
<P>
   A leader? Forty minutes into a college career that probably will
last no longer than the Rams' last game in March?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jim Harrick is going to enjoy him this year,'' said
TCU coach Billy Tubbs, ``because this is the only year he's going
to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   And Harrick will take him _ gladly _ for every game he can. The
Rams are good but have question marks, especially at guard. That
position got even thinner for a couple of weeks with Murphy out.
</P>
<P>
   But URI is going to get better and so is Odom, who will be a
presence on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   After one game Odom has become the leader of the pack. Everyone
at the Civic Center recognized that.
</P>
<P>
   There was little question who would take the last shot. Nor did
there seem to be much question as to what would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just stepped up and did it,'' said senior forward Antonio
Reynolds-Dean. ``I don't know how he did it. But he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he did. And as the season starts to take shape in the next
few weeks, there seems little doubt that Odom's effect on URI will
be enormous.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems just as obvious that his stay with the Rams will be
a short one, but one that will not soon be forgotten.

IN NEW ENGLAND, THE CHOICE IS YOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the widespread shifting of corporate plates beneath the
surface of Planet Ski in recent years, three truths ever shine: No
grouping of properties in a corporate portfolio stamp stamps any
ski area with an imprimatur of the parent company _ personalities
are just too different _ nor could skiers care less who owns the
snow on which they are sliding.
</P>
<P>
   Also, despite the fact that American Skiing Co., Intrawest, and
Booth Creek hold most of the major cards in New England, there are
plenty of quality independent areas, some of which have formed
marketing alliances.
</P>
<P>
   In the neighborhood of Mount Snow, not far from Killington, and
close enough to be a competitor of Sugarbush, for example, Okemo is
now a long-running success story. Despite all the ballyhoo about
tough terrain, the truth about skiers is that blue cruising is by
far the most popular dish on the menu, and that's what Okemo
serves.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked until the '80s as a sleeping giant, Okemo has built
its popularity on maximizing all that blueness with superb grooming
and lifts, and with a strong family ambience that most skiers like.
This year, the mountain has added 60 slopeside condos that will
enhance the village atmosphere. As Okemo has grown in popularity,
the town of Ludlow has also become a pleasant ski town with some
night life and good restaurants that cover the range form
cheeseburgers to gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   An extreme opposite yet thrives up the road in Vermont where Mad
River Glen still sports the most recognizable bumper sticker in ski
country: ``Mad River Glen _ Ski It If You Can'' _ though you still
find the odd VW bus that rattles up the valley with a message
against short skis emblazoned on its rusty bumper.
</P>
<P>
   Mad River knows how to turn a vice (hardly any snowmaking or
grooming) and turn it to a virtue of minimalism. Redolent of the
good old days before machinery got in the way of skiing, devotees
of this area even sing the praises of an ancient single chair on
grounds that it keeps skier density low on the terrain above that
it serves.
</P>
<P>
   And the terrain is superb at Mad River Glen, though don't come
here looking for bluecruisy skiing. That dish is not on the menu
here, nor is there much for beginners, even low intermediates
looking to put notches on their belts.
</P>
<P>
   And snowboarders? Don't even show up in shredder clothes. Boards
haven't been allowed here since owner Betsy Pratt kicked them off
in 1991. When she sold the area to a cooperative of shareholders
four years later, the ban went with the deed, and is not about to
be relaxed anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive terrain? Non-accommodating lifts? Snow too fragile and
too light for boards? These are some theories advanced about the
area's position, but more likely is the ambient old-timer snobbery.
Those who love this area _ and they are legion _ like it just the
way it is.
</P>
<P>
   Across the valley, Sugarbush may be Mad River's alter ego, but
you can still sit at the Blue Tooth bar quaffing brewskies while
the Allman Brothers bang out country blues, the whole scene
reminding boomers of skiing in their college years.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake about Sugarbush. With some of the finest
terrain in New England _ and a good variety _ this area is
seriously on the move. At one time the snowmaking was so bad it was
a rare year that its expert piece de resistance _ Castle Rock _
could open for more than a few weeks in the year.
</P>
<P>
   But what a difference 20 million little dollars make! New
snowmaking and lifts, much arising from Les Otten's hard-fought
battles with Vermont's rabid no-growthers, have transformed
Sugarbush into a thoroughly modern ski area, and with plenty of
room to develop. This, of course, strikes locals and devotees as a
mixed message. But this area once touted in the Stein Erikson era
as ``Zurmat of New England,'' will continue to develop and grow as
a rival to its own corporate cousins in the Green Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, two old rivals in the White Mountain National
Forest _ Loon and Waterville Valley, now under the corporate
blanket of George Gillett's Booth Creek _ are still, well, old
rivals. At about two hours up Route 95, they share the claimed
distinction of being the closest serious skiing to Boston, and
indeed, Boston is largely who skis at both.
</P>
<P>
   Loon, which suffers from bottlenecks of the 13,000 who hit the
town every weekend, badly needs the permit to install a new quad
that would connect a newly cut trial system between the mountain
and downtown Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Loon's skiing is buffed and varied, though without any really
hairball trails to rubberize your knees. Still, the blue cruisers
are groomed for smooth rides that reflect the area's recent
committment to new snow production system. With Lincoln at its
base, Loon has plenty of apres ski life and a few excellent
restaurants. After skiing some clear day, drive a few miles up New
England's most spectacular highway, the Kancamagus. Take your
camera.
</P>
<P>
   An exit before Lincoln, but with a six-mile access off
Interstate 93, Waterville Valley has started to pour on the
snowmaking, bringing it into the modern ski world by providing some
of that buff stuff. Also, Waterville may be the only area in
history to have improved itself by shortening a major lift _ its
high-speed summit quad, which used to pick up a useless and
annoying 300 yards to the very top. About all this did is give you
such a blast of cold wind as to put you in mind of the spectacular
mountaintop restaurant, the Shcwindi Hut a short ski away with its
wonderful hot homemade food.
</P>
<P>
   Those who love Waterville for its cranky old New England trails
with their bumps, and multiple fall lines _ just like Tom Corcoran
designed them _ find little change under the new George Gillett
ownership. Waterville still boasts a couple of leg burners _ Ciaou
and Gemma _ on the south side, and some of the best novice terrain
anywhere. The blue terrain is also terrific.
</P>
<P>
   Though the village is a shuttle ride away, there is a nice sense
of community, apres ski, and alternative activities such as
cross-country skiing, in-town ice skating, sleigh rides, and the
like. The inns around the valley _ all served by shuttle to the
slopes _ range from fair to great.
</P>
<P>
   Across the forest rising across Pinkham Notch from Mount
Washington is another of those areas, Wildcat, that dates to the
early days of New England skiing and has as loyal a following as a
ski area is fortunate to have. There just seems some aura about the
place that makes aficionados want to brand themselves ``Wildcat
Skiers.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's no Mad River in terms of spartan challenge, nor is it
even remarkably tough to ski. But Wildcat's terrain is varied with
some nice old-style narrow twisters mixed in with those that have
been retrofit over the years into broader straighter runs. Wildcat
Trial itself is a terrific blue trail that must be skied with
focus.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a dozen solid runs top to bottom, Wildcat's proximity
to Mount Washington gives it the most beautiful views in New
England, occasionally hellacious winds and weather, but just as
often blankets of new snow that no one else ever saw.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's two fiercest rivals, Sugarloaf and Sunday River, also
both fit underneath the ASC roof, and continue to expand and
refine, Sunday River holding onto the number two spot for
popularity in New England behind Killington.
</P>
<P>
   But one local area, Shawnee Peak in Bridgeton, a suburb of
Portland, is also on the move. Built in 1938, this area's skiing
may not be in the White Heat or Snowfields league, but Shawnee Peak
delivers some first-rate snow and grooming, and still has a feel of
old New England to the cut of many of its trails.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, Sunday River began tapping into the beehive of
North Conway, but this year Shawnee, about a half-hour away on
Route 302, goes one better than merely advertising. Several free
shuttle trips daily conect Shawnee with North Conway, which is a
fair rival for Cranmore and Black. Shawnee has also added an inn to
its base area, expanding the apres-ski choices, which was not too
hard, after all.

MARGARITA ISLAND: BEACHES AND BLISS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARGARITA ISLAND, Venezuela _ Lush palm trees form a narrow,
gently swaying canopy for as far as the eye can see. Underneath, a
row of restaurants _ some funky kiosks, others charming, open-air
affairs _ lines the partially paved road, maybe 50 yards from the
water.
</P>
<P>
   You settle into a chaise longue, shielded from the blazing sun
by one of the scores of brightly colored umbrellas that form a
rainbow down the beach. It's a great spot, because you can take in
the stunning view while keeping an eye on your kids playing in the
azure sea a few feet ahead. And you can do that even as you
consider whether to bargain a little with one of the vendors
strolling by with potential souvenirs, including hand-made
hammocks, summer dresses, shorts, T-shirts, and pearls that may or
may not be real.
</P>
<P>
   Now you're hungry, though. You want to try some of that red
snapper, caught locally just a few hours earlier, that you noticed
on the grill as you took the short walk from your rental car to
your little oasis in the sand. But you don't want to move the
children and, frankly, you don't feel much like moving yourself,
either. So what's a luxuriating vacationer to do?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. Flag down the waiter wandering nearby and ask for a
menu. As your food is prepared, he and a couple of fellow
restaurant workers will bring out a table, place it directly in
front of you, cover it with a crisp, white cloth, unfold some
chairs, and serve your meal, seaside, a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   This, as they say, is the life.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even though there are lots of other visual,
recreational, and historic delights on Margarita Island (including
an extensive flea market and several forts from which the locals
used to fight pirates), beaches are probably the best reason to
come. They are certainly the main attraction for well-to-do
Venezuelans, who for decades have flocked to this Caribbean resort
about 20 miles off their country's coast.
</P>
<P>
   There are secluded beaches like Punta Arenas on the island's
western tip, with golden sand on which you can lie undisturbed and
watch young fishermen bring in their daily catch by hand, one fish
at a time, and plop the critter on an old scale at the small
restaurant a few dozen feet offshore.
</P>
<P>
   There are small beaches like Guacuco on the eastern end, where
perhaps a dozen colorful hammocks hang invitingly from the palms
near a couple of kiosks that sell pasta and fresh fish; and there
are large beaches like Playa Caribe in the north, which boasts a
modern ``club'' that offers boat trips, live music, and flights on
ultralight planes.
</P>
<P>
   There are beaches that are developed and undeveloped, bustling
and remote. And then there's El Yaque, on the south coast, which is
one of the world's premier parasailing spots. Its perfect breezes
and open seas are a magnet for professionals, but it's also a
lovely place just to hang out, picnic on the beach, and maybe even
take a parasailing lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the beaches except those on the western side, which
is called the Macanao Peninsula and contains a national park _ in
which there's a beautiful, extensive mangrove swamp through which
you can take a boat ride _ have hotels right on them or very
nearby. Moreover, construction all over the island is booming,
partly with condos and time-shares that are available for rent, but
also for the growing number of Latin and South Americans who are
building their equivalents of Cape Cod or Martha's Vineyard
vacation homes.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to foresee a time, not many years ahead, when
Margarita will become yet another slick island destination,
striving for perfection in every detail. The island's not there
yet, however; some sites, like the centuries-old forts, are barely
maintained, and it doesn't take a a very long ride along any side
road to glimpse the poverty in which many of the locals still live.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those are issues in any Third World destination, and
increased tourism income will certainly lead to improvements. In
the meantime, Margarita already has its share of good restaurants,
as well as a couple of McDonald's restaurants and a Cheers for
those longing for a taste of home; a lively night life consisting
mainly of dining, discos, and dancing; and plenty of enticing
tourist attractions. All in all, it's an appealing place for
vacationers looking for someplace more rustic, less developed, and
with a bit more edge than many of its Caribbean competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are located in such a beautiful place with so many
activities available,'' said Andre Sidi, owner of the Five Star
Connection tour operator adjoining the luxurious Hilton Hotel here.
``But so many people, especially in the United States, still do not
seem to know much about us.''
</P>
<P>
   That clearly is changing: As Sidi spoke, he leafed through a fax
he'd just received from a travel agency in Boston, inquiring about
tours for a group from Massachusetts. It's still true, however,
that American agencies typically have little information even about
long-established accommodations and attractions on Margarita Island
_ even as new places spring up without notifying their local
chambers of commerce or foreign tourist bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leads to some unusual advice about arranging for a
trip here. That is, don't plan ahead too well.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it's easy to book yourself into a major hotel like
the Hilton, spend time by the elaborate pool, rent a car to run
into town now and then, find a few good restaurants and beaches,
and go home contented. But it might be more fun, and undoubtedly
would be more adventurous, if, before leaving home, you reserve a
room for only a few days.

   TAKE-BOS  
 MARGARITA ISLAND, Venezuela: ... a few days.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Then take a six-hour tour of the island (which is available from
travel agencies everywhere, either in small groups or big buses),
during which you will not only preview the sights that you'll want
to return to, but also will see all sorts of resorts with
all-inclusive packages, including every meal and entertainment;
beachside hotels with huge swimming pools and access to an array of
water sports; and even private housing in pastel-painted fishing
villages, though you should try this last option only if you speak
Spanish. Pick a place, check it out, and, if you like the price,
ambience, and amenities, move there a day or two later. Room costs
range enormously, from as little as $50 to $200 or more a night.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there are many excursions from Margarita to terrific
nearby destinations that aren't listed by, or available through,
travel agents in the United States. It's frequently cheaper to book
them locally anyway, since you can shop around and negotiate with
local tour guides once you're here; again, the prices vary
enormously depending on the dollar-to-bolivar conversion rate, the
individual tour operator, the time of year (high season or low),
and your own ability to strike a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The excursions include inexpensive day trips such as catamaran
rides to tiny Coche Island just south of Margarita, where there's a
lovely beach and restaurant, good snorkeling, and parasailing;
pricey fishing-boat charters that almost guarantee you'll return
with a good catch; and even single or multiday packages to see
other Caribbean islands, such as Grenada and Trinidad. For visitors
who revel in natural beauty, though, two sites rise to the top like
an ice cube in a tropical drink: Los Roques, a series of nearby
keys with breathtaking virgin beaches and fabulous snorkeling; and
Angel Falls, the world's highest waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Falls is located in a rain forest on the Venezuelan
mainland, and plane trips can be booked for a day, overnight, or
longer. If you decide to stay, keep in mind that the habitat is
decidedly unyuppified _ a hut in the jungle with meals that are
often less than gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the treks though creature-laden woods provide an
adventure for the eyes and the ears, and the hikes to and behind
the waterfall itself, through caverns and craggy (but safe)
mountain paths, are spectacular. This probably isn't a journey for
small children, though some high-energy parents have been seen
carrying their toddlers in backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Margarita Island itself was discovered by Christopher Columbus
in 1498; legend has it that he named it for the woman he loved but
could not have: Princes Margarita of Austria. The island's original
inhabitants, the Guaiqueri Indians, called their home Paraguachoa,
or ``a place of abundant fishing,'' a description that remains
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Columbus' reports, Europeans started to emigrate to the
area, drawn largely by the plentiful oyster beds and pearls, which
they eventually depleted, and by the 16th century, Spanish settlers
controlled the island.
</P>
<P>
   To protect their sovereignty and their shipping lanes from
pirates, Margarita's conquerers built a series of forts. Several
are still standing and in relatively good condition, with displays
inside of original firearms, swords, and suits of armor. They're a
pretty cool way to spend a few hours, especially if you have kids.
</P>
<P>
   A very different, but equally distinctive, attraction is the
Virgin of the Valley Sanctuary, located in the tiny village of
Valle del Espiritu Santo. By the way, the whole island is so small
that driving from town to town, or even the entire perimeter of the
place, takes only a half-day or so.
</P>
<P>
   The church that houses the Virgin is painted a muted pink, and
is surrounded by carefully tended greenery and flowers in the
center of the picturesque town. The area around it is lined with
kiosks selling freshly baked breads and pastries; and everything in
the area looks as it probably did 100 years ago. Outside the
church, elderly women sit at tables selling icons, scrolls
containing biblical passages, and religious trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   It's a captivating scene, but the most fascinating part of the
place lies inside. The residents of Margarita are devoutly
Catholic, and they believe the beautifully carved, life-sized
statue of the Virgin, which has been housed inside the chapel here
for more than a century, still performs miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Several large rooms adjoining the chapel provide evidence of
that belief: One is crammed with trophies from sports stars,
tributes to the Virgin for the miracles she performed in allowing
them to win. The walls of another room are filled with ornately
inscribed plaques, some made of gold and silver, donated by
successful businessmen, lawyers, journalists, and other
professionals in gratitude for the divine assistance they say they
have received.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the large main hall, called the Room of
Miracles, that is lined with glass cases containing thousands on
thousands of gold rings, pearls, amulets, and other valuable gifts
and tributes. Most come from fishermen who believe they've been
helped, but many also are brought in daily from other island
inhabitants and from believers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious frustration of traveling to a resort like Margarita
Island, which isn't (yet) a big destination for English-speakers,
is language. Unless you speak Spanish, it's sometimes tough to get
directions on the street or questions answered at some restaurants
and attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The people are typically very friendly and eager to help,
however, and the guides working for tourist agencies and on their
own are terrific. Ours, a young man named Edwin Demey, was not only
bright and personable but spoke English, Spanish, French, Italian,
and Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to get people from all over to come to see our
wonderful island,'' he said, ``we have to be able to talk to
them.''

LAS ROQUES: IT'S HEAVENLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ROQUES, Venezuela _ The name of this string of keys, a
half-hour plane ride from Margarita Island or the mainland,
translates as ``the Rocks.'' But they aren't craggy, mountainous,
or even a bit rocky.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to stones on these perfect, nearly virgin
beaches are the tiny fragments of decayed shell and coral reef that
make up their sand. Indeed, the Venezuelan government has
designated all of Los Roques as a tightly protected natural
preserve. Tourists are permitted in small groups, but some areas
are restricted except to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   To get here, you fly into the speck of an airport on the main
island, where charming rooms in beautifully painted homes are
available if you want to stay overnight. Then you take a small
fishing boat to your catamaran, on which you sail from one pristine
beach to another perfect one, as you gaze at the sparkling
blue-green sea and watch pelicans dive for their lunch.
</P>
<P>
   And every once in a while, you plummet into the water yourself,
to snorkel (gear included in all tours) in waters crammed with
exotic fish gliding through a maze of coral reefs. The food on
board is really good, too.
</P>
<P>
   If Los Roques sounds heavenly, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Gary and Jilly Shiman, a well-traveled couple from Bridgewater,
N.J., classified the snorkeling as among the best they've
experienced in the world. But they reserved their highest praise
for the scene outside their window on the evening they spent on the
big island at Los Roques _ the pelicans diving, the fishermen
fishing, the excellent food, and especially the romantic sunset
they watched from the roof of their little hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was colors I'd never seen before, I'm telling you,'' Gary
Shiman, a financial-data publisher, effused. ``It went from your
typical yellow to orange to orange-mauve to this amazing bright
pink.'' His wife, an attorney, added: ``It put Hawaii to shame. It
was magical.''
</P>
<P>
   A day trip to Los Roques runs about $135 and requires quite a
commitment _ but it's worth it. A travel agent's van generally
makes the rounds of hotels, picking up tourists between 4 a.m. and
5 a.m. to get to the airport by 6 for a 7 o'clock flight. You
return at about 7 in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Shimans paid $325 per person, which covered their round-trip
flights from Caracus, where they were visiting friends, plus two
days of catamaran touring, one night's lodging, and all meals.
Prices are generally lower from Margarita, especially for those
Spanish-speakers who are willing to explore for their own
accommodations once they get here.

   And there go the Beanie Babies in their bobsleds! This riotous
race is just one way youngsters learn while having fun at the new
Winter Science Program at Smugglers' Notch, Vt. The program, part
of the ski and snowboard all-day camps held from Dec. 4 through
April 11, aims to give age-appropriate lessons about weather, snow,
equipment technology, and physics. (But whatever you do, don't tell
the youngsters they'll learn something _ kids just want to have
fun.) Some of the events:
</P>
<P>
   _The Beanie Baby Bobsled Races. Children design and make
bobsleds for these oh-so-popular dolls to ride and race. That
teaches youngsters a bit about gravity and motion.
</P>
<P>
   _The Big Air Dummy Contest. Children get a similar lesson when
they make a dummy and send him or her downhill on skis or a
snowboard.
</P>
<P>
   _Snowflake Catch &AMP; Keep. Snowflakes are captured on black felt.
The kids then memorize their favorite flake (no, not Uncle Harry)
and re-create it by cutting the pattern on paper.
</P>
<P>
   And what a grand science classroom: The woods, mountains, ski
slopes, room are all part of it, as are the pumphouse, the
snowmaking center computer, snowguns, hoses, and snowcats. Learning
scenarios are set up for ages 3-17. For more information and a free
video, call 800-451-8752 or visit www.smuggs.com.

SANTA BARBARA'S COLORFUL, HISTORIC RED TILE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUIS A. DIIORIO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Virtually every important person living
in or visiting 19th-century California stopped by the Casa de la
Guerra, family home of Don Jose de la Guerra, the town's most
influential individual.
</P>
<P>
   Future Civil War generals Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh
Sherman were guests, and in his classic ``Two Years Before the
Mast,'' Richard Henry Dana details a weeklong Casa wedding
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It was where the elite met. It was where the first City Council
met in the 1850s and where plans were made to rebuild the city
after the 1925 earthquake. And it was where, in the 1920s, El
Paseo, a unique Old-Spanish style shopping arcade, was built around
the Guerra homestead, one of Santa Barbara's most famous
architectural landmarks and one of the stops on the city's ``Red
Tile Tour.'' El Paseo was among the first of the nation's shopping
centers and was the inspiration for the revival of Spanish Colonial
architecture in California.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the oldest shopping center in town _ if not the
state _ is adjacent to Bryant &AMP; Sons jewelers at 812 State St.
Appearances to the contrary, it is an extensive area and requires
some exploring to appreciate its one-of-a-kind small shops and
three restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when actor Leo Carillo would ride his horse
into the El Paseo restaurant, when Rita Hayworth would dance there
before becoming one of Hollywood's leading ladies, or when Tyrone
Power would rent an upstairs hideaway. But the Hollywood crowd
still comes, in limos, Jaguars, and Beemers, while the rest of us
take it all in stride ... as part of the ``Red Tile'' walking tour.
</P>
<P>
   Located in the 800 block of State Street in the heart of
downtown Santa Barbara, the historic site is across the street from
Paseo Nuevo, a Spanish-style shopping plaza built in 1990 over two
city blocks. Not only does it house some 50 retailers, anchored by
Macy's and Nordstrom, but is home to an art museum and theater
group. Several eateries also have found a home here, and during the
summer and the holiday seasons, diners and shoppers are treated to
musical entertainment in flower-bedecked, open-air courtyards.
</P>
<P>
   State Street, which is about six miles long, begins at Stearns
Wharf, the oldest operating wharf on the West Coast, and runs
through town before rejoining Highway 101 north of town.
</P>
<P>
   Often compared to the French and Italian Riviera, ``America's
Riviera,'' the only stretch of Pacific coastline from Alaska to
Cape Horn that runs east and west, is sheltered between mountains
and five channel islands 20 miles offshore. The result: a lush,
tropical, south-facing paradise where red tile and bouganvilla
glow; clean air, stunning scenery, and palm-lined beaches are taken
for granted; street signs bespeak its Spanish heritage; and a
renowned temperate climate reigns 300 days a year.
</P>
<P>
   It's a West Coast city with Old World charm, and if you're into
Spanish/Mediterranean architecture, you'll get your fill here. What
is distinct about Santa Barbara architecture is its blend of
century-old adobe houses, renowned mission churches, and lush
tropical horticulture. Out of these evolved one of America's first
major regional architectural styles _ that of Mission Revival.
</P>
<P>
   However, Santa Barbara didn't always look like this. A
population boom in the 1880s brought a variety of architectural
styles. A legacy of that period and a Victorian landmark, the Upham
Hotel (at 1404 De la Vina) remains the oldest continually operating
hotel in Southern California. Concerned citizens, though, began a
beautification movement to develop a Hispanic Mediterranean image
in the city in 1880; this movement continues.
</P>
<P>
   A major turning point in the city's architectural design was the
'25 quake that razed the majority of dwellings. Following the
temblor, an architectural board of review was established and
developed guidelines that are reflected in the downtown area's
present-day design.
</P>
<P>
   Today, restored 19th-century adobes blend beautifully with the
Mission Revival mansions of nearby Montecito and Hope Ranch, making
Santa Barbara's architecture one of the most recognized in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Barbara, red tile roofs extend from the mountains to
the sea _ a truly visual feast where festivals, music, and the arts
flourish. You need a car to explore the outlying areas, but the
city's 76 designated historic landmarks can easily be explored on
foot via the self-guided, 12-block ``Red Tile Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish-Moorish architectural masterpiece, in the 1100 block
of Anacapa Street, the Santa Barbara County Courthouse was
completed in 1929 and remains one of the most beautiful buildings
in California if not the states. Tropical gardens and spacious,
well-groomed lawns surround the public offices and courtrooms. The
elegant interior includes hand-painted ceilings, wrought-iron
chandeliers, giant murals, carved wooden doors, and imported tiles.
From atop the 80-foot tower, the entire city can be appreciated.
There are free guided tours Wednesday and Friday at 10:30 a.m. and
Monday through Saturday at 2 p.m. It's open weekdays from 8 a.m. to
5 p.m.; Saturday, Sunday and holidays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   Continue across Anacapa Street to the elegant Spanish-style
public library, then head west on Anapamu Street to the Santa
Barbara Museum of Art (at 1130 State St.) where they are adding a
wing, cafe, and more gallery and office space. Construction, which
caused us to miss out on the works of O'Keeffe, Eakins, Sargent,
and Hopper, not to mention Monet, Matisse, Degas, and Chagall, is
expected to be completed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At Carrillo Street, make a side trip to the Hill-Carrillo adobe,
then walk back out to State, and go south two blocks to enter the
El Paseo complex for lots of history and a bit of refreshment.
Rested and raring to go, you continue along Presidio Avenue, the
oldest street in Santa Barbara, to the Presidio gardens on the site
of the parade grounds. There are more stops: the historical museum,
the reconstructed Presidio chapel, the Spanish-deco-style main post
office and the Lobero Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The most visited (and most photographed) landmark in the city,
the Mission Santa Barbara, was founded in 1786 by Spanish
Franciscans and was for many years a home for Chumash Indians whom
the Spaniards trained in agriculture and animal husbandry. The 10th
of Father Junipero Serra's California missions, it has a beautiful
setting, unique twin bell towers, and a lovely facade that have
earned it the title of ``Queen of the Missions.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission was severly damaged in the 1812 and 1925
earthquakes, and after a local fund-raising drive, the structures
were repaired, with the main facade completely rebuilt in the
1950s.

<P>
   In the aftermath of this year's elections, the pundits have
spent a great deal of time discussing the impact of the Black vote
and of the Religious Right vote.
</P>
<P>
   But they have ignored the impact of an equally important group
that actually provided more votes for Democrats than the Religious
Right did for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   This group could be called the Non-Christian Left -- Jews (3
percent of voters), other non-Christians (7 percent), and those
with no religious preference (9 percent).
</P>
<P>
   According to the exit poll conducted by Voter News Service, the
Non-Christian Left made up 19 percent of voters. In contrast,
whites who identify themselves with the Religious Right made up
only 13 percent of all voters. (White Religious Right voters may
belong to any Christian group).
</P>
<P>
   White Religious Right voters were three-to-one Republican, while
Non-Christian Left voters were two-to-one Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three percent of white Religious Right voters went
Republican and 24 percent voted Democratic. Looked at from a
different angle, white Religious Right Republican voters made up
about 9.5 percent of all voters.
</P>
<P>
   Jews voted Democratic by 78 to 21 percent, other non-Christians
by 58 to 33 percent, and those with no religious preference by 65
to 32 percent. This means that Non-Christian Left Democratic voters
accounted for a little more than 12 percent of all voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Religious Right outnumbers the Non-Christian Left only in
the South (by 19 to 15 percent). The two groups are about equal in
the Midwest, where the Religious Right accounts for 13 percent of
voters and the Non-Christian Left accounts for 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the Non-Christian Left is much larger than the Religious
Right in the East and West. In the East, the Non-Christian Left
accounts for 19 percent of voters while the Religious Right
accounts for 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, the Non-Christian Left accounts for 25 percent of
voters while the Religious Right accounts for 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers view blacks -- one of the most religious groups
in America -- as the Democrats' answer to the Religious Right, and
there's no question that high black turnout was a key to many
Democratic victories this year.
</P>
<P>
   But elections are won by coalitions, and the Non-Christian Left
is a key part of the Democratic coalition, along with blacks, a
majority of Catholics, and a decent-sized minority of mainline
white Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   There are several major reasons why the Non-Christian Left votes
heavily Democratic. First, non-Christians are a minority in the
United States and therefore highly sensitive to the rhetoric of the
Religious Right, which often seems to imply that only Christians
can be good Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Non-Christian Left is generally liberal on social
issues such as abortion and gay rights, which it often sees as
linked to minority rights.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, those who make up the Non-Christian Left are far more
likely than the Religious Right to see a positive role for
government in meeting social needs. They don't necessarily think
that a government program is always the best solution, but they are
puzzled by a mindset that celebrates a victory in defeating federal
funds to modernize and build school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Non-Christian Left is a major political force, it
lacks the cohesion -- not to mention the public relations -- of the
Religious Right.
</P>
<P>
   American Jews have long been a potent political force. But no
other non-Christian religion has become highly influential as such,
and there are no organizations representing people with no
religious affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is no umbrella organization attempting
to bring non-Christians together as a unified political force. That
may be just as well; ``The Non-Christian Left'' is probably not the
most potent organizing label ever devised, and those who make it up
share a belief in inclusion with mainline Christians.
</P>
<P>
   But when you see the umpteenth story about the ups and downs of
the Religious Right, it's a good idea to remember that that's not
the whole story.

 SANTA BARBARA, Calif.: ... in the 1950s.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the upper end of Laguna Street at Los Olivos, the building
remains a Catholic parish and is open to the public year-round. A
self-guided tour includes the mission museum, gardens, courtyards,
chapel, cemetery, and gift shop near the entrance. The building is
open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (closed Christmas Day). Tours are
$3 for adults; free for children under 12. Call 805-682-4713.
</P>
<P>
   From the mission, drive up Mission Canyon Road toward the
mountains. At 1212, home to the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, are 5
1/2 miles of bright meadows and creekside canyon paths, woodland,
arroyo, and desert environs, home to true natives of California:
scarlet bugler, blue lobelia, lupine and monkeyflower, Apache plume
and white-meadow foam, indigo ceanothus and California poppy.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1926 by Anna Blaksley Bliss in memory of her
father, Henry, the garden is devoted entirely to the study of
California's native flora from regions including the deserts, the
Sierra Nevada, the southern mountains, and offshore islands. More
than 65 acres provide glimpses of cactuses, redwoods, wildflowers,
and much more.
</P>
<P>
   The garden has an excellent library, research facility, gift
shop with books, souvenirs, native plants, and a home demonstration
garden. The garden is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays and from
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekends March through October; 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
weekdays and 9 to 5 on weekends November to February. Docent-guided
tours lasting approximately an hour are offered daily at 2 p.m. and
Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays at 10:30 a.m. Admission is $3 for
adults, $2 for seniors, teenagers through 17, and students with ID,
and $1 for children 5-12. Admission is free for members and
children under 5. Both the mission and gardens have free parking.
</P>
<P>
   A city with marvelous restaurants (The Wine Cask, Citronelle,
and Downey's, to name a few), it also has farmers' markets for
those who do their own cooking. Every Tuesday, weather permitting,
two blocks of State Street are closed to traffic and opened to
local farmers. From Ortega to Haley, shoppers enjoy a great
selection of flowers and produce as well as street musicians and
some of the best people-watching in the city. Summer hours: 4 to
7:30 p.m.; winter hours: 3 to 6:30 p.m. There are two markets on
Saturdays: fresh fish (7:30 to 11:30 a.m.) at the Breakwater near
the harbor; and salad fixin's, veggies, flowers for your table, and
berries at Santa Barbara Cota Streets (8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Barbara coastline includes dozens of golden sand
beaches, perfect for swimming, sunbathing, strolling, volleyball,
and jogging. Locals seem to think that Goleta, 12 miles west of
here, has one of the best family beaches in South County. It's also
home to the lovely seaside campus of the University of California,
Santa Barbara, and its 19,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty miles offshore, five channel islands attract nearly
500,000 visitors a year, but for anyone staying in town, two
beachfront properties worth visiting (or staying at) are the Four
Seasons Biltmore, a magnificent Spanish-style hotel with grand
tradition, glamour, and luxury; and Fess Parker's Double Tree
Resort (formerly a Red Lion property), a 24-acre, 360-room resort.
The adjacent property is also a Parker project, and until he gets
city approval to build a 150-plus room hotel, under the name Villa
Marcella after his wife Marci, it will continue to be a park.
</P>
<P>
   Down by the shore, the temperature is usually around 72 degrees,
but when it gets warmer plenty of shade can be found under the
Moreton Bay fig tree, the largest tree of its kind in the nation.
At the intersection of Chapala Street and Highway 101, this
Australian native's 160-foot span provides 21,000 square feet of
shade.
</P>
<P>
   On a former oceanfront estate at 500 Ninos Drive off Cabrillo
Boulevard, the Santa Barbara Zoo's delightful garden setting is
home to more than 700 animals from around the world (including big
cats, elephants, gorillas, and giraffes), a new restaurant, a
spacious picnic area, a miniature train, and a children's
playground. The zoo is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission
is $6 for adults and $4 for seniors and children 2-12.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Center, operated by the Museum of Natural History at
Stearns Wharf, offers a fascinating glimpse into marine life of the
Santa Barbara Channel, with live marine animals in saltwater tanks
and a computer learning center. The center is open through Labor
Day, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and September through May, noon to 5 p.m.
Weekends and holidays, the hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. It's closed
major holidays.
</P>
<P>
   In the '40s, the wharf was partly owned by Hollywood legend
Jimmy Cagney and his brothers. Now a Santa Barbara landmark, it
offers gifts and souvenier shops, a fresh seafood market,
restaurants, a bait and tackle store, and other small shops.

   For far too many years, I spent much too much time on the road,
motoring up the Pacific Coast Highway from San Diego, Orange
County, and points south. Always in a hurry. Rushing to visit as
many of Father Serra's missions as possible; taking in Big Sur,
Monterey, Carmel; and stopping at the artichoke and strawberry
fields of Castroville and Watsonville.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't end there. It was on to family and friends in the Bay
Area, the Redwood Empire, and eventually the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Although I was gone for a month, it was too much driving and
much too much to absorb!
</P>
<P>
   This time, I did Father Serra proud. I finally stopped _ and
stayed. Modern-day Santa Barbara is a city much like its climate:
sunny and warm. It's a feel-good city that makes you wonder why it
took you so long to get here.

   In the aftermath of this year's elections, the pundits have
spent a great deal of time discussing the impact of the Black vote
and of the Religious Right vote.
</P>
<P>
   But they have ignored the impact of an equally important group
that actually provided more votes for Democrats than the Religious
Right did for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   This group could be called the Non-Christian Left -- Jews (3

FORMER JAZZ REBEL SHOWS MELLOW SIDE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's an old story, in art as well as in politics: The
fiery young radical matures into a proud keeper of the traditional
flame.
</P>
<P>
   That would certainly seem to be the case with pianist McCoy
Tyner, who performed a jazz concert Friday night in the Cullen
Theater at Wortham Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that Tyner has mellowed considerably since
his percussive, keyboard-pummeling days with John Coltrane's
mind-expanding quartet of the early '60s. His virtuosic range now
encompasses the entire jazz piano repertoire, from easy-swinging
blues and vintage stride to delicate ballads.
</P>
<P>
   Tyner also has suffered of late from occasional lapses of taste.
His current album is an ill-fitting salute to the pop songs of Burt
Bacharach, complete with saccharine string arrangements that clash
with the intense improvisations that have been the hallmark of his
style.
</P>
<P>
   But it's too simple to say that Tyner has undergone a complete
pendulum swing, from bomb-tossing revolutionary to
spirit-constricted reactionary.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he was always the relative traditionalist within
Coltrane's group. When the latter's music pushed beyond the final
frontiers of conventional harmonic structure, Tyner departed.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, he remains quite capable of unleashing a
torrential, soul-cleansing shower of notes when the inspiration
strikes, as it inevitably will.
</P>
<P>
   Tyner's solo appearance _ his first Houston visit in seven years
_ was dubbed a ``Soliloquy,'' after the title of one of his early
'90s albums. And indeed, it appeared at times as if Tyner was
carrying on a conversation with himself at the piano, in dramatic
fashion. The program opened with a toe-tapping, stride-right
reading of the standard ``How Deep Is the Ocean,'' followed by the
ballad ``For All We Know.'' ``The Greeting,'' a Tyner original,
displayed the dense note-clusters and knuckle-busting runs that
have made him one of the most influential pianists of the past 30
years, while ``You Taught My Heart'' to Sing poured forth sheer
lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   The Cullen Theater's pristine acoustics, which have in the past
presented problems of balance for larger jazz groups, splendidly
revealed the tonal contrast between Tyner's powerful left-hand
rhythms and dazzling right-hand filigrees.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the program, Tyner dispensed with the
gracious introductions to get down to serious business at the
keyboard. The only title he announced was ``Miss B,'' written for
his mother, which shifted from a lullabylike melody into a rolling
gospel rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   As with fellow jazz piano legends Art Tatum and Oscar Peterson,
Tyner's technique has become so prodigious that it at times
threatens to overshadow the deep feeling in his playing. To put it
bluntly, this never happened when he was with Coltrane or in the
early years of his solo career.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, would we really want him to still be playing
bombastic, 40-minute modal vamps when he can make just as much if
not more musical sense with a four-minute blues variation? Tyner's
thoroughly personalized approach to the vintage stride style makes
young neo-traditionalists such as Marcus Roberts sound like
schoolkids by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The encore was, fittingly, Coltrane's ``Giant Steps.'' Jazz has
been widely criticized in the last two decades for turning away
from the relentless evolutionary process of the 1920s through the
'70s in favor of formalistic retrenchment. Some have gone so far as
to proclaim the music creatively moribund, best relegated to the
historical realm alongside all those dead European composers.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as true giants such as Tyner are still alive and
stepping, the flame will continue to burn. Not as wild and free as
it once did, perhaps, but with no less integrity and clarity of
vision. &QL;

CHILDREN WHO ARE SILENT IN SCHOOL AREN'T ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Sandra Williams has a bright and talented
10-year-old daughter. The only problem is she won't talk in school
_ not to teachers or friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common reaction is, `What's wrong with that kid?''' said
Williams, who lives in the Albany suburb of Colonie.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is a rare and little understood behavioral disorder
known as selective mutism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a form of social anxiety,'' said R. Lindsey Bergman, a
researcher from the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at
the University of California at Los Angeles. ``It's kids who are
extremely, extremely shy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of us don't like speaking in public. But this condition
goes beyond butterflies in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hugh Johnston, a psychiatrist at the University of
Wisconsin, likens it to being asked to stand up before a strange
crowd and sing the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us likes to come under the scrutiny of others,'' he
said. ``These kids have this very normal phenomena but they have
too much of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams didn't realize her daughter, Samantha, had a problem
until she started getting phone calls from teachers telling her
that Samantha wasn't talking. Initially, she thought it was normal
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our daughter did speak in day care and minimally in
kindergarten,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha speaks perfectly at home, but at school, she writes
notes to friends, who often speak on her behalf. That's the typical
pattern for children with selective mutism, Johnston said. By
definition, they are silent at school and verbal at home, where
they feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain how many children are affected by selective
mutism or what causes it. Researchers believe there may be a
genetic link, passed on by shy or phobic parents. In many cases,
there's no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically nobody has heard of this and everybody thinks
there's something terrible wrong with the child,'' Bergman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some children are misdiagnosed with autism or their parents are
put under scrutiny for abuse. In other cases, well-meaning teachers
and therapists can cause more harm by singling out the children,
humiliating them, or pressuring them.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the problem gets more complicated with time, as the
children develop a reputation in school for not talking. That makes
them even more reluctant to speak because they know everybody will
be listening.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's no quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``What works for one kid won't necessarily work for another,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment varies, from therapy to medication, to a combination
of both.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that children treated with a class of
anti-anxiety drugs, including Prozac, Luvox and Zoloft, often show
the fastest improvement. The theory is the medications help
diminish the child's fear of speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Other children grow out of the condition, usually at puberty.
``They realize at some point that not talking draws more scrutiny
than talking a little bit,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was shy herself as a child, no longer dwells on
why her daughter developed selective mutism. Instead, she's
focusing her efforts on starting a selective mutism support group
in the Albany area so parents can share information and overcome
the isolation that comes with disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe Samantha is the only child who suffers from
this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she's grateful her daughter, now a
fifth-grader, is making some progress after 18 months of medication
and therapy. Though Samantha still won't speak in school, she will
talk to friends on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a baby step, but at least it's a start,'' Williams said.

   LOS OLIVOS, Calif. _ If you have time, explore Santa Barbara's
neighboring communities, notably:
</P>
<P>
   _Los Olivos, where they filmed the TV movie ``Return to
Mayberry'' with Andy Griffith and Ron Howard.
</P>
<P>
   _Montecito, a favorite hideaway of the rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   _Solvang, the ``Danish capital of America.''
</P>
<P>
   _Carpinteria, a beach town with old-fashioned luxury.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Los Olivos &LR; , 28 miles north of Santa Barbara in the unhurried
Santa Ynez Valley, is a charming turn-of-the-century town that
bears reminders of stagecoach days. Nestled between the San Rafael
and Santa Ynez mountain ranges, it is a serene, scenic delight,
surrounded by pastoral farmland and rolling hills. Yet, Los Olivos
(the olives) is fast becoming a thriving cultural giant, boasting
fine art galleries, shops, and first-class wineries, including Fess
Parker's, one of nine out on the Foxen Canyon Wine Trail, a 20-mile
stretch of country road that connects the Santa Ynez and Santa
Maria Valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The winding, mountainous drive on Highway 154 (off 101) over the
San Marcos Pass presents breathtaking views, from coastal panoramas
to verdant pastures. You pass Cold Springs Tavern, an old
stagecoach stop atop the pass; vineyards; horse farms; and man-made
Lake Cachuma, just a wonderful spot for fishing, boating,
picnicking, and camping. Sorry, no swimming but there is a pool and
play area nearby. Boat rentals are available as well as seasonal
eagle and wildlife cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Don't leave town without visiting Mattei's Tavern, the oldest
continuously operating restaurant in the Santa Ynez Valley and the
second oldest in California. Mattei's was established in 1886 by
Lucy and Felix Mattei as a stagecoach stop. It now serves as the
town's social hub.
</P>
<P>
   Los Olivos makes for a delightful day trip. Overnighters,
however, will be pleasantly surprised with Fess Parker's Wine
Country Inn (formerly the Grand Hotel), a luxurious Victorian
hideaway. For reservations call 800-446-2455.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Montecito  &LR; (Spanish for little mountain) is an exclusive area
east of Santa Barbara with wooded hills dotted with expansive
estates; magnificent mansions; lush, exotic gardens; quiet
tree-lined country lanes; and a lovely little downtown area with
quaint shops, Mediterranean-style restaurants, and the 60-room
Montecito Inn, built by Charlie Chap-lin and friends to cater to
the Hollywood crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Enough can't be said about this plush _ and posh _ area.
Everything is done in such good taste.
</P>
<P>
   Referred to as the Gold Coast, I did come across one real estate
listing for less than $500,000 _ the rest are in the ``if you have
to ask, you can't afford them'' category. An estate, owned by
actress Geena Davis and director Rennie Harlan, reportedly sold for
$9.2 million, but if you're looking for something less expensive,
Whoopi Goldberg's 180-acre ranch _ the former John Deere family
retreat atop San Marcos Pass _ is on the market for a paltry $1.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Italian and California cuisine dominate Coast Village Road,
while picnickers and beachgoers flock to Tutti's for takeout. But
for someplace extra special, take in the 540-acre San Ysidro Ranch
out on San Ysidro Lane. This is where some of Hollywood's biggest
stars escape from the limelight. It's not uncommon to see them
strolling in its lush, flower-laden grounds or relaxing in one of
the ranch's 21 private cottages. The new ``presidential'' cottage,
by the way, with two bedrooms, two baths, plus living room and 15
by 35 foot private swimming pool and spa, won't be ready until the
fall. Cost: $975 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The 103-year-old ranch, named for the patron saint of farmers,
hosted John and Jacqueline Kennedy on their 1953 honeymoon, and the
Wedding Garden served as the site where Lawrence Olivier and Vivien
Leigh exchanged vows.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch's Stonehouse Restaurant offers regional cuisine while
the Plow &AMP; Angel Pub, built in 1893 as the original wine cellar,
offers cocktails and a casual dinner menu.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Solvang &LR; , &UR;  &LR; founded in 1911 by a group of Danish educators from
the Midwest, represents a page from a Hans Christian Andersen story
and remains an authentic Danish settlement where the heritage and
customs of the Old World live on. Among them, the ``Rejsegilde,'' a
celebration at the raising of the highest rafter of a new building.
This tradition is observed with most new construction in the area,
spreading throughout the non-Danish population of the Santa Ynez
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Tours are provided daily in the spring, summer, and fall and on
weekends in the winter aboard the Honen (the Hen), a replica of an
early 1900s Copenhagen street car powered by a pair of massive
Belgian horses.
</P>
<P>
   Also: two museums; a repertory theater; Mission Santa Ines, the
19th of 21 Spanish missions founded in 1804. And if you're into
ranch living, The Alisal Guest Ranch and Resort, a 10,000-acre
working cattle ranch and resort 35 miles northwest of Santa
Barbara, offers all the romance of the Old West with the comforts
of a world-class resort. The visitors bureau can be reached at
800-468-6765.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Carpinteria &LR; 's small-town charm (and that of neighboring
 &UR; Summerland &LR; ) remains relatively undiscovered, yet the home of
California's Avocado Festival, held every October, is a mere 12
miles south of Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   If you're into polo, matches are held every Sunday April through
October, yet its main attraction remains Carpinteria State Beach
Park with 4,000 feet of ocean frontage, overnight camping, and the
best surf fishing for miles around.
</P>
<P>
   Antique stores, small shops, and restaurants are clustered along
the main street. There are a variety of year-round motels, B&AMP;Bs,
and beachfront rentals. For more information, call the Chamber of
Commerce at 805-684-5479.

`TITANIC' DIRECTOR SAILS ON WITH PROJECTS THAT MAY INCLUDE `APES'
REDO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  EDITORS: Photo of James Cameron available on New York Times photo
service. 
 
By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When James Cameron made his first visit to Houston
last week, he came as conquering hero: as director of Hollywood's
top money-maker, ``Titanic,'' and as self-proclaimed ``king of the
world'' when it cleaned up on Oscar night.
</P>
<P>
   But Cameron didn't come here as a director. He came here as an
actor _ and a humble one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron did his acting as part of TheatreVision, a new process
that enables blind persons to hear audio descriptions of films via
wireless earpieces as they're shown in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Titanic,'' Cameron split reading duties with actress Angie
Dickinson, recording his lines in a Los Angeles studio.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first director to read for his own film in the 4
{-year history of TheatreVision, which ventured beyond Los Angeles
for the first time with last week's Houston screening of
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting and challenging,'' Cameron said before
screening his acting debut. (Well, he did appear briefly in
``Titanic's'' steerage dance scene and played himself once on ``Mad
About You.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Cameron, 44, thrives behind the camera. He has written,
directed, produced, edited and worked as a camera operator and art
director on films since he broke into the business in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   As director, he's had a nonstop string of hits: ``The
Terminator,'' ``Aliens,'' ``The Abyss,'' ``Terminator 2: Judgment
Day,'' ``True Lies'' and ``Titanic,'' winning Oscars for the last
as director, producer and editor.
</P>
<P>
   Long active in his films' video campaigns, he's unveiled added
footage for ``Aliens'' and ``The Abyss'' on laserdisc and may do
the same for ``Titanic.'' Cameron also has taped optional audio
tracks for laserdisc, offering his analyses as his movie plays.
</P>
<P>
   But his TheatreVision reading was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only voice work, but it's still acting, and you have to
put something into it,'' he said. ``You have to try to conjure up
the drama of the narrative.''
</P>
<P>
   Though blind people can glean much from a film's music, dialogue
and sound effects, ``a lot of the mood also comes from the way you
say the words,'' Cameron said. ``You can't just read them in a
monotone.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the script supplied by TheatreVision is written with
artistry in mind.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Titanic's'' opening scenes of a deep-sea dive, Cameron is
heard ominously saying, ``The sonar screen sketches the ocean's
terrain in bright colors. A man peers through a porthole searching
the watery darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   After the screening, he fretted that his voice sometimes
overlapped the dialogue _ which TheatreVision tries to avoid _ but
said, ``That can't be helped sometimes. It can take longer to
describe something than it takes to happen on screen.''
</P>
<P>
   His only real problem, he said self-deprecatingly, ``was that I
got tired of hearing my own boring voice drone on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron still hasn't chosen his follow-up to ``Titanic.'' He's
been linked to a possible remake of ``Planet of the Apes'' and a
lavish big-screen treatment of comics hero Spider-Man.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect the latter anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spider-Man is all tangled up,'' Cameron said, with a quip the
web-slinger's fans can appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Apes,'' ``It's a possibility,'' he said. Yet Cameron
may just produce the film, not also direct, yielding that job (if
rumors are right) to Michael Bay of ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's still riding high on the success of ``Titanic,''
which includes enjoying a new friendship with the cast's Gloria
Stuart, 88.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gloria's great,'' Cameron said. ``We have dinner about once a
month and just hang out. She cracks me up, and she's gotten to be
good friends with my girlfriend'' (Suzy Amis, who played Stuart's
granddaughter in the film).
</P>
<P>
   To date, ``Titanic'' has grossed more than $1.8 billion
worldwide and is selling millions of copies on video.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount hasn't set a date yet for its release on the
sophisticated and burgeoning new DVD format. Paramount officials
will only say that ``Titanic's'' DVD release is ``inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron already is exploring that avenue anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're just scratching the surface on what you can do
with DVD, in terms of additional functions,'' Cameron said. ``But
DVD's capacity is not unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sort of run up against a wall on `Titanic.' I want to
try to get it onto one disc. To me it kind of defeats the purpose
to have two discs'' (since the film has no intermission).
</P>
<P>
   Yet two discs may be needed for the 194-minute ``Titanic'' on
DVD, just as two tapes are needed for VHS.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron is enthusiastic, however, about DVD's option of
switching between a widescreen image and the ``pan and scan''
format normally seen on TV and video.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's one of the cool things about DVD, getting the
widescreen and pan-and-scan versions on the same disc,'' he said.
``That way, you don't have to make that decision at the point of
purchase. You can sample both later.''
</P>
<P>
   This would apply especially to ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to the nature of the film Cameron used, Super 35mm, the
picture is larger at the top and bottom for pan-and-scan than it is
for widescreen. So each format offers visual information that the
other does not.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron tries to serve both formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with today's widescreen consciousness on video, I'd say
less than 20 percent of people buy widescreen as a choice. And you
can't tool all your thinking for 20 percent of your audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron thinks DVD also ``could very easily'' accommodate an
optional audio track for TheatreVision, enabling blind people to
enjoy such films at home, too.
</P>
<P>
   For theaters, the studios still need cooperation from movie
exhibitors, ``and that's the next big challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater owners generally will resist something new because it
means expenses for the equipment,'' Cameron said. ``I don't know
what it would cost them, but for the studios the cost is relatively
inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies are for everybody, and I would love for people who are
visually impaired or blind to enjoy my films as much as everybody
else.'' &QL;

DESIRE, DISCIPLINE AND DRIVE: AUTHOR ANITA BUNKLEY LAYS OUT THE
GROUND RULES FOR SUCCESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  EDITORS: Photo moving on the New York Times photo service. 
 
By BARBARA KARKABI 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confident and poised, Anita Bunkley sits on a white sofa in the
comfortable living room of her Alief home. With five novels and,
most recently, a nonfiction book under her belt, she is the picture
of success.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't always been the case. Back in the 1980s, Bunkley was
a divorced single mom balancing two jobs and raising two preteen
daughters. It was not, she says, a high point in her creative life.
But hidden deep inside her was a dream _ to write historical novels
aimed at African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   One night she found herself at a party attended by a well-known
Hollywood filmmaker. Bunkley timidly told him she was a teacher,
but really wanted to write novels someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you waiting for?'' the director asked her. ``Call
yourself a writer. How else are you ever going to become one?''
</P>
<P>
   Bunkley took his advice and stopped putting off her dream. Her
experiences and those of other successful women who often took
risks to achieve their goals are the basis of Bunkley's latest
book, ``Steppin' Out With Attitude: Sister, Sell Your Dream!''
(HarperCollins, $12.50).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's written from my perspective as an African-American
woman,'' Bunkley said. ``But it is also multicultural, because I
talked to all kinds of women doing research. I don't think it's a
self-esteem problem so much as the fact that women are very
concerned about looking and acting appropriately. They don't want
to look pushy, aggressive or vain. But I think you can get out
there and speak, as long as you have the attitude that `I'm
grateful for my talents.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After Bunkley decided to stop dreaming and start her writing
life, she joined a writer's group and began researching a story.
Originally from Ohio, she was intrigued by the tale of the
beautiful mulatto Emily, who according to legend was the ``Yellow
Rose of Texas'' in the song of the same name. Bunkley went to the
library to look for a book about her and found there was none. So,
she decided Emily`s mysterious story would become her first book.
</P>
<P>
   Like many aspiring writers, Bunkley researched and wrote at
night and on weekends. After taking a course in self-publishing,
she eventually decided to publish ``Emily'' herself. She originally
printed 1,000 copies to see if there was any interest and then
printed another 10,000. Bunkley still has one of the first copies
tucked away on a living room bookshelf. Pulling it out, she thumbed
through it nostalgically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishing my own book was one of the hardest things I have
ever done,'' Bunkley said. ``I had to get in the car and drive
around with the book to all the bookstores. I had to fly places and
talk to people. I spent a lot of money, but it was worth it. I
scraped a lot and drove an old car when people were buying new
cars. But I wanted to do it, so I never grumbled.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, she emphasizes in ``Steppin' Out With Attitude,'' part
of a well-thought-out plan. Bunkley broke even and maybe made a few
thousand on ``Emily,'' but it got her name out. The next book she
started researching was ``Black Gold,'' set in 1920s Texas. Bunkley
sent the first 50 pages to a competition at the University of
Texas/Dallas and won first place. An agent saw it and suggested
Bunkley send it to her when she was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Bunkley did just that, and the agent got her a six-figure,
two-book contract with Penguin USA. That was in 1992, and Bunkley
was able to devote herself to full-time writing. Bunkley, who loves
to talk to readers at bookstores and enjoys making speeches, also
started lecturing and doing workshops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would talk to the women while selling my books, and I met a
lot of people who wanted to find out how to market books,'' Bunkley
said. ``I did a workshop called `Don't Be Shy,' because I really
think you are selling yourself when you are selling books. Books
are very personal, and I think if you know the author you are more
likely to buy the book. That has been my experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women also were asking her how to promote themselves or get
more visibility in their companies. Others would talk about their
dreams of opening a business. So Bunkley decided to put together a
``Steppin' Out With Attitude'' workshop that eventually led to the
book _ a collection of success stories as well as practical tips,
worksheets and a step-by-step program for achieving goals.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of gathering her material, Bunkley interviewed
125 women around the country about their experiences. She
ultimately ended up using about 52 stories _ including those of
Houston City Councilwoman Martha Wong, African-American historian
Patricia Smith Prather, Realtor Beth Wolff and fashion designer
Toni Whittaker. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get the stories of women who had a dream, and
their attitudes,'' Bunkley said. ``I wanted to know what they
thought was important to them, how they started out, what they did
when they ran into problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunkley's book starts with the premise that everyone has good
things going for them. She advises building on your assets and
making a list of skills _ are you organized, patient, good with
ideas? Her guide is then divided into what she calls the ``three
D's'' _ desire, discipline and drive.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with ``desire,'' she says it's important to embrace
your dream, whatever it is, then draft your personal mission
statement and find a new angle to make your product or talent stand
out.
</P>
<P>
   Then you need some ``discipline'' to make things happen. Stick
with your dream, she says. Don't create excuses to lose. Distance
yourself from negative feelings. And never burn bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The third element is ``drive.'' Don't turn and run when faced
with a problem, be mentally prepared, plan for wealth, learn the 10
commandments of networking, stay informed and embrace the applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting when I ask people what keeps them going.
Someone might say: `I wanted to prove to my father I could be a
city council person' or `I've been trying to write this book for 10
years, and I am going to do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent signing at a Washington, D.C., bookstore,
Bunkley met a woman who was employed as a computer programmer but
mentioned that she was really a massage therapist. Her dream was to
open a massage center. Bunkley told her: `` `You are exactly what
I'm talking about. Give me your card. I'm on the road all the time
and always need a massage.' Sometimes I think people are afraid of
success, often because they are afraid of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunkley emphasizes that she doesn't want to make anything _
career changes, writing books, opening a business _ sound easy. It
takes a lot of hard work, combined with a business plan. But she
does believe dreams can be achieved, if you go about it in a
rational way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day people publish books and open businesses,'' she
said. ``It goes back to desire, discipline and drive. Do you really
want it? Think it through carefully, and don't leave your job 'til
you have a plan. It took me two years of planning and studying
before I published `Emily.' But I also found that once people know
what your dream is, they are ready to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Bunkley's life is exactly the way she wants it. She's
been married to businessman Crawford Bunkley for 11 years, her
children are grown, and she is enjoying her first grandchild.
Bunkley loves being able to combine lecturing, traveling and
writing, and enjoys the variety of women and men that she meets
while selling her books. On the wall of her upstairs study are
framed letters from Dan Rather and the late Alex Haley. Behind her
desk are shelves holding copies of her six books. It's an exciting
time, she said, to be talking about books.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Steppin' Out' was my first nonfiction. I'm glad I took a
break and did it,'' she said. ``But I will probably go back to
fiction. For my next project, I would like to rework and republish
`Emily, the Yellow Rose.' That was my first book, and it's been out
of print now for four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunkley is, she says, very grateful for her life and gifts. &QL;

IN CANADA, TREMBLANT IS TOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has spent much midwinter time in Quebec's St.
Lawrence country knows the meaning of cold. It can be bitter,
especially for those who have not made with some extraordinary
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   We get that out of the way first because its proximity to the
Arctic Circle is about the worst thing one can find to say about
Tremblant, one of the top-ranked ski areas in North America.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way. After its early glory days half a
century ago, Mont Tremblant (new owners have since dropped the
``Mont'') began a long slide into ordinariness.
</P>
<P>
   Those returning to the area after an absence of a few years are
struck by the transformation. When the Canadian-based Intrawest
bought the area, it poured on the investment capital for such a
thorough make-over that few recognize the old Mont Tremblant.
</P>
<P>
   The retrofit on the mountain included new trails and on-mountain
facilities, a state-of-the-art snowmaking system, and new
high-speed lifts.
</P>
<P>
   But the most astounding reformation has been the village that
has brought Tremblant back to its former status as a premier
destination resort. Seeking more than a mere instant ski theme
park, Intrawest designers created their concept of the new
Tremblant based on the European style of the old Quebec city.
</P>
<P>
   Narrow streets, multicolored and styled condos _ all quaint in a
Tyrolean sort of way _ fabulous restaurants and shops, and all the
modern facilities such as pools and health clubs lift the new
Tremblant village to a solid leap above anything else in the East.
Beneath all that village quaintness is the modern convenience of a
large underground garage servicing the hotels, condos, and
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Tremblant, a two-sided mountain, is varied enough so that groups
of varying ability can travel there together and find plenty of
decent terrain. On the south side, beginners start on the Flying
Mile lift and work at a number of runs just above the ken of
absolute newcomers. La Passe and Nansen, La Crete and Roy Scott are
some terrific runs for newer skiers and boarders.
</P>
<P>
   There is a rope tow and the Cabriolet lift that serves as a fine
first-timer slope where lessons are underway constantly. The best
thing about this area is how isolated it is from the main traffic
flow, alowing the new skiers freedom from hotshots whizzing past.
</P>
<P>
   From advanced beginner to solid intermediate, Tremblant is at
its best. Most skiers in this range like the broad open blue
cruisers, and that is what they get with runs like Grand Prix and
Alpine. Some of the mogul runs are gentle enough, and some of the
steep areas groomed well enough so that low-end intermediates can
cut their teeth to new alternatives to the paved boulevard approach
to terminal intermediacy.
</P>
<P>
   While the double black diamonds are rightly marked _ they are
challenging _ the single blacks offer a whole range of advanced
intermediate terrain, including an oddity, Cure Deslauriers, which
is a rhythmic, wavy descent that feels as close to a snowboard park
as anyone riding two boards is likely to get. Le Tunnel and Banzi
are good challenging advanced terrain, while other blacks fail to
live up to that rating.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the double blacks do live up to their billing. The area
called the Edge on the North side of the mountain is served by a
quad chair that has no bailout below the level of strong
intermediate skiing. Aside from one cut trail, the rest of the
skiing here is ungroomed glades, some of them dropping straight
down the fall lines in dense woods. Also on this side are some
steep bump trails like Dynamite and Expo.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Tremblant has 11 lifts _ five high-speed quads _
servicing 500 acres, all of it open to boarders as well as skiers.
For information, call 800-461-8711.

STICK WITH STOCKS FOR THE LONG HAUL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't have to say, ``I told you so.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll let the numbers do that.
</P>
<P>
   When the stock market started its tumble in the summer, I and
investment professionals told jittery investors that they should
keep their eye on their long-term investment plan and not let daily
market gyrations cause them to vamoose from stocks. The market
would come back.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past month, it has. Stocks, as measured by the
bellwether Dow Jones industrial average, are just 3.9 percent below
their July 17 record close of 9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow has recovered from a decline of almost 20 percent from
its July high in late August.
</P>
<P>
   After yanking their money out of stock mutual funds in October _
when the market was rallying _ investors have poured back in a big
way.
</P>
<P>
   Investors poured a net $4.51 billion into stock funds in the
week ended Wednesday, their largest inflow in four months,
according to AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif., which tracks fund
flows. Most of the money went to growth funds and international
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of small companies, which were battered during the
market's swoon, gained an average 28.9 percent from Oct. 8 through
Nov. 5, according to Lipper Analytical Services in New York, which
tracks stock funds.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, small stocks wrapped up their best four weeks Friday in
at least 20 years, helping many money managers do what they haven't
done for five years: Beat their benchmark, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 Index, a benchmark of small and
midcapitalization companies, surged 29 percent since Oct. 8 _ the
best four weeks for the index since it was created in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, 75 percent of diversified equity mutual
funds outperformed the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bad timing abounds &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those who get in now missed a month when the average domestic
stock mutual fund gained an average 22.7 percent from Oct. 8
through Nov. 5, according to Lipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market timers are just doomed to failure,'' said Ivy McLemore,
spokesman for Aim Management Group in Houston, a mutual fund firm.
``It's kind of like juggling nitroglycerin; it's great to tell your
friends that you do it, but if you have one bad day, it hurts a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how much it could hurt. If you invested $10,000 in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's index on Sept. 30, 1993, your $10,000 would have
grown to $24,785 by the end of this past September, according to
Aim. That's an average annual total return of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But if you were out of the market during the 10 best days in
that five-year period, your return would have slid to 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people tend to chase recent performance, they tend to buy
in peaks and sell out at troughs, so they cost themselves money,''
said Scott Cooley, an analyst at Morningstar Mutual Funds in
Chicago, which tracks fund performance. ``It really does emphasize
the desirability of a disciplined investing plan.''
</P>
<P>
   This is called dollar cost averaging, which calls for you to
invest a fixed amount of dollars in securities at set intervals.
</P>
<P>
   That enables you to buy more shares when the price is low and
fewer shares when the price is high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across all investment categories, the returns that investors
actually earned were lower than they would have been had they done
dollar-cost averaging, because they tend to buy hot areas and sell
them when they turn cold,'' Cooley said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Market's attitude changing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mindset of the market has started to change from the summer,
when gyrations in world financial markets caused investors to
shrink away from investments that had even the slightest risk and
go into safer U.S. Treasury securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is as much uncertainty now,'' said Henry
Lartigue, chief investment officer of Chase Bank of Texas in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Your best move is to devise a disciplined investment plan that
enables you to invest a fixed amount of money consistently. Stick
to that, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   Staying focused on what you want to accomplish with your money
in the long run will keep you from panicking.
</P>
<P>
   Cut out these rules, paste them in front of your personal
computer or telephone and refer to them when you feel the urge to
follow the pack:
</P>
<P>
   Don't let panic dictate your investment strategy because nobody
knows what the market will do.
</P>
<P>
   Don't presume that rushing into stocks now will make you rich,
because November won't guarantee more happy markets through the end
of the year.

BARENAKED LADIES PROVES TO BE DAZZLING IN CONCERT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE CRAWFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Let's get the obligatory Barenaked Ladies facts out of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   First, they're geeks. Many articles describe them as slightly
older versions of those nerdy Dungeons &AMP; Dragons players you sort
of acknowledged in high school. (Before you get riled up, yes, I
was one, too. I just forgot to become a pop star.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, they're Canadian. But they aren't like Canadian rock
gods Rush or Triumph. More like Bob and Doug McKenzie of ``Strange
Brew'' fame or the Kids in the Hall mixed with bits of Oingo Boingo
(who, by the way, were NOT Canadian) and a lot of common pop sense.
</P>
<P>
   On an album, this formula can be entertaining, though ultimately
a little stifling. Sometimes there's just too much going on _ too
much sunny melody, too much propulsiveness, way too much
cleverness.
</P>
<P>
   In the concert setting, though, it comes out as a heady brew. As
evidenced at the Aerial Theater in Houston on Sunday night,
Barenaked Ladies are one of the more entertaining live acts around
_ they certainly were a hit with the alarmingly youthful audience.
</P>
<P>
   The fun starts with their stage banter _ always genial,
lightning-quick and knife-sharp, and often gut-bustingly hilarious.
Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   The ``Meet the Security Guard'' segment, in which
guitarist/vocalist Ed Robertson coaxed a reluctant _ but gargantuan
_ guard named Andre to strum Robertson's guitar for an impromptu
reading of Lenny Kravitz's ``Are You Gonna Go My Way.''
</P>
<P>
   The risque ``Hello Houston'' rap involved pick-up trucks,
intimate behavior in said pickup trucks, the Johnson Space Center,
a Canadian astronaut and various scatological themes.
</P>
<P>
   Multitalented bassist Jim Creeggan's midshow bass solo _ upright
bass, that is _ which sounded like the Kronos Quartet playing a
mind-meld of ``Itsy Bitsy Spider'' and ``Hava Nagila.'' Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   While vastly entertaining, such elements would be pretty weak if
not backed by BNL's edgy and increasingly polished pop. These guys
know how to take a hook and dig all the way to China with it.
</P>
<P>
   The show, as expected, focused largely on the band's most recent
album, ``Stunt.'' The songs from that album translated well to the
live setting, particularly the manic ``Who Needs Sleep'' and
``Alcohol,'' and the plaintive ``I'll Be That Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the band delivered a rather lackluster rendition of
their cranial parasite of a smash-hit song, ``One Week.'' It lacked
the irresistible sparkle of the studio version. Maybe they're a
little sick of it. &QL;

A BAY STATE DOUGHBOY'S DIARY OF WAR _ AND PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: For Wednesday A.M. release)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eighty years ago today, a Massachusetts soldier wrote home from
the front line in France. He'd never seen a party like it,
celebrating the end of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the wildest of wild nights, and the noisiest night
before the (July) 4th in Worcester cannot be compared to what is
going on here right now ... What a place this, tonight, the first
night of peace. Turn a town of absolute darkness and solitude and
misery into a town all lit-up, with 2,000 French and 500 American
soldiers running around, 90 percent of them drunk and singing, and
blowing bugles ... There is a big chateau situated on the side of
the hill here decorated with jack o'lanterns.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter came from Joe Rodier, 24, with one year's enlistment
under his belt, a Worcester Polytechnic student who'd signed up
with the 24th Engineers, writing to his sister Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   He kept a detailed diary, beginning with a late-February trip
across the North Atlantic in a troop ship carrying ``9,100 men and
big cargo.'' It was ``very hot'' in the hold; ``two men died, 30
cases of scarlet fever and 100 cases of measles on board.'' The
troops kept watch for German submarines. A Wisconsin soldier who
died of diphtheria was buried at sea. ``Many men sick and epidemic
feared.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe avoided the ``hot rat-hole'' where he had to sleep as much
as possible, staying on deck despite ``a sore foot, a bad stomach,
a tooth-ache, and a nose-bleed. Otherwise feeling fine. Very poor
eats.'' The men worried after word that a transport 40 miles ahead
had been sunk. One drill called to practice evacuating ``the rat
hole'' took Joe's cohort 25 minutes to file on deck. ``Every man
lost 10 pounds as he pictured himself going down ...'' March 3:
``Torpedo crossed our bow in the dark. Another sub nearly ran into
us ... The darkest night I ever saw in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Landing at Brest, his outfit hiked six hours with full packs to
``a swell-looking `rest camp' built by Napoleon in 1810 for his
soldiers ... nothing in the barracks except boards ... very cold
and damp in the barracks. Napoleon walked in about 10, followed by
Lafayette and Joan d'Arc about 11 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   July 1 found his outfit at Nancy, for their first view of gutted
buildings and hostile artillery fire. His unit was the first
American outfit to arrive. ``Greeted and cheered royally
everywhere. Quite a bit of shooting going on.''
</P>
<P>
   As the action gets hotter, his handwriting becomes less precise.
July 4: ``Big doings this evening with searchlights, bombs, shells,
etc.'' July 18 he clocked ``train after train, every 15 minutes''
rushing allied reinforcements to the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turning point of war'' is a bold phrase he underlines four
times, drawing an American flag for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   Joe's daughter, Ruth Gilmartin of East Falmouth, sent a copy of
some of his diary pages. One of his lucky days was Friday the 13th
of September. In neat handwriting it begins: ``American offensive
started here at 4:30 a.m. Counted 34 Allied planes in sky at one
time. Big Advance made.'' Then, an exuberant scrawl: ``RED SOX WIN
WORLD SERIES.''
</P>
<P>
   The entry for the 14th reverts to the grim business of war:
``Capture of 8,000 prisoners and much materiel. Big success all
along this front. St. Mihiel retaken after four years of German
rule. Confession to a French priest. Heavy artillery all night.''
</P>
<P>
   By Oct. 2, with peace less than six weeks off, Joe's diary
entries start to run diagonally across the page. With a renewed
Allied offensive spanning a 150-mile segment of the front, Joe
allows himself to speculate on when the war will end. ``Public
opinion is that fighting will cease before winter. I think not. He
(the German foe) has got to be licked.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 9: Cold and disease take their toll. ``More deaths from
Spanish Grippe.'' Making the rounds of civilian houses to pay
laborers, ``found things there in a most filthy condition and
everybody sick. Foggy night. Boche (artillery fire) overhead for an
hour but could not find me.'' The next Sunday, it's ``Mass, 9:15
a.m. Rain. Work.'' But he allows himself a dollop of hope: ``Looks
like an early peace.''
</P>
<P>
   By Nov. 4, his writing explodes off the diary page: ``Armistice
signed with Austria. Takes effect at 3 p.m. today. Hurrah.
Everybody drunk. Germany wants peace. Good health. Raining weather.
Artillery fire ...'' Next day, it's ``artillery duels all day and
night.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 10, Joe begins his day with confession. ``The day of
days,'' he writes. ``Kaiser abdicates. Revolution and defeat in
Germany. The war is won. Greatest of rejoicing ... Germany is done
forever ... Artillery fire all night. Heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fateful day of Armistice, at the 11th hour of the 11th
day of the 11th month, the war finally ends. ``Another day of
days,'' commences Joe. ``Armistice signed with Germany to take
effect at 11 a.m. this date. Great manifestations. Towns lighted up
at night. Everybody drunk, even to the dog. Moonlight, cool night
and not a shot heard ... Everybody happy, and another good feed.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Rodier was lucky, like millions of other American soldiers,
sailors, and airmen we salute today for having won and rewon the
freedoms we enjoy today. They made the free world what it has
become, the triumph of civilization to this juncture. But there
were so many who never came home like Joe did. He was discharged in
1919, married in '21, worked at the Registry of Motor Vehicles,
raised eight kids. He died at 53.
</P>
<P>
   In the century's major conflicts, this many Yanks perished:
</P>
<P>
   World War I 116,500
</P>
<P>
   World War II 405,399
</P>
<P>
   Korea 54,246
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam 58,000
</P>
<P>
   So many lives sacrificed. Which is why this tribute ends the way
Joe signed his Armistice Day letter to his sister: ``Your loving
and living brother, Joe.''

SAN FRANCISCO LEADERS CONDEMN PIE ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Members of the Board of Supervisors have
condemned two recent pie-throwing attacks on the mayor and a
supervisor, allegedly carried out by members of an environmental
organization that want to draw attention to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a laughing matter,'' Supervisor Michael Yaki said
Monday. ``It's an assault on people. It's an assault on public
officials. It's an assault on government.''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Gavin Newsom was struck in the face on election
night, and Mayor Willie Brown was hit a few days later. Four
people, who belong to a group that calls itself the Biotic Baking
Brigade, have been arrested for attacking the mayor. The group
throws baked goods at famous people to draw attention to
environmental and social causes.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Amos Brown introduced a resolution on Monday's
declaring that the city ``will not tolerate assaults on public
officials.'' He also called for stepped-up police security for the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The act of throwing a pie, he said, may seem harmless enough,
but the consequences of someone charging at an elected leader could
have been devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if that person had a gun or a knife?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newsom, hit outside his victory party on election night, called
the incident ``unnerving.'' At first he wasn't going to press
charges against the assailants, but changed his mind when the mayor
was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, I regret (not filing charges), only because,
obviously, of the incident that happened a few days later to the
mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Biotic Baking Brigade said they targeted Brown
because of his policies on homeless people. They also have claimed
responsibility for hitting Newsom with pies.

bone-thin children play in the open sewers that twist through the

present. And, for this reporter, it means it's a place that's hard
to get out of your head after returning to the world's richest
country. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   VETERAN _ The macabre vision is 80 years old but remains
shockingly alive in James Lindsey's brain. On the edge of a bomb
crater, a legless German soldier sits upright in death, staring
ahead like he awaits for Lindsey's unit. The dead man's pack is
still strapped to his back, propping him up. In his pack, the
soldier carries a rotten loaf of bread and three photos: one with
three proud mustashioed men in uniform. Another has one of those
men posing with a woman and a small boy. The third has the woman
alone with the boy. ``I think it was his wife and baby,'' said
Lindsey, a reed-thin, 102-year-old Jonesboro resident who in 1918
was an artillery gunner with American Expeditionary Forces as the
Yanks blasted through a tough but sagging German Army. Feature on
Lindsey, one of a dwindling number of World War I vets, tied to
Veterans Day on Wednesday, which was originally Armistice Day,
celebrating the end of World War I. (Torpy, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTO
</P>
<P>
   MEMORIAL _ The year was 1967. The place was the highlands of
South Vietnam. Sweating and nervous, Richard Cruz and 15 other U.S.
soldiers sat near an open field, waiting under the clear, bright 2
a.m. sky, straining for the slightest sound or sight of the enemy.
When the machine gunners who were supposed to keep watch fell
asleep, four or five Viet Cong crept up slowly on the men and began
hurling grenades into the blackness. Seconds later, shrapnel
pierced Cruz' legs, back, knees and eyes. Cruz was one of the lucky
ones _ he lost no limbs and eventually regained sight in his right
eye. But many Hays County residents lost their lives in Vietnam and
other 20th- century wars. Now, more than 30 years later, Cruz does
not want their lives forgotten. A Veteran's War Memorial in San
Marcos will list their names. His plan is to sell personalized
bricks to people and raise the money for the monument. (Rodriguez,
Austin American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   DDN-VETERAN _ On Veterans Day, John Whitt of Springboro is
asking for help. The Air Force veteran was exposed to radiation
during above-ground nuclear testing in Nevada in the early 1950s.
As a serviceman he watched the explosions and, when on leave with
buddies, explored the mountains near Nellis Air Force Base that he
says were contaminated by radioactive fallout. Now he wants the
Veterans Administration to certify him for disability benefits but
the VA has refused three times. He says that vets like him, called
downwinders, were closer to the test explosions than American POWs
were in Japan when the U.S. dropped two atomic bombs in 1945 yet
the ex-POWs are granted disability benefits. The VA stands by its
rule that only the American prisoners of war and not other soldiers
exposed to radiation who came after them are eligible for veterans
disability benefits. (Smith, Dayton Daily News). 20. WITH PHOTO.

   TALL-TX-CAPITOL_ Reports that Texas' Capitol is taller than the
dome in Washington, D.C. have been pure Texas braggadocio. Now,
Texas plans to back up its bragging rights. The State Preservation
Board is planning to measure the dome to put the matter to rest
once and for all. (Ward, Austin American-Statesman).

   DELRAY-DRUGS _ DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ Central House, located on
the Delray Beach-Boynton Beach border, is an Alcoholics Anonymous
clubhouse. It is home to dozens of AA meetings each week _ for
women, men, beginners, alcoholics only _ and recently has become
the site of a monthly ``rave'' modeled after the ones at big-city
all-night dance clubs. Central House is also a focal point of an
unusual and vital community in southern Palm Beach County _ a
community of recovering alcoholics and drug abusers that by
experts' accounts is surprisingly large for the area's size and
suburban character. (Mnookin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   FLA-LYNN-UNIV _ BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Donald E. Ross, president of
Lynn University, is one of the highest paid college presidents in
the nation _ and deservedly so, in the opinion of Lynn's board of
trustees. But the trustees are concerned the Internal Revenue
Service may not agree. Ross' $320,965 salary in 1996-97 _ the last
year reported _ was higher than that of the presidents of Harvard,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other larger, more
prestigious private universities. (Horine, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    PRINCE CHARLES, 'THE EVERYMAN,' GOES HI-TECH LAUNCHING WEB SITE
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.

<P>
   LONDON _ The heir to the throne of Henry the VIII fired up his
Web site Tuesday, inviting Web surfers from across the realm -- and
beyond -- to e-mail their future sovereign.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles, who turns 50 this week, was shown on television
here studiously manipulating a laptop as he surfed the site at
www.princeofwales.gov.uk. Buckingham Palace clearly wanted to
portray the prince as thoroughly a man of his times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got on very, He was very interested to see the site put
together according to the specifications of himself and his
office,'' said Nicole Davenport, the Internet site's designer. ``He
enjoyed very much particularly the biographical section, the speech
section -- also the section about his work. He got along absolutely
fine with it, and he very much enjoyed surfing around having a look
to see what the site said.''
</P>
<P>
   The site describes the prince's life and times in 354 Web pages
with 250 photographs. His major speeches dating back to 1968 are
reproduced in full.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're looking for the latest lurid gossip about the
royals, you're clicking up the wrong page. Charles' site contains
dispassionate accounts of the prince's life, including his
relationship with the late Princess Diana. Their separation and
divorce is reported in an unadorned passage in the biographical
section.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage was dissolved on August 28, 1996,'' it says.
``The princess was still regarded as a member of the royal
family.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next paragraph, the biography notes that ``the princess
was killed in a car crash in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   His lover of 25 years, Camilla Parker Bowles, gets only a single
mention.
</P>
<P>
   The prince is not the first British Royal to have his own Web
site. Buckingham Palace launched its site 18 months ago, and
recorded more than 100 million hits in the first year. Also, there
are dozens of unofficial Web sites for Princess Diana; only
official one for her charity.
</P>
<P>
   The site's forum page on Tuesday listed five pages of responses
from surfers on topics such as the prince's concerns about
architecture, agriculture community regeneration and even religion.
Most of the messages, all of which were at least generally
supportive if not adoring of the prince, were from England, but
there also were a few from Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The prince, whose popularity has risen since Diana's death, will
review comments, and he might even respond to some of them himself.

IS THERE A DR. SEMMELWEIS IN THE HOUSE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: A few years ago, a movie came out about a Dr. Suleman in
Germany, the doctor who discovered and developed the method of
sterilizing surgical instruments. Do you know the name of this
movie?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.L.B., Weatherford, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds like you're referring to Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a
Hungarian physician who reduced the number of postpartum infections
by insisting that doctors wash their hands between patients.
</P>
<P>
   Several movies have featured Semmelweis, who lived from 1818 to
1865. The 1938 short film ``That Mothers Might Live'' won the Oscar
for best one-reel short subject presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Three foreign films have been produced about the doctor.
``Semmelweis'' was the title of Hungarian films released in 1940
and 1952. More recently, the French made-for-TV movie ``Docteur
Semmelweis'' aired in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   While working at a Vienna hospital, Semmelweis urged staff to
thoroughly wash their hands before delivering children, causing
immediate reduction in a mortality rate that was as high as 18
percent. He died 35 years before his findings became accepted
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter loves some British children's books we found that
are about characters called the Dinobabies. I can't find any other
ones at bookstores. Where are they available?
</P>
<P>
   _ F.S., Lynchburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A: BBC Children's Books has published at least 12 ``Dinobabies''
books, but they're not currently being marketed in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The U.K. affiliate of Amazon.Com, which is on the World Wide Web
at www.amazon.co.uk, sells all 12.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Dinobabies'' animated TV series by Fred Wolf Films is
syndicated in the United States, but not in all markets.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'd like to get Engelbert Humperdinck's address for a
birthday coming up in February. Where can I write to him?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.Y., Hurst, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Engelbert Humperdinck, 7101 Smoke Ranch Road, No.
1086, Las Vegas, NV 89109, or visit his official Web site at
www.engelbert.com.
</P>
<P>
   The singer, who was born Arnold George Dorsey on either May 2 or
May 3, 1936, has sold more than 122 million records and has a fan
club claiming 8 million members.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 27, Interhit Records released ``The Dance Album,'' a
re-recording of Humperdinck songs such as ``Release Me,'' ``Quando
Quando Quando'' and ``After the Lovin'.''

A MATTER OF YARDS FROM GOOD TO GREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the French, where a wine comes from is more important than
what's in it. That a wine comes from Burgundy means more than that
it's made from pinot noir grapes.
</P>
<P>
   It was on this premise that the French created the remarkable
concept of controlled appellations, or place names, more than half
a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Under this system, known as Appellations d'Origine Controllee,
strict rules determine not only the precise place where a wine can
be made, but also the kinds of grapes to be used, how much of them
can be picked and exactly how much wine can be made from them.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a wine made from a specific Bordeaux commune, like
Pauillac, must conform to the criteria for quality laid down
expressly for Pauillac by the National Institute of Controlled
Appellations. So important are the designations to wine producers
that major political battles have been fought by wine-producing
regions to obtain them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, such laws cover about a third of French wine production,
with the proportion growing. These laws, Alexis Lichine once wrote,
``have required growers to match soils and microclimates with the
most promising vines until the nearest thing to a perfect marriage
is achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long had geographic laws covering
winemaking, but they have been much less demanding. For example, a
wine can't be called a California wine unless all the grapes in it
come from that state, while a wine can't be called a Napa Valley
wine unless 75 percent of its grapes come from the Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A wine cannot be called a varietal, like cabernet sauvignon or
chardonnay, unless 75 percent of it is made from the named grape.
Oregon has its own rule, which makes the minimum 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are subregions in American wine country, too, but they
have little to do with setting or maintaining standards. Only
recently have American winemakers come to agree with their European
counterparts that specific terrains produce specific kinds of wine.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, they believed, particularly in California, that
most of their soil was good and that what mattered was climate.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have now seen the light. The winemakers, noting that
subregions within a region like the Napa Valley produce wines with
a specific style and taste, wanted controlled areas based on
geography.
</P>
<P>
   To express a real or imagined diversity, the winemakers got the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the federal agency that
oversees wine regulations, to create American Viticultural Areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Napa Valley now has a dozen subregions so labeled, including
Stag's Leap, Howell Mountain, Mount Veeder, Rutherford and
Carneros. At least half a dozen more locales in the valley are
waiting for federal approval as viticultural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these subregions were created for a single winery: the
only winery in the Atlas Peak viticultural area is Atlas Peak. Wild
Horse Valley, another Napa subregion, has no wineries, just a
vineyard. A recently approved area designation in Mendocino County
includes three mountains, but only their tops.
</P>
<P>
   But where the French appellation system was created only after
hundreds of years' experience and is governed by strict rules that
are toughly enforced, the American system is often seen as little
more than a marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   A viticultural area is defined as ``a delimited grape growing
area distinguished by geographic features, the boundaries of which
have been recognized and defined.''
</P>
<P>
   For wine quality, that definition means nothing. Its inclusion
on a wine bottle label would mean about as much. Which is why some
winemakers use not only the viticultural area on their labels but
also the name of the vineyard that grew the grapes and occasionally
a specific plot of vines within the vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Once a viticultural area is created, nothing more is required of
the wineries and growers within it. There is nothing to prevent an
indifferent winemaker from hiding behind the name of his
viticultural area, should his winery be in one, and producing
indifferent wines.
</P>
<P>
   If he is not in a designated area, he can petition the
government to create one for him.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, viticultural areas are a good idea. They
emphasize the importance of site, of seeking out and developing not
only regional differences but also minute, vineyard-to-vineyard
character changes.
</P>
<P>
   In Bordeaux, a distance of a few yards can mean the difference
between a good wine and a great wine. This comes from years of
trial and error, sometimes centuries. I haven't the slightest doubt
that American vineyards and the wines they produce will one day
show the same diversity.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a while, but it can only benefit those of us who
delight in drinking the stuff.

   LONDON _ The heir to the throne of Henry the VIII fired up his
Web site Tuesday, inviting Web surfers from across the realm -- and
beyond -- to e-mail their future sovereign.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles, who turns 50 this week, was shown on television
here studiously manipulating a laptop as he surfed the site at
www.princeofwales.gov.uk. Buckingham Palace clearly wanted to
portray the prince as thoroughly a man of his times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got on very well. He was very interested to see the site
put together according to the specifications of himself and his
office,'' said Nicole Davenport, the Internet site's designer. ``He
enjoyed very much particularly the biographical section, the speech
section -- also the section about his work. He got along absolutely
fine with it, and he very much enjoyed surfing around having a look
to see what the site said.''
</P>
<P>
   The site describes the prince's life and times in 354 Web pages
with 250 photographs. His major speeches dating back to 1968 are
reproduced in full.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're looking for the latest lurid gossip about the
royals, you're clicking up the wrong page. Charles' site contains
dispassionate accounts of the prince's life, including his
relationship with the late Princess Diana. Their separation and
divorce is reported in an unadorned passage in the biographical
section.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage was dissolved on August 28, 1996,'' it says.
``The princess was still regarded as a member of the royal
family.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next paragraph, the biography notes that ``the princess
was killed in a car crash in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   His lover of 25 years, Camilla Parker Bowles, gets only a single
mention.
</P>
<P>
   The prince is not the first British Royal to have his own Web
site. Buckingham Palace launched its site 18 months ago, and
recorded more than 100 million hits in the first year. Also, there
are dozens of unofficial Web sites for Princess Diana; only
official one for her charity.
</P>
<P>
   The site's forum page on Tuesday listed five pages of responses
from surfers on topics such as the prince's concerns about
architecture, agriculture community regeneration and even religion.
Most of the messages, all of which were at least generally
supportive if not adoring of the prince, were from England, but
there also were a few from Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The prince, whose popularity has risen since Diana's death, will
review comments, and he might even respond to some of them himself.

WINE OF THE WEEK

<TEXT>
<P>
   Chassagne-Montrachet Rouge, Jean-Noel Gagnard, 1996, Burgundy,
France. About $20.
</P>
<P>
   Great Burgundy for $20? No. Good Burgundy? Yes. And here is the
wine to prove it. Chassagne-Montrachet is generally thought of as
white wine country. With parts of the great Montrachet and
Batard-Montrachet vineyards within the Chassagne-Montrachet town
borders, it is easy to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   But in any good year, almost 60 percent of
Chassagne-Montrachet's wines are red. Their relative obscurity can
be a windfall for the Burgundy lover.
</P>
<P>
   This wine, for example, may lack the elegance of a fine Volnay,
but it has good body and can hold its own with some highly touted
Burgundies.

FRAUD'S RARE, BUT CHECK THE TAB ANYWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Texas)   (af)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last week, when a well-known New York chef was
charged with falsifying the tips on receipts submitted to credit
card companies, an alarm might have sounded for diners who don't
think twice about the precise amount scrawled on the bottom of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Some might even admit that, after a a few glasses of wine and a
couple hours of conviviality, they barely think once about it.
</P>
<P>
   And few could say that, weeks later, they check their receipts
against the billing statement.
</P>
<P>
   But how much of this sort of fraud is going on? And just how
difficult is it to accomplish?
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials charged David Ruggerio _ the chef and
owner of the restaurant David Ruggerio and the star of a newly
minted television show _ with stealing $190,000 by submitting
fraudulent restaurant receipts to the credit card companies of 26
of his customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ruggerio's lawyers dispute the charges, but whatever the outcome
of this particular case it is instructive: unscrupulous waiters and
others in a restaurant can alter figures by small or large amounts,
a fact that suggests it's always wise to check personal receipts
against the credit card company's bill when it arrives.
</P>
<P>
   The credit card companies say restaurant-bill fraud is rare and
getting rarer. Moreover, the charges against Ruggerio, if proved,
would go beyond the uncommon to the outrageous: the disputed
transactions range from $5,000 to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I ever saw this done this
systematically,'' said David Robertson, president of The Nilson
Report, a credit card industry newsletter. ``In other cases, you
might have a waiter or someone else on the staff doing this, but it
doesn't add up to much.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing complicated about what Ruggerio is accused of.
Investigators say that he tacked huge _ and bogus _ tips onto
charges, and that his restaurant then received the full amount from
its credit card processor, Paymentech Merchant Services.
</P>
<P>
   Because it often takes 30 to 40 days for such charges to show up
on diners' statements, Ruggerio would have had at least a month to
use the money before customers discovered the discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   According to Paymentech, the company caught on to the
overcharges, but only after it had paid Ruggerio about $190,000 _
showing that even card processors with sophisticated electronic
safeguards can briefly be duped.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said that as recently as five years ago it might have
been possible for such padding to go completely undetected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraud is lower than a snake's belly in the credit card
industry right now, because they're able to analyze millions of
transactions and find patterns of fraud fairly quickly,'' he said.
``It's quite a success story, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   But the safety net is designed to catch large numbers. If bills
were falsified only occasionally, and only small amounts of money
were involved, the transactions could slip through.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the statistics on restaurant fraud don't reflect
the times when a tip or some other part of the bill is inflated and
the error isn't caught and disputed by the customer. (Such disputed
transactions, in credit card parlance, are called ``charge
backs.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``There have to be some losses that are undetected and not
captured by the numbers,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, restaurants have one of the lowest levels of fraud in
the credit card industry, because most transactions occur face to
face and diners typically examine their checks and credit card
bills before signing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And unlike jewelry stores and consumer electronics outlets,
which are victims of credit card fraud more frequently because it
is easy to fence the products they sell, restaurants are protected
because dining out can't be hocked on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an industry, we've seen a dramatic reduction in charge-back
rates over the last eight years,'' said David Richey, vice
president for card operations at Visa USA. Richey said that about
0.06 percent of all transactions are charged back now, as against
0.28 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Several New York restaurateurs said that credit card fraud _
whether grand or petty _ is not a big concern for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not been an issue here,'' said Ben Benson, owner of the
midtown Manhattan steakhouse that bears his name. ``During the era
when there was more cash floating around, waiters could overcharge
customers. But that doesn't happen much any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes waiters will change the numbers on a credit card
tip, like making a $37 tip look like an $89 tip. But when we see a
20 percent tip become a 50 percent tip, that obviously makes us
take a closer look. And then we'll bring it up with the waiter and
sometimes even with the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some restaurants are still concerned that they will
be defrauded in a bogus credit card transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worried,'' said Sarah Polansky, office manager for the
Cupping Room Cafe in SoHo. ``Sometimes we get charge-backs from
customers who say they forgot they ate here. Very few of them are
authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Bell, a spokesman for Paymentech, a Dallas company that
is one of the biggest credit card processors in the country, said
it can help restaurant owners create ``electronic parameters''
around its accounts to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   If a credit transaction is too large or a restaurant an
unusually large number of charges, those parameters can be
breached, prompting a warning that the transactions may be suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Large credit and charge card companies like Mastercard, Visa and
American Express all have similar systems, creating a sophisticated
electronic web designed to snare scam artists.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it is always possible for problems to slip through
the cracks, and there are some common-sense steps that diners and
restaurateurs can use to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Although diners once had to worry that their names and credit
card numbers might be lifted from carbons that were thrown out
after a charge slip was signed, most transactions now are
carbonless. But diners should still keep their receipts and check
them against their credit card statements when the monthly bill
arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Life is a bit more complicated for restaurant owners. First, a
couple of rules of the road. A restaurant is on the hook for a
charge-back only if a processor or a credit card issuer can prove
that the restaurant did not monitor the validity of a transaction
by making sure, for example, that the signature on a card matches
the signature on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   If a restaurant follows the correct procedures for handling the
card, then the processor or card company has to absorb any losses.
</P>
<P>
   Card companies like Visa recommend that restaurants set up a
process for recording disputed charges and tracking them according
to the employee involved as one way of protecting themselves from
in-house theft.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurants have their own controls in place. For example,
at the Hard Rock Cafe, a midtown tourist mecca, a service charge is
not included in a bill unless the party has six or more diners. And
credit card charges for such big parties require the authorization
of a manager, who is also required to swipe the card through the
terminal.

TED AND SYLVIA: FOREVER LINKED IN LIFE, DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is gratifying for me to have been in England, quite by
chance, when Ted Hughes died last week. The London press _ both the
quality dailies and the sleazy tabloids _ was filled with distended
feature articles and other glowing tributes to their poet laureate.
</P>
<P>
   Poets rate higher station with the British people than with our
own. That St. Louis-born, Princeton-educated defector, T.S. Eliot,
was claimed by both countries, but his death in the first week of
1965 was somehow a matter of greater importance in the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Even when a poet so fully American as Robert Frost passed on,
soon after his participation in John Kennedy's inauguration, the
British outmourned us in the public print and perhaps in their
hearts as well.
</P>
<P>
   No complaint this time. Because I was there rather than here, I
read the obituaries and pallbearing testimonials and learned more
about Ted Hughes than I would ever have known otherwise. On my
return, I reread some of his poems, read others for the first time,
and refined what had been a tentative appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   In our country, the name Ted Hughes has been mainly a footnote
to the life and career of Sylvia Plath, the American poet whose
suicide in 1963 at age 30 occurred soon after the collapse of their
six-year marriage. Perhaps especially in the American imagination,
Hughes has been etched as a villain, even a murderer, for having
left Sylvia Plath for another woman, at least ostensibly.
</P>
<P>
   When they first met at a poetry gathering in 1955, Hughes was 25
and Plath was 23. They married a year later, and soon afterward
Hughes was on his way to being famous. His debut volume, ``The Hawk
in the Rain'' (1957) introduced a poet with a remarkable sense of
the beauty and violence of the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   They lived briefly in the United States while Plath taught at
her alma mater, Smith College; but then they settled in England,
where the Hughes star continued its rise. Plath was in his shadow
throughout their married years, which produced two children.
</P>
<P>
   Her first collection, ``The Colossus'' (1962), was politely
received; but it was the publication of ``Ariel'' three years after
her death that set the legend of Sylvia Plath in motion. Over three
posthumous decades, she has risen steadily on the fame graph and
now is among the best-known poets of our history.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ted Hughes stunned the literary world by breaking his
long silence about Plath and their life together _ not in talk-show
interviews but with a volume of poems titled ``Birthday Letters,''
most of whose individual components were as if spoken to his dead
wife. The poems, consciously cathartic and rather apart from his
characteristically brutal nature verse, were accepted as ``his side
of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   And his side surely has some validity. Sylvia Plath certainly
possessed genius, probably ``too much'' genius, and to have lived
with her would conceivably have been a cruel challenge. As a senior
at Smith in 1953, she suffered a nervous breakdown and attempted
suicide. Her only novel, ``The Bell Jar'' _ published under a
pseudonym in the year of her death and under her own name in 1971 _
is an elaborate explanation of her collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, in the now-well-read ``The Minotaur'' and other
``Birthday Letters'' entries, attributes Plath's neurosis to a
Freudian struggle with the dead father whom he could not replace.
He cites her father as inspiration for the ``Ariel'' poems that
remain the cornerstone of her reputation, although two other poetry
volumes are in the posthumous haul _ along with Plath's collected
prose and her journals and correspondence. Her ``Collected Poems''
took the Pulitzer Prize 18 years after her death.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hughes' death at 68 was unexpected; his cancer had been in
remission, and he was ceremonially honored by Queen Elizabeth II
only two weeks before. He had been Britain's poet laureate for 14
years.

MAKING FAVORITE DESSERT IS NOT AS EASY AS PIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before television brought us news from around the world 24 hours
a day, and the Internet made the oceans seems inconsequential, my
perspectives were often as narrow as a plastic straw.
</P>
<P>
   I thought everyone's lifestyle was pretty much the same, give or
take a few bedrooms. I thought everyone had the same values as my
family. I even thought everyone ate sweet potato pie. Boy, was I
ever wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I remember it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yuck! This is the worst sweet potato pie I've ever had!''
</P>
<P>
   That's what I whispered to my husband after I tasted the orange
pie our hostess offered us for dessert after a delicious
Thanksgiving dinner several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then our hostess said,''Would you guys like for me to heat up
your pumpkin pie in the microwave?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, is that what this is?'' I replied. ``I thought it was
sweet potato pie. I've never had this before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet potato pie? That sounds good. You'll have to bake one
and let me try it.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd be happy to, I thought. You'll kick this stuff to the curb
after you try sweet potato pie.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I had no idea how to make my favorite pie. My
grandmother always made them because she made them best. So I
called up Grandma and asked for her recipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Baby,'' she said. (She started every conversation with
that phrase.) ``First you get some flour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Flour?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, for the pie crusts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandma, I've already bought two nine-inch pie crusts so we
can skip that part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it won't taste right, but that's OK since it's your
first time. Alrighty, fix up four medium sweet potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly how do I fix 'em up, Grandma?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boil 'em, Child. Ain't you got no sense at all?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes ma'am. Boil the potatoes. OK, then what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you blend the potatoes with four eggs, a stick of butter,
a small can of evaporated milk, and let me think, oh yeah, a little
vanilla.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much is `a little,' grandma?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, are you trying to cook this by yourself? I don't believe
you're ready for solo cooking. Do you know how to work the oven?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm married with children, Grandma. I can do it. How much
vanilla do I need precisely?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of teaspoons, I reckon. And then you put a dash of
cinnamon and a smidgen of cloves.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't even ask.
</P>
<P>
   She continued, ``Blend it all up until it's smooth and bake it
around 375 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes. Stick a toothpick in the
center to see if it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What will the toothpick do, turn orange or something?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby, let Grandma just mail you a pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, I had peeled, cubed, boiled, and blended,
but something just didn't seem right. The pie mix wasn't sweet
enough. Grandma didn't mention sugar so I didn't add any. I thought
the heat must bring out the natural sweetness in the potatoes or
something like that. Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I called Grandma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandma, was I supposed to put sugar in this pie? It's not
very sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughed and said, ``Baby, you know Grandma is forgetful
sometimes. That's why the Lord gave you common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Grandma. I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you too, Baby, and don't you throw that pie away.
Wasting good food is a sin. Just put some whip cream on it and tell
'em it's pumpkin pie.''

A BUTTERY APPLE CAKE, JUST LIKE PAPA MAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the fifth of eight columns by Francois Payard, the chef and
owner of Payard Patisserie and Bistro in Manhattan. Payard's
collaborator on these columns is Dorie Greenspan.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ This simple apple loaf cake, made from a buttery
batter and filled and topped with chunky apple wedges, is exactly
the same cake my father created for his pastry shop in Nice 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't think of changing it and, the truth is, my father
would never let me. To his way of thinking, a recipe should be
changed only if customers don't like it. And his customers like his
apple cake so much that, the first day he made it, he had to rush
out and buy extra cake pans to bake more. Today, he still sells 100
of these small cakes a day.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Papa would use only one kind of apple, la reine des
reinettes, a juicy apple that retains its moistness no matter how
long it is baked. My father used it in his loaf cakes until June,
when the apples from the fall harvest were no longer firm and fine,
and then he stopped making the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least he tried to stop. His customers, used to their daily
dose, didn't care that apples weren't available; they wanted their
cake. And so my father made the only change to the recipe he ever
considered acceptable: he made the cake with fresh _ only fresh,
never canned _ apricots.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, by the time the supply of apricots was depleted, it
was apple season again.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New York, I use Fuji apples. They have a good sweet-tart
balance and, like la reine des reinettes, they keep their juiciness
and their shape under heat. To make the cake really taste like an
apple cake, cut the apples into hefty, broad wedges.
</P>
<P>
   To make it look like an apple cake, I set two decorative rows
along the top of the loaf. I use an apple slicer, one of those
contraptions that cores the apple and cuts it into a dozen
perfectly even wedges at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Papa soaked the raisins that dot this cake in rum, and so I do,
too. But if rum is not to your liking, you can omit this step. I
promise I won't tell Papa, if you promise not to tell him that I
once served slices of this cake with pina colada creme anglaise.
He'd never approve. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PAPA'S APPLE POUND CAKE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 45 minutes, plus cooling &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Butter and flour for the baking pan
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon plus 2{ teaspoons dark rum
</P>
<P>
   2 Fuji apples, peeled and cored
</P>
<P>
   1 cup plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   8{ tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-third cups confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons apricot jam, melted and still warm. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Center a rack in the oven, and heat oven to 350 degrees.
Butter and flour an 8-by-4-by-2{-inch loaf pan. Line pan with
parchment paper, allowing an extra inch or two to drape over the
opposite ends. This will allow the finished cake to be lifted from
the pan before serving.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bring a small pan of water to a boil, add the raisins, and
boil 1 minute. Drain and repeat the process. Drain raisins well a
second time, and place in a small bowl with 1 tablespoon of the
rum; stir and set aside. Cut one apple into 12 wedges, and set
aside. Cut the other into 8 wedges, then cut each wedge in half
crosswise; set aside. In a medium mixing bowl, sift the flour and
baking powder together; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Working in a mixer with a paddle, or by hand with a rubber
spatula, beat the butter until it is smooth. Slowly add 1 cup of
the confectioners' sugar, and beat until creamy. Add eggs, one at a
time, beating until mixture is well blended.
</P>
<P>
   4. Fold sifted flour mixture into egg mixture just until
blended. Fold the raisins into the batter. Spoon half the batter
into a prepared pan, and smooth the top. Lay the 12 apple wedges
down the center of the pan, so their sides touch and the domed side
of each wedge is on top. There will be a thin strip of exposed
batter on either side of the row. Spoon the rest of the batter over
and around the apples, and again smooth the top. Arrange halved
apple slices in a single row along each long side of the pan,
pressing center-cut sides of the apples against the sides of the
pan. There will be two rows of apple slices, with their points
toward the center of the pan, and exposed batter in the center.
Gently push apples into batter, leaving top of the apples exposed.
Mixture in center of pan will be slightly shallower than the sides.
Let rest for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   5. Place pan in oven, and bake for 10 minutes. Using a sharp
knife, cut a slit down center of batter to help it rise evenly.
Continue to bake until a knife inserted into cake comes out clean,
another 40 to 50 minutes. Remove pan from oven and turn off heat.
Gently brush warm apricot jam over the hot cake; allow glaze to dry
for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Meanwhile, in a small pan, combine the remaining 2{ teaspoons
rum and one-third cup confectioners' sugar. Stir well, and warm the
icing over low heat for a minute. Brush it over the dried apricot
glaze, and return the pan to the turned-off oven just until the rum
icing is dry, about 2 minutes. Place cake on a rack, and cool to
room temperature. To keep the cake moist, keep it in its pan until
serving time. To remove cake from pan, lift it by the edges of the
parchment paper, carefully remove paper, and transfer to a platter.
Cut into slices, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

SAN FRANCISCO PLANS NEW APPROACH TO HOMELESSNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS and RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Homeless people who are arrested repeatedly for
public drunkenness would have to choose between a detoxification
program or jail under a new push to find a solution to San
Francisco's chronic vagrancy problem.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the homeless quickly criticized the proposed
initiative, saying that the administration of Mayor Willie Brown is
trying to make homelessness a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the mayor's staff, however, said they were looking to
see how other cities deal with the seemingly intractable homeless
problem. The policy would be a humane attempt to end the
``revolving door'' of substance abuse, they said. The
administration has reviewed the homeless policies in Boston,
Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Portland, Ore., and Santa Monica,
Calif., some of which have strict law against vagrancy.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan would target those arrested for public drunkenness
three times within a 60-day period. Upon conviction, they would be
offered a slot in a substance abuse program or a 60-day jail
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, however, would rely on space being available at
detoxification centers. If there were no space, the city would
revert to the current policy of citing and releasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city recognizes that there's a problem with people being
severely intoxicated day in and day out on city streets,'' said
Bevan Dufty, the mayor's director of neighborhood services. ``This
is about chronic offenders, people who are belligerent and cause a
threat to themselves and to others. This is not about
incarceration, but about helping people.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy, he said, also would help residents and merchants
affected by the scofflaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is clearly we have a problem with a revolving door of
people who are cited continuously and released,'' said Kandace
Bender, the mayor's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Those who provide services for the homeless referred to a
revolving door of a different kind. This one, they said, would spin
the homeless through the criminal justice system and forced
treatment, but send them back on the streets to begin the cycle
over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police officers will force certain individuals of their
choosing into treatment inside jails, but the city is not going to
expand treatment _ current beds that already have long waiting
lists will be used,'' said Marykate Connor of Caduceus Outreach
Services, which provides treatment for mental illness and
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose administration has wrestled with homelessness for
three years, is searching for a new policy with an eye toward his
November 1999 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan, called San Francisco Cares, is in
draft form. It proposes ``a range of solutions, both short-term and
long-term,'' said Terry Hill, the mayor's homeless services
coordinator. ``The mayor is not interested in more and more
shelter. He wants to find concrete long-term solutions for folks
who are in dire straits.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill denied there would be any sweep of homeless people by the
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything punitive or police-led was rejected by the mayor. The
mayor wants us to treat people where they are whether it's mental
illness or substance abuse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the city's Board of Supervisors, Amos Brown, said
the city must crack down on public drunkenness, urinating and
defecating in public, and using and selling drugs. He said some
people use homelessness as an excuse to break the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no excuse for bad behavior,'' he said. ``Just because
you're homeless doesn't mean you have the right to go out there and
be unkind to someone.''

GRAVLAX WITHOUT FEAR: A STUNNING DISH JUST LOOKS HARD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gravlax owes its allure, one that is shared by few
fish preparations, to its intense orange color, meltingly tender
texture and wonderful flavor. Not bad for a dish whose name means
``buried salmon'' in Swedish.
</P>
<P>
   Although most chefs jazz gravlax up with sauces and side dishes
(how else could they charge $12 a plate?), this salt-cured fish
dish is brilliant on its own or with just a few drops of lemon or
mild vinegar. And even a kitchen novice can make it at home.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't always the case. The first time I made gravlax,
almost 20 years ago, it was a major production. I had to order a
whole salmon, which cost me $50, and have it specially filleted.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully following a recipe, I sandwiched the two large fillets
with salt, sugar, dill, black pepper and aquavit, the
caraway-flavor vodka from Sweden. (Half of the original bottle
still sits in my cabinet.) I wrapped the fillets, weighted the
package and refrigerated it.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three days, I basted the fish every 12 hours with
its exuded juices. Finally, I rinsed off the finished product,
which was wonderful; unfortunately it was enough to feed 40 people,
and much of it went to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I make gravlax inexpensively, with almost no effort, and in
quantities suitable for a single dinner party or a couple of family
meals and snacks. I buy a single fillet (or even half a fillet) at
the supermarket; cover it with salt, sugar and dill; wrap it up _
no weights _ and serve it the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I make it simply: the Minimalist's Gravlax here takes
about 10 minutes, not counting refrigeration time. Sometimes I use
one of the more elaborate cures devised by chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basic gravlax is pretty straightforward,'' said Marcus
Samuelsson, the executive chef at Aquavit, the New York restaurant.
``It's just salt, sugar, pepper and dill. Of course, you can make
it as complicated as you like, and there are times I add various
seasonings and spices. But the process is really simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelsson uses two and a half parts sugar to one part salt,
pretty close to the ratio I like best. He believes it is important
to leave the curing fish out of the refrigerator for the first six
hours, so that the salt and sugar melt. Then he refrigerates the
fish for about 30 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Cyril Renaud, the chef at La Caravelle, uses equal parts of salt
and sugar, and believes that 12 hours' curing time is sufficient.
Because his curing mixture contains acid in the form of citrus and
is heavy on the salt, and because he serves gravlax with exotic
sauces like a beguiling chamomile-vinegar vinaigrette, he can keep
his curing period brief. But when I used Renaud's cure, I allowed
the salmon to sit for 24 hours, deciding that the slightly stronger
flavor would be preferable for unsauced gravlax.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Valenti, Butterfield 81's chef, uses a higher ratio of salt
to sugar, but the amount he uses is far less than the other chefs
use. ``There was a time that the gravlax method was used to
preserve fish,'' he said. ``But now we do it exclusively for
flavor. I don't feel the need to use a lot of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   His curing time goes up proportionately, but the result is an
assertive gravlax, delightfully strong but barely salty. Similarly,
Vincent Hodgins, chef de cuisine at Istana, the Mediterranean-style
restaurant in the New York Palace Hotel, minimizes the salt but
adds a powerful mix of Moroccan spices.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon for gravlax should be as fresh as possible, but this
in no way eliminates supermarket fish. Most supermarkets receive
deliveries of popular fish like salmon three times a week, and
farm-raised salmon is often harvested and shipped on the same day.
Once you buy it, a good rule, Samuelsson said, is to ``handle it as
you would sushi'' _ that is, keep it cold and keep hands and work
surfaces impeccably clean.
</P>
<P>
   Since you don't eat the skin of cured salmon, it need not be
scaled. But you should check the fillet carefully for ``pin''
bones, the long fine bones that run down the center of the fillet.
These are not removed by the routine filleting process. Press your
finger down the center of the flesh and you will feel them; remove
them, one at a time, with needle-nose pliers or a similar tool.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting that the timing for gravlax is imprecise; the
longer it sits, the drier and stronger flavored it will become. So
if you're ready for dinner just 24 hours after beginning the cure,
by all means serve the gravlax. Similarly, if you want to hold the
cure for 12 or 24 hours more, feel free.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, you must treat finished gravlax as a fresh product.
Keep it well wrapped and refrigerated, and use it within a few
days. Freezing is a safe option but will dry the salmon out to some
extent, so avoid it if at all possible.
</P>
<P>
   THE MINIMALIST'S GRAVLAX
</P>
<P>
   Time: 10 minutes, plus 24 to 36 hours' refrigeration
</P>
<P>
   1 cup salt
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch dill, stems and all, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 2- to 3-pound fillet of salmon, pin bones removed.
</P>
<P>
   1. Mix together the salt, sugar and dill. Place the salmon, skin
side down, on a large sheet of plastic wrap. Cover the flesh side
of the salmon with the salt mixture, making sure to coat it
completely. (There will be lots of salt mix; just pile it on.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Wrap the fish well. If the temperature is below 70 degrees,
and it is not too inconvenient, let it rest outside the
refrigerator for about 6 hours, then refrigerate for 18 to 24 hours
more. Otherwise, refrigerate immediately for about 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   3. Unwrap the salmon, and rinse off the cure. Dry, then slice on
the bias (see illustration). Serve plain or with lemon wedges,
creme fraiche, sour cream or a light vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: at least 12 servings. &QL;

'99 SCHEDULE ANNOUNCED FOR HOLLYWOOD BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 - MUSIC-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Making good on its new overseer's pledge to bring
more jazz and world beat music to L.A.'s best-known performance
venue, the Hollywood Bowl on Tuesday unveiled an upcoming season
that includes an expanded jazz series and a new Sunday series
featuring everything from Argentinean tango and Armenian choral
music to U.S. gospel and Native American dance theater.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the Bowl's 1999 season, its 78th, were announced
yesterday at a press conference presided over by Hollywood Bowl
principal conductor John Mauceri; John Clayton, recently named
artistic director of jazz at the Bowl; Esa-Pekka Salonen, which
spends the bulk of its summer season at the Bowl; and Willem
Wijnbergen, executive vice president and managing director of the
Los Angeles Association.
</P>
<P>
   Next summer's lineup reflects the thinking of the Dutch-born
Wijnbergen, former managing director of Amsterdam's Royal
Concertgebouw Orchestra, that the Bowl should diversify its
programming while continuing to offer its traditional fare of
popular classical works and solo artists, fireworks-studded pop
concerts, and programs that include big-screen movie showings.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this season's most significant addition is the expansion
of the 20-year-old Lexus Jazz at the Bowl series to eight concerts.
Under Clayton's direction, each concert will feature a
collaboration between a guest solo artist and a newly appointed
jazz ensemble-in-residence under Clayton's direction, the
14-year-old Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Wednesday series' solo performers will be Canadian
singer-pianist Diana Krall (July 7), a previous Bowl peformer;
vocalist Dee Dee Bridgwater (Aug. 4); bass and piano player Ray
Brown (Aug. 4); and swing guitarist John Pizzarelli (Aug. 25).
</P>
<P>
   The new Sunday nights ``Sunsets'' world beat concerts They
include a July 11 ``Tango Night'' with Juan Jose Mosalini; a July
25 ``Out of Africa'' concert by Oumou Sangare, Hassan Hakmoun and
Aster Aweke; a program titled ``Delight, Ritual, Ecstasy: Our
American Roots,'' with Flaco Jimenez, Natalie MacMaster, Lonnie
Brooks and the Lakota Sioux Dance Theatre; an Aug. 15 ``Say Amen,
Somebody!'' concert that will bring together the Armenian Festival
Chorus and gospel group Mighty Clouds of Joy; and a Sept. 12
``Portuguese Night'' with Brazilian singer-songwriting legend
Gilberto Gil, Angolan singer Waldemar Bastos and traditional
Portuguese fol singer Dulce Pontes.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Starlights'' Classical Series will continue Tuesday and
Thursday evenings. Solo artists appearing this summer will include
pianists Garrick Ohlsson and Yefim Bronfman; violinists Sarah Chang
and Martin Chalifour; and vocalists soprano Alessandra Marc and
soprano Dawn Upshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Under the batons of Mauceri and John Williams, the Hollywood
Bowl Orchestra will offer a lineup of Broadway-themed music (July
9, 10), ``A Night In Old Havana'' (July 30, 31), and a program
intriguingly titled ``Beam me to the Bowl, Scotty!'' conducted by
Hollywood composer Jerry Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian-born Philharmonic assistant conductor Miguel
Harth-Bedoya will make his Bowl debut Aug. 20/21 with a program
that showcases the work of Latin and South American conductors.
</P>
<P>

programs and artists, call the Hollywood Bowl Information Line at

DO BLONDES HAVE MORE FUN?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Keep it to yourself, but Emily Erwin of the hot
country trio known as the Dixie Chicks falls asleep on airplanes _
with her mouth open.
</P>
<P>
   Alert the media.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin is still getting used to being noticed by strangers,
especially on airplanes and particularly in the Lone Star State
after Southwest Airlines profiled the Chicks in the latest issue of
its in-flight magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flying to Austin to meet with my fiance last week and
couldn't do anything without people staring, because the magazine's
right in the seat pocket in front of them,'' Erwin recalled. ``Let
me tell you, I fall asleep on planes with my mouth totally open,
and it certainly doesn't look very attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   While fellow airline passengers are keeping one eye on this
sleeping beauty, Nashville's Music Row is crowing about discovering
the Dixie Chicks.
</P>
<P>
   However, some folks have known about the lively blond vocal trio
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Country fans in Dallas, in fact, named the Chicks their favorite
group four years running before they signed with a Nashville label.
During that time, the gals were frequent performers on the state
fair circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Even prior to the January release of the Chicks' best-selling
album, ``Wide Open Spaces'' (Monument/Sony), the group had a
mailing list of 6,000 fans, a busy Internet site and three indie
CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been said in Nashville that we're an overnight success,''
says Erwin. ``But we got a lot of critical acclaim at the
beginning, and people saw that the music was good and not just
three blondes who were put together like the Monkees or something.
There were people who bought the album because they were curious _
and that word of mouth really helped, especially among the younger
fans. When a girl brings the CD to school and tells her friends, it
helps spread the word.''
</P>
<P>
   However it occurred, the award-winning trio _ which also
includes Natalie Maines and Martie Seidel _ are happening in a big
way. The title track from the Chicks' long-player last week topped
the national country airplay chart, while the album placed No. 2 in
the country sales list and No. 10 in the national pop albums chart,
beating Aerosmith, Brandy and Marilyn Manson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it all ended tomorrow, I'd be OK because we've been so
fortunate,'' Seidel, 29, said. ``I have a big scrapbook of
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicks' flawless three-part harmony-based sound is as
contemporary as anything out there, but with a genuine traditional
streak. The million-selling disc is filled with banjo, dobro,
fiddle and mandolin, all played by Seidel and Erwin.
</P>
<P>
   The trio's fresh-faced, tuneful appeal does indeed cross over
with various age groups. The Chicks have even been dubbed the Spice
Girls of country.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Nicole Emily Larson, an eighth-grader in North
Mankato, Minn., counts the Dixie Chicks among her seven favorite
performers and runs a Web site devoted to the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them in concert three weeks ago, and they really
rocked,'' Larson, 14, said. ``I also got to meet them that night,
and they were all so friendly and thanked me tons of times for my
dedication to my site and all. The Dixie Chicks aren't that popular
yet at school, but I was in my local paper not too long ago, so
people in my town are starting to recognize their name.''
</P>
<P>
   At the recent 32nd annual Country Music Association awards, the
Dixie Chicks won prestigious honors for best new act and vocal
group of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started getting the critical picks, we thought we
might have a shot at the newcomers award,'' Erwin, 26, said.
``Winning the vocal group award was a real surprise. It was funny,
because the cameras were showing Diamond Rio, so we thought they
were about to win. Maybe they were trying to fake us out. But
winning best new act represents our biggest goal _ longevity. It
represents to the industry that these girls are going to be around
for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have said the trio's name is an almost sexist reference to
the fact that Erwin, Seidel and Maines are plainly babes. But
Maines insists the Dixie Chicks moniker has more innocent
connotations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me a blonde, but I never even thought about the name
being sexist,'' Maines, 24, said. ``I was thinking about little
baby chicks _ and that Little Feat song `Dixie Chicken.' It was
totally tongue in cheek. One thing's for sure, it sticks in
people's minds. And that was the goal _ to be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly nine years ago when sisters Seidel and Erwin began
pickin' and singin' for tips on a Dallas street corner, raking in
$375 in their first hour. Back then, the duo wore cowgirl get-ups
and played western swing and bluegrass, becoming one of the city's
most popular club acts in the process.
</P>
<P>
   After selling around 60,000 copies of their first three
independently released CDs, the sisters decided it was time to
audition another member before trying to score a major label deal.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddle-mandolin player Seidel and multi-instrumentalist Erwin
met singer Maines in 1995 when her dad, West Texas session
musician-producer Lloyd Maines, played steel guitar on two of their
early albums. The sisters first checked out an audition tape Maines
had used to get into Boston's Berklee School of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after Maines joined the group, the Dixie Chicks
landed a deal with Sony Nashville's newly revived Monument label, a
logo previously known for launching such legends as Roy Orbison,
Dolly Parton, Kris Kristofferson, Larry Gatlin and others.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicks, in fact, have been selected as the flagship act of
the new label: ``These women are the real deal,'' says Sony
Nashville president Allen Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the groundwork for the success of ``Wide Open
Spaces'' has been carefully laid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very familiar with the grass-roots way of meeting people
and selling records, because with the indie albums, that's the only
way,'' Erwin said. ``You have to rely on the people who were fans
at the beginning, and that tradition is staying with us.''
</P>
<P>
   A busy period for the Chicks is about to get busier. On Nov. 23,
the trio will appear on TV with Dick Clark announcing the American
Music Awards nominees. That evening, the Chicks will perform on
``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.'' On Jan. 5, the gals help
announce the Grammy Awards nominees in Nashville, and on Jan. 11,
the group is set to appear on the American Music Awards telecast
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Dixie Chicks show includes a western swing reading of
Bonnie Raitt's ``Give It Up or Let Me Go,'' savvy country-pop
fodder like ``There's Your Trouble,'' the bluesy single ``I Can
Love You Better,'' and cover tunes by J.D. Souther and Maria McKee.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin recalls with a giggle the first time she heard herself on
the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on my way to the gym,'' she said. ``It was incredible. I
was screaming at cars, `That's me on the radio!' ''
</P>
<P>
   When touring, the Chicks travel on a bus that sleeps 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not luxurious by any means, but at this point we're
businesswomen, too,'' Erwin said.

HE LOVES STERN ENOUGH TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For professional photographer, husband and dad Dan
Wagner, Howard Stern's radio show became an obsession he could only
overcome by writing a book.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's ``Getting to Howard: The Odyssey of an Obsessed Howard
Stern Fan'' (Ilicium Books; $23.95), is a true-life account of an
ultimate Stern groupie.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife said of all the books I could possibly write, why this
one?'' Wagner said. ``This is a real look at what a fan went
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's ``odyssey'' began in October 1995, when he sent a fax
to the nationally syndicated Stern morning show _ heard locally on
talk radio KLSX-FM (97.1) _ on a lark and heard the New York-based
host read it on the air five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a heady feeling,'' admits Wagner, 35, who lives on the
north shore of New York's Long Island near Stern show regulars
Jackie Martling and ``Stuttering'' John Melendez. ``To me, this was
an outlet to be creative. It was a challenge to come up with the
right bait to catch Howard's interest.''
</P>
<P>
   After faxing messages, Wagner tried other stunts like presenting
Stern with a bogus Emmy Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, I became (show writer Fred) Norris' band photographer
and landed the part of an extra in the `Private Parts' movie,''
Wagner said. ``All the interactions I had with Stern or his workers
and fans were just as bizarre as what goes on during the show.
That's what made it so amazing. I came to really like the people on
the show. Every one of them, their waters run deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's book, which includes more than 200 photos, is available
at bookstores, over the Internet (www.gettingtohoward.com), or by
calling (877) GET-HOWARD (438-4692).

EDUCATION INITIATIVE MAY BE SHAPED ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Web site is CQ; will not be accessible until Wednesday.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Silicon Valley venture capitalist is asking
Internet users to help craft a school-choice ballot initiative and
then sign it on-line, a test of cyberspace democracy that may be
ahead of its time.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Draper, calling public education in California a disaster,
said he would launch a cyber initiative Wednesday to get it on the
ballot in 2000. Through a Web site to be located at
www.localchoice.com, on-line users will have a say in how Draper's
initiative is worded.
</P>
<P>
   Draper has three fundamental goals: to give parents tax dollars
to send their children to the school of their choice; reward or
sanction principals based on student performance; and redefine the
state's role in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give California parents the opportunity to choose
the best school for their child,'' said Draper, a father of four
and a founder Draper Fisher Associates of Redwood City, Calif. He
also was named to the state Board of Education by retiring Gov.
Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the word voucher because ``it scares people,'' Draper
said it would be left to the Internet community to determine
whether, through his initiative, public tax dollars should be used
to send children to public schools, or to public, private and
religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through on-line polls, people will be able to write to us and
tell us where we're right and wrong,'' Draper said. ``We need to
break up the education bureaucracy by creating a market system. The
money should follow the child to the school of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   School choice, an umbrella term for everything from home
schooling, education tax credits and public and private
scholarships, is getting more attention across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand a Wisconsin court
ruling expanding Milwaukee's voucher program to allow parents to
send their children to religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale state-run voucher programs are in place in Cleveland
and Milwaukee, and programs are being debated in Vermont and
Pennsylvania. In California, voucher systems face vehement
opposition from the powerful state teachers unions and ambivalence
among voters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, California voters defeated a proposition that would
have given students from poor families a voucher worth 50 percent
of the annual cost of public schooling.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Draper is proposing giving the entire annual
per-pupil spending _ more than $5,500 per child _ to the public or
private school of the family's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do away with a lot of the education bureaucracy,''
he said. ``Why do we even need county offices of education?''
</P>
<P>
   Although the California secretary of state has identified
technology that could be used for gathering and validating
electronic signatures, there are political and legislative hurdles
to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would need time to develop an electronic database of
electronic voters, complete with signatures that counties would be
able to verify,'' said Alfie Charles, spokesman for the secretary
of state.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, a
nonprofit organization that promotes the Internet as a tool for
voter education, called Draper's on-line campaign a good idea, but
premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether the secretary of state would accept
digital signatures,'' Alexander said. ``But this will attract
people who are deeply interested in the issue of school reform.
Maybe this initiative will be the catalyst that gets the digital
signature process in place.''
</P>
<P>
   For Draper, the initiative is a chance to fuse his interests in
the Internet and overhauling the education system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went into my daughter's classroom and saw her using the
same textbooks I'd used 25 years ago, in a classroom that was
falling apart, I realized there had been no change in education
over 25 years,'' said Draper, who moved his children from public to
private schools. ``I have always believed that market systems work.
We need competition for our education bureaucracy.''

`I WILL BEAR WITNESS': HOW THE LITTLE THINGS ADD UP TO HORROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Victor Klemperer, for many years a professor of Romance
languages at the Dresden Technical University, was an intelligent
and literate man and a fine scholar but not an extraordinary
individual. And that is one of several things that makes the
publication of his diaries, written in secret during the entire
period of the Nazi nightmare in Germany and concealed for decades
in East Germany, an extraordinary and important event.
</P>
<P>
   Klemperer, a Jew baptized as a Protestant, survived the 12 years
of Nazi rule in part because he was married to an ``Aryan,'' in
part because he had special dispensation for having served on the
front lines in the German army in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Will Bear Witness,'' covering the years 1933 to 1941, is the
first of two volumes of the diaries in which Klemperer recorded the
day-to-day experience of living as a Jew in Germany under Hitler.
Written for himself, apparently without any thought of eventual
publication, the book is history raw, an unvarnished account of a
single exceedingly beleaguered life, most notable for the petty
outrages, the quiet desperation and the undercover spiritual
struggle that they reveal.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries, translated from the German and abridged by Martin
Chalmers, are straightforward and unadorned, full of pain and
anger, but also full of shrewd observations on the nature of the
Nazi regime and the quality of the response of the German people to
it. (In Germany, Klemperer writes two years after the Nazi
takeover, ``90 percent want the fuehrer and servitude and the death
of scholarship, of thought, of the spirit, of the Jews.'')
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the diaries are a record of the way events _ the
gradual loss of civil rights, the rumors of deportations, the
everyday slights, the banal and not-so-banal horrors of a madman's
tyranny _ were experienced by one person at that time, an innocent
man turned guilty by a fiendish ideology. They have in this sense
some of the same value as Anne Frank's ``Diary,'' though, of
course, they represent the response not of a pubescent Dutch-German
girl but of a sophisticated, assimilated, cosmopolitan middle-aged
man striving to maintain self-control and dignity as the only world
he knows crumbles around him for no reason.
</P>
<P>
   Klemperer was born in 1881 and, after being restored to his post
at the university in Dresden at the end of the war, died in 1960 at
the age of 78. He was a twice alienated man, alienated from his
German identity and from his Jewish identity at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   He does not deny his Jewishness, despite his conversion to
Protestantism. But he does express an intense resentment toward
those who take Jewishness as a prime element in personal identity.
He blames Hitler for the creation of the ``Jewish problem,''
believing that before the Nazis came along to fetishize the concept
of blood and race, there was no separate Jewish identity. It is for
that reason that Klemperer is given to a disproportionate rage
against Zionism, which he compares more than once to Hitlerism.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nazism, he says, Zionism turns the Jews into a separate
racial category, and this violates his powerful belief in
assimilation, his undying conviction that he is German.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until 1933 and for at least a good century before that, the
German Jews were entirely German and nothing else,'' he writes in
January 1939, six years after Hitler came to power. ``There is only
one solution to the German or West European Jewish question: the
defeat of its inventors.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, very few of Klemperer's entries treat matters
philosophically or touch on what might be deemed the big issues,
like freedom, nationalism and how the horrible aberration that
Hitler is to him could have come to power and consolidated his
anti-Semitic tyranny so quickly and with so little opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The very everyday quality of Klemperer's concerns at times slows
down the narrative; yet given its overall length and the fact that
he was not writing for an audience, the diary as a whole has
remarkable momentum. It is the accumulation of relatively small
insults that brings home the poisonous nature of a regime of many
rules but no just law: Klemperer is insanely chastised by the
police for gardening on a national holiday, he is banned from the
university library, he is prohibited from driving his car. Jews are
no longer sold tickets for the popular Elbe River ferries. Some
events that are now well known, like Kristallnacht in 1938, the
most severe anti-Jewish assault up to that point, pass without a
great deal of comment by Klemperer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not need to describe the historic events of the following
days, the acts of violence, our depression,'' he writes briefly of
that incident. ``Only the immediately personal and what concretely
affected us.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``immediately personal'' was a search of the Klemperer
household by the police and Klemperer's brief arrest, after which
he writes: ``Since then, we have both been unceasingly tormented by
the question, go or stay? To go too early, to stay too late? To go
where we have nothing, to remain in this corruption?'' The
Klemperers do not leave Germany, though Victor does spend time
unsuccessfully looking into teaching posts abroad. They lack money
but they also lack the real desire to leave; they are too attached
to Germany for that. Klemperer survived the war because of his
unusual situation, but, of course, many of those who did not leave
perished as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the diary shows Klemperer simply striving to get by. He
records chronic financial difficulties, relieved from time to time
by a gift from his older brother Georg, a surgeon, who went to the
United States in 1935. Not long after Hitler's accession, a Polish
Jew named Sandel swindles Klemperer of some money, and Klemperer
feels he has to file a complaint with the police, or others will
suspect he wants to ``protect the JEW.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A terrible situation,'' he writes. Another preoccupation is
building a small cottage outside Dresden, which he and Eva finally
succeed in doing despite cash shortages and bureaucratic
obstruction.

 UNDATED: bureaucratic obstruction.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile Klemperer doggedly continues to work on an ambitious
history of French thought in the 18th century, confiding at one
point in 1938: ``Voltaire and Montesquieu are more than ever my
essential guides.''
</P>
<P>
   He makes sporadic notes on what he calls ``the language of the
Third Reich.'' He notes, for example, in 1934 that Hitler tells
German youth, ``You sing songs together,'' of which Klemperer
observes: ``Everything is aimed at deafening the individual in
collectivism.'' This is a shrewd remark. It anticipates the George
Orwell of ``1984'' and Newspeak.
</P>
<P>
   Klemperer is also ahead of his time in likening communism to
Nazism (``both are materialistic and lead to slavery''), which
makes it strange that, after the war, he became a Communist Party
member in East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries record Klemperer's moods, which alternate between
despair and the effort not to give up hope. He reads between the
lines of newspaper reports of great German victories to perceive
when matters are not going so well _ as when, for the first time,
the German press, in August 1940, reports a ``systematic and
cowardly attack on Berlin'' by the British air force. Klemperer
knows that not all hope is lost.
</P>
<P>
   This first volume (the second, covering the years 1942 to 1945,
is scheduled to be published next year) does not reach into the
very worst of the Nazi period, when the death camps were in full
swing and the ``final solution'' was steady Nazi policy. Still,
Klemperer hears rumors of deportations of Jews to Poland. (``They
have to leave almost literally naked and penniless.'' When, in
September 1941, he, like other Jews, is forced to wear the yellow
star, he sees it as the ultimate humiliation, declaring, ``That
means upheaval and catastrophe for us.''
</P>
<P>
   One reads these late diary entries with a growing sense of
foreboding, since we know, as Klemperer himself did not, that far
worse than the yellow star was yet to come.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Houghton, the former chairman of Corning Inc.,
was named chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Tuesday.
Houghton, a member of the Met's board for 16 years and its vice
chairman since 1984, succeeds Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, who announced
his retirement from the post in September.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also announced the appointment of David McKinney as
the next president of the Met. McKinney will succeed William Luers,
who is stepping down after 12 years. McKinney, who spent 36 years
with IBM, is the executive secretary of the Thomas J. Watson
Foundation and the director of the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement signals a major change in the power structure
of the Met, the largest art museum in the country, with more than
two million objects and more than five million visitors last year.
Unlike Luers, who reported directly to the board, McKinney will be
responsible to Philippe de Montebello. De Montebello, who has been
the museum's director for 21 years, has been named to the new
position of chief executive officer, putting him in charge of all
museum operations.
</P>
<P>
   In McKinney, who turns 64 this month, the Met has chosen a man
with a strong business background. ``We looked at many people of
all ages and sexes in all different worlds from academic to
nonprofit,'' de Montebello said Tuesday. ``Dave best fit the
cumulative qualities we were looking for. When you look to the
future, he brings a tremendous amount of wisdom and experience.''
</P>
<P>
   De Montebello added that at a moment when the museum is facing
larger challenges than ever _ with its building renovations, cuts
in the operating funds it receives from Reader's Digest, and its
aim to move forward technologically _ McKinney's experience in
strategic planning, technology and international relations would
make him a great asset. McKinney served as executive officer of the
IBM World Trade Europe/Middle East/Africa Corp., retiring in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work in smooth partnership,'' de Montebello said. It
is well known in the art world that de Montebello has had a
strained relationship with Luers.
</P>
<P>
   The passing of the chairmanship from Sulzberger, the chairman
emeritus of The New York Times Co., to Houghton signals a new era
for the Met. Sulzberger's tenure as Met chairman was a time of
expansion. The museum's attendance grew to 5.2 million visitors
from 4.8 million; its membership grew to 111,594 from 96,531, and
its budget nearly doubled, to $116.6 million from $64 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new chairman will be following in the footsteps of his
cousin Arthur Houghton, chairman of the Met from 1969 to 1972.
James Houghton, a Harvard-educated executive who became chairman of
Corning in 1983, retiring 13 years later, is a director of
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and Exxon Corp.
He is also a trustee of the Pierpont Morgan Library, the Corning
Museum of Glass and the Corning Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an interesting time at the Met,'' Houghton
said. ``We have a new president and a new management structure. As
far as the direction of the museum goes, I'd say we're on a pretty
good track.''
</P>
<P>
   As its new president McKinney, a native of Tennessee, comes to
the museum with little background in art other than taking art
classes and visiting museums. But as an executive at the
International Business Machines Corporation he has filled several
major positions, among them executive assistant to the chairman of
IBM, vice president of personnel and president of IBM World Trade
Americas/Far East Corp. He also served as head of the IBM corporate
operations staff and was a member of the corporate management
board.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney is also a trustee of Brown University and a director of
the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to have a plan in mind,'' he said Tuesday. ``I
need to learn more about the Met first.''

TEARDROPS CAN YIELD SUCH SWEET BLISS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARBARA KAFKA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the child in all of us, pomegranates make things easy. All
you need are a metal skewer and a straw. Punch the skewer through
the fruit's leathery red skin, slip a straw into the hole, and
slurp up the sweet and sour juice.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for most Americans the joys of the pomegranate
end right there. While some cooks may experiment with sprinkling
its jewel-like, teardrop-shaped red seeds over desserts, most have
not discovered the wealth of delicious dishes that can be made when
cooking with pomegranates, in season now until January.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Wolfert and other food writers have steered us to
pomegranate vinegar and syrup, which are available commercially,
for use in Near Eastern and Indian dishes. But it is almost just as
easy to buy some large dark red heavy pomegranates and juice them
yourself, extracting the beautiful seeds, to make similar dishes or
new ones.
</P>
<P>
   To juice a pomegranate, first cut it in half between the stem
and blossom end. Holding one half over a bowl, use a citrus juicer
_ an electric one is easier _ to extract the maximum amount of
juice. A large ripe pomegranate will produce a half cup of juice; a
small one will give as little as a quarter cup.
</P>
<P>
   To seed a pomegranate, cut it into quarters. Working over a
bowl, use a small spoon or your fingers to gently pull the seeds
away from the pulp. (The juice may stain your fingers temporarily,
but it washes off easily.)
</P>
<P>
   The seeds are fragile, so take care to keep them whole. As the
seeds are pulled away, they separate from each other. Drop the
seeds into a measuring cup, and pick off any white membrane
clinging to them.
</P>
<P>
   A large pomegranate will yield a half cup to one and a half cups
of seeds; a small one will yield a half to three-quarters cup. (If
you end up with more seeds than you need for a recipe, sprinkle
them over a fruit or green salad for color and crispness.)
</P>
<P>
   The flavor of pomegranate and the beauty of its seeds go well in
any part of a meal. The shrimp dish here, a lovely first course,
uses plenty of spice but is not, as one might think, hot.
</P>
<P>
   The pomegranate provides color, crispness and fresh flavor. The
roasted chicken dish is one of my favorites: the bird turns a rich,
dark brown and makes a savory gravy that is brightened by the
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   In the dessert, the orange slices and pomegranate seeds make for
a beautiful contrast of colors. The dish is light and refreshing. A
warning: The pomegranate-walnut brittle is addictive. Consider
making double and having some on another day. &QL;

 &HT;    CAMPAIGN MOUNTED AGAINST INFECTION THAT BLINDS MILLIONS
 &HT;    545 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a drug company's donation of several million
doses of antibiotics, a private foundation has launched a campaign
against a common eye infection that blinds millions of people in
tropical countries.
</P>
<P>
   The infection, known as trachoma, causes blindness the hard way,
said Dr. Joseph Cook, director of tropical disease research for the
Edna McConnell Clark Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated infections over a period of years, the victim's
upper eyelids slowly turn inward because of scars. This causes the
eyelashes to scrape against the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slow and painful way to become blind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a preventable way, even though the World Health
Organization estimates more than 150 million people worldwide have
trachoma infections and more than 5 million are blind because of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, river blindness, a disease spread by a biting
fly, has blinded an estimated 250,000 people. Only cataracts cause
more cases of blindness than trachoma, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Foundation officials announced Tuesday that using public
health measures, village-based surgery and approximately 4 million
doses of zithromycin donated by Pfizer Inc., the foundation will
launch a campaign against the disease in five countries, probably
Vietnam and the African countries of Morocco, Mali, Ghana and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer officials said the donation is valued at roughly $60
million, based on the price the company charges pharmaceutical
wholesalers. In addition, the company has agreed to donate $3.2
million in cash to the campaign, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Trachoma is most common in countries where poverty, poor access
to water and poor hygiene are pervasive. In addition to Africa and
Asia, the disease is prevalent in parts of Australia and Central
and South America.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria that cause trachoma are spread from person to
person through physical contact, especially among children, by
items such as towels that are shared within families and by flies,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A single capsule of zithromycin, which Pfizer markets as
Zithromax, can keep a person free of trachoma for up to a year,
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the campaign, seeking to eliminate the factors that
spread the disease, will attempt to teach people the importance of
face washing, even in arid areas, and the use of clean water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a single community, when you reduce the total number of
cases, you cut down on the 'force of infection' and inhibit the
spread of the disease,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   For people whose eyelids already have been damaged, a 15-minute
operation, which can be performed in a village setting by a public
health nurse, can prevent scraping of the cornea, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of surgery, antibiotics and health training was
developed by the foundation over the past 12 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Good hygiene, good water and health education have eliminated
trachoma in developed countries, including the United States, Cook
said. However, most eye hospitals in the United States were first
built to treat trachoma, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Edna McConnell Clark Foundation was established by Edna
McConnell Clark and her husband, Van Alan Clark. Mrs. Clark was the
daughter of David McConnell, founder of Avon Products Inc.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MARYSVILLE, Calif. _ It was late afternoon, the sun sat high
over the Sacramento Valley, and Chuck Mathews Jr. was in a groove _
literally. With his right hand on the steering wheel, and his left
eye trained on a helpful furrow, he kept the wheels of his
bright-green harvester rolling in a perfect line, reducing acre
after acre of rice plants to sawed-off stubble.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth. Back and forth. Like a barber, the harvester
combed and fluffed up the two-foot stalks, then applied the shears,
trimming off the golden rice heads to create a perfect 100-acre
crew cut.
</P>
<P>
   Mathews glanced up at an electronic box overhead and read some
digital numbers. ``Two hundred and six hours in this machine, and I
still haven't lost my mind yet,'' he said. Two hundred and six
hours. Four point six million pounds of rice, and still counting.
</P>
<P>
   In a six-week blitzkrieg each fall, California farmers harvest
about half a million acres of rice, almost all of it sticky
short-grain and medium-grain varieties related to the rice grown in
Japan. This yearly assault comes hard on the heels of the harvest
in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi, where long-grain
rice is grown. Just about the time that Crowley, La., cranks up for
its post-harvest festival in mid-October, the farmers of the
Sacramento Valley are in the thick of it, and the roads around
towns like Marysville, Yuba City and Richvale swarm with trucks
headed for the drying stations and the rice mills.
</P>
<P>
   It might as well be a secret military operation. Most Americans,
and many Californians, do not realize that California grows rice at
all, although it accounts for a quarter of the national crop, and
diners eat it every time they set foot in a sushi restaurant or
bite into a rice cake.
</P>
<P>
   Rice may be America's most paradoxical crop, a rising culinary
star in a country that has almost no indigenous rice culture. The
United States harvests prodigious amounts, about 9 million tons
last year, making it one of the world's top 10 producers. Yet, by
and large, rice has been a minor player on the culinary scene.
Southwestern Louisiana developed an authentic rice-based cuisine,
with dishes like jambalaya and crawfish etoufee, but in the rest of
the United States, the grain appears most prominently in poor-man's
dishes like red beans and rice, or in industrial products like Rice
Krispies.
</P>
<P>
   That picture is changing. In the last decade, rice consumption
has risen from about 16 pounds a person to more than 25 pounds.
Some of the increase can be attributed to Hispanic and Asian
immigration, and some to a growing emphasis on grains as an
essential part of a healthy diet.
</P>
<P>
   A third reason can be found in the more adventurous national
palate. A fascination with the cuisines of Asia and the Middle East
has put the spotlight on exotic rices like Indian Basmati, Thai
jasmine, Italian Arborio and Japanese koshihikari, and California's
rice breeders and farmers have jumped into this new territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like all those,'' said Milton LaMalfa, who grows 28
different rices on 1,800 acres just east of Richvale. ``A lot of
guys don't like to fool around with these specialty markets because
it takes a lot of trouble, but if we can grow 40 or 50 acres of
something that will fetch a premium, then we want to be in on the
ground floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg Brothers Farms, in Richvale, has built a thriving
business with organic rices that include some downright weird
hybrids, including a black Japanese-style rice and a long red
Basmati-related rice called Wehani, an acronym forged from the
first names of the four Lundberg brothers, Wendell, Eldon, Harlan
and Homer, and their late father, Albert. The ``ni'' is extra.
``Homer just decided the ni sounded Indian-ish,'' said Grant
Lundberg, Eldon's son and the company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   For chefs, the new activity on the rice front adds a little
glamour to a grain that needed some badly. ``For years, I didn't
want to see a grain of rice on the menu,'' said Bradley Ogden, the
chef and owner of the Lark Creek Inn in Larkspur, Calif. ``Now,
they've come out with varieties that are exciting to see. You can
play with the wording on the menu and cook in different styles.''
Ogden has used some of the newer rices to make a black-rice
jambalaya and a risotto with scallops.
</P>
<P>
   With a little luck, rice may recapture some of the star power it
had three centuries ago, when Carolina Gold set the world standard
for quality. Where the rice came from no one knows, although
Madagascar seems most likely, but this medium-long-grain rice, with
a deep-orange hull, took to the tidelands of South Carolina, and
later found its way to Georgia and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It emerged as an enormously profitable crop, second only to
tobacco in value. In 1775, the colonies exported 66 million pounds
of the golden grain. The reign of Carolina Gold lasted for 150
years, until cotton sent it into decline. In the end, the small,
hand-farmed plantations of the Southeast, with their squishy soil,
could not compete with the huge, mechanized rice fields that were
established on the flat prairies of Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas
in the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   In California, state officials and farmers had been thinking
hard about rice ever since the 1850s, when thousands of Chinese
began streaming into the state in search of gold. Attempts to grow
rice in overflow lands along the San Joaquin River in the Central
Valley came to nothing. The soil was too rich and porous, the
nights too cold, and farmers were trying the wrong varieties.
Eventually, eyes turned to the Sacramento Valley, a swath of
table-flat land that runs 150 miles from Sacramento north to
Redding, bounded on the west by the Coast Range and on the east by
the Sierra Nevadas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1912, farmers near Biggs, taking advantage of the area's
water-retaining clay soil, harvested their first commercial rice
crop. Before long, farmers like LaMalfa's grandfather were taking
the train from Nebraska to Oroville, setting up as rice farmers
and, thanks to the long growing season, bringing in enormous
harvests, so large that one Texas newspaper called the Californians
``either the greatest rice farmers or the greatest prevaricators on
earth.''

 MARYSVILLE, Calif.: on earth.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The yields were genuine, and they still are, 8,400 pounds an
acre in a good year, compared with an average of 5,500 pounds an
acre in the Southern rice states.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of productivity has earned the rice industry two
cheers in California. For years, it has been a target of
environmentalists, who point out that it is the state's
fourth-leading user of water among crops. The rice farmers also
lost points for burning the rice straw after the harvest, a
technique that laid a layer of smoke over the valley.
</P>
<P>
   Strained relations have improved lately. Realists point out that
the choice is not between rice farms and pristine oak savannas, but
between rice farms and housing tracts. In addition, a 1991 state
law has reduced the practice of burning to 40 percent of the rice
fields. On most fields, the rice straw is plowed back into the
ground after harvest and the fields are flooded, allowing the straw
to decompose and creating a winter resort for the birds and
waterfowl that cruise the Pacific Flyway.
</P>
<P>
   As planting time approaches in late April, the farmers soak
their seeds for about 24 hours, and dry them for another 24. When a
root hair emerges, the seed is boarded onto a biplane that buzzes
the flooded rice fields, distributing its load over land that has
been leveled using a laser guidance system. The laser method is so
accurate that the water depth varies by as little as half an inch
at either end of a field.
</P>
<P>
   As winds blow across the paddies, the seeds, pushed by wave
action, find their way through four to five inches of water into
V-shaped furrows. The seed takes hold and shoots up four inches in
10 days. For the next 130 to 150 days, the rice simply grows,
developing a two-foot green stalk, and a golden head so heavy with
kernels that by harvest time it bows, as it were, chin to chest.
When the kernels reach a moisture level of 24 percent, the harvest
begins.
</P>
<P>
   Still wrapped in its brown hull, the rice goes from the field to
the drying shed, a giant column that circulates hot air through the
rice until the moisture level comes down to about 14 percent. Then
the rice goes to the mill, where the husks are rubbed off, and the
kernels lose their coating of bran, unless the mill is turning out
brown rice.
</P>
<P>
   Milling time has become tense because of the new emphasis on
premium rices intended for the Japanese, who are notoriously
finicky about quality, especially when it comes to premium
varieties like akirakomachi and koshihikari, prized for their tiny
pearl-like kernels and meltingly smooth texture. In 1995, because
of an unusually bad harvest, Japan bought foreign rice for the
first time. Under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it
must agree to keep the rice door, if not open, at least ajar.
</P>
<P>
   California now accounts for nearly half the 500,000 tons of
foreign rice sold to Japan (virtually no Japanese rice is sold in
the United States). And growers can barely contain their excitement
at the thought of getting to compete head-on with the heavily
subsidized, high-priced Japanese rice.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasing the Japanese, however, has not been easy. Japanese
buyers are acutely sensitive to fissures, the hairline cracks in
the kernel that can cause it to break during cooking. They require
each grain to glow with a translucent white sheen. They require a
nice ``bounce'' to the cooked grain, but at the same time a soft,
melting quality. The rice must stay soft after cooking and reheat
readily. ``In Japan, the grading and tasting of rice is an art,''
said Jim Higa, the director of international sales for California
Pacific Rice Milling in Arbuckle.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a science. To come up with a taste score, the
Japanese subject rice to near-infrared tests that measure protein
and starch levels, and they have developed machines to measure
moisture, potassium-magnesium ratios, and free fatty acids, all of
which affect the flavor of rice. The Japanese have even developed a
texture meter that cooks a grain of rice, ``eats'' it and then
rates it according to how springy and sticky it is.
</P>
<P>
   No one matches the Japanese for being demanding, but every
culture has its own preferences. At the Rice Experiment Station in
Biggs, researchers have been relying on a tasting panel of Sikhs to
judge their latest Basmati-type rice, 96-Y-90, one of four new rice
models that should roll off the Biggs assembly line next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indians like the grain to break across, to crumble,'' said
Kent McKenzie, a plant breeder at the station. ``It's called
beading.'' Sure enough, if you stare closely at a cooked grain of
96-Y-90, it looks a little like pop beads that have been linked
into a chain and then smoothed over. Where other cultures want a
rice grain to plump out, Indians look for a proper basmati to
double its length while retaining its slim profile.
</P>
<P>
   The Biggs station has released 31 new varieties since 1969. Many
of these have been improved medium-grains _ descendants of the
Wataribune rice first grown in the valley _ that are blended and
sold as Calrose, which accounts for 80 percent of the California
crop. Table-rice brands like Tamaki are a premium version of
Calrose; Kokuho Rose, a widely sold premium rice, is a close cousin
to Calrose that was developed by Nomura Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Biggs station has also developed long-grain rices intended
to compete with their Southern cousins, a California Arborio and
Calmochi. Calmochi is a California version of mochigome rice, the
supersticky rice that the Japanese make into New Year's treats and
American companies use to bind gravy and fillings.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the station, farmers like the Lundbergs take their own
walk on the wild side. Donna Wallace of Bayliss Farms has developed
Calriso, an Arborio-type rice that crosses carnaroli, the best
Italian rice for risotto, with Calrose.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the Lundbergs, who will do just about
anything. Short-grain, long-grain, red, mahogany, black or brown _
if it's rice, the Lundbergs will breed it and grow it. When a
planting mistake gave them a field of speckled red rice, they
simply harvested it and sold the motley package as Christmas Rice,
touting its ``mysteriously musky flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice with sex appeal? It took California to find it.

<P>
   Adapted from Bradley Ogden, Lark Creek Inn, Larkspur, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Time:1 hour
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup lemon juice, plus extra for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped chives
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup diced leeks, white part only
</P>
<P>
   1 small yellow Spanish onion, peeled and diced
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup Calriso or other Arborio rice
</P>
<P>
   3 cups (or more if desired) cabernet sauvignon
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 pound diver scallops, or sea scallops, tough muscles removed
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons toasted cracked mustard seeds, for garnish
(optional).
</P>
<P>
   1. In a small nonreactive saucepan, combine 1/2 cup lemon juice
and the lemon zest. Place over high heat, and bring to a boil.
Immediately remove from the heat. Strain into a clean pan,
discarding the zest. Add 3 tablespoons butter to the pan, and place
over low heat just until the butter is melted. Remove from heat,
and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the chives; keep
warm.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a heavy-bottomed 4-quart saucepan over medium heat, warm 1
tablespoon olive oil. Add the leeks, onion and garlic. Cover the
pan and allow the mixture to soften without browning, stirring
occasionally, for about 4 minutes. Add the remaining tablespoon
butter, and the rice. Saute until the rice is translucent, 2 to 3
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add about 1/2 cup wine,
stirring continuously until the wine is completely absorbed. Add
another 1/2 cup wine, and again stir until it is absorbed. Repeat
this process until all the wine is used, a total of 25 to 30
minutes. (The rice will be al dente. For a creamier consistency,
add more wine and cook longer.) Add the Parmesan cheese, and salt
and pepper to taste. Cover, and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a large nonreactive saute pan over high heat, heat the
remaining olive oil until sizzling. Season the scallops with salt
and pepper to taste, and add to pan. Sear until golden brown on
both sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from pan, and sprinkle with a
little lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, spoon or mold risotto in the center of 4 serving
plates or soup bowls. Arrange scallops in the center of the
risotto. Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of the lemon broth around the
risotto. If desired, sprinkle each plate with 1/2 teaspoon toasted
cracked mustard seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it was all over, when he had finished
choreographing ``The Lion King,'' won his Tony Award and returned
home to Rochester, Garth Fagan was relieved to be back with his
dance company.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, his ``Lion King'' experience had been wonderful, but Fagan
welcomed the opportunity to choreograph for bodies without having
to worry about how they would balance with elaborate puppets on
their arms and cumbersome masks on their heads. To move dancers
around without having to worry about dodging tracks in the floor
and large pieces of scenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was heaven,'' said Fagan, 58. ``Suddenly I'm using an empty
space to dance on, clear space that I can carve. Critics have
always commented on the physical condition of my dancers. It was a
joy to see that without anything covering, so you can see the
movement with more clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's 13-member modern-dance company is back in New York this
week for a 12-day run at the Joyce Theater. In its 28th season, the
company has been widely acclaimed for Fagan's signature style,
which combines African, Caribbean, modern and classical influences.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan said he liked to create movement with a purpose and a
meaning. In his ``Two Pieces of One: Green,'' which is having its
world premiere this week, Fagan said he had tried to explore the
idea of ``two different perspectives making one unified position.''
As a result, the work is set to the music of a contemporary jazz
musician, Tony Williams, and a 16th-century composer, Cristobal de
Morales. ``I like jazz, I like Gregorian chant,'' Fagan said. ``Why
not investigate them all?''
</P>
<P>
   It is Fagan's inventive iconoclasm _ evident in pieces like his
celebrated ``Griot New York'' (1991) _ that has earned him forceful
critical praise over the years. In 1994, Anna Kisselgoff wrote of
Fagan in The New York Times: ``As a choreographer, Fagan goes his
own way. His works can refer to serious social issues (AIDS, urban
ills). But he has none of the self-awareness of his contemporaries
in modern dance, and he is willing to follow his fancy to the point
of oddity, in both vocabulary and structure.''
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Pennewell, who has danced with Fagan's troupe for 19 years,
said the choreographer often incorporated other creative forms.
``He's always researching different art exhibits or architectures
or poetry readings,'' Pennewell said. ``He likes to use a lot of
those past experiences as reference points.''
</P>
<P>
   This dramatic, daring quality of Fagan's dances got him the
attention of Peter Schneider and Thomas Schumacher at Walt Disney
Theatrical Productions, which produced ``The Lion King,'' and Julie
Taymor, who directed the wildly successful musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not looking for traditional choreography because the
show was so outside the definition of a traditional Broadway
show,'' Schumacher said. ``It really had to be a fusion of
contemporary and of indigenous. Mr. Garth was a great candidate for
that. It seemed to come very easily to him.''
</P>
<P>
   After considering the work of several choreographers, Ms. Taymor
said, she went to see Fagan's company perform, and that made her
decision easy. ``I could really see how the isolation movements of
the bodies would really lend themselves to the animal moves,'' she
said, adding that ``his own particular interest in the flexibility
of the torso would really be great for mask work and the needs of
`The Lion King.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan had worked on a couple of theatrical productions before:
``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' at the Public Theater in 1988 and
Duke Ellington's musical, ``Queenie Pie,'' which he also directed,
at the Kennedy Center in 1986. But ``The Lion King,'' he says, was
a show of a different order.
</P>
<P>
   First, there were the logistical complications of dealing with
the puppets and large headdresses that the dancers manipulate as
they move. ``When a dancer does a leap, that's one thing,'' Fagan
said. ``But when you leap with a gazelle on your head and two on
your arms, you've got to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fagan said he wanted his choreography to work on
several levels _ conveying a clear sense of character, furthering
the plot, bringing the animals to life. ``I had to come up with new
things that gave the effect of natural animals, at the same time
keeping the duality of animal and person alive throughout,'' Fagan
said. ``In concert dance you can abstract, you can meander, you can
go away from. Here, you had to tell the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Because, for example, the dance of the lionesses early on in the
show is pivotal in establishing their role in the jungle, Fagan
said, it was crucial to get the choreography just right. ``It sets
up the lionesses as being the moving forces, the ones who hunt and
the ones who keep the pride while the male lions fight,'' he said.
``So it was a very important metaphor for contemporary women.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Fagan said, the hyenas had to be murderous and
treacherous and human at the same time. And then, of course, he had
to keep the children in the audience interested. ``In using every
type of dance that was available to me _ modern, African, ballet
and regular childlike horseplay,'' Fagan said, ``I wanted every kid
to plug into something as being familiar from classes or different
cultures and make that universal.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's interest in dance grew out of his experience with
gymnastics. His father, the chief education officer of Jamaica,
where Fagan was born, initially did not approve. ``My father was an
Oxford graduate, and he didn't understand that dancing could go
this far,'' Fagan said. ``He wanted me to be one of the
lawyer-doctor types, an educator like he was. I just knew I wanted
to do this, and I couldn't explain to him that it was more than fat
girls running around the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan began his professional career in high school, touring
Latin America with Ivy Baxter and the Jamaican National Dance
Company. After graduating from Wayne State University in Detroit,
he performed with several dance companies in Detroit before moving
to Rochester in 1970 to teach at the State University of New York
at Brockport, where he is now a Distinguished University Professor,
and start his company.
</P>
<P>
   He has been honored with awards before. But winning the Tony _
along with the Drama Desk Award, the Outer Critics Circle Award and
the Astaire Award _ for ``The Lion King'' was, Fagan said,
particularly momentous.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a modern-dance choreographer from the not-for-profit world,
I felt very proud and honored,'' he said. ``To represent the
integrity of artists like myself, who worked for pennies for
years.''

<P>
   YPRES, France -- An old man, frail but still standing tall,
stepped forward from the crowd of onlookers Tuesday morning to do
what he always does at this time of year. With regimental cap
firmly on his head, and medals hanging heavy from his top pocket,
he bent forward to lay a wreath ``From All London Scots'' at the
monument to his old comrades.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery around is rolling green pastoral, the battle honors
on the granite -- from Palestine to the Somme -- read like a
history of the First World War. ``Strike Sure'' is the motto on the
regimental badge.
</P>
<P>
   The simple message on the wreath tells who the man is: ``Harold
Judd, Private, 516997, Second Batt. Aged 100 Years.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't remember how many times he has done this since he first
revisited the battlefields near Ypres just eight years after the
guns finally fell silent. But he always has the same thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think of the boys, friends that I lost,'' he says. This
year, of course, is special, with Wednesday marking the 80th
anniversary of the Armistice. There is also the particularly sad
fact to be faced that Harold and the five other veterans on his
trip may not all return.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he says, he also thinks about how his friends died.
Like the young man with whom he joined the Army, at 18, who was
killed on his first day in action.
</P>
<P>
   He has no difficulty remembering how the two were sent forward
as wire-cutters when an ineffective artillery barrage had left the
enemy's barbed wire intact. How they completed their task to allow
the boys ``to get through.'' How he had to leave his dead pal Fred
in the rush forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just carry on and join in with it all. Once you're on the
move you all go together,'' he says, speaking in the present tense
as though it were still going on. ``You mustn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   He also still knows why he joined in 1917, as soon as he was 18.
With conscription coming in he wanted to be a volunteer and to
choose his regiment in line with his Scottish background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do things willingly, but I hate to be forced,'' he says.
There is still fierceness behind the old, glistening eyes.
</P>
<P>
   While he jokes and describes himself as ``still a bit of a
fool,'' there is also just a hint of bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he was having another thought. ``Was it all
worthwhile?'' he said, pointing out that this was not, after all,
the war to end all wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think politicians would have learnt their lesson,'' he
added. ``They may have done if they'd had a basinful of it like we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Burns, 103 on Wednesday and the last surviving member of
the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, said he had no difficulty in
remembering it all -- from the day he joined in 1914 until he was
demobbed five years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget the other people that were with me. I have
my leg to remind me every day,'' he said, referring to the wound he
received on the Somme. He is also one of the last survivors of the
Battle of Loos, in 1915, which he said, ``was just as bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking from beneath the awe-inspiring Menin Gate at
Ypres where the 54,800 dead, with no known grave, from that sector
alone are commemorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more visits I make the more touching it seems to be.
Because there are so few of us left. To see them now, on the way
out ...'' and then his voice trailed away.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of it all now, Burns replied only that as
simple soldiers they just had to do what they were told. ``We just
lived from day to day -- despite the cold and hunger and nightmares
and everything else, just hoping to goodness it would be over any
day.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Royal Signaller aged 20, Arthur Halestrap was listening in
on the wireless when the Armistice announcement was made and the
bells began to chime.
</P>
<P>
   Serving with the 46th Midlands Division in their final battles
for the Hindenberg Line and beyond, he reports a surprising
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went quiet, eerily quiet. There was such a
relaxation to the point where life seemed to be empty. There was
nothing to do,'' he said. ``We were completely lost, but it was
only temporary.''
</P>
<P>
   His subsequent reactions to the war and to his own visits to the
battlefields have been more predictable, and were just as
eloquently expressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come back here, all I can think of is the tens of
thousands of men of my own generation who died in terrible,
terrible circumstances -- hanging off barbed wire for days in some
cases with their pals being shot trying to rescue them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think that these young men had volunteered and died for
an ideal -- the preserving of our own country and the safety of
loved ones at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he is interrupted by someone wanting him to sign a
visitors' book. He simply records his name, number and unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I do that,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After 17 years of tasting and testing mail-order food for the
holidays, I think I have gotten choosing favorites down to
something of a science.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 100 items arrived at my house (none were
ordered under my own name). To make it into the finals, the food
had to arrive when promised, be fresh, and intact. Of course, it
had to taste great.
</P>
<P>
   And especially at these prices, the ingredients had to be real.
Things made with margarine that are supposed to be made with butter
were automatically eliminated. So were those that contain
additives. This year, some Southern pulled pork was dropped because
it contained monosodium glutamate.
</P>
<P>
   Products from 24 companies made the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years I have learned that, with few exceptions, the
best food tends to come from companies that are run by individuals
whose personal reputations rise and fall on what they produce. The
large companies often had some of the worst shipping problems.
</P>
<P>
   The final test came when 40 guests were invited to sample the
finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their favorites were no surprise: one was richer than
the next _ a deep-dish apple-walnut sour-cream cake, and a
handsome, intense chocolate truffle cake. Oh, someone complained
that the salmon, cream cheese and caviar cake was messy to cut, but
that didn't stop people from inhaling it.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected favorite in this year's tasting was _ of all
things _ maple fudge. Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of Health and
Human Services, gave it her highest rating and then took home the
leftovers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are some winners from 24 companies. The last date orders
are accepted for Christmas delivery is included. The last date
orders are accepted for Christmas delivery is included. Except
where otherwise noted, shipping is extra, and the companies accept
American Express, Mastercard and Visa. &QL;

<P>
   YPRES, Belgium -- An old man, frail but still standing tall,
stepped forward from the crowd of onlookers Tuesday morning to do
what he always does at this time of year. With regimental cap
firmly on his head, and medals hanging heavy from his top pocket,
he bent forward to lay a wreath ``From All London Scots'' at the
monument to his old comrades.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery around is rolling green pastoral, the battle honors
on the granite -- from Palestine to the Somme -- read like a
history of the First World War. ``Strike Sure'' is the motto on the
regimental badge.
</P>
<P>
   The simple message on the wreath tells who the man is: ``Harold
Judd, Private, 516997, Second Batt. Aged 100 Years.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't remember how many times he has done this since he first
revisited the battlefields near Ypres just eight years after the
guns finally fell silent. But he always has the same thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think of the boys, friends that I lost,'' he says. This
year, of course, is special, with Wednesday marking the 80th
anniversary of the Armistice. There is also the particularly sad
fact to be faced that Harold and the five other veterans on his
trip may not all return.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he says, he also thinks about how his friends died.
Like the young man with whom he joined the Army, at 18, who was
killed on his first day in action.
</P>
<P>
   He has no difficulty remembering how the two were sent forward
as wire-cutters when an ineffective artillery barrage had left the
enemy's barbed wire intact. How they completed their task to allow
the boys ``to get through.'' How he had to leave his dead pal Fred
in the rush forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just carry on and join in with it all. Once you're on the
move you all go together,'' he says, speaking in the present tense
as though it were still going on. ``You mustn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   He also still knows why he joined in 1917, as soon as he was 18.
With conscription coming in he wanted to be a volunteer and to
choose his regiment in line with his Scottish background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do things willingly, but I hate to be forced,'' he says.
There is still fierceness behind the old, glistening eyes.
</P>
<P>
   While he jokes and describes himself as ``still a bit of a
fool,'' there is also just a hint of bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he was having another thought. ``Was it all
worthwhile?'' he said, pointing out that this was not, after all,
the war to end all wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think politicians would have learnt their lesson,'' he
added. ``They may have done if they'd had a basinful of it like we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Burns, 103 on Wednesday and the last surviving member of
the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, said he had no difficulty in
remembering it all -- from the day he joined in 1914 until he was
demobbed five years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget the other people that were with me. I have
my leg to remind me every day,'' he said, referring to the wound he
received on the Somme. He is also one of the last survivors of the
Battle of Loos, in 1915, which he said, ``was just as bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking from beneath the awe-inspiring Menin Gate at
Ypres where the 54,800 dead, with no known grave, from that sector
alone are commemorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more visits I make the more touching it seems to be.
Because there are so few of us left. To see them now, on the way
out ...'' and then his voice trailed away.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of it all now, Burns replied only that as
simple soldiers they just had to do what they were told. ``We just
lived from day to day -- despite the cold and hunger and nightmares
and everything else, just hoping to goodness it would be over any
day.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Royal Signaller aged 20, Arthur Halestrap was listening in
on the wireless when the Armistice announcement was made and the
bells began to chime.
</P>
<P>
   Serving with the 46th Midlands Division in their final battles
for the Hindenberg Line and beyond, he reports a surprising
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went quiet, eerily quiet. There was such a
relaxation to the point where life seemed to be empty. There was
nothing to do,'' he said. ``We were completely lost, but it was
only temporary.''
</P>
<P>
   His subsequent reactions to the war and to his own visits to the
battlefields have been more predictable, and were just as
eloquently expressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come back here, all I can think of is the tens of
thousands of men of my own generation who died in terrible,
terrible circumstances -- hanging off barbed wire for days in some
cases with their pals being shot trying to rescue them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think that these young men had volunteered and died for
an ideal -- the preserving of our own country and the safety of
loved ones at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he is interrupted by someone wanting him to sign a
visitors' book. He simply records his name, number and unit.
</P>

BEWARE OF SNAGS WITH MAIL-ORDER FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both Neiman Marcus and Williams-Sonoma have made their
reputations offering high-quality products. Now each company is
offering an impressive mail-order catalog devoted to food. The
companies' size and prestige make them hard to ignore in a roundup
of mail-order food for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   But the results from both companies point up the inevitable
problems when ordering from large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Using another name, I ordered six items by phone from
Williams-Sonoma. The catalog explains that merchandise is only
delivered on Thursdays and must be ordered by 6 p.m. on Wednesday
of the previous week. I asked if I could order two weeks in advance
and was assured that I could.
</P>
<P>
   So I was surprised to find that some of the food arrived one
week before I wanted it. When I called the company, the customer
service representative apologized but could not explain why part of
the order had come early without the rest of the items (which
arrived at the right time).
</P>
<P>
   A supervisor explained that orders could only be placed one week
in advance and that the person who had taken my order had been
mistaken. She, too, apologized, credited my account for the full
amount and sent out a $100 Williams-Sonoma gift certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system is hardly customer-friendly: If food can only be
delivered on Thursday, obviously anything you order for a Tuesday
party will be five days old.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of some of the food was also surprising, especially
considering the prices. Eight three-ounce crab and scallop cakes
for $48 had more filler than seafood; two three-ounce cheese rounds
at $28 were so hard they could not be cut with a knife, and four
14-ounce stuffed pork chops at $55 were dry and tasteless. (None of
these prices include shipping.)
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus requires seven business days to deliver. Of the
three perishable items I ordered, one arrived on the day specified,
a Friday. I called about the others and asked to have them shipped
again on Saturday for Sunday delivery. I was assured that the
company would if possible, but that in any case someone would call
me on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the second item arrived from the original shipment,
a day late and too warm to be safe to use; the promised phone call
never came. The following Monday the third item arrived (again from
the original shipment), three days late and certainly not edible.
Still no phone call. When I called customer service on Monday, I
received an apology and a refund _ but neither of those things
helped my party.

   YPRES, Belgium -- An old man, frail but still standing tall,
stepped forward from the crowd of onlookers Tuesday morning to do
what he always does at this time of year. With regimental cap
firmly on his head, and medals hanging heavy from his top pocket,
he bent forward to lay a wreath ``From All London Scots'' at the
monument to his old comrades.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery around is rolling green pastoral, the battle honors
on the granite -- from Palestine to the Somme -- read like a
history of the First World War. ``Strike Sure'' is the motto on the
regimental badge.
</P>
<P>
   The simple message on the wreath tells who the man is: ``Harold
Judd, Private, 516997, Second Batt. Aged 100 Years.''
</P>
<P>
   He can't remember how many times he has done this since he first
revisited the battlefields near Ypres just eight years after the
guns finally fell silent. But he always has the same thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think of the boys, friends that I lost,'' he says. This
year, of course, is special, with Wednesday marking the 80th
anniversary of the Armistice. There is also the particularly sad
fact to be faced that Harold and the five other veterans on his
trip may not all return.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he says, he also thinks about how his friends died.
Like the young man with whom he joined the Army, at 18, who was
killed on his first day in action.
</P>
<P>
   He has no difficulty remembering how the two were sent forward
as wire-cutters when an ineffective artillery barrage had left the
enemy's barbed wire intact. How they completed their task to allow
the boys ``to get through.'' How he had to leave his dead pal Fred
in the rush forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just carry on and join in with it all. Once you're on the
move you all go together,'' he says, speaking in the present tense
as though it were still going on. ``You mustn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   He also still knows why he joined in 1917, as soon as he was 18.
With conscription coming in he wanted to be a volunteer and to
choose his regiment in line with his Scottish background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do things willingly, but I hate to be forced,'' he says.
There is still fierceness behind the old, glistening eyes.
</P>
<P>
   While he jokes and describes himself as ``still a bit of a
fool,'' there is also just a hint of bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he was having another thought. ``Was it all
worthwhile?'' he said, pointing out that this was not, after all,
the war to end all wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think politicians would have learnt their lesson,'' he
added. ``They may have done if they'd had a basinful of it like we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Burns, 103 on Wednesday and the last surviving member of
the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, said he had no difficulty in
remembering it all -- from the day he joined in 1914 until he was
demobbed five years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never forget the other people that were with me. I have
my leg to remind me every day,'' he said, referring to the wound he
received on the Somme. He is also one of the last survivors of the
Battle of Loos, in 1915, which he said, ``was just as bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking from beneath the awe-inspiring Menin Gate at
Ypres where the 54,800 dead, with no known grave, from that sector
alone are commemorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more visits I make the more touching it seems to be.
Because there are so few of us left. To see them now, on the way
out ...'' and then his voice trailed away.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of it all now, Burns replied only that as
simple soldiers they just had to do what they were told. ``We just
lived from day to day -- despite the cold and hunger and nightmares
and everything else, just hoping to goodness it would be over any
day.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Royal Signaller aged 20, Arthur Halestrap was listening in
on the wireless when the Armistice announcement was made and the
bells began to chime.
</P>
<P>
   Serving with the 46th Midlands Division in their final battles
for the Hindenberg Line and beyond, he reports a surprising
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went quiet, eerily quiet. There was such a
relaxation to the point where life seemed to be empty. There was
nothing to do,'' he said. ``We were completely lost, but it was
only temporary.''
</P>
<P>
   His subsequent reactions to the war and to his own visits to the
battlefields have been more predictable, and were just as
eloquently expressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come back here, all I can think of is the tens of
thousands of men of my own generation who died in terrible,
terrible circumstances -- hanging off barbed wire for days in some
cases with their pals being shot trying to rescue them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think that these young men had volunteered and died for
an ideal -- the preserving of our own country and the safety of
loved ones at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he is interrupted by someone wanting him to sign a
visitors' book. He simply records his name, number and unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I do that,'' he said.

HOW TO COOK `STICKY' RICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost all the rice grown in California is ``sticky rice,'' the
mostly short-or medium-grain varieties that clump together when
cooked. Besides being the appropriate rice for sushi and other
Japanese dishes, sticky rices make ideal rice cakes and add a
heftier texture to rice salads.
</P>
<P>
   Like all members of the subspecies japonica, these rices contain
high levels of the starch amylopectin and low levels of amylose,
the other starch in rice. Rices like Basmati or Southern-style
long-grains, also known as indica rices because they originated in
India, have low levels of amylopectin and high levels of amylose,
meaning they cook up drier.
</P>
<P>
   In their cookbook ``Seductions of Rice'' (Artisan, 1998),
Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid offer instructions for making
Japanese-style rice. First, rinse the rice with cold water several
times before cooking to remove excess starch; otherwise the rice
will be too sticky. When the water runs clear, let the rice sit in
a sieve for 20 to 30 minutes, absorbing the water that clings to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Using one and a sixth cups water for each cup of rice, put the
rice and water in a heavy medium-size pot, uncovered, and turn the
heat to high. When the water reaches a vigorous boil, cover and
reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook for 5 minutes, then reduce the
heat to very low and cook 10 more minutes. Remove from the heat,
and let stand for 10 minutes before serving. Do not uncover or stir
the rice at any point before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Sticky rice should feel tacky _ that is, adhesive enough to form
a convenient clump when herded by a pair of chopsticks, but not
gooey or mushy. Each grain should be plump, shiny and distinct.
``It should be toothsome,'' said Rocco DiSpirito, executive chef at
Union Pacific in Manhattan. ``You want it slightly chewy, with a
little springiness in it.''

CLINTON TO ATTEND PACIFIC RIM MEETING, BOLSTER ASIAN ECONOMIES
THROUGH TRADE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Tuesday he and other Pacific
Rim leaders will work to bolster Asian economies when they meet
next week to discuss broad trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
in Malaysia despite the crisis over Iraq's defiance of
international arms inspectors, spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
Clinton's attendance had been in doubt as the United States
contemplates military strikes against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The president, talking trade to students and experts gathered at
the massive Ronald Reagan Building, provided a broad overview of
the upcoming APEC session and economic issues facing the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll work on speeding the economic recovery in Asia,
strengthening the social safety net, helping companies there to
restructure their debt so they can emerge from the crushing burdens
they face and once again employ people and pay them wages,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration fears the Asian economic collapse, which
already has helped push Russia into a meltdown, could work its way
through Latin America and eventually disrupt the United States
growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton again pointed to Japan as the key to reviving the
Pacific Rim markets. The president plans to stop in Tokyo, as well
as South Korea, after the APEC meeting next week in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The restoration of growth in Japan, which has been stalled now
for more than five years, is absolutely essential to the
restoration of growth in the remainder of Asia,'' Clinton said.
``The rest of us look to Japan to move quickly to implement the
good banking reforms which have been passed, to spur demand for
goods and services in the home market, to reduce unnecessary
regulations and to open its markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of APEC is to bring down all tariff barriers and
promote free trade throughout the region. The United States has a
similar goal with the nations in Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his administration would again ``find common
ground'' with Congress to pass the so-called fast-track negotiating
authority that would allow him to negotiate trade pacts free of
amendment by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The president also warned nations that are dumping their steel
products into the United States. ``We are committed to a full and
timely enforcement of our trade laws to address unfair trade
practices affecting this industry, and we will insist that our key
trading partners play by the rules,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton earlier signed into law a measure agreeing with other
nations to crackdown on international bribery. The international
agreement requires nations that sign it to enact laws outlawing
their citizens from bribing foreign officials to win business
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States has had such laws for 20 years and the
international pact will help level the playing field for U.S.
companies. &QL;

   For the Marsalis brothers, it's quite a week. Thursday night in
New York at Carnegie Hall, the Grammy Award-winning saxophonist
Branford Marsalis joins the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band for a salute to
two great swing-era band leaders, Jimmie Lunceford and Tommy
Dorsey. Friday, in Weill Recital Hall, the Orion String Quartet
will perform the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Wynton Marsalis'
first string quartet, ``At the Octoroon Balls.'' Inspired by
Marsalis' early life in New Orleans, its motifs include Creole
dances and runaway trains.

   Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen were among the stars named
Tuesday for induction next year into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
in Cleveland. Also named were Del Shannon, Curtis Mayfield, Dusty
Springfield, Billy Joel, the Staples Singers, Charles Brown and Bob
Wills and the Texas Playboys. With George Martin, the British
record producer who offered the Beatles their first contract, they
are to be inducted in March in a ceremony in New York.

   George Romney (1734-1802), the popular English portraitist,
often turned to Shakespeare's plays for inspiration. The Folger
Shakespeare Library in Washington has nearly 500 of his drawings,
most never exhibited. Tuesday 116 went on view in `` `Designs From
Fancy': George Romney's Shakespearean Drawings.''

   Ellis Island is a National Monument, and on the north side, its
famous Main Immigration Building, restored and renovated in the
1980s, is a prime tourist attraction. But on the south side, two
dozen historic buildings, smothered in shrubs and vines, stand
abandoned. Between 1900 and 1937, this was a hospital complex where
some 10 percent of the 12 million immigrants who reached the island
were detained before they could enter the country. Starting
Thursday, this complex will be the focus of ``Forgotten Gateway:
The Abandoned Buildings of Ellis Island,'' at the National Building
Museum in Washington. The 37 large-format photographs by Larry
Racioppo capture the intimacy and ghostly emptiness of the complex.

   The Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester is
celebrating the arrival in the United States of manuscripts of all
original music composed by Kurt Weill when he lived in Germany,
including ``The Threepenny Opera.'' Weill's Viennese publisher,
Universal Edition AG, has turned them over to the Sibley Music
Library at the Eastman School, where a Weill festival begins
Wednesday and ends Saturday.

   Elections Vs. Hurricane Mitch
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 people died in floods or mudslides brought on
by Hurricane Mitch in Central America, and the infrastructures of
Nicaragua and Honduras were virtually destroyed. Big news story,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Yet the network evening news broadcasts devoted a total of only
53 minutes to it in the two weeks that ended with Friday's
broadcasts _ roughly half the coverage given earlier this year to
two much less damaging hurricanes, Bonnie (104 minutes) and Georges
(94).
</P>
<P>
   Was this because Mitch's devastation became news at the height
of election coverage or because Mitch did not threaten the United
States?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to say it's isolationism and xenophobia, there's no
way around it,'' said Andrew Tyndall, publisher of the Tyndall
Report, a weekly newsletter that tracks coverage on the major
networks' evening news broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   But logistics played some role. Networks have fewer reporters in
Central America, and the devastation restricted reporting further.
</P>
<P>
   ``All news organizations were caught off guard by the amount of
destruction down there,'' said David Doss, executive producer of
NBC's ``Nightly News,'' which led its broadcast with Mitch stories
two nights last week while CBS and ABC led with it only once.
``Once the real gravity of it filtered out, we moved in very
quickly.'' Doss also pointed out that two other major news events
were happening then: John Glenn's space flight and the midterm
elections.
</P>
<P>
   At ABC News, the two men who run ``Nightline'' _ anchor Ted
Koppel and executive producer Tom Bettag _ talked Saturday and
decided to spend four consecutive programs this week (starting
Tuesday night) examining Mitch's devastation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all covering the election, and I don't think we were
paying proper attention to the storm,'' Koppel said Tuesday,
speaking by cellular phone from a riverbank in Choluteca, Honduras,
where he was waiting for a helicopter to take him to his next stop.
``There was until two weeks ago a huge bridge over this river,'' he
added. ``It was built by the Japanese as a gift to Honduras. Now
one end of it is in the middle of the river.''

<P>
   Fox on NBC's Tail
</P>
<P>
   Now maybe it's time for NBC to get worried. Far from dominating,
as usual, a ratings sweep month, those all-important ratings
competitions, NBC finds itself in an all-out struggle with Fox
among viewers between 18 and 49 _ the only race those two networks
count _ and with CBS among viewers of any age.
</P>
<P>
   The news from two weeks ago surely raised some eyebrows, if not
hackles, at NBC. That week Fox beat NBC among those precious
18-to-49-year-olds, and last week the competition for that group,
was, to steal a quote from Dan Rather's election-night Bartlett's,
``tighter than last year's bathing suit.'' NBC edged Fox by
one-tenth of a rating point.
</P>
<P>
   For the November sweep, NBC's lead over Fox has dwindled to
four-tenths of a point.
</P>
<P>
   Most ominous is the news from Thursday, the night NBC has owned
like a birthright. Last week, Fox, relying on one of those
down-and-dirty video specials it pulls out of its crypt every sweep
month (``Shocking Moments Caught on Tape!'' _ including courtroom
brawls and a mudslide wiping out a street), drew huge numbers of
male viewers away from NBC.
</P>
<P>
   That was never possible when ``Seinfeld'' ruled the night,
because male viewers were devoted to that comedy. The same is
clearly not true for ``Frasier'' and certainly not for ``Veronica's
Closet,'' NBC's latest disappointing beneficiary of the best time
period on television.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of the other disappointments, ``Suddenly Susan'' and
``Caroline in the City,'' are now on Monday, where this week they
all but collapsed under the growing strength of CBS's comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it has already merited one magazine cover
(Entertainment Weekly), ``Will and Grace'' was drubbed Monday night
by CBS's new comedy, ``Becker,'' now teamed with the emerging hit
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' as the real comedy deal on Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, ``Frasier'' and ``Veronica'' will have to contend with
perhaps the most potently lurid Fox special yet _ and certainly the
one with the best title: ``When Good Pets Go Bad.'' It features
such moments as a man with his whole head squashed in the jaws of
his ``pet'' alligator.
</P>
<P>
   Next week Fox will be back with ``Busted on the Job 3,'' with
such sights as a hotel maid trying on a guest's lingerie and a
disgruntled baker spraying pies with window cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Fox had its own disastrous start to the season but has come back
thanks largely to the return of ``The X-Files'' on Sunday, which
easily dominated all three competitors among young adults,
especially young men.
</P>
<P>
   The ``X-Files'' did fall off sharply from its premiere rating
from a year ago _ down 27 percent _ but still beat last year's
average rating, suggesting there is still life in the show.
</P>

<P>
   A Plus: Rose's Rolodex
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes II'' is the name it was given, but there is nothing
second-string about the on-air team assembled for the latest CBS
News magazine program.
</P>
<P>
   With the announcement Tuesday that Vicki Mabrey and Charlie Rose
have signed contracts, the four correspondents for ``60 II'' are in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rather, anchor of ``The CBS Evening News,'' chief
correspondent on ``48 Hours,'' author, radio commentator and former
correspondent for the original ``60 Minutes,''_ is the marquee
name.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Bob Simon, CBS News' Tel Aviv-based roving
reporter, widely regarded as one of the world's top correspondents,
and Ms. Mabrey, who joined CBS News in 1992 and has been a
correspondent in London for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Rose is the odd duck in that he comes not from CBS News but from
public television, where his talk show is a late-night institution
with a devoted following among intellectuals, artists, policy wonks
and newshounds. Rose will keep his show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Rose is one of the best interviewers out there,'' Jeff
Fager, the executive producer of ``60 II,'' said Tuesday. ``He
brings an amazing hunger for stories, which all four have in
common; he also brings an amazing Rolodex.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mabrey brings a ``fresh face,'' Fager said, while at the
same time being ``a classic `60 Minutes' choice'' because the
magazine's original correspondents all came up through the ranks of
CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   Simon is even more classic; he has done so many reports for ``60
Minutes'' that he could be mistaken for a regular correspondent
there. As for Rather, the main issue is how he will manage to fit
more work into his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan is a workhorse like no other,'' Fager said. ``He just
doesn't stop. He's unsleeping in terms of his desire to report
stories.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Zagat Survey turned 20 this week, grown from a two-page
typed list of New York restaurants into a series of 35 gastronomic
guidebooks, each devoted to a city or region, shaped like an
upended legal-size envelope, written in a telegraphic style and
wrapped in a claret-colored cover.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some criticisms, the guides have become America's
closest analogue to France's Michelin series, the successors to
Duncan Hines' ``Adventures in Good Eating,'' which was the nation's
culinary vade mecum in the 1940s and 50s.
</P>
<P>
   The New York guide sold 500,000 copies last year, and Zagat has
launched successful entries recently in London and Paris, the
latter in both French and English.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the guides are almost as vital to the American traveler
as clean socks. Some have even learned to pronounce their name
correctly, zuh-GAT rather than ZAY-gat or ZAG-it, the favored
mispronunciations.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cities, like Boston and San Francisco, good local
guidebooks provide competition. But among dedicated diners, Zagat
has no national rival for answers to the insistent question,
``Where shall we eat?''
</P>
<P>
   Marcellino's, a knockoff produced by a German entrepreneur, has
limited coverage. A.A.A. and Mobil may be fine for hotels, but
their restaurant ratings remain mired in the Pleistocene era, still
celebrating veal Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well-informed professional critics are important to the elite
restaurant-goer and to the industry,'' said George Lang, the New
York restaurateur, consultant and food writer. ``But the vox populi
that Zagat reflects matters just as much to the great mass of
American restaurant clients.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet many in the trade have their doubts about the guides,
precisely because they are based not on the judgment of
professional critics but on the assessments of thousands of
diners-out _ 18,320 of them in the case of this year's New York
survey _ who fill out questionnaires and mail them in.
</P>
<P>
   Some say amateurs lack the knowledge to rate restaurants
soundly. Some insist that the ballot box can be stuffed. Some argue
that respondents rate restaurants where they have not eaten for
five or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are these people who vote in the surveys?'' asks Piero
Selvaggio, whose flagship restaurant, Valentino, has consistently
been named one of the top spots in the Los Angeles area. ``I find
it hard to believe that most people know enough to make these kinds
of judgments, and harder still to believe that the editors
rigorously follow the results of the balloting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim and Nina Zagat, the guides' owners and editors-in-chief,
have heard all of that before, a hundred times. But they remain
passionate believers in ``consumer democracy,'' as Zagat described
it in an interview the other day, and they defend the integrity of
their technique, which includes the use of a Salt Lake City firm to
handle all the numerical tabulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be doing data processing,'' he said in his
New York office, off Columbus Circle, with an eye-level view of the
explorer atop his column. ``We want somebody above suspicion, like
Price Waterhouse for the Academy Awards or corporate proxy
fights.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagat described himself as ``unimpressed by restaurant critics''
and asked, ``Who gave them a PhD in taste buds?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Zagat, interviewed separately, put a subtler spin on the
matter, crediting critics with ``doing a better job of describing
nuance and mood.'' The Zagat books, she said, cover more
restaurants more often, and from varying perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the top restaurants chosen by Zagat's amateurs do not
vary markedly from those chosen by the pros, whether critics, food
writers or restaurateurs. That is not surprising, since the pros
influence the amateurs to start with, and the Zagats compare the
judgments of control groups, composed of professionals and other
people whom they know personally, to those of the amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   If the amateurs deviate too widely from the control group, a
bell rings in Columbus Circle, and the Zagats scurry to discover
why.
</P>
<P>
   That is one defense against ballot-box stuffing. Another is the
prohibition of Xeroxed ballots; only originals, requested by mail
from the Zagat headquarters or distributed through food societies
and food and wine shops, are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Some completed ballots are discarded, such as those to which no
name is signed and those that contain votes for only one or two
places. There are other bulwarks as well, which the Zagats try to
keep confidential, lest would-be cheaters find ways of breaching
them.
</P>
<P>
   A Manhattan restaurant was eliminated from the guide this year
because respondents rated it much higher than last year and higher
than the control group, and because questionnaires mentioning it
``looked suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Zagats are themselves a safeguard. They eat out
five or six times a week, often twice a day. Jean Georges, just up
the street from their office, is a lunchtime favorite, where they
often order the $28 fixed-price menu; the restaurant is rated 27 on
a scale of 30 for food this year.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite for dinner, where the Zagats are among the select few
who can usually get a reservation, is Rao's, the century-old East
Harlem Neapolitan classic; it is rated 25 for food, with the
comment that tables are ``booked through the year 3,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Zagats are adamant in rejecting accusations that they
juggle the figures. They help choose pithy phrases from the reams
of computer printouts that record every comment that comes on the
evaluation sheets. They and their staff of about 15 try to insure
that comments reflect the ratings, and that the 50- to 70-word
write-ups of each restaurant have a similarity of tone coast to
coast _ ``a kind of New York edge,'' Mrs. Zagat calls it.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious problem with the Zagat methodology is inconsistency
from city to city. The New York ratings are clearly more reliable
than those in Chicago, where only 1,873 diners' views are
represented, or Las Vegas, where the number is 630.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the meaning of the point scores varies from place
to place, although they are arithmetically identical, which could
be confusing to the unknowing. The 28 awarded to L'Antibes in
Columbus, Ohio, for example, is obviously not equal to the 28
garnered by the French Laundry in the Napa Valley, which critics
have called the nation's best restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The problem exists even within the metropolitan area. Sirio
Maccioni of Le Cirque 2000 ``went berserk last year,'' Zagat
acknowledged, when his reborn restaurant was given a 25 for food,
one point less than Soup Kitchen International, which was made
famous by the ``Seinfeld'' television show. (Le Cirque caught up
this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there is something deeply incongruous about a 26 for
Frank Pepe's Pizzeria in New Haven, unmatched though its clam pies
may be, when that is exactly the same rating given to Lutece and La
Caravelle.
</P>
<P>
   There are also scores here and there that seem inexplicable.
Take San Domenico, Tony May's elegant, widely admired Italian
restaurant on Central Park South. Praised in the text for
``swanky'' decor, ``impeccable'' service and a risotto that leaves
clients ``speechless,'' it gets 23's for food and decor, 22 for
service. It is also a no-show on a list of the 13 best Italian
places in the city, which makes the list hard to take very
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Equally perplexing is the exclusion of Stephan Pyles' wonderful
Star Canyon from Dallas' top five, and the exciting Tribute from
Detroit's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that people tend to give the top grade to the best
restaurant in town, no matter how good it is in absolute terms,''
Mrs. Zagat said. ``We know that haute cuisine takes a lot more
skill than soup. People suggest that we massage the grades to iron
out these kinds of problems _ but how? That would mean we were
substituting our judgment for our surveyors' and we aren't prepared
to play God.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagat _ at 58, tall, burly, blunt of speech and boundlessly
energetic _ handles the editorial and marketing chores. He works at
a blond wood desk that could easily seat eight for dinner, seldom
venturing from his office without a pocketful of guides to
distribute to people he meets. Mrs. Zagat, 56, quieter, disciplined
and more emollient, handles financial and legal matters, and is
adapting the guides to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They met in contracts class at the Yale Law School, from which
they graduated in 1966 (after Gary Hart, before Bill Clinton and
Hillary Rodham). Their surveys began as an exchange of information
with legal colleagues about Paris restaurants when they were living
there in the 1970s; they gave their top marks in 1974 to
Taillevent, just after it won its third Michelin star, and Grand
Vefour, before it lost its third when Raymond Oliver sold out.
</P>
<P>
   The New York guide started as a hobby. It stayed that for three
years, until Mrs. Zagat told her husband that it was costing them
at least $10,000 every six months, not including the expense of
eating out. They quickly set up a company, mainly to get tax
deductions for meals. At first, they distributed the guide
themselves, touring Manhattan in their little station wagon,
dropping off copies at any bookstore that would stock them.
</P>
<P>
   The Zagats' big break came when the guide was favorably
mentioned in New York magazine in 1985; sales jumped from 40,000
copies a year to 75,000 a month, almost overnight. They had been
rebuffed in the early days by every publisher they approached, so
when success arrived, they found themselves still sole proprietors.
</P>
<P>
   Each surveyor is asked to rate each restaurant in which he has
eaten in the last year for food, decor and service on a scale of 1
to 3. (Service is and always has been the chief cause for
complaint.) To derive a food rating for any given restaurant, the
ratings are totaled, divided by the number of respondents and
multiplied by 10.
</P>
<P>
   This year's leader in New York, Le Bernardin, scored 28.04; the
runner-up, Daniel, scored 27.99.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the jury is composed differently each year, scores
remain remarkably steady. Last year, Daniel finished first at
27.77, only 0.22 points lower than this year.
</P>
<P>
   But over the 20 years of its publication, the guide has
reflected enormous changes in the views of New York foodies. Only
one of the 10 restaurants that it rated best for food in 1979, La
Grenouille, made the top 10 list for 1999, although three of New
Yorkers' 10 favorite restaurants this year, a completely separate
category, have been among the city's best-loved haunts for decades:
the Four Seasons, which was founded in 1959; Peter Luger, which
dates from 1887, and Cafe des Artistes, established in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   The escalation in cost, which Zagat also tracks, has been more
modest than many might expect. In 1981, for example, a meal at Le
Cirque cost $42, compared with $72 today, an increase of $30, or
about $1.65 a year; a meal at the Four Seasons has risen from $43
to $65, or about $1.22 a year. &QL;

PRETTY FLY FOR A WHITE GUY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; When Danny Hoch talks about ``my generation,'' as
he often does, he doesn't stammer the ``g'' the way Roger Daltrey
did on the Who's 1965 pop anthem of that name.
</P>
<P>
   Hoch, you see, doesn't put much stock in antiquated baby-boomer
references, nor could his demeanor be described in any way as
``faltering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation,'' Hoch declares emphatically, ``is getting
criminalized for profit.'' His generation can get a jail sentence
easier than it can get a job. His generation doesn't go to
mainstream theater because it doesn't see itself represented there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what my generation is up against, as a hip-hop
generation, as a hip-hop culture of resistance,'' says the
27-year-old Queens native, in Los Angeles recently to promote his
new solo show, ``Jails, Hospitals &AMP; Hip-Hop,'' which opens tonight
at the Actors' Gang in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Hoch (rhymes with rock) can talk this kind of talk all day long,
as sharp-edged and smoothly syncopated as a rap single. But it's
not just another case of gangsta-envy afflicting a Long Island
homeboy.
</P>
<P>
   A performer of multiple, ever-shifting identities, Hoch summons
characters across a wide ethnic, sexual and socioeconomic spectrum,
sampling different syntaxes like a hip-hop DJ and flipping
characterizations with the speed of an Internet Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   In his highly praised 1995 show, ``Some People,'' which ran at
the Mark Taper Forum, Hoch portrayed (among others) an
English-challenged Polish handyman, a Bronx-Jamaican dance-club
performer, a straight-outta-Jersey pseudo-yuppie and a 50-ish
Jewish matron whose rhetoric doesn't always match her liberal good
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jails, Hospitals &AMP; Hip-Hop'' he segues from a Riker's
Island prison inmate to an Old Havana student street vendor
obsessed with American pop culture to a frustrated, disenfranchised
white Montana teen-ager and his black rapper alter-ego, Flip-Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   How did Hoch acquire his gift of tongues? You could start with
his mom, who worked as a speech pathologist at a Bronx hospital,
helping victims of car accidents and gunshot wounds reclaim their
voices. She also used to take her son to see live theater both on
and off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Hoch continued honing his skills while training in North
Carolina and New York City, studying everything from Shakespeare to
Tennessee Williams to Sam Shepard. Somewhere along the way, he was
influenced by performance-monologist Eric Bogosian, whose wife, Jo
Bonney, is directing ``Jails, Hospitals &AMP; Hip-Hop.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoch also spent a good part of the early 1990s teaching conflict
resolution through drama to adolescents in New York City's jails
and alternative high schools with New York University's Creative
Arts Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My director/mentor was an ex-Black Panther, and she saw
theater in a totally politicized way. And she changed my life _ I
wouldn't say just her, but this (kind of) theater changed my
life,'' he says of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the best explanation for his dexterity is that Hoch,
a fourth-generation New Yorker, spent his formative years and all
his other years in an outer-borough Babel where every day he heard
people conversing in everything from Polish- and Italian-accented
English to Trinidadian and Jamaican patois.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sort of the foundation of my upbringing and my life is based
on diversity,'' he says. Even so, Hoch still is sometimes suspected
of being a pop anthropologist, making forays into America's
cultural back streets and hauling away linguistic booty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, a lot of people say, `Oh, where'd you get these
characters?' `How'd you start doing this?' as if I came from a
`traditional,' quote-unquote, theater background, you know, a North
American theater background, then, like, decided to delve into
ghetto storytelling, or delve into marginalized societies. This is
my generation _ these are my communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the obligatory hip-hop uniform of Mets warmup jacket and
sneakers (he also favors baseball caps worn backward or forward),
Hoch is a good-natured sort who grins and laughs easily. His one
concession to his growing celebrity seems to be a cellular phone,
which he puts aside during the 50-minute interview. Occasionally,
while mulling over a point, he rubs his ring from New York City's
High School of Performing Arts, Class of '88.
</P>
<P>
   Quick-thinking and not prone to self-censorship, he'll tell you
pretty much whatever you want to know. Some of these anecdotes, in
fact, have furnished fodder for ``Jails, Hospitals &AMP; Hip-Hop.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did he drop out of Quentin Tarantino's latest film?
</P>
<P>
   The movie, Hoch says, ``is really about nothing _ it's just sort
of glorifying everything negative about society.'' Hoch also
disliked the script's inclusion of a scene that referred to a bar
``filled with dirty greasy Mexican whores.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he disillusioned by his aborted guest-star appearance on
``Seinfeld''? (Hoch dropped out after refusing to portray a pool
attendant at Jerry's health club as a crazy Spanish-speaking guy
named Ramon.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little disillusioning,'' Hoch begins.
</P>
<P>
   Then he checks himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't disillusioning _ I take that back _ it was
liberating. Because I knew what Hollywood thinking was. I knew in
1995, before I had this `Seinfeld' episode in my life, when I was
having Hollywood meetings and I was meeting executives at Paramount
and Universal and Fox, and I was sitting down with them and they
were saying, `What do you want to do? We love you, we think you're
a great talent, what kind of movie do you want to make?' I would
tell them, and they would say, `Look, America's mostly white
people, they don't want to listen to that'.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoch immediately adds that his policy isn't to turn down
everything Hollywood offers. After all, he appears in a cameo in
Terrence Malick's soon-to-be-released World War II feature film
``The Thin Red Line,'' and just completed starring in his own movie
``White Boys,'' directed by Marc Levin. ``Jails, Hospitals &AMP;
Hip-Hop'' is also being made into a film.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was never to get discovered and be a movie star,'' he
explains. ``My goal was to create catharsis in a theater with my
generation and my community, with stories center-stage that come
from my community and my generation.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, how's he going to get his generation into the Actors' Gang
this month?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Hoch's been working on that in conjunction with the
show's presenter, the Mark Taper Forum. Tickets are being priced at
$25, but with $10 student tickets available for all
performances. &UR;  &LR; Hoch also decided to eschew the usual high-cost
newspaper ads in favor of hiring South Central-based ``street
teams'' to pass out handbills promoting the show in areas
frequented by teen-agers and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a control freak,'' Hoch says. ``I just find that, at
the end of the day, if you want something done right politically,
socially and morally, you gotta do it yourself. I can't rely on the
Mark Taper Forum to do it, I can't rely on Quentin Tarantino to do
it, I can't rely on my agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Like hip-hop itself, Hoch knows he easily could turn into
another Madison Avenue commodity. He's turned down offers to make
soft-drink commercials and is confident he'll be able to resist
whatever future temptations come his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have a kid come up to me in the street and say, `Oh
(expletive), I saw you when you came to Riker's Island. You really
made me think. That was really wow what you did, 'cause we didn't
expect to see that. It made me think about my life,' rather than
some kid come up to me and be like, `Oh, you were the guy that blew
up the token booth on `Money Train' _ that was phat`!''

 &HT;    FEMA CHIEF: HOLD HOMEOWNERS IN HIGH-RISK AREAS MORE ACCOUNTABLE
 &HT;    430 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Homeowners who choose to live in areas plagued by
floods and other natural disasters should be held more accountable
if they refuse to take steps toward disaster prevention, the
director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   James Witt said the agency may propose to Congress a law that
would deny federal flood insurance to homeowners who have filed two
or more claims totaling more than the value of their home and who
refuse to elevate their home or accept a buyout.
</P>
<P>
   The national flood insurance program spends more than $200
million each year on properties that have been repetitively
flooded. Currently, no limit is set on the number of such claims a
homeowner can make, a FEMA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to accept the responsibility and consequences of
their choice to live in high-risk areas,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed that residents in high-risk areas be charged
the fair market rate for insurance instead of the lower, subsidized
federal flood insurance rate.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hunter of the Consumer Federation of America was critical of
that proposal. He said the government subsidizes insurance rates
for older homes, and in exchange, cities agree to control new
construction in high-risk areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would be sort of reneging on your half of the
bargain,'' said Hunter, director of insurance for the consumer
advocacy group. ``It's not appropriate for the government to
promise something, then renege on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Witt also proposed that flood plains and wetlands be protected
from development. In the next two years, Witt proposed, cities
should strive to make sure such public buildings as city halls and
fire stations are insured for 80 percent of their replacement
value.
</P>
<P>
   Witt urged businesses, politicians, flood plain managers and
environmental groups to work together to develop strategies to
prepare for and reduce the effects of natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the know-how to reduce risks, but it means we must
change the way we think and plan and budget,'' Witt said. ``It
means instead of responding to disasters, we must do more in
prevention. It means that instead of waiting to react, we prepare
now for the next flood, the next hurricane, fire or earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government expects to spend more than $59 million
this year on disaster assistance to Floridians affected by
hurricanes Earl and Georges, according to the FEMA office of
financial management.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the agency expects to spend more than $74 million in
the wake of tropical storms Charley and Frances.

MITCH STORM VICTIMS NEED MONEY, AID 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARTY RACINE 
and JEANNIE KEVER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Residents are turning out in force to donate tons of
food and medical supplies for the Central American survivors of
Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   But the devastation is so great that the need for relief aid
will continue for months.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush was in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital,
as more than 60,000 pounds of aid from the U.S. relief group
AmeriCares arrived Sunday. He said much more would be needed for
months _ maybe years _ to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell the American people and the people of the world
that the devastation is appalling,'' Bush said after viewing the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   While many local groups are still collecting food and medicine,
national and international relief agencies are accepting only money
to buy what is needed in bulk, rather than trying to process and
ship material aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all practical purposes, the best way people can help is
through monetary donations,'' said Russell Hubbard, a spokesman for
the Greater Houston Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   People may donate through the American Red Cross International
Response Fund by calling 800-HELP-NOW (800-435-7669) or, for
Spanish speakers, 800-257-7575.
</P>
<P>
   Make checks payable to the American Red Cross International
Response Fund, earmarked for Hurricane Mitch relief.
</P>
<P>
   Other agencies requesting money:
</P>
<P>
   AmeriCares is seeking money to cover medicine and food for
people in Honduras and Nicaragua. The private, nonprofit disaster
relief and humanitarian aid organization has already sent $20
million in supplies to the area since since Hurricane Mitch hit.
</P>
<P>
   Checks marked Hurricane Mitch Relief can be sent to AmeriCares
Foundation, 161 Cherry St., New Canaan, Conn. 06840. Credit card
donations made be made by calling 800-486-HELP.
</P>
<P>
   Checks may be sent to the Salvation Army, 1500 Austin St.,
Houston 77002.
</P>
<P>
   CARE is receiving checks at 151 Ellis St. NE, Atlanta, Ga.
30303-2426, or by phone, 800-521-2273.
</P>
<P>
   Quest for Peace, a national nonprofit organization that has been
sending humanitarian aid to Nicaragua for 15 years, is accepting
checks marked Hurricane Relief at Quest for Peace, P.O. Box 5206,
Hyattsville, Md. 20782. Credit card donations can be made by
calling 301-699-0042.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations still are collecting supplies. Many also
need volunteers to help with the work:
</P>
<P>
   The Honduran Consulate of Houston is accepting both money and
supplies, especially medications, canned goods, bottled water,
powdered milk and disposable diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Checks or money orders, payable to the Honduran Relief Fund, can
be sent to the Consulate General of Honduras, 4151 Southwest
Freeway, Suite 700, Houston 77027.
</P>
<P>
   Donations will be accepted through November and probably through
December, said spokeswoman Ludan Majia.
</P>
<P>
   The Guatemalan consulate has a collection site at 11528
Bellaire, Houston. Volunteers are needed for packing and carrying
boxes of supplies to the airport and Port of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Money donations can be deposited at Sterling Bank under account
number 021-030205, or checks marked ``Ayuda Guatamala Por Huracan''
may be mailed to the Guatemalan consulate, 3600 S. Gessner, Suite
200, Houston 77063. Consulate number: 713-953-9531.
</P>
<P>
   Before accepting any more clothing, the Nicaraguan consulate
needs additional warehouse space _ preferably at least 2,000 square
feet and accessible to volunteers on nights and weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're swamped,'' volunteer Barbara Thompson said. ``We thank
everybody for what they're doing, but right now we've got a
backlog.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical supplies are desperately needed. Most needed are medical
rubber gloves, salves, ointment, adhesive bandages, Ace bandages,
anti-diarrhea medicine, antibiotics, hydrogen peroxide, burn
medicine, packaged needles, dried milk, canned formula, can openers
and baby bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Checks can be made out to the Nicaraguan Relief Fund/American
Red Cross and sent to the consulate at 6300 Hillcroft, Suite 250,
Houston, Texas 77081.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers are needed to process the donations that have poured
in to the Christian Alliance for Humanitarian Aid, which is
preparing to send help aboard the Spirit of Grace, a ship that
routinely sails mercy missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We desperately need labor,'' volunteer Bill Warren said. ``Big
shipments (of donations) are hitting us. We have about seven
semi-trailer trucks, and about that many people to unload them.
It's just impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers can work four-hour shifts between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.
at least through Saturday. For more information, call the alliance
at 281-412-2285.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Alliance is an ecumenical coalition of churches
and volunteers. It is working out of a warehouse at 4401 Rice Dryer
Road in Pearland, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance also is accepting donations of nonperishable food,
baby clothes, cotton diapers with pins, personal hygiene items,
drinking water, dish towels, blankets, nonprescription medicines,
sleeping bags, tents, household items and hand tools. Donations may
be dropped off at most Houston Fire Stations and the Nicaraguan
consulate at 6300 Hillcroft, Houston.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane force winds were recorded Tuesday on Mackinac Island
near the juncture of Lake Huron and Michigan as an extraordinary
strong storm bore through the Great Lakes and Upper Middle West.
The potent autumn storm also brought blizzard conditions to the
northern Plains and isolated tornadoes to the Mississippi Valley.
Wednesday, very gusty winds from the west will import much cooler
and drier air into the region as the formidable low pressure center
moves into central Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered morning showers will accompany the passage of a cold
front moving through New England and the coastal Northeast on
Wednesday morning. Behind the front, gusty winds from the southwest
drying on descent from the Appalachians will cause skies to clear
from Washington to Boston. Meanwhile, sinking air currents
associated with high pressure will promote abundant sunshine and
seasonable temperatures across the interior Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Humid air impinging a slow-moving front will cause spotty
showers and thunderstorms in northern Florida and along the Gulf
coast. Partly to mostly sunny skies and ample sun will occur south
of the front over south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and a few flurries will form near a weak low pressure
system over North Dakota on Tuesday while dry and sunny conditions
occur farther south in the central and southern Plains. Farther
west, valley showers and mountain snow will surround a jet stream
disturbance moving through the southern Rockies. Behind the
disturbance, intervals of clouds and sun with little risk for rain
will prevail along the West coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Power of Wind &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, sustained winds of 85 mph buffeted the Mackinac
Bridge, which connects Michigan's lower and upper peninsulas across
the Straits of Mackinac. Peak gusts were clocked at 94 mph. In the
morning, building gales associated with a powerful low pressure
system forced the Mackinac Bridge Authority to escort high-profile
vehicles across the bridge because the force of the wind on vans
and sports utility vehicles was dangerously great. For each square
foot of area of a high-profile vehicle that was exposed to a wind
of 85 mph, nearly 300 pounds of force were exerted. &QL;

   VETERAN _ The macabre vision is 80 years old but remains
shockingly alive in James Lindsey's brain. On the edge of a bomb
crater, a legless German soldier sits upright in death, staring
ahead like he awaits for Lindsey's unit. The dead man's pack is
still strapped to his back, propping him up. In his pack, the
soldier carries a rotten loaf of bread and three photos: one with
three proud mustashioed men in uniform. Another has one of those
men posing with a woman and a small boy. The third has the woman
alone with the boy. ``I think it was his wife and baby,'' said

   MEMORIAL _ The year was 1967. The place was the highlands of
South Vietnam. Sweating and nervous, Richard Cruz and 15 other U.S.
soldiers sat near an open field, waiting under the clear, bright 2
a.m. sky, straining for the slightest sound or sight of the enemy.
When the machine gunners who were supposed to keep watch fell
asleep, four or five Viet Cong crept up slowly on the men and began
hurling grenades into the blackness. Seconds later, shrapnel
pierced Cruz' legs, back, knees and eyes. Cruz was one of the lucky
ones _ he lost no limbs and eventually regained sight in his right
eye. But many Hays County residents lost their lives in Vietnam and
other 20th- century wars. Now, more than 30 years later, Cruz does
not want their lives forgotten. A Veteran's War Memorial in San
Marcos will list their names. His plan is to sell personalized
bricks to people and raise the money for the monument. (Rodriguez,
Austin American-Statesman).

   DDN-VETERAN _ On Veterans Day, John Whitt of Springboro is
asking for help. The Air Force veteran was exposed to radiation
during above-ground nuclear testing in Nevada in the early 1950s.
As a serviceman he watched the explosions and, when on leave with
buddies, explored the mountains near Nellis Air Force Base that he
says were contaminated by radioactive fallout. Now he wants the
Veterans Administration to certify him for disability benefits but
the VA has refused three times. He says that vets like him, called
downwinders, were closer to the test explosions than American POWs
were in Japan when the U.S. dropped two atomic bombs in 1945 yet
the ex-POWs are granted disability benefits. The VA stands by its
rule that only the American prisoners of war and not other soldiers
exposed to radiation who came after them are eligible for veterans
disability benefits. (Smith, Dayton Daily News). 20. WITH PHOTO.

   TALL-TX-CAPITOL_ Reports that Texas' Capitol is taller than the

Texas plans to back up its bragging rights. The State Preservation
Board is planning to measure the dome to put the matter to rest
once and for all. (Ward, Austin American-Statesman).

   DELRAY-DRUGS _ DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ Central House, located on
the Delray Beach-Boynton Beach border, is an Alcoholics Anonymous
clubhouse. It is home to dozens of AA meetings each week _ for
women, men, beginners, alcoholics only _ and recently has become
the site of a monthly ``rave'' modeled after the ones at big-city
all-night dance clubs. Central House is also a focal point of an
unusual and vital community in southern Palm Beach County _ a
community of recovering alcoholics and drug abusers that by
experts' accounts is surprisingly large for the area's size and
suburban character. (Mnookin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   FLA-LYNN-UNIV _ BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Donald E. Ross, president of
Lynn University, is one of the highest paid college presidents in
the nation _ and deservedly so, in the opinion of Lynn's board of
trustees. But the trustees are concerned the Internal Revenue
Service may not agree. Ross' $320,965 salary in 1996-97 _ the last
year reported _ was higher than that of the presidents of Harvard,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other larger, more
prestigious private universities. (Horine, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

FOOD NOTES: THE NEW ABC FOOD HALL; DINING WITH THE ASTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has taken six years to evolve, but ABC Food, the
new food hall at ABC Carpet and Home, 888 Broadway (19th Street),
is finally up and running. The complex, comprising nearly 14,000
square feet on three levels of the Old World knicknack-laden store,
includes a new food retail area on the lower level adjacent to the
existing Parlour Cafe, which is now a bit smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Candies and packaged sweets are on the main floor of the store,
and there is a well-stocked department for kitchenware and table
accessories a short flight above, with everything from wire whisks
to sterling silver berry spoons.
</P>
<P>
   The food hall has attracted some big-name purveyors. Murray's
Sturgeon Shop on the Upper West Side has opened a branch there,
selling excellent smoked fish and delicious pickled salmon, with
caviar supplied by Caviar Russe. There is a counter with breads
from many fine sources, including Eli's, Amy's and Sullivan Street.
</P>
<P>
   Ceriello of Williston Park, N.Y., is handling aged prime beef,
cured meats like prosciutto and mortadella, and Italian sausage,
including a delicious fresh variety made with mozzarella and
broccoli rape. Negotiations are under way for the first retail
outlet of D'Artagnan, the wild game company in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The prepared-food department is being run by Mitchel London.
There is also a well-stocked cheese department that emphasizes
imports, especially French. These departments are surrounded by
shelves that are stocked with olive oils, vinegars, condiments,
pasta and other packaged ingredients. A fresh flower stand will be
added in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   A restaurant, the decor of which was shipped in parts from
Brazil and is now being reassembled, is to open in about two months
on the lower level. It will have its own entrance on East 18th
Street, in addition to access directly from the store. Evan Cole,
ABC's president, is planning to have Jeff Salaway, an owner of the
Nick &AMP; Toni's restaurants in East Hampton, N.Y., and near Lincoln
Center, to run the restaurant and the Parlour Cafe. Salaway said
the restaurant, as yet unnamed, will feature rustic Italian and
Mediterranean food. John DeLucie is to be the chef, and Jonathan
Waxman the consultant.

   New York Food History
</P>
<P>
   In the year that celebrates the 100th anniversary of the
incorporation of New York City's boroughs, it is fitting that ``On
the Town in New York: The Landmark History of Eating, Drinking and
Entertainments From the American Revolution to the Food
Revolution,'' by Michael and Ariane Batterberry (Routledge, $30),
has been reissued. The authors added a 15-page afterword to bring
it up to date.
</P>
<P>
   The original was published in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is food documented in the book, but also restaurants,
dining practices and the movers and shakers of the city's social
scene. Its lively prose deserves a more attractive typeface and
design, and the authors do a better job covering the city's dining
and entertainment scene of 100 years ago than they do with all that
has happened in the last 25 years, an important era. But for those
who want to know how the Astors entertained or what it was like to
dine at the original Delmonico's, the book is a must.

COURT EXAMINES TREATY PROTECTING AIRLINES FROM LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Israeli airline's search of a woman and her
luggage was so intrusive and traumatic that she should be able to
sue the carrier, El Al, for $5 million for the mental anguish she
suffered, her lawyer told the Supreme Court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No, her illness simply resulted from an accident stemming from a
routine check, an event that barring her from seeking big damages,
airline lawyers replied during oral arguments before the justices.
</P>
<P>
   How the court decides the case could have major implications for
a 69-year-old treaty known as the Warsaw Convention, which protects
the aviation industry from massive lawsuits after airline
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1929 Convention, passengers suffering bodily injuries
from ``accidents'' occurring during ``international air
operations'' are limited in the damages they can seek from an
airline. That cap is now about $145,000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the aviation industry has always maintained that if
a passenger's claim falls under the Convention's criteria, that
person's case must be decided according to Convention rules.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's arguments, Justice Antonin Scalia criticized
what he called the Convention's ``vague'' language _ contained in
Article 17 of the treaty _ on when an airline is liable for
damages. He asked sarcastically, ``How many smart people from how
many countries came up with this article?''
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from a May 22, 1993, incident in which Tsui Yuan
Tseng, a clinical technician in New York City, went to the John F.
Kennedy International Airport there and checked in for an El Al
flight to Tel Aviv, Israel. After asking Tseng routine questions
about the reason for her flight, El Al's security guards decided
that she was a high-risk passenger. They took her to a private room
to search for explosives.
</P>
<P>
   During the search, the guards went through Tseng's luggage in
another room. After that, they told her to remove her jacket,
sweater, shoes and belt and to loosen her blue jeans to mid-hip
level. A female guard searched Tseng's body outside her clothing
for 15 minutes and finally searched her with an electric security
wand.
</P>
<P>
   Determining that Tseng was not a security risk for the flight,
the guards escorted her to the waiting plane.
</P>
<P>
   Though she suffered no physical injury because of the search,
Tseng said she became ``really sick and very upset'' during the
flight and was ``emotionally traumatized and disturbed'' throughout
her trip to Israel and later back in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tseng sued El Al, saying she needed the $5 million in damages to
compensate for her mental stress.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. District Court trial of the case in 1994, lawyers
for El Al said that if Tseng suffered any mental anguish, it was an
accident resulting from a routine security check and therefore
covered under the Warsaw Convention. This meant that she could sue
only for a maximum of $145,000.
</P>
<P>
   The airline lawyers also contended that the airline was not to
blame for the psychological trauma and not liable for any damages.
</P>
<P>
   The federal court agreed with both El Al arguments and dismissed
the case.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
overturned the district court's decision, ruling that the security
search could not be defined as an ``accident'' and that the
Convention did not apply to Tseng's case.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the appeals court said, Tseng could sue El Al in a
federal court without regard to the Convention's $145,000 cap.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court did not rule on whether Tseng's mental anguish
resulted from El Al's security search.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Diane Wilson, representing El Al, told the Supreme
Court that the drafters of the Convention intended for the treaty
to cover all instances of bodily harm, including psychological
distress, occurring during international airline operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court must follow the drafters' original intention and
overturn the appeals court's ruling,'' she insisted.
</P>
<P>
   However, Robert Silk, representing Tseng, argued that a security
search was ``certainly not an accident'' and, therefore, Tseng's
resulting mental anguish did not fall under the Convention.
</P>
<P>
   He contended that she should be allowed to pursue her case under
U.S. law allowing higher compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Silk told the justices that it would be ``absurd'' if the
Convention were to ``grant to airlines a freedom to imprison,
assault and batter their passengers, immunizing them (the airlines)
from local law requirements that they compensate their victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is expected to be decided this spring.

PRINCE PHILIP'S VISIT TO IRELAND SEEN AS PRECURSOR TO THE QUEEN'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ In a gesture intended to advance the Northern
Ireland peace effort, Prince Philip visited both parts of Ireland
on Tuesday and said he hoped for an end to the ``rather artificial
divisions'' separating the people of the Irish Republic and the
British province of Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   The prince's visit is widely seen in the Irish Republic as a
precursor to a visit within the next year by his wife, Queen
Elizabeth II. Her visit would be the first to Ireland by a reigning
British monarch since the country became independent in 1922. The
queen's grandfather, King George V, visited Dublin in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   A royal visit to the Irish Republic was unthinkable until the
new peace effort began five years ago. In 1979, the queen's cousin
Lord Mountbatten was killed in an Irish Republican Army attack on
his yacht off County Sligo, on the west coast.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, as the prince was shaking hands and chatting with
Irish President Mary McAleese and Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, two
prisoners convicted of conspiring to attack British security forces
were released early from a prison in the North as part of the peace
agreement approved in the North and the Republic in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   President McAleese is to join Queen Elizabeth on Wednesday in a
ceremony in Belgium honoring soldiers who died in World War I, in
which more than 200,000 Irishmen fought in the British army. At
that meeting, the queen and the president are expected to discuss a
royal visit to Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   The prince's visit included poignant ironies: his meeting with
President McAleese was at the presidential mansion in Phoenix Park,
the former residence of the island's British colonial rulers. He
also attended a ceremony at Dublin Castle, the seat of British
colonial power. And when he visited the prime minister at
government buildings in central Dublin, Union Jacks flew in the
brisk wind.
</P>
<P>
   The prince gave no interviews and did not mix with people to
shake hands. Irish national radio reported that he said he hoped
for the end of the ``rather artificial divisions'' separating north
and south.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast, Roman Catholic and Protestant leaders continued to
disagree over the issue that has slowed the peace effort, the
disarmament of the IRA. The Catholic guerrilla organization has
observed a cease-fire for 16 months, but wants to hold on to its
weapons and explosives.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The mother walked nervously toward Gate 42
at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, her eyes scanning the crowd for the
son she had not seen in 17 years. She had not held him in her arms

over the years. Hoping that a reunion would erase the emptiness she
felt, she'd hired a private investigator in Canada to contact the
boy and arrange a meeting. There he is, she thought, spotting a

 &HT;    NEW RULES FOR BRAZILIAN SOCCER
 &HT;    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Brazil's most popular pastime and
passion, soccer, now has a new governing law designed to clean up
the sport and give it a more professional image. The South American
country has dozens of professional teams in several leagues, some
of which have been caught up in scandals over the millions of
dollars the sport moves every month. With allegations that some
team executives were buying referees, gambling, laundering money,
and skimming profits, many Brazilians felt a change was in order.
The biggest proponent of the new law was Edson Arantes do
Nascimento, the former minister of sports who is more commonly
known as the great soccer legend Pele, for whom the new law was
named.
 &HT;    As originally envisioned, the new law would have enforced a
series of strict new rules governing the conduct of referees and
team executives and would have removed some disputes from the
Brazilian Football Confederation, soccer's governing body in
Brazil. The proposal, like soccer itself, raised so many
deep-seated feelings that a congressional debate on the subject
evolved into a shoving match in Congress. ``It demonstrates how
much passion soccer causes in our country,'' says Mario Drummond
Coelho, a spokesman for the sports ministry. ``From the poor to the
rich man, everybody has an opinion about soccer.''
 &HT;    Eventually, a version of the law was passed before Brazil's
national team went to defend its World Cup championship in France
earlier this summer.
 &HT;    The new law gives players in all sports protections they never
before enjoyed. While official statistics are hard to get, Drummond
says there are between 12,000 and 15,000 professional athletes in
all sports who are affected by the new law. Only a handful of those
athletes enjoy the multimillion dollar contracts that the flashiest
soccer stars have. One of the most important clauses of the new law
gives players limited rights to transfer to other clubs, something
they didn't have under old law. ``What we had in the past was like
slavery,'' he says. But the free-agency clause doesn't take effect
until February 2001, and many critics say teams are already trying
to sign long-term agreements with players before they have the
right to transfer to other teams. A second major change in the new
law gives players minimum insurance protection when they step out
onto the field to play, something only the best and highest-paid
athletes enjoyed in the past. The new law also gives players
protection from clubs that can't _ or won't _ pay them. ``Players
sometimes went for months without pay,'' Drummond says.
 &HT;    Probably the most controversial clause of the new law requires
sports clubs, as the soccer teams are known, to register as private
businesses. This clause forces clubs to adopt professional
accounting procedures to keep track of the income from ticket
sales, broadcast rights, clothing sales, and promotional fees _ and
pay taxes on them. Previously, the clubs were registered as
private, non-profit organizations, despite the huge sums of money
they took in. ``That was the biggest lie in Brazilian sports,''
Drummond says.
 &HT;    It remains to be seen how many of Brazil's soccer clubs will
respect the new law.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    RECIPE FOR FRIED CHICKEN SUCCESS
 &HT;    GUATEMALA CITY _ The smell of extra-crispy fried chicken fills
the air in the departure lounges at Guatemala's international
airport. Almost every traveler seems to be carrying a bright yellow
fast-food box decorated with a smiling chicken.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing like this in the U.S.,'' says one Guatemalan
passenger, who wrinkles his nose at the suggestion that Kentucky
Fried could be a reasonable substitute and who says his family in
the United States demands he take them Campero fried chicken when
he travels.
 &HT;    With an aggressive expansion campaign that picked up pace in the
1990s, Campero has installed 108 of its bright, clean and friendly
restaurants in the region. The Gutierrez family, which founded the
company in 1971 as an extension of the family poultry farm, owns 58
in Guatemala, 31 in El Salvador and six in Honduras. In December
the first Campero franchise opened in Panama and now there are 3
franchises in that country, five in Costa Rica, two in Nicaragua
and three in Ecuador.
 &HT;    Intense quality control and a training institute for employees,
who can achieve high school diplomas while employed by Campero, are
the top reasons for the company's success, according to executives.
 &HT;    ``We have put a lot of time, effort and money into the quality
control program, to develop a system that tells us what is
happening week to week in every restaurant,'' says Roberto Denegri,
manager of Campero's international division.
 &HT;    After an unsuccessful attempt to expand to Miami in the late
1980s, Campero plotted its new franchise expansion with great care.
Since 1992 Campero has changed its logo, redesigned its
restaurants, expanded its menu to include breakfasts and spicy
chicken sandwiches and added playgrounds and kiddie theme parties.
 &HT;    Fried chicken might not have much competition in Guatemala, but
in other countries Guatemala is up against the big guys. Profits
have been ``stupendous'' in all seven countries in recent years,
says Denegri, who declined to release specific figures.
 &HT;    ``You can measure our success by how full the restaurants are.
We're the only world class Latino chain, with table service,'' says
Denegri. ``One of the beauties of Campero is that it attracts all
type of people, from executives in ties to laborers.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ANOTHER DAILY NEWSPAPER FOR MEXICO
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ Hoy made quite a splash when it hit Mexico City
newsstands earlier this year.
 &HT;    The 48-page, full-color tabloid has set out to appeal to
middle-class Mexicans who are turned off by Mexico's best-selling
newspaper, the sensational La Prensa, but find Reforma, published
by the same family that produces El Norte in Monterrey, too
elitist. To do that, the new publication has hired 20 staffers away
from Reforma with double the salaries.
 &HT;    It has also plowed around $34 million into state-of-the-art
equipment and facilities, including an entire city block on Mexico
City's south side for its headquarters.
 &HT;    At first glance, the newspaper is refreshing. One of its first
issues included a story about how a man was dealing with his
friends' machismo when he lost his job and had to take care of the
house and kids while his wife went to work. A more recent issue
profiled the lives of some of the city's firefighters, exploring
the risks they face. The paper also has hands-on sections on how
economic news affects everyday citizens and reports on crime and
how citizens can safeguard themselves.
 &HT;    But after just a few months, the newspaper has failed to find
its readership. ``It's a newspaper without a personality,'' says
Raymundo Riva Palacio, an editor at Mexico City financial newspaper
El Financiero and an expert on the Mexican media.
 &HT;    Director General Miguel Canton Zetina and his editorial
director, Cruz Ulin Hernandez, didn't return calls from LATIN TRADE
seeking comment. But other officials have said that their goal is
to boost the newspaper's circulation from 50,000 at launch to
100,000 in the short term to 250,000 in the long term, putting it
in the same league as La Prensa. In a city teeming with 30-plus
newspapers, it'll be an uphill climb.

MITCH STORM VICTIMS NEED MONEY, AID 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARTY RACINE 
and JEANNIE KEVER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Residents are turning out in force to donate tons of
food and medical supplies for the Central American survivors of
Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   But the devastation is so great that the need for relief aid
will continue for months.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush was in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital,
as more than 60,000 pounds of aid from the U.S. relief group
AmeriCares arrived Sunday. He said much more would be needed for
months _ maybe years _ to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell the American people and the people of the world
that the devastation is appalling,'' Bush said after viewing the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   While many local groups are still collecting food and medicine,
national and international relief agencies are accepting only money
to buy what is needed in bulk, rather than trying to process and
ship material aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all practical purposes, the best way people can help is
through monetary donations,'' said Russell Hubbard, a spokesman for
the Greater Houston Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   People may donate through the American Red Cross International
Response Fund by calling 800-HELP-NOW (800-435-7669) or, for
Spanish speakers, 800-257-7575.
</P>
<P>
   Make checks payable to the American Red Cross International
Response Fund, earmarked for Hurricane Mitch relief.
</P>
<P>
   Other agencies requesting money:
</P>
<P>
   AmeriCares is seeking money to cover medicine and food for
people in Honduras and Nicaragua. The private, nonprofit disaster
relief and humanitarian aid organization has already sent $20
million in supplies to the area since since Hurricane Mitch hit.
</P>
<P>
   Checks marked Hurricane Mitch Relief can be sent to AmeriCares
Foundation, 161 Cherry St., New Canaan, Conn. 06840. Credit card
donations made be made by calling 800-486-HELP.
</P>
<P>
   Checks may be sent to the Salvation Army, 1500 Austin St.,
Houston 77002.
</P>
<P>
   CARE is receiving checks at 151 Ellis St. NE, Atlanta, Ga.
30303-2426, or by phone, 800-521-2273.
</P>
<P>
   Quest for Peace, a national nonprofit organization that has been
sending humanitarian aid to Nicaragua for 15 years, is accepting
checks marked Hurricane Relief at Quest for Peace, P.O. Box 5206,
Hyattsville, Md. 20782. Credit card donations can be made by
calling 301-699-0042.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations still are collecting supplies. Many also
need volunteers to help with the work:
</P>
<P>
   The Honduran Consulate of Houston is accepting both money and
supplies, especially medications, canned goods, bottled water,
powdered milk and disposable diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Checks or money orders, payable to the Honduran Relief Fund, can
be sent to the Consulate General of Honduras, 4151 Southwest
Freeway, Suite 700, Houston 77027.
</P>
<P>
   Donations will be accepted through November and probably through
December, said spokeswoman Ludan Majia.
</P>
<P>
   The Guatemalan consulate has a collection site at 11528
Bellaire, Houston. Volunteers are needed for packing and carrying
boxes of supplies to the airport and Port of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Money donations can be deposited at Sterling Bank under account
number 021-030205, or checks marked ``Ayuda Guatamala Por Huracan''
may be mailed to the Guatemalan consulate, 3600 S. Gessner, Suite
200, Houston 77063. Consulate number: 713-953-9531.
</P>
<P>
   Before accepting any more clothing, the Nicaraguan consulate
needs additional warehouse space _ preferably at least 2,000 square
feet and accessible to volunteers on nights and weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're swamped,'' volunteer Barbara Thompson said. ``We thank
everybody for what they're doing, but right now we've got a
backlog.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical supplies are desperately needed. Most needed are medical
rubber gloves, salves, ointment, adhesive bandages, Ace bandages,
anti-diarrhea medicine, antibiotics, hydrogen peroxide, burn
medicine, packaged needles, dried milk, canned formula, can openers
and baby bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Checks can be made out to the Nicaraguan Relief Fund/American
Red Cross and sent to the consulate at 6300 Hillcroft, Suite 250,
Houston, Texas 77081.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers are needed to process the donations that have poured
in to the Christian Alliance for Humanitarian Aid, which is
preparing to send help aboard the Spirit of Grace, a ship that
routinely sails mercy missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We desperately need labor,'' volunteer Bill Warren said. ``Big
shipments (of donations) are hitting us. We have about seven
semi-trailer trucks, and about that many people to unload them.
It's just impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers can work four-hour shifts between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.
at least through Saturday. For more information, call the alliance
at 281-412-2285.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Alliance is an ecumenical coalition of churches
and volunteers. It is working out of a warehouse at 4401 Rice Dryer
Road in Pearland, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance also is accepting donations of nonperishable food,
baby clothes, cotton diapers with pins, personal hygiene items,
drinking water, dish towels, blankets, nonprescription medicines,
sleeping bags, tents, household items and hand tools. Donations may
be dropped off at most Houston Fire Stations and the Nicaraguan
consulate at 6300 Hillcroft, Houston.

 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a moment after the salmon with Brittany sea
salt at the pillowy corner banquette at the Carlyle, after the
triumphant stroll up Madison Avenue, where East Side matrons
swooned like teen-agers spying Leonardo DeCaprio, after the brief
tour of the 12-room symphony of mahogany and double-beveled glass
where he lives, when, out of the blue, Tom Wolfe sounded like a man
ready to let his red dog slip its leash.
</P>
<P>
   The untethered red dog in Wolfe's new novel, ``A Man in Full''
(Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux), is a metaphor for breaking out of type,
taking a mad dash on the wild side, as the novel's cautious banker
Raymond Peepgass does in cooking up a felonious get-rich scheme.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed so un-Wolfean as to be almost Wolfean when he began
preaching the virtues of teaching his son to hunt, sounding like
some old boy in muddy fatigues contemplating the apocalypse in
Valdosta or Spartanburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day will come, inevitably, maybe it's the Y2K, when only
the grandmothers will have the skills to deal with life on another
basis: no computers, hunting for food,'' said Wolfe, the towers of
Manhattan glistening in the late afternoon light outside his
14th-floor window. ``It's not going to happen anytime soon, but it
could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if two weeks from now the food supplies were all cut off?
People are throwing their hands in the air, saying: `This can't
happen! Where's my congressman?' And it turns out he's out in the
woods somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The vision emerges like a scene from a bad Tom Wolfe parody: the
author in his trademark cream-colored double-breasted serge suit
and matching vest, his two-tone shoes and white cotton handkerchief
with brown selvage design, his silver hair shockingly tousled and
his blue eyes bloodshot, lurching up Fifth Avenue past the Pierre
with a shotgun in search of who knows what for dinner. Wild turkey!
Brown bear! Sinewy cougar! South Texas javelina! And then, of
course, the vision fades away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about degenerate,'' he had sniffed, in a
bit-too-transparent piece of stagecraft as he passed a Madison
Avenue boutique with its plastic mannequin positioned in droll
repose above five gleaming toilet seats, each roughly the color of
Wolfe's famous garb. Aside from his one red-dog digression, he
played relentlessly to type, modest, soft-voiced and unfailingly
polite (``Shall we take the air?'' he inquired as he finished his
coffee), like the refined Richmond boy he still is at heart.
</P>
<P>
   But if his red dog tends to run loose in his writing and not,
not publicly anyway, in his life, ``A Man in Full'' presents an
intriguing window for looking beneath Wolfe's familiar urban-dandy
exterior.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, his second novel, Wolfe goes south to the
plantations, bank towers and strip malls of Georgia and
particularly the wealthy Atlanta of the leafy, sumptuous Buckhead
neighborhood, where ``the lawns rose up from the street like big
green breasts.'' It is also, in many ways, a trip home for Wolfe,
who grew up the grandson of a Confederate soldier in Richmond, went
to school at the Southern gentleman's redoubt at Washington and Lee
University, and whose dress, manners, work and worldview bear the
unmistakable mark of the South's most aristocratic state.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if his ambitions inevitably drew him to New York and
then kept him there, he remains so indelibly Southern that his new
book, right down to its unlikely homage to the Stoic philosopher
Epictetus, reveals as much about him as about the South.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kennerly Wolfe Jr. was born in 1930 into an old Virginia
family at a time when the Civil War was still as much a part of
Richmond as the Confederate statues on Monument Avenue. His father,
whose Virginia roots go back to 1710, was an odd Southern hybrid of
agronomist, teacher and businessman who taught at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute, edited a publication called The Southern
Planter and ran a company, Southern States Cooperative, that became
a Fortune 500 company. His mother, Helen Perkins Hughes Wolfe, came
from an old Virginia family as well.
</P>
<P>
   And Wolfe grew up with a sense of entitlement so profound that
each night when he got down on his knees to pray, he began by
thanking God for the miraculous gift of his place of birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think of it every night,'' he said, as he sipped his
tomato (``ta-MAH-to'') juice with a dash of salt and pepper.
``First, I thanked God for having been born in America, which was
obviously the greatest country on earth. I was pretty dead right on
that. And in what was obviously the greatest state, because more
presidents came from Virginia than anywhere else. And from the
greatest city in the greatest state in the greatest country,
because it was the capital of Virginia. Just think of all the
people not fortunate enough to be born in Richmond, Va.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused a moment to contemplate that injustice for a moment
and realized he had not fully conveyed his enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he added, ``and I also thought I lived in the best
location in the greatest city because from my window, when the
state fair was in town, I could see all the fireworks. How many
children could say that? I can see now that I had _ what's the
word? _ literally an egocentric view of the world. But it wasn't
all that far from the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe strayed from the steamy Eden of his youth, but his friends
say that to understand his work _ the (dare one say?) cavalier
detachment from the passing parade; the acerbic skewering of most
elements of modernism from art to architecture; the conservatism
about politics, art and race; the withering disdain for what he
calls the think-alike ``intellectual etiquette'' of liberal
Manhattan _ one need only think of Wolfe not as dandy or New
Journalist or satirist, but as Virginian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what he's all about,'' said Ed Hayes, a Manhattan lawyer
who says he is the model for Killian, the defense lawyer in Wolfe's
first novel, ``The Bonfire of the Vanities.'' ``Tom doesn't talk
about this stuff publicly, but he has this Scotch-Irish sense of
honor, of duty, of family, about masculinity.

 &HT;    LA LEY DE PELE
 &HT;    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brasil _ El deporte Y la pasion mas popular de
Brasil, el futbol, tiene ahora una nueva ley rectora concebida para
hacer mas diafano el deporte y darle una imagen mas profesional.
Brasil tiene decenas de equipos profesionales en varias ligas, y
algunas se han involucrado en escandalos.
 &HT;    Muchos brasilenos pensaban que hacia falta un cambio ante las
acusaciones de que varios ejecutivos de equipos compraban arbitros,
participaban en apuestas ilegales, lavaban dinero y se embolsaban
ganancias. El mayor partidario de la nueva ley fue Pele. La nueva
ley lleva su nombre.
 &HT;    Como se concibio en un principio, la ley impondria normas
estrictas a la conducta de arbitros y directivos, y habria librado
de varias disputas a la Confederacion Brasilena del Futbol. La
propuesta, como el propio futbol, agito tantos sentimientos
arraigados que un debate parlamentario en el Congreso dio lugar a
una pelea. ``Eso demuestra la pasion que el futbol despierta en
nuestro pais,'' comenta Mario Drummond Coelho, portavoz del
Ministerio de Deportes. ``Todo el mundo tiene una opinion sobre el
futbol, desde el mas rico hasta el mas pobre.''
 &HT;    Al final, se aprobo una version de la ley antes de que el equipo
nacional de Brasil fuera al Mundial de Francia este verano, a
defender su titulo.
 &HT;    La nueva ley da a todos los deportistas protecciones que nunca
antes habian tenido. Aunque es dificil conseguir estadisticas
oficiales, Drummond dice que hay entre 12.000 y 15.000 atletas
profesionales en todos los deportes contemplados en la nueva ley.
Solo un punado de esos deportistas disfrutan de contratos
multimillonarios como los de las estrellas del futbol. Una de las
clausulas mas importantes de la nueva ley da a los atletas derechos
limitados para trasladarse a otros equipos, cosa que no tenian bajo
la antigua ley. ``Lo que teniamos antes era una esclavitud,'' dice
Drummond. Pero la clausula que permite los traslados no entra en
vigor hasta febrero del 2001, y muchos criticos dicen que los
equipos ya intentan firmar convenios a largo plazo con los
jugadores antes de que tengan el derecho de trasladarse a otros
equipos. Otro gran cambio en la nueva ley otorga a los deportistas
un seguro minimo cuando salen al terreno, proteccion que antes
disfrutaban solo los atletas mejor pagados. La nueva ley tambien
protege a los deportistas contra los clubes que no pueden o no
quieren pagarles. ``A veces los jugadores tenian que esperar meses
para que les pagaran,'' senala Drummond.
 &HT;    Probablemente la clausula mas controversial es la que requiere
que los clubes deportivos, como se llama a los equipos de futbol,
se inscriban como negocios particulares. Esta clausula obliga a los
clubes a adoptar sistemas profesionales de contabilidad para
registrar los ingresos por concepto de venta de entradas, derechos
de difusion, venta de prendas de vestir y cuotas promocionales, y
pagar impuestos sobre esos ingresos. Anteriormente, los clubes se
inscribian como organizaciones particulares sin fines de lucro, a
pesar de las enormes sumas de dinero que percibian. ``Esa era la
mayor mentira del deporte brasileno,'' dice Drummond.
 &HT;    Queda por ver cuantos clubes de futbol acataran la nueva ley.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    RECETA CENTROAMERICANA
 &HT;    CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA _ El olor del pollo frito invade las salas
de espera del aeropuerto internacional de Guatemala. Casi todos los
viajeros llevan una caja color amarillo brillante, adornada con un
pollo sonriente.
 &HT;    ``En Estados Unidos no hay nada como esto,'' dice un pasajero
guatemalteco, que frunce el ceno ante la sugerencia de que Kentucky
Fried Chicken podria ser un sustituto razonable y que cuenta que su
familia en Norteamerica le exige que les lleve pollo frito Campero
cada vez que viaja a Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Con una ambiciosa campana de expansion que cobro impulso en los
anos 90, Campero ha abierto 108 brillantes, limpios y acogedores
restaurantes en la region. La familia Gutierrez, que fundo la
compania en 1971 como una extension de su granja avicola, tiene 58
en Guatemala, 31 en El Salvador y seis en Honduras. En diciembre se
abrio la primera franquicia de Campero en Panama, y ahora hay tres
en ese pais, cinco en Costa Rica, dos en Nicaragua y tres en
Ecuador.
 &HT;    Un estricto control de calidad y un instituto de capacitacion
para los empleados, que pueden obtener el diploma de educacion
secundaria mientras trabajan para Campero, son las principales
razones del exito de la empresa, segun varios ejecutivos.
 &HT;    ``Hemos dedicado mucho tiempo, esfuerzo y dinero al programa de
control de calidad, para desarrollar un sistema que nos diga lo que
pasa semana tras semana en cada restaurante,'' explica Roberto
Denegri, gerente de la division internacional de Campero.
 &HT;    Tras un fallido intento por penetrar en Miami a fines de los
anos 80, Campero planeo la nueva expansion de su franquicia con
gran cuidado. Desde 1992, Campero ha cambiado su logo, ha
remodelado sus restaurantes, ha ampliado su menu para incluir
desayunos y emparedados de pollo picante y agrego areas de juego y
fiestas para ninos.
 &HT;    Quiza el pollo frito no tiene mucha competencia en Guatemala,
pero en otros paises Guatemala se enfrenta a los gigantes. Las
ganancias han sido ``estupendas'' en los siete paises en los
ultimos anos, afirmo Denegri, aunque no dio cifras especificas.
 &HT;    ``Se puede medir nuestro exito viendo lo llenos que estan
nuestros restaurantes. Somos la unica cadena latina de categoria
mundial,'' agrega Denegri. ``Una de las cosas mas llamativas de
Campero es que atrae a todo tipo de gente, desde ejecutivos de
cuello y corbata hasta obreros.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MAS CRONICAS
 &HT;    MEXICO _ Hoy tuvo un debut espectacular cuando llego a los
estanquillos de la capital a principios de este ano.
 &HT;    El tabloide de 48 paginas, a todo color, tiene el objetivo de
atraer a los mexicanos de clase media que estan decepcionados con
el periodico de mas venta en Mexico, el sensacionalista La Prensa,
y que a la vez consideran demasiado elitista a Reforma, publicado
por la misma familia que produce El Norte en Monterrey. Para lograr
su objetivo, la nueva publicacion sedujo a 20 periodistas de
Reforma ofreciendoles el doble de lo que ganaban.
 &HT;    Tambien invirtio unos US$34 millones en equipos avanzados e
instalaciones, entre ellas una manzana completa en el distrito sur
de la capital, como sede de sus oficinas centrales.
 &HT;    A primera vista, el periodico es refrescante. En uno de sus
primeros numeros aparecio un reportaje sobre como un hombre lidiaba
con el machismo de sus amigos tras perder el empleo y dedicarse a
los quehaceres domesticos y a cuidar a sus hijos mientras la esposa
iba a trabajar. En una edicion mas reciente se publican las
biografias de varios bomberos municipales y se examinan los riesgos
que corren en su labor. El diario tambien tiene secciones practicas
sobre como las noticias economicas afectan a los ciudadanos comunes
e informes sobre la delincuencia, con indicaciones para protegerse
de los delincuentes.
 &HT;    Pero al cabo de unos meses, el periodico no ha logrado encontrar
a sus lectores. ``Es un periodico sin personalidad,'' comenta
Raymundo Riva Palacio, director en Mexico D.F. del periodico El
Financiero y experto en la prensa mexicana.
 &HT;    El director general, Miguel Canton Zetina, y su directora
editorial, Cruz Ulin Hernandez, no devolvieron llamadas de LATIN
TRADE. Pero otros directivos han dicho que su meta es elevar la
circulacion del periodico de 50.000 ejemplares cuando se lanzo a
100.000 a corto plazo, y luego a 250.000 a largo plazo, situando a
la publicacion en la misma categoria que La Prensa. En una ciudad
donde hay mas de 30 periodicos, la tarea no sera facil.

 NEW YORK: about masculinity. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He's the grandson of a Confederate rifleman and grew up with
the sense of the Lost Cause, of glorious doomed charges at
Gettysburg, of a sense of personal honor and what constitutes
masculinity that has largely been rejected by the urban
intellectual elite of the Northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one person's noble lost cause is another's
slaughterhouse over slavery. And Wolfe clearly sees the South more
as something that shaped him than as something he is unduly taken
with today.
</P>
<P>
   He may rhapsodize about his mother's iced tea with mint or the
``genteel Richmond accent'' he says is ``about as terrific as
accents become.'' He may give concise voice to the Southern
fixation on manners. (``I don't mind hypocrisy as long as courtesy
comes with it.'')
</P>
<P>
   But despite his claim to being taken with Atlanta's
``hypomanic'' business culture and incessant chatter about being
world-class, what he seems to like best about the South is what
used to be there, like the view from his Richmond window or the
seemingly genetic grace and courage of his mostly Southern flyboys
in ``The Right Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new book, he gives his one unrelievedly virtuous
character, a young man named Conrad Hensley, a name he picked from
his Shenandoah Valley past, and he dotes on the fading Old South
grit of his embattled developer hero, Charlie Croker. But the go-go
New South, where Southern Planters Bank and Trust Co. is now
PlannersBanc, seems more grist for his mill than balm for his soul,
which perhaps explains Wolfe's own red dog running headlong and
armed toward the past, however uncharacteristic it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motor is more important than where the car left,'' he said
of his own journey. ``One of my problems is that everything I know
about Atlanta is in the book. There's nothing left. If I'm
pontificating about the South and Atlanta, it's not from a very
high pulpit.''
</P>
<P>
   And while others have portrayed the book as a devastating
evisceration of Atlanta's New South pretensions, he insists his
only agenda is getting it right, from real-estate machismo to
stud-farm machismo, from the delicate negotiations of race to the
latest trophy-wife fashions in the golden era of ``perfect boys
with breasts'' as the ideal body type for the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book isn't anti-Atlanta, and it's not pro-Atlanta, just as
`Bonfire of the Vanities' wasn't anti-New York or pro-New York,''
he said. ``It's just Atlanta as near as I could get it. What I've
always been swept up in is the great journey of journalism, of
discovery, what I call the objectivity of egotism. It's always been
more important to me to discover something new in what I'm writing
about and put it into brilliant prose than to make any political
point on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   It was probably inevitable that Wolfe, after 11 years of work
sandwiched around a 1996 heart attack that almost killed him,
preferred to see the book as a triumph of craft rather than a grand
vessel of significance. After all, he has been preaching the gospel
of artful, imaginative reporting as high art, whether in fiction or
nonfiction, since the 1960s. Critics can argue over whether he is a
modern Dickens, Balzac or Zola or merely the possessor of perhaps
the wittiest, most merciless, reportorial eyes of his time. But his
second novel at least validates him as a player in both the New
Journalism and the old fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably foolish to say this, but I feel more fireproof
now than I ever did,'' he said. ``What's the old song? `They Can't
Take That Away From Me'? It's how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   He is almost 70 now, a decade older than his book's Old South
hero, who goes from a raging bull to a broken man as he turns 60.
And surely, a man with as acute an eye as Wolfe knows what a big
target he has become with his grand pronouncements about the proper
role of the novel, his Southern planter meets Savile Row attire,
his artful dismantling of cultural icons and, perhaps most of all,
his pitiless eye for the failures of the flesh, for
broad-shouldered cast-off first wives, for wide-bottomed,
fleshy-armed men. Indeed, ``A Man in Full'' at times reads like an
ectomorph's manifesto in which only the slim survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the things written about me and this book, it's the
adjective `spry' that really gets me,'' he said dolefully. ``Not
flexible, or supple, or strong. Spry. Someone really knows how to
hurt a guy.''
</P>
<P>
   These are ambiguous days for great Virginians, after all, as
evidenced by the doings at Monticello. But for now, the food supply
has not run out, Wolfe is contemplating a new novel having
something to do with education, and all seems well as his publisher
offloads Titanic-like mounds of ``A Man in Full,'' which has a 1.2
million first printing, into bookstores this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Wolfe,'' gushed one of the women of Madison Avenue as the
white suit breezed by. ``I have to tell you, you look even better
than your picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're too kind,'' Tom Wolfe replied, smiling like a man in
full, as he strolled jauntily down the avenue toward home.
</P>
<P>
   Finding Wolfe on the Web
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe will read from ``A Man in Full'' Wednesday night at
6:30 at Town Hall, 123 West 43rd St., Manhattan. Audio of the
reading will be available at 9:30 p.m. on The New York Times on the
Web: www.nytimes.com/books.

SAVING FOR RETIREMENT MEANS HAVING A PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILLIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Congratulations. You graduated in June, landed a job in
July and have by now discovered numerous ways to spend your
hard-earned paycheck.  &LR; txr:There are the basics such as rent,
clothes and food, not to mention car payments and student loans.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of list, the last thing in the world you're
thinking about is saving for retirement, even if the people in
human resources encouraged you to sign-up for the company 401(k)
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Well think again _ especially if you're a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The national debate and recent national meetings on Social
Security, including one at Penn Valley Community College, remind us
how inadequately most of us have prepared for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that your pension correlates to your
salary. American women traditionally earn lower wages than men and
are less likely to be covered by an employment-based pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   Women also are less likely to participate in a 401(k) plan if it
is available. That's because the rate of employee participation
also correlates to earnings. Only 39 percent of workers earning
less than $15,000 per year participate, while 90 percent of those
earning $75,000 or more take part.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, you're thinking. There's Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly women receive less Social Security than elderly men
because most earned less and worked fewer years.
</P>
<P>
   But even with Social Security and a pension, if you want to
retire with the same standard of living you now have, you have to
start saving early, warns Sandi Weaver, a certified financial
planner.
</P>
<P>
   Most people wait until they are in their 40s and 50s to start
planning for retirement, she said. That leaves many of them with
inadequate resources, so they are forced to work longer or cut
their standard of living when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver's solution is simple, but may not be well-received by a
society that's used to immediate gratification.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends that everyone start saving as soon as possible,
preferably from the beginning. Begin by taking advantage of the
401(k) plan at work. Start with even $25 or $50 a month and try to
increase it every year as you get a raise.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not enough. People also need to save in addition to a
401(k) plan. Often that means cutting other expenses. One of the
least painful places to cut is entertainment, Weaver said. She also
encouraged people to consider whether they should be driving a
less-expensive car and whether they should refinance their
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver thinks people don't plan because they don't have the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Take the time before it's too late.

THREE OF SIX CAUGHT AFTER JAILBREAK AS CITY WONDERS: WHAT
HAPPENED? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN T. DAUNER and ANNE LAMOY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ In a manhunt that straddled the state line,
three Wyandotte County, Kan., Detention Center escapees were caught
in Kansas City, Mo., on Monday afternoon, but two _ including a
convicted murderer _ remained at large.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, people throughout Wyandotte County were
wondering what had happened to pave the way for the biggest jail
break in the history of the 8-year-old facility. They were also
wondering how or why jail officials failed to act for nearly two
and a half hours after receiving a report that a prisoner might be
loose on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Wyandotte County Sheriff's supervisors suspended
three deputies for violating regulations and procedures. Sheriff
Mike Dailey refused to identify the men.
</P>
<P>
   The escapees still being sought Monday were Cleveland Henderson,
24, a convicted felon who is charged with six counts of aggravated
robbery, and Carsey Littlewood, 21, who is charged with capital
murder. Both men are Kansas City, Kan., residents.
</P>
<P>
   Captured Monday afternoon were James Crume Jr., 39, a convicted
murderer; Steven A. Ford, 17, facing sexual assault charges; and
Michael J. Enriquez, 20, charged with possession of cocaine on a
Jackson County warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth escapee, James Wedlow, 16, was apprehended Sunday in
an apartment building in Kansas City, Kan. He is charged with
aggravated robbery and auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   The six inmates apparently escaped about 11 p.m. Saturday.
Dailey said the prisoners, acting at about the same time, somehow
manipulated the locks on their fifth- and sixth-floor cells and
then broke through two doors or manipulated those locks while
making their way out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey said he had found no evidence that jail personnel had
aided the inmates in their escape. By late Monday, authorities had
not been able to replicate how the prisoners manipulated the cell
and fire-door locks, the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   The escape left many people, including Wyandotte County District
Attorney Nick Tomasic, uneasy. ``I hope they don't hurt someone,''
Tomasic said.
</P>
<P>
   Unified Government Commissioner Bill Young, chairman of the
government's Public Safety Standing Committee, said he had faith
that Dailey would get to the bottom of the escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any sense that they got through two locked
doors,'' Young said. ``It sounds like a big problem to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Palacio, the father of a young man whom Littlewood is
charged with killing, said Monday that he was considering sending
his wife and daughters to sleep with relatives. ``I fear for my
family,'' Palacio said.
</P>
<P>
   Littlewood is one of two men charged with capital murder in the
Oct. 3 slayings of Michael J. Palacio, 20, and Aldo Davila, 15,
both of Kansas City, Mo. Palacio and Davila were shot to death in
the Rosedale area of Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Monday, police on both sides of the state line
followed up on tips from callers.
</P>
<P>
   About 6:30 a.m., someone reported that Littlewood and Henderson
were at an apartment complex in Kansas City, Kan. Officers
surrounded the complex, but the search was fruitless and ended
about 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a cold drizzle, some apartment-complex residents
said they were frightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said last night, `What if they were up here?' '' said
Felicia Carson, standing outside with two small children.
</P>
<P>
   Police speculated that Littlewood may have been at the complex
because a former girlfriend lives there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, someone informed police that Crume, Ford and Enriquez
were holed up in a house.
</P>
<P>
   They were arrested without incident inside a green, wood-frame
house. Once inside a police van, the three men could be heard
yelling. Ford, one of the last to be handcuffed, was wearing white
socks but no shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the three would remain in the custody in Kansas
City, Mo., to await extradition to Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really, really frightening,'' said Juanita Kelton, who
lives across the street. ``I never dreamed they'd be over there.''
</P>
<P>
   About 4 p.m. Monday, a tipster reported seeing Henderson in a
Pontiac Trans Am in Kansas City, Kan. The car was painted with grey
primer and had Missouri plates, authorities said. After a short
chase, by car and on foot, the man police believed was Henderson
got away. So did the car, which another man was driving.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the escape, a normal complement of 15 to 16
deputies and supervisors was on duty. Dailey said about 11 staff
members were working on an overtime basis.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the jail was not being run according to
regulations Saturday night. For one thing, mandatory hourly head
counts apparently were not made, the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   The jail is supposed to be locked down at 9 p.m. The escapees
and 38 other prisoners were in individual cells in one of two
maximum-security pods. But jail logs showed that some prisoners in
the pod were let out of their cells after lock-down to make
telephone calls, J.B. Hopkins, jail administrator, said. The
prisoners were returned to their cells after the calls, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey said authorities believe the escapees may have stopped
their cell doors from locking, possibly by slipping something
between the lock bolt the door jam. There also is a striker bolt on
each door that would have to be opened, and prisoners don't have
access to either lock from inside the cells, Dailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Any lock bolt that did not seat should have activated a warning
light in the jail control room but apparently did not, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once out of their cells, the inmates jimmied the lock on a fire
door leading from the pod into an interior fire escape stairwell,
went down the stairs and broke through the lock on another fire
door to gain freedom on the north side of the building. Both fire
doors had cell type locks but were not alarmed, Dailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey said jail officials recently heard that inmates were
using combs to try to manipulate locks. Deputies then went through
the jail and picked up all the combs they could find.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, there have been at least three incidents involving
inmates walking away or breaking out of the jail.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1992, five inmates used a smuggled hacksaw to cut steel
window bars on a fifth-floor, maximum-security cell and slid down a
makeshift rope of bed sheets. They came down on the ground-floor
roof of the district attorney's office and got away. They were
recaptured within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, a prisoner using a key provided by a jailer
escaped from a jail van but was shot in the back and apprehended
before he got more than 100 yards. The prisoner, a convicted rapist
named Charles Holmes, lived but was paralyzed from the waist down.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the key witness in Crume's murder case walked out
of the jail before he was officially booked in. His absence was not
discovered for about three weeks. He turned himself in the day
after his absence came to light.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey, a former major on the Kansas City, Kan., Police
Department, has been sheriff since 1995. He was appointed to
succeed a former sheriff who resigned. Dailey was elected to a
four-year term in 1996.

STATE GAMING OFFICIALS EXAMINING $3 MILLION PAYOUT TO HILTON
DIRECTOR

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A director of the Hilton Hotels Corp. who
resigned during a scandal over its Kansas City casino was paid more
than $3 million after leaving the company.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri regulators plan to scrutinize the payments to Raymond
C. Avansino Jr. as part of a continuing examination of the Flamingo
Hilton casino and its relationship with the Kansas City Port
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a precaution, we are going to re-examine the transaction,''
said Mel Fisher, executive director of the Missouri Gaming
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Prosecutor Claire McCaskill also is investigating
dealings between Hilton and the Port Authority, which controls the
site of the Flamingo Hilton riverboat. She would not say Monday
whether her office would also look into the payments to Avansino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation will be as broad as it needs to be,''
McCaskill said.
</P>
<P>
   A Hilton spokeswoman confirmed the payment to Avansino. She
declined to provide details, however, and would not say whether two
Hilton executives who resigned with Avansino received similar
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't comment on compensation issues,'' said the
spokeswoman, Kathy Shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   Avansino could not be reached for comment Monday. He resigned in
1996 after disclosing that he approved paying $250,000 to a company
linked to Kansas City Port Authority Chairman Elbert Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Anderson has been convicted of unrelated charges of
bribing a City Council member and a chairman of the Jackson County
Legislature. Anderson is now cooperating with federal
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Hilton and its subsidiaries agreed to pay the federal
government $655,000 to avoid criminal charges that their $250,000
grant was designed to reward Anderson for his support for the
casino. Federal prosecutors contend a Hilton employee, whom they
have not named, agreed to a total payment of $1.25 million to
secure Anderson's vote.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill began investigating this fall, at the request of the
gaming commission. She said Monday she was looking into whether
bribery charges should be filed under state law.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press has reported that Hilton documents
described the payments to Avansino as compensation for ``unvested
stock options.'' The company also allowed Avansino to keep a
company car and unspecified ``other equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd declined to elaborate on the report, but said Hilton
disclosed the payments to its stockholders more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Steve Hill Jr. has said prosecutors did not pursue
charges against individual Hilton employees because none of them
benefited personally and because none still worked for Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton's agreement with federal prosecutors shows that in 1993,
Anderson arranged for Hilton to pay $250,000 to K.C. Perspectives.
The company was owned by an Anderson business associate, Michelle
Lathan.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors called the payments a ``reward'' to Anderson,
designed to ``influence his future support as Port Authority
chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Anderson declined to comment. A lawyer for
Hilton has said the corporation did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gaming Commission officials said Monday that they knew
Avansino held stock options when he resigned. But they were unaware
when he cashed them in, or how much he received.
</P>
<P>
   Avansino is a former casino regulator from Nevada and, until
November 1995, was president of Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   F. Michael O'Brien, who resigned about the same time, was
executive vice president of Hilton Gaming Corp. and was the Hilton
executive who appeared to have had the most contact with Anderson
about the grant. The third Hilton official who resigned was Mark
Rousseau, senior vice president for development at Hilton Gaming
Corp.

FOLLOWING THE WONDERFUL LOGIC OF `WONDERLAND'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, Justin G. Schiller, a New York dealer in
children's books, was certain that he knew most everything about
the publishing history of ``Alice in Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   The story had intrigued him since childhood, and so in 1960 when
he became a bookseller while still in high school, he began buying
and selling early printings of the book. Then, in 1974, he became a
founding member of a collectors' group, the Lewis Carroll Society
of North America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, he bought a rare copy of the first edition of
``Alice,'' printed in 1865 by Clarendon Press at Oxford University,
an edition that had been suppressed when Carroll, the pseudonym
used by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, and John Tenniel, the
illustrator, found imperfections in the printing.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller had seen the book once in an exhibition but had never
had a chance to inspect it closely until then.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finally had the book in my hands, I was puzzled by the
purple ink markings of circles, lines and a few word changes, seen
throughout the text,'' he said. ``Long identified as Lewis
Carroll's copy, bibliographers studied the book and assumed that
the markings were the changes Carroll had in mind for the second
edition and later printings.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiller was dismayed to find that the changes were not included
in the second edition, which was published in London in October
1865 but dated 1866, or in later printings. Even more perplexing
was the color of the ink in the markings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis Carroll did not begin using purple ink until 1870,''
Schiller said. ``That's when Christ Church Oxford gave him, and all
members of the faculty, purple ink to use to mark students'
papers.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery notwithstanding, he now owned what for him was his
greatest treasure. He had been willing to pay $200,000 _ his entire
savings _ for the book, but he was luckily able to buy it at an
auction in Paris for $56,000.
</P>
<P>
   Of the original 48 copies of the first edition, 23 survive, 16
of them in libraries. But none of the other copies is as
distinctive as the one Schiller bought: it includes 10 of the
work's original pencil drawings by Tenniel, each of which is signed
with his monogram.
</P>
<P>
   The drawings were combined with the marked pages when they were
bound as a book for the first time in 1899. Another uncommon aspect
of the book is that the pages were left untrimmed and never gilded.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the purple ink, Schiller was convinced that Carroll
was not responsible for the markings. In a monograph that he
published privately in 1990, Schiller wrote, ``Since 1928, these
markings have been misattributed as being in Lewis Carroll's
handwriting.'' Curiously, a footnote in the monograph provided a
clue that just a month ago helped solve the mystery, when the book
was being prepared to be auctioned at Christie's in New York on
Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to Alice in the story happened to me,'' Schiller
said. ``Alice prides herself on being logical. She looks at the
evidence directly in front of her and confronts it head on; she
then follows the road of logical assumptions, making twists and
turns and getting lost along the way, to an ultimate conclusion. I
did this too, using the evidence of the date that the book was
published, the aspect of the purple ink and the advice of
bibliographers. However, I ignored other possibilities and came to
a narrow conclusion that was all wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Francis Wahlgren, who heads the books and manuscript
department at Christie's, suggested to Schiller that he auction his
copy of ``Alice'' this year, during the centenary of Carroll's
death while the market was hot for his books. Another 1865 copy of
``Alice'' was sold privately a year ago for about $800,000, to a
collector, John Lindseth, a Cleveland industrialist. He included it
in an exhibition of his Lewis Carroll collection at the Grolier
Club last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Wahlgren added another inducement: ``Alice'' could become the
last book sold at Christie's Park Avenue before the auction house
moved to Rockefeller Center next year. Schiller agreed. The price
expected is between $1.5 million to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the catalogue went to press, Wahlgren decided to
check the footnote on Carroll in Schiller's monograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct told me that Schiller's explanation for the purple
markings did not add up,'' Wahlgren said. ``So I went to the Morgan
Library to check whether the information was correct in a footnote
to a 1956 article, that Schiller had cited in his book.''
</P>
<P>
   In the footnote, William H. Bond, a curator who became the
librarian at the Houghton Library at Harvard University, wrote that
the purple-ink markings in ``Alice'' were made by Carroll
``possibly in preparation for `The Nursery Alice,' '' the version
for very young children published in 1889. (Schiller said that he
had underestimated the importance of that statement because of the
word possibly.)
</P>
<P>
   Wahlgren found that the changes suggested by the markings
corresponded almost perfectly to the text of the ``Nursery Alice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Francis became my White Rabbit,'' Schiller said. ``He retraced
my steps but then took another path and solved the mystery of the
purple ink markings. Whenever Alice was lost, she followed White
Rabbit and found her way.''

POP LIFE: R. KELLY, JUDY GARLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trading Macho For Sensitive
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif. _ Subtlety and vulnerability were hardly
priorities when R. Kelly released his lascivious, 3-million-plus
selling album ``12 Play'' five years ago. Songs like ``I Like the
Crotch on You,'' ``Your Body's Calling'' and ``Sex Me'' pretty much
encapsulated the record's message.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kelly has matured as a songwriter since then, his new
``R.'' (released Tuesday as a double CD on Jive Records) is such a
sophisticated leap that it seems like the work of a different kind
of artist: an extremely talented singer, producer, arranger,
songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who now understands the
meaning of the blues and soul.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt come-ons and nouveau riche braggadocio remain on
``R.,'' but the tone has changed. They are mixed in with songs in
which Kelly apologizes to women instead of seducing them. ``All she
wanted was some love and affection/But all I did all the time was
neglect,'' he bemoans in ``Reality,'' an answer of sorts to the
single he wrote for Sparkle, ``Be Careful.'' When Kelly does try to
lure women into his bedroom, it is with the intention of having a
child, of going ``Half on a Baby,'' in the words of the album's
single and its mock-opera reprise.
</P>
<P>
   If anything has changed for Kelly between ``12 Play'' and now,
this reticent songwriter isn't telling. ``I feel pretty much the
same,'' he said. ``Tomorrow I might write another `12 Play' style
of song. It just depends on what hits my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, however, Kelly does admit that he has ``changed in
ways,'' most specifically in turning to religion. When he tours, he
now brings a minister on the road. ``Going around this world a few
times and meeting a whole lot of people has made me grow some,'' he
said. ``I came out of the clubs and quit partying so much and got
serious. I wanted to go deeper into my music and get to another
level with myself, my album and my artistry. Sometimes you have to
find somebody to give you the strength to do that. I prayed because
I wanted to do that. And I ended up going to church.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kelly rarely discusses his private life, including when
it was reported that he married his 15-year-old protegee, Aaliyah,
four years ago, he does admit to having his heart broken recently.
It is hardly a confession considering songs like ``Suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional high-water mark of this album, ``Suicide'' is
anchored by crisp acoustic guitar, slow keyboard chord changes and
touches of funk bass and soul horns backing Kelly emoting, ``The
easiest thing in the world is to love you/And the hardest thing in
the world is to lose you'' before concluding, with
self-recrimination, ``You were at work, I was at play.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about ``Suicide,'' Kelly said: ``Whether it's over a
woman or losing a job or not having any money to support your
family, sometimes you feel like, `I'm getting out of here.' I'm
glad I didn't, but I have felt that way and I've known people to
feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``R.'' isn't all remorse, though. Outside of the half-dozen or
so songs about how much Kelly likes money, it is an extremely
diverse album. There are slow-churning ballads sung with Celine
Dion (``I'm Your Angel''), raps spun with Jay-Z, Noreaga, Foxy
Brown and Nas, and Kelly's feel-good hit from ``Space Jam'' and
Mobil commercials (``I Believe I Can Fly''). There's some very
old-school baritone singing (``The Opera''), a sock-hop soul number
crooned in the style of Ben E. King (``If I Could Turn Back the
Hands of Time'') and an update of Michael Jackson's ``Scream''
(``'What I Feel/Issues'').
</P>
<P>
   When listening to the album, he said, fans should realize
``first of all that they're listening to an artist that means
business and means what he writes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, I want them to be able to see what I'm singing about
rather than just hear it,'' he added. ``When they hear the lyrics,
I want them to be able to imagine what I'm saying right off the
bat.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is the optimal environment to be in when imagining
these things? ``In the Jeep, in the car or in the tub,'' Kelly
replied.
</P>
<P>
   `Judy Garland Show'
</P>
<P>
   After 34 years and months of court battles, 26 episodes of ``The
Judy Garland Show'' are being released. The shows from the early
1960s, which include a 19-year-old Barbra Streisand's first network
appearance in addition to performances by Ethel Merman, Count
Basie, Tony Bennett, Bobby Darin, Vic Damone, Louis Jordan, her
daughters Lorna Luft and Liza Minnelli and many more, will be
released one by one over the next year by 32 Productions.
</P>
<P>
   Since Garland died at 47 in 1969, the shows have been in the
custody of her third husband and the executive producer of the
series, Sid Luft. Last year Luft sold the rights to the shows to a
company called Classic World, which then sold the U.S. rights to 32
Records, which most recently released the Judy Garland boxed set,
``Judy.''
</P>
<P>
   But in July, Luft sued 32 Records and Classic World, claiming
that he never got paid for the shows and thus still owns them. The
judge ruled that Classic World owned the shows, but after being
paid, Luft still failed to turn over the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, upon release of the boxed set (which contained
excerpts from the program), Luft called Tower Records and several
guest artists from the show claiming that his copyright was being
infringed upon. After several more court hearings, Luft turned over
the tapes Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shows are like a snapshot of Hollywood in an era that will
never exist again,'' said 32 Records president Robert Miller. ``We
want to put together a TV special, a best-of compilation and then
make the videos available to her fans around the country. We're in
the business of making sure the Judy Garland renaissance continues,
in video as well as audio.''
</P>
<P>
   Luft's lawyer, James Harrington, did not return several phone
calls. &QL;

(EDS: Canada points note) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GABRIELLE CRIST 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The mother walked nervously toward Gate 42
at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, her eyes scanning the crowd for the
son she had not seen in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   She had not held him in her arms since he was a baby, and had
had only sporadic contact with him over the years. Hoping that a
reunion would erase the emptiness she felt, she'd hired a private
investigator in Canada to contact the boy and arrange a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   There he is, she thought, spotting a teen who was looking her
way. But as she drew closer, her heart started racing.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the boy Sheila Powell had seen in the photographs.
He wasn't tall and skinny. He didn't have big ears.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they hugged and she kissed his cheek, then invited him to
her home in Fort Worth. She had to know who he really was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put on an act that would have won an Oscar,'' Powell said.
``I had to because I had to find out what these people were up
to.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally learned the boy's true identity, and a story of
deception, desperation and a mother's fragile hopes of reuniting
with her son unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story so bizarre that it's hardly believable.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Powell was 22 and living in North Carolina when she met her
husband-to-be, Generoso Moccia, in 1979 through an ad in the
National Examiner tabloid. Within months, they were married and
living in Chatham, Ont.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was as sweet as he could be,'' Powell recalled, seated in
the living room of her small home on McCart Avenue. Within a year,
they had a son, Salvatore Moccia.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbing through her wedding album, she told how marital bliss
quickly turned to bitterness. Within three years, the couple were
getting divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Custody documents filed Aug. 6, 1981, by Generoso Moccia refer
to testimony by Powell that she had been hospitalized after a
beating by her husband and had undergone psychiatric treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Generoso Moccia for this article were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband was seeking temporary custody of their son, and on
June 29, 1981, during a visit, Powell took Sal and fled to North
Carolina. Two months later, a Canadian court ordered that Powell
return her son to her ex-husband in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not afford to go back and fight him,'' said Powell,
42, who stays at home to care for another son who is 14. ``I didn't
know how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell went on with her life, had another son and, in 1986, got
married and moved to Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Sal was 12, Powell called to tell her son that his
maternal grandmother had died. She said she wanted to have a
relationship with him, and he seemed amenable.
</P>
<P>
   Sal wrote to her, told her about his friends and his favorite
subjects in school. He signed his name and drew a big heart around
it.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, he wrote again, but this letter was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``You said anything I wanted you would buy it and send it to me
by airmail. Well, here's what I want and you better send it to me
or I won't come to Texas,'' states the letter, which Powell keeps
in a cardboard box filled with her life's mementos.
</P>
<P>
   He then listed his demands: a jackknife, two brass knuckles, two
slingshots, two Swiss Army knives, a pair of nunchaku, a
basketball, a wallet, a watch, a big squirt gun and a BB gun, to
name only a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make up for all the birthdays you missed if you buy
me this stuff,'' the letter says. ``I won't talk to you on the
phone until I get the stuff I want in the mail. I mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell wrote her son a letter and told him not to expect any
airmail packages.
</P>
<P>
   Their contact ended.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Powell received an anonymous letter from Canada with
several recent pictures of her son. It told Powell where her son
was living and going to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must not let anyone know we are helping you,'' stated the
letter, signed ``your guardian angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell called the school and asked the vice principal how her
son was doing. He sent Sal's most recent photograph.

`MEMORY OF WATER': SIBLING RESENTMENT, FILIAL AMBIVALENCE IN
ORKSHIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (Production notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This isn't quite what dressing up in Mommy's clothes
used to be like.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa, Mary and Catherine, three English sisters of no
particular closeness, have gathered before a mirror in garish
dresses from their mother's closet. There's not a flicker of
remembered little-girl fantasies of grown-up glamour in the eyes of
these adults. They're appalled and amused by what they see, and
when one of them says to another, ``You look dead like Mum,''
they're taken hostage by laughter. After all, Mum, at the moment,
is lying in state in the local funeral parlor.
</P>
<P>
   As enacted by Suzanne Bertish, J. Smith-Cameron and Seana
Kofoed, this collapse into gallows merriment is a sad and
invigorating spectacle. It occurs just before the end of the first
act of ``The Memory of Water,'' the new play by Shelagh Stephenson
at the Manhattan Theater Club, and it has a raw spontaneity that
captures perfectly the idea of ``what normal people do in abnormal
times,'' as one character has said earlier. It is what often
happens in the face of a death in the family: words fail, emotions
short-circuit and the only proper response seems to be laughter.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is also remarkable as an indication of a play and of
performances that might have been instead of what is seen during
most of this reflective comedy, which opened Tuesday night under
John Tillinger's direction. The moment is one of the few in which
three fine actresses are able to sink comfortably into their parts,
and the effect is of a revivifying breeze sweeping through a small,
stuffy room.
</P>

   ``The Memory of Water,'' previously produced in London and
Chicago and the first stage play by Ms. Stephenson, who brings to
mind an English Beth Henley, is dotted with stimulating
observations that point to depths the work itself never plumbs.
This story of sibling resentment and filial ambivalence, set in a
seaside town in North Yorkshire, considers the notion that what we
remember from our pasts is as much invention as fact. ``Can you
feel nostalgia for something that never existed?'' asks Mary (Ms.
Smith-Cameron), the middle sister and the official success of the
family.
</P>
<P>
   Like other, similar lines in ``Memory,'' the question hovers in
the air, but it never really lands on the stage to become a part of
the action. The comedy features enjoyably detailed arguments among
the sisters in which no one can agree, for instance, on which of
them was once abandoned at the beach and which threw up on the
television when ``The High Chaparral'' was on. It extends the theme
by having Mary, a doctor, describe a patient who has come to obsess
her, a young man with ``post-traumatic amnesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet these elements often feel like sparkling accessories pinned
onto a comedy cut from a conventional pattern and synthetic cloth.
Ms. Stephenson, who is currently under commission to the Royal
National Theater, is a writer of promising curiosity. Here,
unfortunately, she trucks out her arresting themes without letting
them take on organic life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memory'' can be broken down too easily into alternating scenes
of bantering insults and heartfelt confrontation. They are attached
to a central plot line, built on the mysterious papers that lie in
a missing green biscuit tin, that could have figured in a
19th-century melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters themselves fall neatly into pre-formed categories.
Teresa (Ms. Bertish), the eldest, is the practical, bossy one, who
stayed home to take care of Mother and married a nice but boring
man, Frank (Peter McRobbie). Mary, the doctor, has a worldly
arrogance and a married lover, Mike (David Hunt). Catherine (Ms.
Kofoed), the baby, is a professional, promiscuous drifter.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters carp at and blame each other in dialogue that exists
somewhere between situation and drawing-room comedies. It's
intermittently funny, but the actresses delivering it only rarely
transcend a sense of deft mechanical banter to suggest the
biological bonds of sisterhood. You keep wanting them to react to,
rather than just perform for, each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith-Cameron, the blissful star of ``As Bees in Honey
Drown,'' has retained some of that earlier performance's
artificiality, her eyebrows arching to accent a quip as if they
just couldn't help themselves. The excellent Ms. Bertish often
seems to be struggling against stereotype and giving up the battle,
especially when the prim Teresa gets drunk. Ms. Kofoed, in the
flashiest and most exaggerated part, does convey the ravenous
neediness at her character's center.
</P>
<P>
   As the bewildered men in the sisters' lives, Hunt and McRobbie
are very good indeed, giving the evening its most persuasive flow
of natural life. But the standout in the cast is Robin Moseley as
Vi, the girls' mother, who reappears as a ghost to bedevil Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a 1950s-ish green taffeta dress and a smile that is both
droll and reproachful, Vi exudes the adult sophistication that her
daughters must have projected onto her as children and would now
deny her in recollection.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she nags and criticizes, in the tradition of ghost
mothers in comedies, she also has a fundamental reserve, a sense
that she knows something that no one else onstage does. Unlike
``The Memory of Water'' itself, Vi understands the importance of
not spelling out one's secrets.

WHITAKER NAMED EDITOR OF NEWSWEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Whitaker, who was penciled in as Newsweek editor even
before the death of the legendary Maynard Parker last month, was
formally _ and predictably _ named to the post Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 41-year-old Whitaker will be the first black editor
of a major national newsweekly, that distinction was downplayed
both by media observers and by Whitaker himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud and honored about all that,'' said Whitaker, who
began at the magazine as a student intern in 1977. ``But my goal is
to be the best possible editor of Newsweek, not just the best
possible black editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker had handled day-to-day editing duties along with
chairman and editor in chief Richard Smith since Parker was
hospitalized earlier this year with leukemia, which led to his
death from complications from pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   So Whitaker clearly had the inside track in a field of
candidates that included Washington bureau chief Ann McDaniel,
international editions editor Michael Elliott, and assistant
managing editor Evan Thomas. McDaniel and national affairs editor
Jon Meacham were both named managing editors Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a surprise within the building,'' said Jonathan
Alter, a Newsweek senior editor and columnist who has known
Whitaker since their days on the daily Crimson at Harvard, where
Whitaker graduated summa cum laude in 1979 and won a Marshall
Scholarship to Oxford. ``People were very happy that it was made
official. There was a big round of applause.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, who had been managing editor since January 1996, is a
classic insider at a magazine that values loyalty. He had his
ticket punched at all the requisite stops _ six years as an
international writer, four years as business editor, five as
assistant managing editor, and two as managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   He directed the magazine's coverage of the 1987 Wall Street
crash, Princess Diana's death, and the Monica Lewinsky scandal and
also wrote occasional essays on race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark clearly has the experience, drive, character, and good
judgment to lead Newsweek into a very successful future,'' said
Smith, who will work with Whitaker on strategic issues and
long-range editorial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek, which trails archrival Time by nearly a million copies
(3.2 million to 4.1 million) in the subscription war, has been
trying to close the gap in recent years by jumping on big stories
and writing edgy pieces on both pop and computer culture.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, who launched the magazine's monthly Focus on
Technology section and its weekly Cyberscope page, said that he
wanted to expand Newsweek's emphasis on science, the global
ecnonomy, personal finance, and family issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll continue to cover the major stories as aggressively as
possible,'' said Whitaker. ``We'll continue to scramble the jets in
the Maynard Parker tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scrambling the jets'' was Parker's term for his willingness to
tear the magazine apart near deadline and order up a fresh cover
story to stay abreast of the news.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the newsweeklies are struggling to compete in the
24-hour world of cable news and the Internet, Whitaker said
Newsweek needs to find ways to remain timely and relevant,
especially to younger readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want our readers to have an emotional attachment to the
magazine,'' Whitaker said. ``I don't want it to sit on a coffee
table or a nightstand as homework.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When they come down out of the clouds,
congressional Democrats will be sorry they crowed about the
precipitous downfall of incendiary House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   They are going to miss him like crazy.

polls he makes even used car salesmen seem like pristine pillars of
society?
</P>
<P>
   Who else indeed, except Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not that pragmatic, careful and until now nationally
obscure fellow, Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., the prospective new
House speaker. Lacking Gingrich's perpetually Mephistophelian
smile, the Livingston visage is tightly controlled and absent of
political mischief.
</P>
<P>
   It might take ages to build Livingston into a worthwhile villain
capable of producing Democratic campaign contributions, and indeed
it may never be possible if he proves to be as responsible as he is
currently portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Former Speaker Jim Wright can now gloat. He's the Texas Democrat
hounded from office by ethics charges leveled primarily by
then-minority-backbencher Gingrich that were similar to charges
later leveled against Gingrich himself. A Gingrich who lives by the
partisan sword deserves political death by the partisan sword.
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats should think twice about what losing
Gingrich means in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   He will never again be the provocative powerhouse he was as
speaker _ despite the fanciful theory that he may now run for
president since he is free to be himself without the burdensome
accountability of public office. Being himself helped to produce a
conservative congressional revolution four years ago, but both he
and the revolution are exhausted, and it won't work twice.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich insists that although momentarily jobless he will
remain publicly visible and active in politics. He has long hinted
that he envisions himself in the White House. Fortunately, not many
other people have that vision.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich as recycled gadfly will pop up in our consciousness
from time to time, mostly when he indulges his most outrageous
ideas. But it is difficult to imagine that he will ever be taken
seriously again. He had the ultimate power to make public policy
and lost it. He is just another political face, scaring no one.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is not comparable to defeated GOP presidential
candidate Bob Dole, who earned the national approval of his party
if not the country. Gingrich was a product of an elite, closed GOP
circle in the House, with narrow interests and a narrow perspective
not necessarily reflective of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But we knew he was on his way out when he pushed his second
book, ``Lessons Learned the Hard Way,'' with a cover photograph in
which he looked oddly cozy and lean in jeans and a leather jacket.
He was trading the old fire for a more conventional pose. The book,
and his makeover, didn't find a market. We knew too much about the
old Newt, whom we considered the real Newt.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, whose relationship with
Gingrich ranged from poor to poorest, will be more at home with a
fellow pragmatist like Livingston. But the partisan contrast
necessary to win elections may be more difficult to draw with
Gingrich out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   If Gephardt and Livingston are happily cutting backroom deals
all day, how are voters to know the winners from the losers? Oh,
dear.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was a wonderful symbol of everything Republicans loved
and Democrats loathed.
</P>
<P>
   But we in the media will miss him too. Journalists thought he
was a terrific story, no matter what else we thought of him.
Actually, we helped to do him in.
</P>
<P>
   Americans like to personalize politics, and so when we see an
individual who is erratic, colorful, fearless _ and interesting _
we overexpose him or her. The shelf life of political shockers is
not very long, as Minnesota Gov.-elect Jesse Ventura may soon
discover.
</P>
<P>
   We voters say we want our politicians to be outspoken and frank
and totally independent. But we don't really. We like them to be
comfortable, safe, in the middle of the road where they can't roll
off into the ditch and take us with them.

COMMENTARY: SAY CHEESE, GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a classic comedy routine long ago, Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner
theorized that the original seven astronauts parading before the
public were actually male models, hired by a PR-minded NASA to
camouflage the fact that it had such ``ugly little astronauts.'' In
the aftermath of its election disaster, the Republican Congress
seems to be trying out the same strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a smile on my face,'' declared Steve Largent, the
football star turned Oklahoma congressman as he told Larry King of
his aspiration to topple Dick Armey as House majority leader.
``What the Republican Party needs so desperately is ... new fresh
ideas, fresh faces. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Largent is a fresh face, and he is smiling, and he has a
better chance of landing in a J. Crew catalog spread than Armey
does. But there is no more difference between his political
``ideas'' and Armey's than there is between those of Newt Gingrich
and his milder successor, Robert Livingston. As recently as July,
Largent was on TV railing against homosexuality as a ``sin'' and
saying ``there is no middle ground'' on abortion. Does he really
think no one will go to the videotape?
</P>
<P>
   Largent's views are precisely those that helped cost his party
the year's key races. Religious-right candidates backed by Gary
Bauer and Ralph Reed couldn't win even in the Deep South. On the
coasts, the victors Chuck Schumer and Gray Davis successfully
impaled Al D'Amato and Dan Lungren on their efforts to reverse Roe
vs. Wade. It was also in California, always a snapshot of the
political future, that Matt Fong's campaign against a vulnerable
Barbara Boxer went into meltdown after the revelation of his
contribution to the homophobic Traditional Values Coalition. John
Ashcroft, the Missouri senator aspiring to be the religious right's
presidential candidate, stumped for candidates in four primary
states this year _ and all four lost. In Colorado, home to James
Dobson's Focus on the Family, even a supposedly slam-dunk ballot
initiative outlawing ``partial birth abortion'' went down to
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The happier, slimmer faces of the new GOP leadership, all of
them talking about ``pragmatism'' and ``compassionate
conservatism,'' are giving only new form to this same old content.
Trent Lott and Tom DeLay, both to the right of Newt, remain in
place. The token woman running against Largent, Jennifer Dunn, has
a far worse record on abortion rights than her predecessor in that
role, Susan Molinari. The sole black face that may join the team,
J.C. Watts, is not for nothing a perennial favorite of Pat
Robertson's Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Republican Leadership Council _ the organization
that champions New Republicans exemplified by the GOP's many
successful, socially moderate governors _ the feeling is that it
may take another election to sort their riven party out.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, the Ashcroft-Bauer-Forbes right will go up against the
McCain-Alexander middle, and George W. Bush, for now a telegenic
tabula rasa who is all things to all people, will have to define
himself far more clearly, one way or the other, if he chooses to
stand in the crossfire. Al Gore _ or any Democrat _ will push the
GOP candidate to the wall on cultural issues just as Davis and
Schumer did Lungren and D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, these issues are hardly going to go away. Like the
far left of the '60s, the far right of the '90s has an active
terrorist wing. Anti-abortion and anti-gay crimes are rising. The
'98 campaign took place against the backdrop of the murders of
Matthew Shepard and Barnett Slepian, as well as the manhunt for
Eric Rudolph, charged with bombing abortion clinics and a gay
nightclub along with Atlanta's Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders of the party will have to find a way to lower the
rhetoric and dismantle the hate apparatus'' of this fringe, said
Lewis Eisenberg, the Republican Leadership Council's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Yes they will, but the new faces trotted out in Washington,
however prettier than Armey and Newt, can't do it. The story of
this election is not in the old, soundly defeated ideas hiding
behind the Ken-doll grin of Steve Largent but in the upset victory
of former wrestler Jesse (the Body) Ventura. Surely it wasn't his
looks that attracted large numbers of women and young voters, but
it may have been in part his muscular libertarian stands for both
gay and abortion rights.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Employees at Amazon.com, the popular Internet bookseller,
recently received in their e-mail a directive from senior
management that struck some as Orwellian.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an event that the Seattle-based company designated
``Sweep and Keep,'' employees were instructed to purge, among other
things, e-mail messages that were no longer required for business
or not subject to legal records requirements. Free lattes would be
dispensed in the cafeteria to those who complied immediately, the
directive said.
</P>
<P>
   This Amazon ``document retention'' policy, which requires
employees to expunge electronic files regularly, was followed a few
weeks later with guidelines for ``document creation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply put, there are some communications that should
not be expressed in written form,'' the Oct. 20 memo stated.
``Sorry, no lattes this time!''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind monopoly power in the marketplace; the real lesson
corporate America is taking away from the Microsoft antitrust trial
is that old e-mail can be a mine field of legal liability, not to
mention a source of public embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-profile court battle between the Justice Department
and the Microsoft Corp., e-mail has emerged as the star witness _ a
fact that appears to be giving pause to corporate executives
accustomed to clicking ``send'' without a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love e-mail,'' said Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief
executive. ``I think it is changing the world. The problem is
somebody can take it out of context and use it against you, and we
have to guard against that.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, like many companies, had embraced e-mail as the
preferred way to communicate about business matters. Instant,
convenient and at least putatively private, it allows the lowliest
employee to discourse with the most exalted. And it provokes
spontaneous, if not always eloquent, brainstorming among colleagues
who might otherwise keep their thoughts to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Amazon, which to many people symbolizes a progressive
Internet culture, is among the growing ranks of companies that are
imposing new restrictions on e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier policies prohibiting abusive or harassing
electronic messages, the new rules tend to curb types of expression
that have long been deemed acceptable business discourse. And when
such exchanges must take place in writing, the prevailing
philosophy would have them expunged as quickly and ruthlessly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   This backlash underscores a paradox of the information age:
while instantaneous electronic communication often helps increase
productivity and innovation, the privacy of workplace
correspondence and accountability for what is written are growing
concerns for many employers.
</P>
<P>
   Often, e-mail is more a conversation that happens to be written
down than an actual letter, and it is often more revealing than
either. It has thrived largely because of the assumption _ some
would call it the illusion _ that the rapid-fire confessional
exchanges that e-mail seems to encourage will never be divorced
from their context.
</P>
<P>
   But that is often not the case in legal disputes, where e-mail
is increasingly being treated as the ultimate window into the true
thoughts of executives and the inner workings of an enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Microsoft trial's electronic highlights: the company
chairman, Bill Gates, in a sworn deposition, flatly contradicts his
e-mail statements, and an e-mail from James Barksdale, chief
executive of the Netscape Communications Corp., to America Online's
chairman, Steve Case, in which he refers to Case as ``Franklin D.''
and himself as ``Joseph Stalin'' in a strained _ and ultimately
embarrassing _ allusion to the leaders of the United States and the
Soviet Union in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in the Sun Microsystem lawsuit against Microsoft over
the Java programming language, a federal court in San Jose, Calif.,
has seen a great deal of embarrassing e-mail from both companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the very attributes that have made e-mail so
popular _ chief among them its tendency to induce off-the-cuff
candor _ are driving managers to conclude that its use must be
reined in, its tracks dusted over.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, message-retention policies have been primarily
designed for disk space management,'' said Jim Browning, a senior
research analyst at the Gartner Group, a consulting firm. ``The new
question is how quickly should e-mail be deleted to prevent it from
becoming a danger to the organization?''
</P>
<P>
   Browning said that anxious calls from clients had been rising in
tandem with headlines about the Microsoft trial. Earlier this
month, a client called looking for what he characterized as an
``e-mail shredder.'' Another wanted a ``Mission Impossible'' e-mail
product that would self-destruct the message after it was read.
``That option doesn't exist today,'' Browning said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group recommends policies that help employees
understand what a company considers appropriate business language.
</P>
<P>
   For example, said Joyce Graff, Gartner's research director for
the electronic workplace: ``You talk about `fair competition'; you
don't talk about `slaughtering' them. No warfare language. That way
you have fewer messages you have to worry about in the files.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 83 million Americans who now use e-mail in the workplace
know, it is easily and often forwarded, copied and stored in
perpetuity on everything from company backup tapes to personal Palm
Pilots. The fact that people are disinclined to erase old e-mail
has not been lost on lawyers, who routinely request e-mail as part
of the discovery process in civil and criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lipstein, a Washington-based antitrust lawyer, said a
company's e-mail was a treasure trove of evidence ``because that's
when you catch people in their unguarded moments.'' Lipstein, who
specializes in subpoenaing computer records from multinational
corporations, added, ``I've seen e-mail that makes me cringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several executives said they regretted the new
atmosphere of deliberation and delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It slows down communication if everybody is stopping and
thinking about what they write,'' said Tom Jermoluk, chief
executive of At Home, a company that provides Internet access over
cable television lines. ``It's chilling. I don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Jermoluk, whose company was dragged into the
Microsoft antitrust dispute because of an e-mail message a senior
manager had written titled ``Gates on the Warpath,'' said he had
instructed the company's lawyer to write a more restrictive policy
to regulate e-mail and record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting desires to engage in frank, private
communication and to escape public accountability for it are by no
means new. Corporations have for decades trashed acres of files _
albeit with the added incentive that paper takes up a lot of space.
</P>
<P>
   And well before the first subpoena for a document, Socrates
warned that writing ideas down was a bad idea because, among other
things, one could never know who might read them. Plato countered
that a culture that had to commit everything to memory was limited
in its intellectual possibilities.

<P>
   The quandary of archived records, said Neil Postman, a professor
of media studies at New York University, has been around ``ever
since phonetic writing became a critical part of Western culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every important new technology is a Faustian bargain,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, employers are choosing censorship. More than 20
percent of the respondents in the American Management Association's
annual survey this year said that they monitored employee e-mail,
compared with 15 percent who said they did so in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Classes with titles like ``E-Mail 101'' are getting healthy
enrollments. Bloomberg, the financial news service, installed a
system last month that searches e-mail for offending words. If it
finds one, a warning pops up before the e-mail is sent: ``This is
inappropriate language to use in correspondence with any customer,
and a copy of this message will be immediately sent to your
superior.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers at the Polk Co., a data resource firm in Southfield,
Mich., recently discovered that 10 percent of employees had from
5,000 to 10,000 e-mail messages saved on hard drives. A delete-fest
is being planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Microsoft trial has done is to say that if people are
using this as an electronic filing system, it could be a dangerous
medium,'' said David Zaccagnini, Polk's vice president for
information technology. ``That's what the Microsoft trial really
means to corporate America.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without formal policies, executives said they were
sanitizing their own e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I self-consciously tone my language down,'' said John Gage,
chief scientist at Sun.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Prusak, executive director of IBM's Institute for
Knowledge Management, is wary of inhibiting the use of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``With e-mail, you get an optimization of a firm's knowledge,''
Prusak said. ``You know Queen Elizabeth I said, `I don't wish to
build windows into men's souls.' That's in a sense what we're
beginning to do, and I find it very threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Iran-Contra investigations in which Col.
Oliver North's e-mail detailed illegal aid to the Nicaraguan
rebels, courts ruled that most government e-mail must be saved as a
public record. That has changed attitudes toward e-mail among
federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an enormous increase in information requests
from Congress, which has a very legitimate oversight function,''
said Sally Katzen, who formerly headed the Clinton administration's
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. ``But the call for
e-mails _ which in many instances are very susceptible to being
incomplete, cryptic and misunderstood _ has led a lot of people to
shun the use of e-mail, and I think that's most unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some critics say that unless e-mail comes to be viewed
through a more appropriate legal lens, companies, governments and
individuals will lose the full benefits of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is perhaps the most contextually sensitive piece of
writing that we have, and culturally we're going through this stage
where we don't understand how to read it,'' said Lawrence Lessig, a
Harvard University law professor. ``The clumsiness that the legal
system has in dealing with this will lead to losing some of its
value unless we learn how to put it into context and properly weigh
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's own personal e-mail became a source of controversy last
year when he was named special master by the judge hearing the
Microsoft antitrust case. Microsoft contended that he was biased,
citing an e-mail message he had sent to a Netscape executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people now who will not send me things in e-mail,''
Lessig said.

WIDOW OF LENNON, GUARDIAN OF MYTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 15)  
 (bl)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a glance, the just-released four-CD ``John Lennon Anthology''
looks very much like an ambitious collectors' trawl. Lavishly
packaged and copiously annotated, this ``Anthology'' (Capitol)
brims with studio outtakes, concert performances, private composing
tapes and assorted spoken bits _ 94 selections in all.
</P>
<P>
   The thriving bootleg market has proved that the Beatles,
collectively and individually, have a following that voraciously
snaps up material of this kind.
</P>
<P>
   But satisfying the quasi-musicological obsessions of collectors
is not the primary purpose of this set. ``Anthology,'' compiled by
Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, is less a freestanding record release
than an installment in a continuing multimedia biography.
</P>
<P>
   It joins a mountain of CDs, videotapes, material for film
documentaries and radio series, picture books, collections of
Lennon's writings and art works _ that Ms. Ono has released,
overseen or sanctioned since Lennon was murdered on Dec. 8, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   This body of posthumously released work is an object lesson in
the building, polishing and maintenance of the myth that envelopes
a cultural icon.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the world of pop music, one sees similar treatment
accorded to Lennon's neighbor at the Dakota apartments, Leonard
Bernstein. Soon after Bernstein's death in 1990, his children and
his production company, Amberson, began arranging commemorative
concerts and documentaries, reissuing classic television
appearances and encouraging performances of newly published,
authoritative editions of his works. An official Web site and a
newsletter keep the world abreast of these developments.
</P>
<P>
   Many pop stars fare less well. Since the death of Elvis Presley
in 1977, RCA has reissued his recordings by the boxful, the Postal
Service has memorialized him on a stamp, and there have been
several books and documentaries, not all of them sympathetic. But
he left no legacy of self-defining interviews, and with no one
seeing to his posthumous image, he has become an amorphous figure _
an overdeveloped larynx attached to an increasingly dissolute body.
</P>
<P>
   On Lennon's behalf, Ms. Ono has projected a carefully defined
picture of a musician, peace campaigner, husband and father, a man
with a complex temperament and an equally complex sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   In her liner notes for the ``Anthology,'' in fact, Ms. Ono
begins with an almost novelistic physical description:
</P>
<P>
   ``In person, John was a much more attractive man than the one
you saw in photos and films. He had very fair, delicate skin and
soft, sandy hair with a touch of red in it when the light hit it a
certain way.'' Then, after describing the moles on his forehead,
the gracefulness with which he carried himself, and his personal
magnetism, she adds:
</P>
<P>
   ``His slumming, clowning and acting the entertainer was just a
kind of play acting he enjoyed. But it was obvious to anybody
around him that he was actually a very heavy dude: not a prince,
but a king.''
</P>
<P>
   This is hagiography, certainly; yet Ms. Ono pointedly avoids
making Lennon into a plaster saint. Even if she were so inclined,
his life was too thoroughly documented for that, and doubtless
Lennon would have loathed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   So her notes discuss bad times as well as good, and touch on his
angry, stubborn, indiscreet and remarkably inconsiderate sides. She
describes, for example, an incident in which Lennon had sex with
another woman at a party while Ms. Ono and the other guests waited
in the next room. Telling that story follows a principle of
myth-making that goes back to ancient times: an iconic figure's
flaws put his virtues in high relief.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, as popular culture icons go, Ms. Ono has plenty to work
with: Lennon's work with the Beatles guarantees him a constituency.
But it is Lennon's post-Beatles work that Ms. Ono is most
vigorously promoting, and the audience for that has always been
shakier, because the work itself was uneven.
</P>
<P>
   At its worst _ the batch of topical broadsides that made up the
``Sometime in New York City'' double album _ it is workaday and
expendable. Even Lennon regarded it that way.
</P>
<P>
   His best music, though, is incisive, abrasive and hard-hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the songs on his best albums, ``John Lennon/Plastic Ono
Band,'' ``Imagine'' and ``Double Fantasy,'' are also intensely
personal. It is not lost on Ms. Ono that for the personal songs to
live, listeners must remain curious about the circumstances that
led Lennon to write them. Hence the constant stoking of the Lennon
story: if either his music or myth were not constantly in the
public eye and ear, his post-Beatles music might fade into 1970s
oldiedom.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Ms. Ono has not opposed the use of Lennon's music
and image in advertisements, to the chagrin of Lennon's most ardent
and idealistic fans. Hearing him sing ``Revolution'' in a Nike ad
or seeing him portrayed, along with Einstein, Gandhi and Bob Dylan,
in Apple Computer's ``Think Different'' pantheon, serves a purpose
beyond the hawking of someone else's product.
</P>
<P>
   Lennon himself was a championship-level promoter of his work and
ideas. When world peace became his pet project, in 1969, he turned
his honeymoon with Ms. Ono into a Bed-In for Peace, news media
invited. To reporters who asked why, he said that since the news
media were reporting on his marriage anyway, he might as well use
the occasion to get his message out.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, he periodically promoted his albums with interviews
that were so expansive that several were published as books, in
question-answer form.
</P>
<P>
   Lennon's volubility on a range of issues, and his uncanny
ability to tap into the the spirit of the times made him a
spokesman for his generation. But his pronouncements and his
penchant for elaborate self-explanation have been equally useful in
death: however much has been written about him, his image is now
not radically different from what it was during his life.
</P>
<P>
   Still, images of the famous are rarely permanently fixed. As
time passes and biographers a generation or two removed take up the
story, the focus inevitably shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Ms. Ono is hardly the only shaper of Lennon's myth. A
raft of insiders has weighed in with books, among them Lennon's
sister (Julia Baird's ``John Lennon: My Brother''), his closest
childhood friend (Pete Shotten's ``John Lennon In My Life''), his
lover during an 18-month separation from Ms. Ono in the early 1970s
(May Pang's ``Loving John''), his tarot card reader (John Green's
``Dakota Days'') and two of his personal assistants (Anthony
Fawcett's ``One Day At a Time'' and Frederic Seaman's ``Last Days
of John Lennon'').
</P>
<P>
   Independent biographies have ranged from the scholarly (Jon
Wiener's ``Come Together'') and the respectfully balanced (Ray
Coleman's ``Lennon''), to the openly hostile (Albert Goldman's
``The Lives of John Lennon,'' which portrays Lennon as a violent,
musically inept junkie).
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the discussion of Lennon and his music on the
Internet in recent years, most readers touch on these extremes and
either reject one outright or create a dialectic of their own.

</P>
<P>
   In the 18 years since John Lennon was murdered, his widow, Yoko

FORT WORTH, Texas: most recent photograph. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Then Powell recruited the help of private investigator Gary
Cummings, who had been referred to her by the Chatham-Kent Police
Department in Ontario. She was broke, so Cummings allowed her to
set up a payment plan and started searching for Sal without any
money upfront.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings said he quickly found Sal and persuaded him to go to
Texas and meet his mom.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring his work was worthy of a little publicity, Cummings
contacted the local newspaper and pitched the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen Reunites with Mom,'' read the headline in the Chatham
Daily News. There, on page 6 of the Aug. 17 paper, was a picture of
the private eye and a teen-ager shaking hands with the town's
police chief. The photo was taken just before the trip to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Powell waited anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wanted to do was just take care of him and love him and
get him to stay in Texas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But when she saw the boy and a friend sitting at the gate, her
hopes sank.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was nice to meet me after all these years,'' Powell
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At her house, she tried to get the boy alone, hoping she could
somehow trick him into confessing that he was not Sal.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Powell dropped off the teens and an investigator
who had accompanied them in downtown Fort Worth, where they said
they wanted to hang out. While they were gone, she looked at the
boys' plane tickets: Neither had been issued to a Salvatore Moccia.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the investigator called to say that he and the
teens were cutting their trip short. Still, when the trio returned
for the boys' backpacks, Powell didn't confront them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have just told them right then and there, but I
didn't,'' she said. ``I don't know why I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Powell called Sal's school. Someone told her
they had seen the article _ and the picture _ in the local
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But the boy identified as Sal Moccia in the picture was actually
Dan Laflamme, 17, a friend of Sal's who had been kicked out of
school.
</P>
<P>
   Laflamme, who has a criminal history that includes armed
robbery, said that he and Sal had planned to go to Texas but that
Sal changed his mind the day before they were supposed to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Laflamme said Cummings asked him to step in for Sal. Powell
would never know the difference, Laflamme said he was told.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings offered $1,000 for the job, Laflamme said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan seemed easy enough, Laflamme said, and it included a
free trip to Texas. But as he waited at the gate for Powell to
arrive, Laflamme started getting nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking: `I don't want to do this. I want to go
home,''' Laflamme said.
</P>
<P>
   Laflamme, now a busboy and dishwasher at a Chinese restaurant,
said he hopes he can someday apologize to Powell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say that I didn't realize that it would affect her
like that,'' he said. ``I'm young. It just seemed like fun at
first.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cummings said it is he who has been conned. He
said Laflamme learned that he was looking for Sal and began posing
as Sal from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid him nothing,'' said Cummings, who says Powell owes him
$1,800 for his services. ``I am not happy with the fact this
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   After being reached by phone, Sal Moccia would not comment for
this article. Before he hung up, he said he does not want to see
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said she is convinced that her ex-husband has
``brainwashed'' Sal and said she won't give up trying to see him.
</P>
<P>
   She repeatedly calls the police chief, the Chatham newspaper,
Sal's school and her son. She has also called TV talk shows to see
whether any are interested in her story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want somebody to look at me and tell me they are
sorry,'' Powell said. ``It all started because I placed an ad for a
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gilbert, the vice principal at Sal's school, said Powell
should leave her son _ and any hope of a reunion _ alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's doing herself more harm than good.''

MITCH EXPLODES MYTHS ABOUT HURRICANES, SHOWS NEED TO RE-EVALUATE
WARNING SYSTEMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EDWARD HEGSTROM 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PESPIRE, Honduras _ With a major mountain range and 150 miles
lying between them and the Caribbean Sea, the people of this quaint
colonial village never thought they would be hit by Hurricane
Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rains carried by Mitch swelled the Pespire River and
swept away an entire neighborhood of 300 homes in the lower part of
town.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 people died in the hamlets that lie in the hills
outside town, where warnings of the storm couldn't get through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were too far away to have all this damage,''
said Pedro Martel, a native of Pespire, a town with tidy
cobblestone streets, adobe homes and a gleaming white church.
``We're close to the Pacific, not the Caribbean'' where Mitch
stalled for days just off the Honduras coast.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Pespire weren't the only ones caught off-guard. By
reaching at least 200 miles inland and wreaking havoc in the
mountains of southern Honduras and northern Nicaragua, Mitch
exploded a number of myths about hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom suggests that hurricanes do most of their
damage when heavy winds attack the coastline. But Mitch and a
number of other recent hurricanes show that storm systems can
sometimes be more deadly when heavy rains fall in mountains
hundreds of miles inland.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the devastation from Mitch, even some of the
world's top hurricane experts acknowledge they may need to
re-evaluate how they go about warning people of potential
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still a little anchored to this idea that the first
thing is to get people away from the coast,'' said Jerry Jarrell,
the director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for massive death in the highlands is ``probably
an issue that gets overlooked,'' he said, noting that after
watching the effect of Mitch he will begin think of possible
changes to the way the service warns about hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Mitch cause most of its damage after it had been
downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm, but it also killed
more than 4,000 people in neighboring Nicaragua, a country that
received little direct warning of the catastrophic flooding coming
its way. ``We didn't think it was going to come to Nicaragua,''
said Mauricio Rosales, the head of the Nicaraguan government's
meteorology department. ``They U.S. hurricane officials didn't warn
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell acknowledges that Nicaragua might not have received
enough attention. ``I'm not sure we did that much for them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one can say that the National Hurricane Center ignored
the potential for problems in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   While predicting that the storm would likely move northwest
toward Belize or Mexico, the service also gave ample warning about
possible problems in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   One early warning from Oct. 27 noted that heavy rains in the
mountains of Honduras and other parts of Central American ``could
cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, U.S. hurricane experts note that each nation has
responsibility to warn its own citizens, and weather experts within
the country need to study how a storm might affect their own
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things vary depending on the country,'' said Chris
Landsea, a hurricane researcher at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Association. ``The individual weather services need to
tailor their advisories based on their own terrain.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is funded entirely by U.S. taxpayers, the National
Hurricane Center provides storm-warning services to all of the
Caribbean and Latin America under an international system.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the world, Japan, Australia, India and other
countries share in paying for the monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell said the system was established under U.S. leadership
because other countries simply couldn't afford the sophisticated
satellites and airborne reconnaissance required to predict
hurricane movements.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is required to give the other countries
three-day forecasts of a storm's potential movements. When a
hurricane seems likely to hit, the U.S. advises that the target
country to issue a hurricane warning.
</P>
<P>
   The system generally works, but there are problems.
</P>
<P>
   Few people at the National Hurricane Center speak Spanish, and
the forecasters from Central America often do not speak English.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the hurricane center has trouble even making contact.
In one crucial period, hurricane center meteorologists were unable
to reach weather officials in Honduras for nine hours, according to
Jarrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we had trouble contacting them suggests they are
not very well equipped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Flores, the director of the Honduran National
Meteorological Service, denies that he was ever out of contact with
the hurricane experts in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the hurricane disaster response system is
based on a fairly basic principal: Predict where the storm will hit
and evacuate people from the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane center's warnings have worked remarkably well,
particularly in the case of Hurricane Andrew, which hit South
Florida in October of 1992. Evacuations from greater Miami probably
saved thousands of lives, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says that a hurricane is most deadly right
along the lowlands of the coast. The powerful winds at the center
of the tempest push the ocean forward into a bulge, causing the sea
level to rise by up to 15 feet _ a phenomenon known as a ``storm
surge.''
</P>
<P>
   When the storm surge hits the coast, lowland areas are entirely
submerged under the pounding surf and the driving wind, a lethal
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Most the deaths in the more powerful hurricanes, such as the one
that devastated Galveston in 1900, occur when the storm surge hits
the coast.
</P>
<P>
   But the traditional system of evacuating the coastline is not
enough in the Caribbean and Central America, where rugged mountains
rise almost at the edge of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   When hurricanes collide against those mountains, heavy rains can
cause catastrophes hundreds of miles from the storm center. Even
the way scientists measure the strength of a hurricane can be
deceptive when it comes to predicting impacts in the Caribbean
basin.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of a storm is measured by its winds, a crucial
factor in lowland areas like Florida. But the system doesn't
measure the potential for rain, which is the key factor in
mountainous regions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most deadly storms in recent Caribbean history were
not ranked as particularly strong tempests by the hurricane
center's measurement system.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell offers the example of Hurricane Gordon, a relatively
minor storm that hit Haiti in 1994. Yet the storm took 1,500 lives
in the highlands of the country.
</P>
<P>
   A minor tropical storm moved in to southernmost Mexico just last
summer. The storm caused little fuss until it passed over the
mountains of Chiapas, causing floods that killed more than 200
people.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch is the deadliest recent example by far. At one
point, the storm ranked as class 5 hurricane on a scale of 1 to 5.
Though the storm hovered off Honduras, the National Hurricane
Center predicted that it was likely to move northwest, hitting
Belize or Yucatan.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the storm camped along the coast off Honduras, where it
lost most of the force of its winds. Much of the damage came from
flooding and mudslides after the downgraded storm moved slowly over
the mountains. Mitch's track meandered into El Salvador and
Guatemala before circling once again over the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the damage in Honduras and Nicaragua was caused
by rain rather than wind. In some parts of mountainous Honduras,
the storm dumped more than 20 inches of rain in six hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that when the storm started to weaken, people put
their guard down,'' said Jarrell.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that his office warned Honduran officials to stay
alert. By the time the storm reached southern Honduras, local
political leaders only had limited time to warn the people.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Pespire, officials heard radio reports of impending
floods and evacuated the lower part of town before the river swept
away the homes.
</P>
<P>
   But in other parts, people weren't quite so lucky. A few miles
upstream in the hamlet of La Rampa, the people only learned of the
flooding by watching the river rise.
</P>
<P>
   When the river swelled up over its banks in a matter of a few
hours on Oct. 30, the people ran out of their homes and headed for
the hills, with no protection from the pouring rains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't take anything out of our homes,'' said Fredy
Ortez, who lived in one of 30 homes swept away. ``There wasn't
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river left us poor.'' &QL;

 &HT;    DRUG COURTS REDUCE RE-ARREST RATES, STUDIES SAY
 &HT;    525 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drug-use intervention initiatives in which arrested
offenders are ``coerced'' or guided into treatment programs
significantly reduce re-arrest rates, according to a series of
studies released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Drug arrests in America more than doubled between 1980 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Studies commissioned by an organization known as Physician
Leadership on National Drug Policy concluded that ``drug courts''
and structured treatment programs for prison inmates, teen-age
offenders and parolees dramatically reduce prison recidivism and
drug-abuse relapses.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation-funded organization is made up of 37 physicians,
including former Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
of Atlanta, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David
Kessler and Antonia Novello, surgeon general during the Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This field is in an evolving stage,'' said Lonnie Bristow,
vice chair of the physicians' group and a former president of the
American Medical Association. ``We need more serious research and
ongoing evaluations of existing programs to determine which
programs work best for whom and how to sustain them.''
</P>
<P>
   The studies were conducted by researchers from universities and
private study institutes, including Columbia University in New
York, Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, the Rand Corp. and
the University of California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers presented results of the commissioned studies at a
daylong meeting Tuesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   TCU researchers D. Dwayne Simpson and Kevin Knight said a
comparison of former prison inmates enrolled in long-term
residential treatment centers showed drug-use rates declined by 67
percent for cocaine users, 65 percent among heroin users and 53
percent among heavy drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and Knight also concluded that 27 percent of former
inmates who complete the ``after-care'' programs are arrested
again, compared with more than 75 percent of formerly incarcerated
drug offenders who receive no treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A Rand Corp. study of drug courts in Multnomah County, Calif.,
concluded the alternative courts produced savings of $10.2 million
in avoided criminal justice system expenses, theft reduction,
public assistance and medical claims.
</P>
<P>
   The ``drug court'' concept, in which defenders, prosecutors and
judges work together to coerce offenders into treatment programs,
has spread rapidly in recent years as local and state governments
search for ways to reduce the cost of dealing with drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that, when drug treatment is available in the
criminal justice system, it works,'' said David C. Lewis, director
of the Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies at Brown University
in Rhode Island and project director of the physicians' group.
``The bad news is that it's usually not available.''
</P>
<P>
   Physician Leadership on National Drug Policy is funded by the
John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation. It is chaired by June Osborn, president of the
Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation and former chair of the National AIDS
Commission during the Bush administration.

 &HT;    INTEL WITNESSES DIVIDE ON MICROSOFT'S MOTIVES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two senior Intel Corp. executives differed sharply
Tuesday at the Microsoft antitrust trial on whether the software
giant had misused its monopoly power to shut down Intel's own
software venture.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Intel Corp. Vice President Steven
McGeady said, ``We had a fear that if we revealed our (software)
program too early to them, Microsoft would bad-mouth the project to
(computer makers). The fear we had was ultimately realized when
they stomped it out of existence.''
</P>
<P>
   McGeady was referring to native signal processing, or NSP, which
Intel had developed to speed up multimedia displays on personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft attorneys sought to undermine McGeady's testimony
by showing a pre-trial videotape from his boss, Ron Whittier.
</P>
<P>
   NSP was scrubbed in the summer of 1995, Whittier said, primarily
because Microsoft was ready to release Windows 95 and NSP could
then only improve Windows 3.1, the previous operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is important because the government is seeking to show
that Microsoft Corp. has behaved in a predatory way toward many
high-tech companies, including Intel, the world's foremost producer
of microprocessors, the digital brain of all personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Microsoft sought to portray Intel as the bad actor and
Microsoft as the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it not a common pattern, Mr. McGeady, for Intel to deny
technology to companies it seeks to punish?'' boomed Microsoft
lawyer Steven Holly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' McGeady shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Holly: ``If you did that to Microsoft you would be shooting
yourself in the foot?''
</P>
<P>
   McGeady: ``That would be one characterization.''
</P>
<P>
   As McGeady saw it, ``we had some help from Microsoft as to what
our best interests were.'' Citing the taped testimony by Whittier,
the government's witness said: ``The emphasis he gives it is PR
spin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At his deposition?'' Holly asked incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' McGeady replied.
</P>
<P>
   McGeady also cited Intel founder Andy Grove, who said two years
ago that Intel had bowed to Microsoft's industry power when it
decided in 1995 to abandon work on NSP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have much of choice. We basically caved,'' Grove
told Fortune magazine in July 1996 during a joint interview with
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. ``We caved. Introducing a
Windows-based software initiative that Microsoft doesn't support
well, life is too short for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In its dealings with Intel, Microsoft would typically pledge in
vague terms to incorporate the chip maker's latest innovations _
but only for software releases still far down the road, McGeady
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's strategy, McGeady amounted to ``I'll pay you
tomorrow for a hamburger today.''
</P>
<P>
   Not content with scuttling NSP, Microsoft also wanted to
``Balkanize'' the World Wide Web so that competitors' browsers
would no longer be able to view all Web pages, McGeady held.
</P>
<P>
   In his handwritten notes, he quoted top Microsoft officials as
saying at a 1995 meeting that they planned to use their clout to
``kill'' the universal Web language, known as HTML, by extending it
in a proprietary way, thereby undermining the Internet's basic
page-viewing technology.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's trial testimony also showed Gates to be a poor legal
prognosticator, telling Intel executives in 1995 that ``this
antitrust thing will blow over,'' and adding: ``we haven't changed
our business practices at all.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gates also said that he might change his company's policy
on how often internal e-mail was destroyed, company policy was
never changed, allowing the government to harvest more than 2
million pages of documents to help make its current case.

   Yvette Weilacker sits in the kitchen of a small house in
Buffalo, N.Y., waiting for the contractions to begin. Her baby,
already named Nicholas Lee by his anxious parents, was due days
ago, and he shows scant signs of being ready to be born.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting is all the more tense because the kitchen she waits
in is not hers, and the baby she waits for is in another woman's
body. Kim Elniskey and her fiance, Jorge Rosario, have chosen Mrs.
Weilacker and husband, Paul, to adopt their son and the two
families have gotten to know each other well these past few months,
by telephone, letter and now in person as the birth nears.
</P>
<P>
   Since she flew in from her home in Riverside, Calif., four weeks
earlier, Mrs. Weilacker has been staying with Ms. Elniskey and
Rosario and helping care for their three other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to feel that this is your baby, your family,'' Ms.
Elniskey told Mrs. Weilacker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey has kept the Weilackers involved throughout her
pregnancy, sharing ultrasound pictures and updates about the baby's
intra-uterine acrobatics. ``Your son kicked me a lot today,'' Ms.
Elniskey reported in one of many telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The Weilackers have promised that they will be just as open as
Nicholas grows: what he wears on his first Halloween, when he loses
his first tooth and learns to read. When the boy is ready, Ms.
Elniskey and Rosario plan to visit him.
</P>
<P>
   The intimacy between these two families would have been rare
just a few years ago and unthinkable a generation ago. But such
open contact between adoptive parents and biological parents is one
of the many ways that adoption has evolved from a secretive, closed
process weighed down by dark stigmas and painful misconceptions
into an infinitely more transparent experience.
</P>
<P>
   How many children are adopted each year is an elusive number,
since no one keeps complete statistics. The most recent data, from
1992, show 127,441 children adopted that year, a slight increase
from 118,000 five years earlier. About 42 percent of those
adoptions were by stepparents and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The most sought-after children for adoption are, as they have
been for generations, domestic white infants _ known among parents
and professionals in the adoption loop as DWI's _ but those babies
are scarcer because of the easier availability of birth control,
the legalization of abortion and the growing acceptance of single
mothers raising children alone. Experts estimate that there are
fewer than 20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the biggest increase in adoptions has been children
adopted from other countries. Because they require visas, there are
up-to-date statistics for these adoptions and since 1990, their
numbers have nearly doubled, to 13,620 in 1997 from 7,093. So while
the overall increase in the number of children adopted has been
subtle, the increase in visibility has been dramatic, enhanced by
those children adopted from other countries whose physical
differences from their parents make their adoption an obvious fact.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, adoption has gone public in much the same
manner that divorce did in the 1970s. Increasingly children are
told, even before they can fully understand, how they came to their
families and that story is shared with relatives, friends,
teachers, sometimes even strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My birth mother gave me this doll,'' Sasha Saidman, a
6-year-old who was adopted, told a clerk at the video store near
her home in Wheaton, Md., as her family prepared for a visit from
the woman who had borne her. Like most adopted children, Sasha used
the term that has replaced such loaded phrases as ``real mother''
and ``natural mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Where once children hid their adoption from friends, if they
even knew of it, adopted children today can belong to play groups
made up entirely of adopted children. They can buy storybooks about
being adopted, go to summer camps for children adopted from
particular foreign countries, and if they face emotional
difficulties, get treated by a therapist who specializes in
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, like New York, San Francisco and Boston,
playgrounds are peppered with parents of various races and
nationalities chasing children of other races. Many of those
families are headed by single people, people in their '40s or older
and gay people, men and women who, in years past, would have been
rejected as unsuitable adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Once the ``other'' option for becoming parents, adoption is now
one of many ways that men and women create families. The panorama
of the American family now includes children born through advanced
reproductive technology, some conceived with donated sperm and
eggs; families broken apart by divorce then blended through
remarriage; families created by single parents and by gay men who
have hired a surrogate to bear a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing an explosion of different family forms which
make adoption seem downright mainstream and conservative,'' said
Madelyn Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B. Donaldson
Adoption Institute, a research group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, the media have focused on global dramas
highlighting the plight of children needing homes: Chinese girls
abandoned in markets by parents encumbered by the country's
one-child policy and its preference for boys; Romanian children
orphaned by revolution or left in understaffed institutions by
their impoverished parents; Russian children stranded in dismal
state orphanages, in a society that widely stigmatizes adoption.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, it became a kind of social phenomenon to adopt a
child from abroad. Last summer, Vanity Fair magazine quipped that a
Chinese baby was the season's hot accessory in the Hamptons. The
experience, however, is not limited to wealthy neighborhoods.
Suburban American and rural towns are also home to children adopted
from Shanghai, Murmansk, Guatemala City, Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
   Many people turning to international adoption, and indeed
adoption in general, are baby boomers who put off starting
families, then confronted infertility problems and finally opted
out of the world of assisted reproductive technology that many call
the ``Ovarian Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Further raising the profile are the celebrities who have spoken
happily about being adoptive parents, including: Nicole Kidman and
her husband, Tom Cruise; Rosie O'Donnell, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who
wrote a popular children's book on the subject, ``Tell Me Again
About the Night I Was Born.''
</P>
<P>
   In bookstores, that book shares shelf space with an expanding
selection of adoption-related titles from large publishers and from
niche publishers like R-Squared Press in Ann Arbor, Mich., a small
family-run business that focuses on adoption.

 &HT;    INTEL WITNESSES DIVIDE ON MICROSOFT'S MOTIVES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two senior Intel Corp. executives differed sharply
Tuesday at the Microsoft antitrust trial on whether the software
giant had misused its monopoly power to shut down Intel's own
software venture.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Intel Corp. Vice President Steven
McGeady said, ``We had a fear that if we revealed our (software)
program too early to them, Microsoft would bad-mouth the project to
(computer makers). The fear we had was ultimately realized when
they stomped it out of existence.''
</P>
<P>
   McGeady was referring to native signal processing, or NSP, which
Intel had developed to speed up multimedia displays on personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft attorneys sought to undermine McGeady's testimony
by showing a pre-trial videotape from his boss, Ron Whittier.
</P>
<P>
   NSP was scrubbed in the summer of 1995, Whittier said, primarily
because Microsoft was ready to release Windows 95 and NSP could
then only improve Windows 3.1, the previous operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is important because the government is seeking to show
that Microsoft Corp. has behaved in a predatory way toward many
high-tech companies, including Intel, the world's foremost producer
of microprocessors, the digital brain of all personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Microsoft sought to portray Intel as the bad actor and
Microsoft as the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it not a common pattern, Mr. McGeady, for Intel to deny
technology to companies it seeks to punish?'' boomed Microsoft
lawyer Steven Holly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' McGeady shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Holly: ``If you did that to Microsoft you would be shooting
yourself in the foot?''
</P>
<P>
   McGeady: ``That would be one characterization.''
</P>
<P>
   As McGeady saw it, ``we had some help from Microsoft as to what
our best interests were.'' Citing the taped testimony by Whittier,
the government's witness said: ``The emphasis he gives it is PR
spin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At his deposition?'' Holly asked incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' McGeady replied.
</P>
<P>
   McGeady also cited Intel founder Andy Grove, who said two years
ago that Intel had bowed to Microsoft's industry power when it
decided in 1995 to abandon work on NSP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have much of choice. We basically caved,'' Grove
told Fortune magazine in July 1996 during a joint interview with
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. ``We caved. Introducing a
Windows-based software initiative that Microsoft doesn't support
well, life is too short for that.''
</P>
<P>
   In its dealings with Intel, Microsoft would typically pledge in
vague terms to incorporate the chip maker's latest innovations _
but only for software releases still far down the road, McGeady
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's strategy, McGeady amounted to ``I'll pay you
tomorrow for a hamburger today.''
</P>
<P>
   Not content with scuttling NSP, Microsoft also wanted to
``Balkanize'' the World Wide Web so that competitors' browsers
would no longer be able to view all Web pages, McGeady held.
</P>
<P>
   In his handwritten notes, he quoted top Microsoft officials as
saying at a 1995 meeting that they planned to use their clout to
``kill'' the universal Web language, known as HTML, by extending it
in a proprietary way, thereby undermining the Internet's basic
page-viewing technology.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's trial testimony also showed Gates to be a poor legal
prognosticator, telling Intel executives in 1995 that ``this
antitrust thing will blow over,'' and adding: ``we haven't changed
our business practices at all.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gates also said that he might change his company's policy
on how often internal e-mail was destroyed, company policy was
never changed, allowing the government to harvest more than 2
million pages of documents to help make its current case.

 UNDATED: on adoption.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Tacoma, Wash., Gloria Finkbeiner, an adoptive sister, aunt
and grandmother, started a mail-order card and gift business called
Adoption Option with her daughter, Susan Pierce, who adopted three
children out of foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are, adoption isn't unique,'' said Mrs. Finkbeiner.
``It's just a way to be a family.''
</P>
<P>
   The Evolution:
</P>
<P>
   Rules on Privacy
</P>
<P>
   Led to Secrecy
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most profound change in the process of adoption is
the growth of the kind of open adoption that brought Nicholas to
his parents, the Weilackers.
</P>
<P>
   Before World War I, it was common for friends and relatives to
raise the child of someone they knew and for the biological parents
to be in touch with their children. But as the century progressed,
adoptive parents were paired with babies, mainly by doctors,
lawyers and social workers, most of whom sought a match of physical
traits that would allow parents and children to pass as a ``real
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The institutionalization, and the secrecy and the stigma, of
adoption were deepened after World War II by state laws requiring
that records to the event be sealed and new birth certificates
issued, listing the adoptive parents in place of the biological
ones. E. Wayne Carp, a professor at Pacific Lutheran University,
writes in his book ``Family Matters: Secrecy and Disclosure in the
History of Adoption,'' that initially, such confidentiality was
intended to protect those involved in an adoption from outside
scrutiny, but it later evolved into a way to keep all parties to an
adoption from one another.
</P>
<P>
   That change dovetailed with a postwar emphasis on the nuclear
family. In the 1950s, motherhood was glorified. For those unable to
conceive on their own, adoption was a blessing, one often kept
secret to mimic the wished-for idyll.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, social workers seized on a postwar embrace of
psychoanalytic theories _ which tended to view unmarried mothers as
disturbed, adoptees seeking information about their roots as
neurotic, and infertile people as unstable _ as a rationale for
keeping adoptive families and biological families apart.
</P>
<P>
   In that atmosphere, nobody imagined that adopting parents would
ever live with the expectant family in the final days of the
pregnancy, waiting for the contractions that would signal the
beginning of their new families.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are going through together blows me away,'' Mrs.
Weilacker said, soon after she arrived in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   But as the wait dragged on, drawn out by a doctor's inaccurate
calculating of Ms. Elniskey's due date, both women grew tense.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Weilacker, a court stenographer, was also anxious about
transcripts she needed to finish. Reluctantly, she returned to
California until the birth seemed more imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel a little lonely,'' Ms. Elniskey said. ``I thought
we'd stick this out together and now Yvette gets to get away for a
while and I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in California, there seemed no relief. ``It's all I think
about,'' Mrs. Weilacker said. ``I love Kim and Jorge and their
kids. It was just all getting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   A New Approach:
</P>
<P>
   Easing the Curiosity
</P>
<P>
   And Guilt in Adoption
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics on how many people build families
through open adoption, no way to know how many birth parents select
the people they want to rear their child, get to know them and then
stay in some sort of contact _ from regular visits to occasional
phone calls or letters _ after the baby is legally and emotionally
the other family's child. But people in the field say the trend of
open adoption is growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Human Services in Traverse City, Mich., a rural area in
the northern part of the state, was one of the first agencies to
arrange open adoptions. Since 1980, the agency has handled close to
500 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stereotype from 20 years ago was that birth parents were
wild and reckless people from the other side of the tracks,'' said
Jim Gritter, a child welfare supervisor at the agency. ``But what
we found was that that viewpoint was 180 degrees from reality. So
many birth mothers talked about feeling that they were abandoning
their babies because the closed system basically asked of them to
abandon them.''
</P>
<P>
   Social workers at the agency decided that the only way to soothe
birth parents' guilt was to let them choose families for their
children. The social workers were motivated in part by stories they
had heard of adoptees searching for their birth parents. If
children yearned to know about their roots, and birth parents
longed to know who became the parents of their children, the agency
social workers figured that it made sense to make adoption a
collaborative experience.
</P>
<P>
   It was a logical time to try to coax adoption out of the
shadows. By the late 1970s, with the rise of the sexual revolution
and the women's rights movement, many in society were rejecting a
range of paternalistic institutions. Although in many places a
child born to unwed parents would still face scorn, in many places
he would not.
</P>
<P>
   The Traverse City social workers devised a plan in which they
asked prospective adoptive parents to put together a letter about
themselves with a picture and other information to be shown to
pregnant women, who would choose among them.
</P>
<P>
   Gritter and his colleagues have since taken the concept one step
further. In nearly all cases, the children handled by their agency
are born of parents in the region and adopted by parents in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same to be pen pals as it is to be part of a
clan,'' Gritter said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that open adoption is always a good option,
particularly workers at agencies whose birth mothers come from
cultures that still regard out-of-wedlock births with shame. In
addition, many parents who have adopted internationally say that
one reason they chose that route was to avoid being involved with a
birth family.
</P>
<P>
   Because the practice is still so new, researchers are only now
studying how these open relationships are working: Will a child be
hurt if a birth parent starts out involved but then withdraws? How
will a child feel if the woman who bore him has another child but
decides she can raise this one? And what if there is a falling out
between the birth parents and the adoptive parents?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people pressured into openness that
might not be in their best interest,'' said Beth Parsons, executive
director of El Paso Adoption Services. The agency places about 25
children a year, roughly 70 percent of them children of Hispanic
mothers, many of whom conceal their pregnancies from relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk to birth mothers about what their options are, but
many do not feel emotionally ready for an open adoption,'' Ms.
Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the pregnant women choose parents themselves
from among the agency's files, most people who adopt through the El
Paso agency do not learn that they have a child until
relinquishment papers are signed, which cannot be done in Texas
until at least 48 hours after the birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the mothers to make their decisions without the
pressure of an adoptive family waiting outside the delivery room
door,'' Ms. Parsons said. She said she also wanted to protect
adopting parents from becoming attached to a woman and her unborn
baby in case the mother changes her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Parsons said, the move toward openness is positive
and she urges all birth mothers to give photographs, letters or
some memento to their child, a change from when the agency first
opened in 1990.

 UNDATED: in 1990.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most experts agree that the open adoption process has helped to
transform the experience of adoption even for those with more
traditional arrangements. Today, the majority of people who adopt
know something about their children's backgrounds. Even if they do
not stay in regular contact, they frequently have detailed medical
histories, photographs of biological relatives, and letters and
gifts for the children from the women who bore them.
</P>
<P>
   This information, experts say, can help children to understand
better the decisions leading to their adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most frustrating things for me growing up was not
knowing my background,'' said David Wilson, a 31-year-old
telecommunications consultant who several years ago found and met
his birth parents. ``I'm cautious about saying that having an open,
ongoing relationship with them when I was growing up would have
been good. That could create conflict or blur lines. But just
knowing who they were and why they made their choices would have
taken away an unnecessary mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest shifts in adoption in recent years is this
emergence of birth mothers from the shroud of shame and dependence
that kept them from having any role in shaping their children's
futures. In fact, most parents who adopt domestically today _
whether in totally open adoptions or more closed ones _ engage in a
kind of courtship of birth mothers, preparing often elaborate
albums and letters aimed at persuading pregnant women to entrust
their unborn children to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see things through the eyes of this child,'' the
Weilackers wrote in their ``Dear Birth Mother'' letter.
</P>
<P>
   The Weilackers, who are both 39 and had endured several years of
unsuccessful infertility treatments, placed their letter in the
files of the Independent Adoption Center in Pleasant Hill, Calif.
It was forwarded, among dozens of others, to Ms. Elniskey,
prompting her to call the Weilackers on a toll-free line they had
set up in the hopes of receiving just such a call.
</P>
<P>
   Before she called the center, Ms. Elniskey said that she did not
even know such an arrangement was possible. The world of adoption,
she said, was vastly different than it was eight years ago, when
she was 18, in high school and pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wasn't ready to be a mother; I couldn't do it,'' Ms.
Elniskey, a 26-year-old homemaker, said of her first pregnancy.
``After I gave birth, my sister Judy took the baby home and cared
for her. I named her Alyssa. My obstetrician found the couple. She
was a patient of his. I wanted to know about them, who they were
and all. But I didn't know I could ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience, she said, left her heartbroken. Even now she
will scan a crowd, looking at girls around Alyssa's age, wondering,
``Is that my hair? My nose? Could this be her?''
</P>
<P>
   When she found herself last winter with three small children and
pregnant again, despite having had an injection of Depo-Provera
that was supposed to prevent pregnancy for several months, Ms.
Elniskey said she panicked. She and Rosario, who is 30 years old
and works in a factory making roll-up doors for trucks, agreed that
they could not cope with another child.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey said she knew she could never go blindly into
another adoption. But she never imagined the power she had to
influence her baby's future and to remain a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to have his own life with them,'' Ms. Elniskey
said. ``I don't want to be in their way. But I want to know what's
going on. When he's old enough, he can come to me and ask what he
wants. But I want him to never have to wonder why I made this plan
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He never will,'' Mrs. Weilacker assured.
</P>
<P>
   Battling Ignorance:
</P>
<P>
   Hurtful Words, Even
</P>
<P>
   By the Well-Meaning
</P>
<P>
   Despite these radically changed attitudes toward adoption,
parents and adoption professionals said that Nicholas can expect to
be asked by his friends and others why his ``real'' mother ``gave
him away.'' Even in the most cosmopolitan and adoption-saturated
cities, like New York, people still say callous things to adoptive
families.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of a girl adopted from Korea said that the first week
she strolled with her daughter in Central Park, strangers
approached her and said: ``Oh, she'll be great at math!''
``Couldn't you have one of your own?'' ``Does she speak Chinese?''
</P>
<P>
   Ronny Diamond, director of post-adoption services at the
Spence-Chapin adoption agency in Manhattan, said that attitudes
toward adoption were similar in some ways to racial prejudice. ``If
you ask people if they are prejudiced, they would say, `No,''' Ms.
Diamond said. ``But if you put forth a scenario, the bias emerges.
For example, a teacher gets a class list and sees that three boys
are adopted. Often, they'll say, `This is trouble. This will be a
tough year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spence-Chapin offers advice to help teachers and administrators
focus on how they talk about adoption, the language they use and
the assignments they make.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent workshop, teachers were surprised at how clumsy they
had been in dealing with the issue and how easy it was to readjust.
Administrators at the school agreed to have a reporter present on
condition that the school not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Diamond began by handing out a glossary showing the common
ways people talk about adoption and the more positive alternatives.
For example, instead of saying that a birth parent ``gave a child
away,'' it is better to say she ``made an adoption plan,''
reflecting the thought that goes into such a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important shifts in language is to say that a
child ``was'' adopted, rather than ``is'' adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being adopted is an action that happens once and then you are
someone's child,'' Ms. Diamond said.
</P>
<P>
   She also cautioned teachers against trying to comfort adopted
children by telling them that they were ``chosen.'' ``Think about
it,'' Ms. Diamond suggested. ``What is the opposite of chosen?
Rejected. To be chosen, a child might think he had to have been
rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, she went on, most adopted children are not chosen.
Implying that they are makes it seem like their parents walked down
a row of children in a pediatric supermarket and selected the
choicest offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adoption is not better,'' Ms. Diamond told the teachers.
``It's just not worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Changing Family:
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the Mold
</P>
<P>
   Of a Traditional Home
</P>
<P>
   Diana Galligan, nearly 7, knows what adoption means. ``It's when
people who love you take care of you and become your parents,'' she
says, quietly poised.
</P>
<P>
   And she will tell you that in her case, those people who love
her and take care of her are her ``guys,'' her dad, John Galligan,
and her pop, Richard Koonce.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuckahoe Elementary School in Arlington, Va., Diana is one of
many adopted children, although her fathers think she is the only
one there who is being raised by openly gay parents. And even
though Galligan and Koonce are far more concerned with helping
their daughter learn to read and to express herself freely, they
are acutely aware that families like theirs are a symbol of ``the
new American family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In previous generations, one of the most difficult notions for
many gay men coming out was putting aside the idea of having a
family,'' said Galligan, 39, who works for the U.S. Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Galligan said that he knew he wanted to be a father ever since
he worked as a college volunteer in a Big Brother program. Several
years ago, Galligan, said, although he had no partner at the time,
he decided that ``the time was right; I wanted to be a father.''

 UNDATED: a father.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was trying to figure out how to go about adopting, when a
woman he knew with two older children told him that she was
pregnant and was willing to have him adopt the baby. Their
arrangement is open, and Diana visits her birth mother every summer
and calls her when she feels like it.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have sensed disapproval and worse from strangers,
Galligan and Koonce said they have never faced prejudice from
neighbors or teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But both men lamented that many religious and political
institutions were still hostile. Although Galligan adopted Diana,
Koonce is legally only Diana's guardian in case something happens
to Galligan. He has yet to formally adopt her, they said, because
Virginia courts would not allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Many states let single people adopt without their sexual
orientation being an issue. Some states allow one gay person to
adopt, then later and separately the other partner. But about half
the states do not allow a second parent of the same sex to adopt a
child, even at a later time. And in Florida and New Hampshire, it
is nearly impossible for homosexuals to adopt at all.
</P>
<P>
   Koonce and Galligan said that they thought such resistance to
adoptions by gay people would eventually wither.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society is on the edge of creating a lot of new models for
work, family and community,'' said Koonce, 44, who owns his own
career counseling business. ``I look at myself. I have a
nontraditional model of work that's a far cry from what my father
did, working for the big company. I have what many people would
consider a nontraditional family, although we see ourselves as very
conservative and mainstream. I walk Diana to school; John picks her
up. On Teacher Appreciation Day, there I was with all the moms,
bringing a tossed salad.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when Kathryn Creedy is stitching badges on a Brownie
sash or searching under a couch for a magic marker cap, she pauses
and reminds herself that, as real as being a mother feels to her, a
generation ago, she and her daughters _ Alexis, who is 8, and
Brooks, 5 _ would also likely not have become a family. Ms. Creedy
is a single woman.
</P>
<P>
   As the American family has assumed new forms, adoption agencies
have begun to look beyond stereotypes to find parents. Some
countries, it turned out, actually favored older parents and single
parents, reasoning that children would have such parents' full
focus. Single parents were also more willing to adopt older
children or children with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Ms. Creedy, a media specialist for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Washington, decided that, then 39 and unmarried,
the biggest regret in her life was that she was not a mother.
Initially, she tried to adopt a child out of foster care, but she
was turned down because she was single.
</P>
<P>
   She signed up with a private adoption agency near her home in
Alexandria, Va. While preparing to adopt a child from Guatemala,
news reports coming out of Eastern Europe pushed her to fly to
Rumania. After seven grueling weeks of scouring the bureaucracies
there, she returned home at last with a feisty 14-month-old girl
with laughing eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's birth mother was desperate for her child to climb out
of the poverty engulfing the family. ``She would take Alexis and
point to me and say, `Mama, America,''' Ms. Creedy recalled. ``It
was so profound. We didn't speak the same language, but it was
clear she was saying to me, `You are the one I trust to be my
child's mother.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Ms. Creedy flew to Bolivia to adopt a
5-month-old girl, whose onyx hair and tawny skin set her apart from
her golden-haired, fair-skinned sister, and from her mother, who
describes herself as having ``turkey white skin.'' And yet,
together they are a family in every way: loving, argumentative,
affectionate.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' roots are a vibrant part of their identities. Each
year, each girl celebrates her ``Gotcha Day,'' the day she became a
part of the family. The day begins with the reading of ``life
books'' that Ms. Creedy prepared for each, with pictures, maps and
the tale of how their family came to be.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis' book, which she now proudly reads herself, begins,
``Once upon a time there was a woman, who dreamed of having a baby
girl of her own to give her all the love she had stored up over her
lifetime. Her name was Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mothers' View:
</P>
<P>
   Finding That People
</P>
<P>
   Seldom Understand
</P>
<P>
   Even as adoptive parents and their children feel less isolated
and stigmatized, birth parents say they continue to endure
society's disapproving glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was pregnant, people were shocked and disgusted by my
plans, not that I was pregnant and unmarried but that I was making
an adoption plan,'' said Lisa Nicholson, a 28-year-old woman from
Richmond, Va., who four years ago chose a family to adopt her
daughter. ``My family and friends understood, but strangers who
knew nothing about me or my circumstances would say, `How could
you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she said, when she hears people talking about how
irresponsible birth parents are, she cannot help revealing herself.
``Usually, I really surprise them, because, to meet me, I'm the
girl next door,'' said Ms. Nicholson, who married last year and
hopes to start a family. ``I explain to them why it's a responsible
decision. It's not easier, it's harder.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Nicholson corresponds with and occasionally speaks to
the couple who adopted her daughter, she has often feared that
disapproval and ignorance among the couple's friends and relatives
would drive them away from her.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Saidman, who has a warm and open relationship with Linda
Dooley, the birth mother of her daughter, Sasha, said that
prejudices in society lingered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been this image in the popular consciousness that
birth parents are these selfish, uncaring people who don't even
think twice about giving up their kids and yet, paradoxically, that
they are these evil people lurking in the shadows who are going to
come and snatch these children back,'' said Mrs. Saidman, 49, a
writer and management consultant. ``But it's just fear and
ignorance speaking. Linda is part of our lives, part of our family.
But I am Sasha's mother.''
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate Sasha's 6th birthday this August, Mrs. Saidman and
her husband, Perry, a 52-year-old design patent lawyer, invited Ms.
Dooley and her 22-year-old daughter, Keira, to drive up from their
home in Florida and stay with the family in their house in Wheaton,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third time the extended clan had gotten together
since Sasha's birth. In between, there were e-mail exchanges,
letters, phone calls and a vacation in the Bahamas that Keira, a
college student, took with the Saidmans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing for me is that Sasha is a great kid,
she has wonderful parents and she will never have to have any
self-doubts because any questions she has, she can ask me or she
can ask Susan,'' said Ms. Dooley, 42. ``The hardest part has been
when people who barely know me belittle me and my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying Goodbye:
</P>
<P>
   Decision May Be Best,
</P>
<P>
   But Deed Is Not Easy
</P>
<P>
   The day Nicholas was born, on a warm, late September Sunday, Kim
Elniskey wrote him a letter as he rested beside her in a bassinet
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Weilacker was scrambling to get on a plane to Buffalo.
Rosario was at home with the children. ``I needed to make sure that
you would always be healthy, safe, happy and most of all LOVED more
than could humanly have been possible,'' Ms. Elniskey wrote. ``And
in order for all those things to go together as one, Jorge and I
had to make THE HARDEST DECISION OF OUR LIVES, and that was to find
you a mommy and daddy that would do all those things for you.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Weilacker arrived, the two women stayed together in
the hospital room and tended to Nicholas, confusing nurses about
who his mother was. One even tried to take Mrs. Weilacker's
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey showed Mrs. Weilacker how to change his diaper, how
to tap his back gently to bring up air after a feeding.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Nicholas' birth, Mrs. Weilacker spent time alone
with him in the hospital, when Ms. Elniskey had tubal ligation
surgery. After checking out, Mrs. Weilacker settled into a hotel
with Nicholas, while Ms. Elniskey returned home to her family.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the week, they shuttled between the apartment
and the hotel. Jake, Miranda and Serena cooed over Nicholas.
Rosario kept his distance. Ms. Elniskey seemed always on the verge
of tears. And yet, when her children clambered about her and
Nicholas would begin to cry, she said that she was relieved and
sure of her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mrs. Weilacker, Ms. Elniskey and Rosario boarded a
plane to Los Angeles, where Nicholas met his father and the
adoption papers were signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas has to get on with his life and we have to move on
with ours,'' Ms. Elniskey said. ``At least our lives won't be
entirely separate, but I really can't imagine how it will all be in
a month or a year from now.''

PFIZER SAYS DRUG CAN HALT DISEASE THAT BLINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A major US pharmaceutical manufacturer and a New York foundation
Tuesday initiated a $66 million effort to attack a bacterial
disease virtually unheard of in developed countries that has left
nearly 6 million Third World residents blind and 146 million others
infected.
</P>
<P>
   A one-gram dose of an antibiotic called Zithromax given just
once a year can treat the disease, trachoma, an infection of the
upper eyelid caused by the chlamydia bacterium. People infected
develop painful, running sores on their eyelids that leave crusty
deposits on the eyelashes that, over time, scratch away their
corneas and leave them blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having sand in your eye all the time,'' said Heather
Lauver, assistant manager of corporate philanthropy for drugmaker
Pfizer Inc., which is teaming with the Edna McConnell Clark
Foundation on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the International Trachoma Initiative will seek to
eradicate trachoma in five countries, most likely Ghana, Mali,
Morocco, Tanzania, and Vietnam, identified by Harvard School of
Public Health researcher Michael Reisch as the most promising
candidates for a nationwide medical program.
</P>
<P>
   Trachoma has been found in dozens of countries, particularly in
sub-Saharan Africa, Indochina, and Iran, as well as parts of
Mexico, Brazil, and Australia. An estimated 540 million people are
at risk of developing trachoma.
</P>
<P>
   To support the program, Pfizer is donating $58 million worth of
Zithromax, and the company and the foundation are each putting in
more than $3 million to manage a comprehensive plan to eradicate
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Besides administering the antibiotic to hundreds of thousands of
people, the project will also fund eyelid repair surgery for people
with advanced trachoma, improved access to clean water and health
education, and campaigns to get people to wash their faces daily to
reduce the risk of transmission. Insects attracted to running eye
sores also spread it from person to person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concerted efforts using this strategy could readily eradicate
the world's leading cause of preventable blindness,'' said Dr.
Alfred Sommer, dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of
Hygiene and Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of Zithromax, which was introduced in 1992 and
has become the leading antimicrobial medicine in the United States,
as a cure for trachoma was shown in a 1996 study involving 10,000
Moroccans.
</P>
<P>
   The standard treatment for trachoma has involved a six-week
cycle of two daily applications of ointment. ``It's painful, and
there are a lot of problems with noncompliance,'' said Dr. Mike
Magee, Pfizer's senior medical adviser.

AIG EXECUTIVE CHOSEN TO HEAD MASSMUTUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a change that portends more than a shift in
executive positions, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co.
Tuesday named a senior official from competitor American
International Group Inc. to its top post.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. O'Connell, who headed AIG's US life insurance
business, will succeed Thomas B. Wheeler as chief executive of the
Springfield, Mass. insurer. Wheeler, who is retiring, said the
shift was designed to allow MassMutual, the nation's 11th largest
life insurer, to undertake a host of strategic initiatives,
including acquisitions and possible conversion to a new corporate
form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob isn't going to do anything at the moment,'' Wheeler, 62,
said. ``He's going to sit and learn about the company and then make
some changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said O'Connell, 55, would seek to grow MassMutual by
buying companies, possibly overseas, and to decide whether the
firm, nominally owned by its policyholders, should convert to a
mutual holding company, issue stock, or remain as it is. O'Connell
would also consider how to grow MassMutual's asset management
business, also through acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to look at external growth as well as internal
growth,'' said Wheeler, who is staying on as board chairman.
O'Connell also bears the title of president. He was traveling and
unavailable to comment.
</P>
<P>
   MassMutual also said that president and chief operating officer
John J. Pajak, 63, was stepping down after 41 years of service. The
chief operating post will remain vacant.
</P>
<P>
   MassMutual, the second largest insurer in Massachusetts after
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., has considered taking its
$88.5 billion OppenheimerFunds Inc. mutual funds unit public. It
considered a merger with Milwaukee's Northwestern Mutual Life
Insurance Co. earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The life insurance industry on which MassMutual focuses has seen
slumping sales and grown more competitive. But MassMutual is one of
few mutually owned firms to have a triple A rating from Standard &AMP;
Poor's, the ratings agency.
</P>
<P>
   MassMutual, with a total $160 billion in assets under
management, including $63 billion of its own, is the parent of
David L. Babson Co. &AMP; Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.money management
firm, and Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers Inc., of Hartford, Conn.

CHINA CRACKS DOWN ON UNREGISTERED CHURCHES, RIGHTS GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese authorities have detained 140 Protestants and
severely beaten more than a dozen church leaders in the last few
weeks, a New York-based human rights organization said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents occurred in Henan province in an area known to
have many ``house churches.'' These are often run by evangelical
Protestant groups that have refused to register with the
government, so members worship furtively in homes rather than in
state-sponsored churches.
</P>
<P>
   David Zhang, identified as a spokesman for China's house
churches, has sent a letter protesting the arrests to a number of
leaders and groups both in the West and in China, the group Human
Rights in China said in releasing the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, who was born in China but now lives in the United States,
said he knew some of those detained. ``The situation is very
dangerous for these people,'' he said in a telephone interview from
California.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang said that 40 worshipers at a house church were arrested
Oct. 26 in the city of Wugang and that more than 100 were detained
Nov. 5 in Nanyang. In both cases, the leaders of the house churches
were beaten and tortured and are still being held, he said. Other
worshipers were detained and released.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two acts are not isolated,'' Zhang wrote in the letter
he sent to President Clinton, Amnesty International and China's
Cabinet, among others. ``In the next two months there will be more
acts of religious persecution throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   China requires that all churches register with the government,
and in the last few years has stepped up its efforts to ensure
compliance. Once their congregations accept this constraint,
mainstream Protestants have relative freedom to worship.
</P>
<P>
   But the unregistered house churches, which tend to be relatively
small with a variety of beliefs, are under surveillance and suffer
frequent harassment, particularly at the hands of local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officially, policies on religion are fairly enlightened,''
said a religion expert who spoke on condition of anonymity, ``but
you also have instances all over China where at a local level there
are abuses or policies don't get followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars estimate that there are at least 20 million Protestants
in China, including those who worship in house churches. A small
number of house church leaders are serving prison terms, but more
commonly their meetings are broken up by the local police,
sometimes followed by short detentions.
</P>
<P>
   A police official in Wugang, who gave his family name, Wang,
told The Associated Press that police there broke up an illegal
meeting Oct. 26 but started arresting people only when the
worshipers resisted, even firing homemade rifles at the officers.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, met
with President Clinton at the White House on Tuesday and said he
was maneuvering to open talks with the Chinese government aimed at
gaining some degree of autonomy for his people.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that negotiations were not imminent, given
the ``atmosphere of deep distrust between Tibetans and Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which risked Beijing's wrath by agreeing to the
30-minute meeting, said afterward that Clinton and the Dalai Lama
agreed on the need for direct talks between the Chinese government
and the Tibetan leader, who is revered by his Buddhist followers as
a god and a king.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India since 1959,
suggested in an interview with reporters that he was eager to take
advantage of an opportunity that presented itself in June. That
month, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said during a news conference
in Beijing with Clinton that the ``door to negotiation'' was open
if the Dalai Lama accepted Chinese sovereignty over Tibet and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama long ago publicly accepted Chinese sovereignty
over Tibet, which is now considered a province of China, and has
hinted that he does not support the independence movement on
Taiwan. He has offered effusive praise for Jiang's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has been little movement from Beijing since June to
suggest that the offer of negotiations was sincere. And in recent
days, the Chinese government, angered by the Dalai Lama's nine-day
visit to the United States, has denounced him.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, who also met Tuesday with Vice President Al
Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, said he was not seeking independence for Tibet but hoped
to obtain ``genuine autonomy for the Tibetan people to preserve
their distinct identity and way of life.''

CHINA'S ECONOMIC BOOM IS LATEST THREAT TO TIBETAN CULTURE

<P>
   LHASA, Tibet _ At daybreak, thousands of Tibetan worshipers
march a path that circles this holy city, twirling prayer wheels
and murmuring tributes of faith. Clad in dark robes or silk tunics,
they wind their way around a gold-roofed temple where the scent of
smoldering juniper bush, a traditional offering, rises from a
blackened stupa, a dome-shaped shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Past a dilapidated Chinese factory, down an ill-paved city
street, their daily parade then takes the faithful right by a row
of gambling houses and massage parlors that represent the gaudiest
element of a growing Chinese presence here. Yet few Tibetans even
glance into these places of imported debauchery as they walk by,
keeping their focus on the sacred trail.
</P>
<P>
   Tibet, a mountainous desert whose people have preserved a
remarkably intense form of religious devotion despite decades of
persecution by the Chinese, is now in the next stage of a
grindingly long battle between Tibetan tradition and Chinese
modernity. Today, it is the onslaught of China's free-wheeling
economic boom that most threatens Tibet's resilient Buddhist
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to beat us, to silence us, to overwhelm us,'' said
one monk, whispering in a dark corner at Sera Monastery, a
sprawling complex at the edge of town. ``You can see they are not
succeeding, just look at all the people who come to worship every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibet's exiled leader, the Dalai Lama, is in Washington seeking
support for his efforts to persuade Chinese leaders to allow more
self-rule for Tibet, even if it is under Chinese sovereignty. Apart
from international pressure, however, Beijing has little incentive
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   China exercises firm military and political control over Tibet,
as it has since its troops suppressed an uprising and the Dalai
Lama fled to India in 1959. In the past four years, the authorities
have sharply tightened restraints on Buddhist monasteries, which
are seen as centers of dissent, and limited the number of monks
allowed to worship.
</P>
<P>
   No sign of protest or potential violence is evident in Lhasa
today, and for a city that is ethnically divided _ there is a
distinctly Tibetan half and a Chinese half _ there is little
palpable tension. In the first visit to Tibet allowed to a reporter
for The New York Times since 1990, crowds of both groups were seen
mixing easily in open-air markets where fruit, clothing and
distinctive Tibetan jewelry were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after decades of trying, Beijing's political and now
economic efforts to fully transform Tibet into another province of
China still founder on Tibetans' extraordinary religious fervor.
Religion and culture create such a deep gulf between Chinese and
Tibetan ways of life that it is hard to foresee any easy
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking aspect of daily life is the passionate worship
by Tibetans of every station. One must rise at dawn to see the
daily, two-hour march around central Lhasa that draws thousands of
worshipers each day, but thousands more pilgrims who come from
elsewhere in Tibet to pray at the region's holiest sites are
evident everywhere in town.
</P>
<P>
   All day long at the gate of the Jokhang Temple, the most revered
structure in Tibet, dozens of worshipers perform an obeisance of
prostration, lying face down on cold stone, only to stand up again,
hands together, motion hundreds of times in succession. Dirt-poor
pilgrims, filthy from weeks or even months of travel, pray next to
well-dressed businessmen and women from Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese don't understand our religion,'' said Chuni, 25, a
health administrator who came to the Jokhang Temple to pray one
recent evening. Like many Tibetans she uses only one name. ``They
think we are uneducated and inferior. They will never understand,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   A layer of good-natured Tibetan fatalism, Chuni said, often
shields the animosity that ordinary Tibetans feel toward the
Chinese. Underneath, she said, most Tibetans deeply resent the
Chinese presence here.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetans are unlikely to forget the relentless efforts to
destroy their culture that came in the years after Chinese forces
consolidated control in 1959. Calling it ``liberation,'' the
communist authorities banned religious worship, demolished
monasteries and killed untold thousands of Tibetans who resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Times change, as do methods. But China's aim in Tibet remains
the same, to integrate it more closely with the rest of the
``motherland.'' In the 1960s, that meant tearing down almost
anything old and parroting fanatical political slogans; today it
means building almost anything new in the name of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Chinese government point to the undeniable
benefits built with Beijing money in recent years: roads and
telephones that allow communication in previously impassable areas,
hospitals and schools that offer care and general education in a
land that had almost none during its centuries as a theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities make much of the stubbornly medieval nature
of Tibet's old society, where slaves of various grades were taught
that they suffered for the misdeeds of a past life.
</P>
<P>
   But material gains have come on Chinese terms. All Tibetans are
required to be literate in Chinese for the best jobs; few Chinese
ever learn Tibetan, even officials who live here for decades.
Schools are theoretically bilingual, but in practice Chinese
dominates.
</P>
<P>
   Many Tibetans, accepting the fact of Chinese dominance, push
their children to study Chinese, because it broadens their chances
for decent employment. Some send their children to study at schools
in China proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sad that so many children cannot read or speak Tibetan
well,'' said a 35-year-old employee at a state-run department
store, and mother of a 9-year-old girl. ``But I want what is best
for my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Tibetans, this woman complained that economic
gains in Tibet have overwhelmingly benefited Chinese here, not
Tibetans. It is hard to measure, since economic status is not
measured by ethnic group, but Tibetans uniformly say that
unemployment among Tibetans is many times that of Chinese.

LIVINGSTON PUTTING TOGETHER LEADERSHIP STAFF BEFORE WINNING
SPEAKER'S POST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana began putting
together new leadership staff and working on committee assignments
Monday even though he has not yet been officially elected as the
new speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who is expected to be tapped Republican members on
Nov. 18 to replace Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., met in the evening with
outgoing speaker to discuss the transition of power.
</P>
<P>
   Working in his office across from the Capitol, Livingston
continued placing phone calls to members to shore up support. He
told many of them that he would likely name Rep. C.W. ``Bill''
Young of Florida to take Livingston's old post as chairman of the
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNN, Livingston said he hopes that his
tenure as speaker will be almost ``boring,'' when compared to
Gingrich's four-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   He called himself a conservative, but said he would replace the
``flamboyance'' and partisan conservatism of the Gingrich era with
a more pragmatic management style designed to overcome legislative
logjams of the kind that forced two government shutdowns in 1995
and early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being simply conservative and making grand speeches doesn't do
any good if we can't get the bills through the House and Senate and
on the president's desk,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to allow committee chairmen greater freedom than
Gingrich did and said he said he would not inject himself into the
impeachment inquiry being conducted by Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston promised that his first act as the new speaker will
be to introduce legislation that will take the Social Security
Trust Fund off budget. The surplus trust fund has been used in the
past to help balance the federal budget, a process that Livingston
and other members on both sides of the aisle say has undermined its
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has not been elected yet, Livingston said has
discussed all kinds of leadership business of leadership business
like arranging the schedule for ``freshmen orientation'' later this
week. The next speaker will also be involved in making revisions in
the House rules that often led to angry show-downs with Democrats
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Livingston told members plans to remain neutral in
the three other battles being waged for the jobs of majority
leader, GOP conference chairman and head of the Republican National
Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey of Irving currently holds the the No. 2 post of
majority leader, but faces a tough challenge from Reps. Jennifer
Dunn of Washington and Steve Largent of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   There was also talk around Capitol Hill Monday that Rep. Bill
Thomas of California, who currently chairs the House Oversight
Committee, may decide to challenge Armey, whom many members blame
as much as they do Gingrich for the loss of five GOP House seats to
the Democrats in this year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the opposition, Armey aides said he was confident that
he has enough committed votes to come out ahead of any of his
challengers when members meet next week to cast their secret
ballots for the new leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   Armey will have to get a majority of the 222 votes expected to
be cast in the Nov. 18 election. ``We know how to count votes,''
his press secretary Michelle Green said, when asked if Armey has
enough support.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Largent, a hard-line conservative and former pro football
star, said he was prepared to call what he described as an Armey
bluff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a head fake when I see one,'' he said, adding that his
internal counting shows the Texan way short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the incumbent majority leader hasn't locked up
his re-election bid . . . sends a clear signal that the caucus is
not behind Dick and is seriously weighing a change,'' Largent said.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's bid for re-election has apparently been undermined by
the fact that House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas has yet to
throw the full weight of his vote-getting organization behind him.
Although DeLay is expected to vote for his fellow Texan, Republican
aides said that Armey has not yet asked his colleague for help.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because the two have not been on the best of terms
since last year when DeLay ended up taking most of the blame for a
failed coup that conservative members mounted against Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Armey was involved early on in discussions among conservatives
about removing Gingrich, but bailed out of the insurrection after
it became clear that he might lose his leadership post in the
process. His flip-flop ended up alienating a lot of conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who was blamed by some of his colleagues for the GOP
losses as well, is the only Republican leader who is not facing a
challenge in his re-election bid. Members who intend to support him
say that he is still considered the best at pulling together the
votes needed from both sides of the aisle to pass crucial
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Although DeLay, one of the most conservative members of
Congress, has said little since the election about the upheaval
within the leadership, he has moved quickly to mend fences with
angry Republicans who believe his job should be up for grabs as
well. In addition to throwing his whip organization behind
Livingston, he has also been calling members on behalf of moderate
Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia who challenging conservative John Linder
of Georgia for head of the party's congressional campaign
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Delay's support, Davis is believed to have the job
all wrapped up over Linder, who was appointed to his position two
years ago by Gingrich. &QL;

SURVEY SHOWS SURGE IN USE OF ALTERNATIVE HEALING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new survey shows that the use of alternative medicine has
surged in the 1990s and Americans are now making more visits to
alternative healers than to primary care medical doctors.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 4 in 10 Americans used at least one alternative, or
``complementary,'' remedy in 1997, and among people 35 to 49 it was
5 in 10. Visits to alternative practitioners in 1997 jumped by 47
percent from 1991, to a total of 629 million _ exceeding all visits
to primary care medical doctors, said the study.
</P>
<P>
   The report from Dr. David M. Eisenberg and collegues at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and the Harvard Medical
School updates a similar survey carried out in 1990 and published
in 1993, which found that 3 in 10 Americans used alternative
therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who saw an alternative practitioner for a serious
condition also saw a medical doctor, Eisenberg reported.
</P>
<P>
   The updated survey is the lead article in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, whose current issue is wholly devoted
to the alternative medicine phenomenon. Two JAMA editors call it
``deeply troubling'' that billions of health care dollars are being
spent on an array of practices and products with little proof of
safety or efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncritical acceptance of untested and unproven alternative
therapies must stop,'' write Dr. Phil B. Fontanarosa, a senior
editor, and Dr. George D. Lundberg, the editor of JAMA. And
therapies that have been shown not to work or to be harmful
``should be abandoned immediately,'' they add.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second sharp critique of alternative medicine to come
from a leading medical journal in the past two months. In
September, the New England Journal of Medicine published several
reports documenting harm from herbal remedies, and editorialized
that alternative medicine has been getting a ``free ride'' from the
scientific community, which it said has failed to subject such
therapies to the same rigorous tests as it does conventional
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The most-used alternative therapies, according to the new
survey, are relaxation techniques, herbal medicine, massage,
chiropractic and spiritual healing by others. About half of the
total alternative practitioner visits were for two therapies _
massage and chiropractic.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the NEJM, the JAMA issue contains some reports of
alternative therapies that proved effective, along with ones that
failed to show benefit. Nine other medical journals affiliated with
JAMA are also carrying reports on alternative medicine this week.
</P>
<P>
   Among the results published in the special JAMA issue:
</P>
<P>
   _ Irritable bowel syndrome, a common set of symptoms that
include abdominal pain, bloating, constipation and diarrhea,
responded to chinese herbal formulations in an Australian study.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spinal manipulation by a chiropractor failed to alleviate
tension-type headaches, according to a Danish study.
</P>
<P>
   _ Acupuncture proved ineffective in treating nerve pain due to
infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but no other
treatment has been shown to work either, said researchers from
Denver, the University of Minnesota and the National Institutes of
Health.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome who participated in an
8-week yoga program improved more than patients who only received a
wrist splint, said a report from the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers from Italy and China tested an ancient Chinese
practice, moxibustion, which has been used to reposition fetuses
incorrectly oriented in the womb before birth. Moxibustion involves
burning an herb near the body so that the smoke stimulates
particular acupuncture points. The report said that moxibustion
increased fetal movements and was effective in repositioning a
significant number of fetuses who had been in a breech (feet-first)
presentation in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   _ Overweight patients who took an herbal remedy, Garcinia
cambogia, which is found in many commercial weight-loss products,
were no more successful at shedding pounds than were those who took
a placebo, according to a report from the obesity research center
at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Saw palmetto, a popular herbal remedy for symptoms caused by
an enlarged prostate, is about as effective as the drug Proscar in
relieving symptoms and increasing urine flow, and had fewer adverse
effects than the drug, said researchers at the Minneapolis Veterans
Affairs Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The updated survey from Eisenberg and colleagues estimated that
Americans in 1997 spent $12.2 billion of their own money on visits
to alternative therapists (most are not covered by insurance) and
an additional $5.1 billion on herbal remedies, $3.3 billion on
high-dose vitamins, $1.7 billion on diet products and $4.7 billion
on books, classes or equipment related to alternative therapy.
</P>
<P>
   This total of about $27 billion is comparable to the $29.3
billion in out-of-pocket expenses paid for all US physicians'
services in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that about 15 million Americans are taking
herbal remedies or high-dose vitamins at the same time that they
are using prescription drugs, putting them at risk for drug-herb
and drug-vitamin adverse interreactions, Eisenberg warned.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Delbanco, chief of general medicine and primary care at
Beth Israel Deaconess and co-author with Eisenberg of the original
survey, predicted Tuesday that 95 percent of alternative remedies
won't withstand scientific scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   He labeled the current interest in alternative medicine a fad,
fueled by a nostalgia for quieter times, natural products and the
days when doctors could spend a lot of time listening to their
patients' troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 10 years, it will be something else,'' said Delbanco,
adding that ``scientific medicine'' will come up with a variety of
new treatments for common, chronic problems that alternative
medicine won't be able to compete with.

 LHASA, Tibet: of Chinese. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A senior Chinese leader, Hu Yaobang, decried the colonial
attitude that prevailed among Chinese officials here when he
visited in 1980. Much has changed in Tibet since then, but perhaps
not the mindset of the average Chinese official. In a small but
telling example, Chinese officials still insist that Beijing time
be observed throughout Tibet _ as it is elsewhere throughout
Chinese-controlled territory _ even though this means sunrise in
November here comes after 8 a.m., and sunset after 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Although Beijing clearly hopes a rising economic tide will draw
Tibetans closer to the Chinese way, local officials assigned here
often seem more interested in taking advantage of loose
restrictions to make money in any way possible. As in most of
China, a local official has wide latitude in economic matters, as
long as his or her political patron is secure.
</P>
<P>

takes thousands of Tibetans each morning, was converted two years
ago into a resort area of gambling halls that operate openly, even
though they are technically illegal. Across the street is a long
row of massage parlors with come-hither names, equally open and,
because they are clearly fronts for prostitution, equally illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling? How could we allow gambling?'' asked Nima Tsering, a
deputy governor of Tibet, in an interview. ``No gambling is allowed
in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was truly unaware of what transpired on Sun Island,
Tsering quickly backtracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe our supervision is not perfect,'' said Tsering, one of
many ethnic Tibetans in the Chinese government here. ``Maybe this
phenomenon does exist in some cases. We know about it. We're
keeping an eye on it, and we'll decide what to do when the time
comes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many Tibetans are as disgusted by the presence of the Chinese
here as they are by the fact that Chinese businessmen and workers
keep arriving each day. Exactly how many Chinese live in Lhasa has
become a matter of constant interest.
</P>
<P>
   According to official statistics, of Lhasa's 198,000 current
residents, including Chinese workers who have temporary residence
permits, 55 percent are Tibetan and 45 percent are Han, China's
dominant ethnic group. Tsering conceded that this figure does not
include the innumerable Chinese itinerants who fail to register.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese and Tibetan businessmen estimate that at least 60
percent of the people in Lhasa at any given time are Chinese. Yet
it is hard to know with accuracy because Chinese workers typically
stay anywhere from five days to five years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chinese statistics do not include Chinese military
personnel. International military experts say there are probably
about 50,000 Chinese military personnel stationed in Tibet, as well
as an unknown number of paramilitary police. After protests erupted
here in 1987 and 1989, however, Chinese soldiers have been ordered
to keep out of view as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Although outside critics of China's Tibet policy denounce what
they see as a monolithic Chinese plan to overwhelm Tibet, the
day-to-day reality of Chinese expansion here appears to be
relatively limited and haphazard.
</P>
<P>
   Tibet's economy, though growing by 10 percent, reached only $927
million last year, a tiny amount considering that more than half of
it came in the form of direct grants from Beijing. Yet Chinese
businessmen here say there is a larger, unrecorded economy of
trading in consumer goods and commodities that draws thousands of
businessmen and workers from neighboring Sichuan province, which is
overflowing with 110 million people, compared with Tibet's 2.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several Chinese businessmen here complained that their
biggest obstacles lie not in Tibetan culture, but in the corruption
among local officials, who often make money in the form of ``fees''
that are unlikely ever to appear in provincial balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention and problems that the Chinese presence in
Lhasa produces, it represents a small part of the larger picture in
what is still a desperately poor region. More than 80 percent of
the people in China's Tibetan Autonomous Region live outside cities
and towns as herdsmen and farmers with an average income of $10 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The official population of the Tibetan Autonomous Region is only
2.4 million. Yet the larger Tibetan plateau, each corner carved
into another Chinese province, includes a total population of
roughly 7 million Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the traditions that ordinary Tibetans keep alive is
saving their meager earnings for years in order to make a
pilgrimage to Lhasa. Virtually every Tibetan who can comes here to
worship.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, Thondrup, 57, a herdsman from northern
Tibet, sat outside the Potala Palace, the former residence of the
Dalai Lama, describing how he had prepared for years to bring his
family to Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
   For a total of 11 people, including his wife, 2 daughters and
sons-in-law and 5 grandchildren, Thondrup rented a truck to make
the journey. It took eight days and nights of terrible roads and
volatile weather to reach the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to pray,'' said Thondrup. ``It is the most important
thing we do in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering a simple interpretation of the Tibetan belief that an
act of worship brings good will that will pay off in a future life,
Thondrup said his family members could improve their karma by
visiting each of the main religious sites in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
   The only other time Thondrup came to Lhasa, 15 years ago, he
traveled by horseback, truck and bus. It took three weeks each way.
</P>
<P>
   New roads, Thondrup said, have greatly improved livestock
trading in his area and fattened his wallet. Yet it has hardly made
him more partial to Chinese officials, whom he regards as
patronizing and bribe-hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they think about it money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the material improvement in Thondrup's life, like most
Tibetans he seems to care far more about prayer and devotion to the
Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Tibetans want the Dalai Lama to come home, more than
anything else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, here lies the unsolvable dilemma for the Chinese
authorities in Tibet. Regardless of the physical improvements that
have been made, the health care and the education, and the
fast-growing economy, most Tibetans do not hesitate to talk about
their religious attachment to the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Almost without exception, ordinary Tibetans here eagerly say
that they would happily sacrifice all their own material goods, as
well as all the modern advances in Tibet, if only the Dalai Lama
would come home for a single day.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to consider this quandary, Tsering, Tibet's deputy
governor, took a deep breath and exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people do have this ideal,'' he said. ``But Tibet needs
to be more modern. We need science and technology. That was the old
society. We need a new society.''

<P>
   Yvette Weilacker sits in the kitchen of a small house in Buffalo
waiting for the contractions to begin. Her baby, already named
Nicholas Lee by his anxious parents, was due days ago, and he shows
scant signs of being ready to be born.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting is all the more tense because the kitchen she waits
in is not hers, and the baby she waits for is in another woman's
body. Kim Elniskey and her fiance, Jorge Rosario, have chosen Mrs.
Weilacker and husband, Paul, to adopt their son and the two
families have gotten to know each other well these past few months,
by telephone, letter and now in person as the birth nears.
</P>
<P>
   Since she flew in from her home in Riverside, Calif., four weeks
earlier, Mrs. Weilacker has been staying with Ms. Elniskey and
Rosario and helping care for their three other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to feel that this is your baby, your family,'' Ms.
Elniskey told Mrs. Weilacker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey has kept the Weilackers involved throughout her
pregnancy, sharing ultrasound pictures and updates about the baby's
intra-uterine acrobatics. ``Your son kicked me a lot today,'' Ms.
Elniskey reported in one of many telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The Weilackers have promised that they will be just as open as
Nicholas grows: what he wears on his first Halloween, when he loses
his first tooth and learns to read. When the boy is ready, Ms.
Elniskey and Rosario plan to visit him.
</P>
<P>
   The intimacy between these two families would have been rare
just a few years ago and unthinkable a generation ago. But such
open contact between adoptive parents and biological parents is one
of the many ways that adoption has evolved from a secretive, closed
process weighed down by dark stigmas and painful misconceptions
into an infinitely more transparent experience.
</P>
<P>
   How many children are adopted each year is an elusive number,
since no one keeps complete statistics. The most recent data, from
1992, show 127,441 children adopted that year, a slight increase
from 118,000 five years earlier. About 42 percent of those
adoptions were by stepparents and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The most sought-after children for adoption are, as they have
been for generations, domestic white infants _ known among parents
and professionals in the adoption loop as DWI's _ but those babies
are scarcer because of the easier availability of birth control,
the legalization of abortion and the growing acceptance of single
mothers raising children alone. Experts estimate that there are
fewer than 20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the biggest increase in adoptions has been children
adopted from other countries. Because they require visas, there are
up-to-date statistics for these adoptions and since 1990, their
numbers have nearly doubled, to 13,620 in 1997 from 7,093. So while
the overall increase in the number of children adopted has been
subtle, the increase in visibility has been dramatic, enhanced by
those children adopted from other countries whose physical
differences from their parents make their adoption an obvious fact.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, adoption has gone public in much the same
manner that divorce did in the 1970s. Increasingly children are
told, even before they can fully understand, how they came to their
families and that story is shared with relatives, friends,
teachers, sometimes even strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My birth mother gave me this doll,'' Sasha Saidman, a
6-year-old who was adopted, told a clerk at the video store near
her home in Wheaton, Md., as her family prepared for a visit from
the woman who had borne her. Like most adopted children, Sasha used
the term that has replaced such loaded phrases as ``real mother''
and ``natural mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the ``other'' option for becoming parents, adoption is now
one of many ways that men and women create families. The panorama
of the American family now includes children born through advanced
reproductive technology, some conceived with donated sperm and
eggs; families broken apart by divorce then blended through
remarriage; families created by single parents and by gay men who
have hired a surrogate to bear a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing an explosion of different family forms which
make adoption seem downright mainstream and conservative,'' said
Madelyn Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B. Donaldson
Adoption Institute, a research group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many people turning to international adoption, and indeed
adoption in general, are baby boomers who put off starting
families, then confronted infertility problems and finally opted
out of the world of assisted reproductive technology that many call
the ``Ovarian Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Further raising the profile are the celebrities who have spoken
happily about being adoptive parents, including: Nicole Kidman and
her husband, Tom Cruise; Rosie O'Donnell, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who
wrote a popular children's book on the subject, ``Tell Me Again
About the Night I Was Born.''
</P>
<P>
   In bookstores, that book shares shelf space with an expanding
selection of adoption-related titles from large publishers and from
niche publishers like R-Squared Press in Ann Arbor, Mich., a small
family-run business that focuses on adoption.
</P>
<P>
   In Tacoma, Wash., Gloria Finkbeiner, an adoptive sister, aunt
and grandmother, started a mail-order card and gift business called
Adoption Option with her daughter, Susan Pierce, who adopted three
children out of foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are, adoption isn't unique,'' said Mrs. Finkbeiner.
``It's just a way to be a family.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics on how many people build families
through open adoption, no way to know how many birth parents select
the people they want to raise their child, get to know them and
then stay in some sort of contact _ from regular visits to
occasional phone calls or letters _ after the baby is legally and
emotionally the other family's child. But people in the field say
the trend of open adoption is growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Human Services in Traverse City, Mich., a rural area in
the northern part of the state, was one of the first agencies to
arrange open adoptions. Since 1980, the agency has handled close to
500 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stereotype from 20 years ago was that birth parents were
wild and reckless people from the other side of the tracks,'' said
Jim Gritter, a child welfare supervisor at the agency. ``But what
we found was that that viewpoint was 180 degrees from reality. So
many birth mothers talked about feeling that they were abandoning
their babies because the closed system basically asked of them to
abandon them.''
</P>
<P>
   Social workers at the agency decided that the only way to soothe
birth parents' guilt was to let them choose families for their
children. The social workers were motivated in part by stories they
had heard of adoptees searching for their birth parents. If
children yearned to know about their roots, and birth parents
longed to know who became the parents of their children, the agency
social workers figured that it made sense to make adoption a
collaborative experience.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-R-ABR-ADOPTION-CHANGES-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &QL; 
UNDATED: collaborative experience. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that the open adoption process has helped to
transform the experience of adoption even for those with more
traditional arrangements. Today, the majority of people who adopt
know something about their children's backgrounds. Even if they do
not stay in regular contact, they frequently have detailed medical
histories, photographs of biological relatives, and letters and
gifts for the children from the women who bore them.
</P>
<P>
   This information, experts say, can help children to understand
better the decisions leading to their adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most frustrating things for me growing up was not
knowing my background,'' said David Wilson, a 31-year-old
telecommunications consultant who several years ago found and met
his birth parents. ``I'm cautious about saying that having an open,
ongoing relationship with them when I was growing up would have
been good. That could create conflict or blur lines. But just
knowing who they were and why they made their choices would have
taken away an unnecessary mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Adoption is no mystery for Diana Galligan, nearly 7. ``It's when
people who love you take care of you and become your parents,'' she
says, quietly poised.
</P>
<P>
   And she will tell you that in her case, those people who love
her and take care of her are her ``guys,'' her dad, John Galligan,
and her pop, Richard Koonce.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuckahoe Elementary School in Arlington, Va., Diana is one of
many adopted children, although her fathers think she is the only
one there who is being raised by openly gay parents. And even
though Galligan and Koonce are far more concerned with helping
their daughter learn to read and to express herself freely, they
are acutely aware that families like theirs are a symbol of ``the
new American family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In previous generations, one of the most difficult notions for
many gay men coming out was putting aside the idea of having a
family,'' said Galligan, 39, who works for the U.S. Treasury
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Galligan said that he knew he wanted to be a father ever since
he worked as a college volunteer in a Big Brother program. Several
years ago, Galligan, said, although he had no partner at the time,
he decided that ``the time was right; I wanted to be a father.''
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to figure out how to go about adopting, when a
woman he knew with two older children told him that she was
pregnant and was willing to have him adopt the baby. Their
arrangement is open, and Diana visits her birth mother every summer
and calls her when she feels like it.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have sensed disapproval and worse from strangers,
Galligan and Koonce said they have never faced prejudice from
neighbors or teachers.
</P>
<P>
   But both men lamented that many religious and political
institutions were still hostile. Although Galligan adopted Diana,
Koonce is legally only Diana's guardian in case something happens
to Galligan. He has yet to formally adopt her, they said, because
Virginia courts would not allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Even as adoptive parents and their children feel less isolated
and stigmatized, birth parents say they continue to endure
society's disapproving glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was pregnant, people were shocked and disgusted by my
plans, not that I was pregnant and unmarried but that I was making
an adoption plan,'' said Lisa Nicholson, a 28-year-old woman from
Richmond, Va., who four years ago chose a family to adopt her
daughter. ``My family and friends understood, but strangers who
knew nothing about me or my circumstances would say, `How could
you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she said, when she hears people talking about how
irresponsible birth parents are, she cannot help revealing herself.
``Usually, I really surprise them, because, to meet me, I'm the
girl next door,'' said Ms. Nicholson, who married last year and
hopes to start a family. ``I explain to them why it's a responsible
decision. It's not easier, it's harder.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Nicholson corresponds with and occasionally speaks to
the couple who adopted her daughter, she has often feared that
disapproval and ignorance among the couple's friends and relatives
would drive them away from her.
</P>
<P>
   - 0 -
</P>
<P>
   The Weilackers, who are both 39 and had endured several years of
unsuccessful infertility treatments, placed their letter in the
files of the Independent Adoption Center in Pleasant Hill, Calif.
It was forwarded, among dozens of others, to Ms. Elniskey,
prompting her to call the Weilackers on a toll-free line they had
set up in the hopes of receiving just such a call.
</P>
<P>
   Before she called the center, Ms. Elniskey said that she did not
even know such an arrangement was possible. The world of adoption,
she said, was vastly different than it was eight years ago, when
she was 18, in high school and pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wasn't ready to be a mother, I couldn't do it,'' Ms.
Elniskey, a 26-year-old homemaker, said of her first pregnancy.
``After I gave birth, my sister Judy took the baby home and cared
for her. I named her Alyssa. My obstetrician found the couple. She
was a patient of his. I wanted to know about them, who they were
and all. But I didn't know I could ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience, she said, left her heartbroken. Even now she
will scan a crowd, looking at girls around Alyssa's age, wondering,
``Is that my hair? My nose? Could this be her?''
</P>
<P>
   When she found herself last winter with three small children and
pregnant again, despite having had an injection of Depo-Provera
that was supposed to prevent pregnancy for several months, Ms.
Elniskey said she panicked. She and Rosario, who is 30 years old
and works in a factory making roll-up doors for trucks, agreed that
they could not cope with another child.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey said she knew she could never go blindly into
another adoption. But she never imagined the power she had to
influence her baby's future and to remain a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The day Nicholas was born, on a warm, late September Sunday, Kim
Elniskey wrote him a letter as he rested beside her in a bassinet
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Weilacker was scrambling to get on a plane to Buffalo.
Rosario was at home with the children. ``I needed to make sure that
you would always be healthy, safe, happy and most of all LOVED more
than could humanly have been possible,'' Ms. Elniskey wrote. ``And
in order for all those things to go together as one, Jorge and I
had to make THE HARDEST DECISION OF OUR LIVES, and that was to find
you a mommy and daddy that would do all those things for you.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mrs. Weilacker arrived, the two women stayed together in
the hospital room and tended to Nicholas, confusing nurses about
who his mother was. One even tried to take Mrs. Weilacker's
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elniskey showed Mrs. Weilacker how to change his diaper, how
to tap his back gently to bring up gas after a feeding.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Nicholas' birth, Mrs. Weilacker spent time alone
with him in the hospital, when Ms. Elniskey had tubal ligation
surgery. After checking out, Mrs. Weilacker settled into a hotel
with Nicholas, while Ms. Elniskey returned home to her family.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the week, they shuttled between the apartment
and the hotel. Jake, Miranda and Serena cooed over Nicholas.
Rosario kept his distance. Ms. Elniskey seemed always on the verge
of tears. And yet, when her children clambered about her and
Nicholas would begin to cry, she said that she was relieved and
sure of her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mrs. Weilacker, Ms. Elniskey and Rosario boarded a
plane to Los Angeles, where Nicholas met his father and the
adoption papers were signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas has to get on with his life and we have to move on
with ours,'' Ms. Elniskey said. ``At least our lives won't be
entirely separate, but I really can't imagine how it will all be in
a month or a year from now.''

COURT REJECTS DALLAS INVENTOR'S BID FOR PATENT PROTECTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a
Dallas area inventor's bid for patent protection, ruling that he
waited too long after marketing his product to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling shortens the time an inventor has to perfect an
invention before applying for a patent.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Pfaff waited so long after selling his product _ a socket
to hold computer microchips during testing _ that he missed the
one-year deadline for applying for a patent, the high court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law says a patent cannot be obtained if an invention has
been on sale in this country for more than one year before the
application is filed.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaff had argued that the clock should have begun ticking later
_ after he'd perfected a working version of the device. While he
had detailed drawings of the device when he sold it to Dallas-based
Texas Instruments in April 1981 _ it took months to create a
working prototype. He didn't apply for the patent until April 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The high court rejected Pfaff's argument, saying the year begins
before an invention has been completed. In their 9-0 decision, the
justices said the clock starts when a pending invention is placed
on the market and its blueprints are sufficiently clear to enable a
skilled technician to build the product.
</P>
<P>
   Patent attorney Jay Alexander of Washington said the court's
ruling should serve as a warning to small inventors to pay
attention to patent questions before the work is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apply for a patent as soon as possible. That way you eliminate
the risk,'' said Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Large companies, by contrast, are generally well-versed in
patent law, Alexander said. Most have policies in place to ensure
they do not miss the one-year deadline for filing their
applications, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the justices upheld a federal appeals court
decision that stripped Pfaff of his patent. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit had ruled that Pfaff's April 8,
1981, agreement to sell 30,100 of his sockets to Texas Instruments
for $91,155 rendered his April 19, 1982, patent application invalid
due to the one-year time limit.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision marked a victory for Wells
Electronics of South Bend, Ind., which makes competing socket that
had challenged Pfaff's patent in court.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court for Northern Texas upheld the validity
of Pfaff's patent, prompting Wells Electronics to appeal to the
Federal Circuit, which hears patent cases.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court for the Federal Circuit said the clock began
when Pfaff signed the contract because his invention was
``substantially complete'' at the time of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The high court interpreted the Patent Act even more broadly,
saying the year begins when inventions that are sufficiently
described on paper are put on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The justices compared Pfaff's situation to that of Alexander
Graham Bell, who more than 100 years ago applied for his patent
before he had constructed a working telephone. The Supreme Court in
1888 upheld Bell's patent, ruling that he had described a telephone
with ``sufficient clearness and precision'' to merit the
protection.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, the high court noted that the plans Pfaff
delivered to Texas Instruments before signing the contract were
identical to those he submitted with his patent application more
than a year later. Therefore, the court concluded, Pfaff's proposed
socket product was ``ready to be patented'' at the time he reached
the agreement with Texas Instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary meaning of the word `invention' in the Patent Act
unquestionably refers to the inventor's conception rather than to a
physical embodiment of that idea,'' Stevens wrote. ``The statute
does not contain any express requirement that an invention must be
completed before it can be patented.'' &QL;

BRITAIN'S FLIES-ON-THE-WALL DOCUSOAPS TRANSFIX A NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For releae Sunday, Nov. 15)  
 (bl)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In the last year or so, British television viewers have
been introduced to a traffic warden who sadistically sings
``Another One Bites the Dust'' when he finds an illegally parked
car. They have met a middle-aged woman who, having failed her
driving test six times, spreads terror among the local populace as
she doggedly continues with her driving lessons.
</P>
<P>
   And they have watched as an airline steward, asked by a
passenger why you can't smoke the duty-free cigarettes you purchase
on the plane, replies: ``You can buy condoms in Boots. Need I say
more?''
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the most memorable characters to emerge from
Britain's latest television fad, fly-on-the-wall documentaries that
profess to show the unvarnished truth about various institutions,
from health spas to veterinarians' offices to supermarkets. Their
quality varies widely, but the shows seem to have so captured a
public mood that at times they can draw as many as 10 million
viewers, or about half the national viewing audience on a given
night.
</P>
<P>
   While the shows are boons for the networks _ they cost half as
much as the average sitcom and are often more than twice as popular
_ their weedlike proliferation has provoked a furious debate in
Britain about the possible exploitation of their subjects, the
debasement of Britain's proud documentary tradition and the
always-thin line between reality and entertainment in the genre.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the country's most respected documentary filmmakers
believe that such shows, called observational documentaries or
docusoaps in the industry, condescend to their subjects to provoke
an easy laugh or fleeting emotional response from the lazy
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with many of the new soaps is that they don't
enrich or inform our lives,'' said Paul Watson, who in 1974 made
``The Family,'' a fly-on-the-wall documentary about a working-class
family in Reading that is now considered both the precursor to and
the model for the genre. ``All we have is a bunch of middle-class
people going in and sneering at other people, laughing at them
because they're so stupid. The filmmaker finds someone who can't
drive very well, for instance, and laughs at them.''
</P>
<P>
   In its time, ``The Family'' was considered almost breathtakingly
daring, in that it took seriously the concerns of a working-class
family, the sort of family rarely seen on television outside of
sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that was wrong in their lives was wrong with the
vast majority of working-class lives, but they were trying to do
something about it,'' said Watson in an interview, explaining the
show's appeal. And viewers were electrified by the unflinching
portrayal of a family that many found much like their own, and by
the way television could so illuminate some of the basic social
issues of the day.
</P>
<P>
   That was 24 years ago. The more recent fashion for fly-on-the
wall series probably dates back to early 1996 and ``The House,'' a
six-part BBC documentary that followed the Royal Opera House
through a series of riveting financial, political and artistic
crises.
</P>
<P>
   While that series set the stage for its more recent offshoots in
that it was high entertainment with recognizable heroes and
villains, it was in a class above many of the new shows, because it
represented a serious effort to look at a serious institution. The
show set off an impassioned discussion about the role of the opera
and the elite arts in general in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely, however, that viewers of a show like ``Health
Farm,'' which detailed the glitch-plagued $14 million opening of
the Forest Mere countryside retreat, tuned in by the millions
because they were seriously interested in the societal issues
underlying the operation of a health spa. Instead, they enjoyed
watching as the stressed-out general manager scarfed down doughnuts
on the sly, the aerobics instructor confessed that he was a closet
smoker and that he ``hadn't had sex in ages,'' and the pudgy guests
were herded en masse into the aquatherapy pool like cows to the
slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   And viewers of ``Airline,'' which followed the ups and downs of
Britannia Airways, which specializes in cut-rate package vacations,
were probably less interested in the politics of the airline
industry than they were in the personal dramas that lay behind the
scenes. These included the problem of an elderly gentleman who
happened to be falling-down drunk (he was barred from his flight),
a woman who began to cry because she hadn't been given a seat with
extra legroom and a man who grew apoplectic when his tea arrived
long after his sandwiches and scones. ``This is a debacle,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Mansfield, the controller of features and arts
documentaries at the ITV network and the man responsible for
scheduling many such shows, said that they had touched a nerve in
people, allowing the audience members to be the voyeurs in a series
of ``Truman Shows'' with one difference: all the protagonists know
they are being watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``At their heart, these shows are about contemporary British
life,'' he said. ``The successful ones are, first and foremost,
about the concerns and preoccupations of people in Britain, and
they have warm and empathetic characters which draw sympathy from
the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the characters on the docusoaps have gone on to
new-found fame. Maureen Rees, the hapless star of ``Driving
School,'' was, at last sighting, recording a driving instruction
video. Jane McDonald, the bravura nightclub singer of a certain age
featured on ``The Cruise,'' made a CD that instantly jumped to the
top of Britain's music charts, and she is currently performing to
sold-out crowds around Britain.
</P>
<P>
   And the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool, the subject of the series
``Hotel,'' suddenly found itself deluged with reservations, even
though it was portrayed as being about as efficiently run as Fawlty
Towers, the fictional hotel in the old John Cleese farce.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the shows have a point of view, a narrative angle. But
others just seem to meander aimlessly along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find some of them very watchable,'' said Michael Waldman,
who directed ``The House.'' ``But I do think that quite often there
is a tendency to just press the camera and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're commissioning great wodges of these things, and there
is a danger that all you get is lazy television for lazy viewers,
programs that have a superficial attractiveness, get high ratings
and then are instantly forgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many shows having been broadcast or in the works, it is
hard to know what can possibly be left to make a series about.
``All of the obvious lines of work have been covered _ vets,
doctors, police, nurses, midwives, sailing crews, traffic
wardens,'' wrote Alan Hay in the daily newspaper The Scotsman.
``You name it, they've trivialized it.'' The joke in the industry
is that the next fly-on-the-wall documentary commissioned will be
about the making of a fly-on-the-wall documentary.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if you get a few successes in a particular genre,
the great danger is that they're copied _ you become a production
line and just push out more and more of the same, rather like a
sausage machine,'' said Chris Terrill, who produced the mega-rated
show ``The Cruise'' and is now making a series about life inside a
women's prison. ``But the idea that we've exhausted all those areas
where we can make another observational documentary is a dangerous
one. The ones that really work are those that concentrate on
people, and allow them to take us to events, rather than the other
way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, critics say, is how the shows treat their
subjects. In its last annual report, the Broadcasting Standards
Commission, which administers the television industry's code of
practice, said it had received a number of complaints from viewers
upset at ``what they have seen as unacceptable treatment of a
vulnerable individual.'' Do the participants in docudramas, the
commission asked, understand what they are taking on and what the
consequences might be?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think these programs intend to be unfair, but in the
end the control of the program belongs to the producer and the
editor,'' said John Eldridge, a professor of sociology at Glasgow
University and a founder of the Glasgow Media Group. ``People
hardly know what they're in for unless they're involved in the
world of the media. They may think they know, and feel something of
the glamour of it, but I don't think they can really know.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that the luckless manager of Forest Mere in
``Health Farm'' knew that he would be yelled at by his boss, on
camera, in the last episode of the series. (He was dismissed two
days after filming stopped.) And it is unlikely that the sobered-up
version of the drunken man on ``Airline'' would have relished the
sight of himself reeling around, singing and swearing at the
airport staff, even if he did finally get on a plane 24 hours
later. But that is the price the subjects pay for their burst of
fame.
</P>
<P>
   And Mansfield said that the producers paid special attention to
the emotional needs of their subjects, even sometimes giving
participants the chance to view rough cuts of the shows and to make
a case for changing things they particularly object to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have covered something inaccurately or included
something hurtful or difficult, and we'd have to talk about it,''
he said. ``We've made dozens of these things now, but by and large
I can't remember a situation where we've reached loggerheads with a
subject. They know we're not doing it as a press release for
them.''

POLICE FEAR NEW REMEMBRANCE DAY ABORTION SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The opening shots fired in what have come be called
the Remembrance Day snipings cracked the early morning gloom of
Nov. 8, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Garson Romalis, then 57, a British Columbia gynecologist who
performed abortions at his Vancouver clinic, was at the breakfast
table waiting for the bread to pop from the toaster when two
bullets pierced the window of his suburban home. The first 7.62mm
rifle slug slammed into the back of his chair, the second tore into
his thigh, shattering bone and severing an artery.
</P>
<P>
   He nearly bled to death on the kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, across Canada, the days of early November have
become a season of fear for those in the front ranks of the
abortion rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   For four years now, Canada's Remembrance Day _ the country's
somber Nov. 11 commemoration of its war dead _ has been overcast by
the shootings of three abortion doctors in British Columbia,
Manitoba and Ontario as well as two doctors in western New York,
just across the Ontario border.
</P>
<P>
   Strong similarities between the attacks suggest the work of a
single sniper, and police are scouring 50 states and 10 provinces
in search of a 44-year-old American, James Koop, a Vermont resident
wanted for questioning in last month's fatal shooting of Barnett
Slepian of Amherst, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``All victims were shot in the hours of darkness. All were
residing in a home that was somewhat secluded by trees or a
fence,'' said Inspector Keith McCaskill of the Winnipeg, Manitoba
police, spokesman for the US-Canada task force investigating the
shootings. ``All were shot in their residences through a window or
a glass door.''
</P>
<P>
   Police fear the sniper may strike again in Canada this year,
although there is hope the massive manhunt under way might deter
what has become an annual rite of anti-abortion violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very much on alert because someone could be struck
anywhere,'' said Anne Drennan of the Vancouver Police.
</P>
<P>
   Several abortion clinics in British Columbia and Alberta closed
their doors this week for fear of attack. Meanwhile, a package of
written materials described as ``militantly anti-abortion and very
threatening'' was received Tuesday by an Ontario newspaper, the
Hamilton Spectator, raising more alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, an outspoken defender of his abortion practice, was
killed by a rifle bullet fired through the window of his home on
the night of Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Canada and the United States suspect that the abortion
doctor was killed by the same gunman, or a close confederate,
responsible for the Remembrance Day shootings that started with the
wounding of Romalis in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believe the sniper attacks are meant to make
Canada's Remembrance Day a symbolic date of mourning for aborted
fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is no question that the shootings have made
Canadian doctors providing abortions fearful and anxious, and the
procedure is becoming less readily available in Canada because of
that fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access to safe medical abortion is being threatened by
murderous attacks on doctors,''' said Henry Morgantaler, the
Canadian pro-abortion physician whose campaign led to legalization
of the procedure in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of defiance, Morgantaler, whose Toronto clinic was
heavily damaged by a bomb blast in 1992, announced he will open a
clinic offering abortions in New Brunswick on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of such clinics has become a rarity in Canada as
many doctors and health centers are fearful of offering the service
to pregnant women in a country where the procedure remains nearly
as controversial as in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many abortion clinics operate under a degree of security that is
highly unusual in a country whose violent crime rate is far lower
than in the United States. A number of abortion doctors wear
bulletproof vests and keep all windows at their homes covered with
blankets that conceal even the shadow of movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense of a reign of terror,'' said Marilyn Wilson,
executive director of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League.
``There is a special concern that younger doctors won't want to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   About 107,000 abortions are done in Canada each year, or one for
every 3.5 live births. Nearly all are paid for with tax dollars
under the country's national health system. Nontheless, the
procedure is generally available only in urban areas. One mostly
rural province, Prince Edward Island, bans doctors from terminating
pregnancies in general hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, anti-abortion protests are commonplace, clinics
providing the service are regularly picketed, and opponents argue
that doctors who perform the procedure are, in effect, setting
themselves up for attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence breeds violence, and I think there will be more
violence as long as they allow abortions,'' said Rev. James Whalen,
a Roman Catholic priest and anti-abortion activist in Ontario. ``If
you teach people in a country to accept abortion and euthanasia,
you are promoting violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1994 shooting, there have been four other attacks,
including the Slepian ambush:
</P>
<P>
   -- On Nov. 10, 1995, a sniper's bullet shattered the elbow of
Hugh Short, a gynecologist with an abortion practice, as he watched
television in the den of his home in Ancaster, Ontario. He has
retired from medicine as the result of the wound.
</P>
<P>
   -- On October 28, 1997, a gynecologist with an abortion practice
was wounded by a shot fired through a window of a home near
Rochester, N.Y. Police refuse to release the name of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   -- On November 11, 1997, Jack Fainman, 66, a Winnipeg
gynecologist, was struck in the shoulder by a bullet fired through
the window of his home. The wound forced him to abandon his
practice.

ADVERTISING: FLEDGLING AGENCY AIMS AT BIG THINKING IN SMALL
PACKAGES
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two longtime creative executives who worked at big
agencies producing campaigns for big brands such as Diet Coke and
Kentucky Fried Chicken have quietly opened their own small shop.
</P>
<P>
   Frank DeVito and Betty Fitterman, who held senior positions at
Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising, SSC&AMP;B, Lintas Worldwide and Ammirati
Puris Lintas from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, are now partners
at DeVito Fitterman Advertising in New York. The fledgling agency
is handling accounts and projects with billings equivalent to an
estimated $35 million for clients of all sizes: large (Johnson &AMP;
Johnson), medium (Franklin Electronic Publishers Inc.) and small
(the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, or
Ascap).
</P>
<P>
   The opening of DeVito Fitterman seems an exception to the
pervasive trend that has been reshaping Madison Avenue: agencies
becoming bigger to serve their continuously growing clients. But
advertising sometimes follows physics in that an action can
generate an equal and opposite reaction.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito Fitterman represents ``a counterflow,'' said DeVito, an
art director, ``in that while major corporations are thinking
globally, at the same time they're asking for fresh thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some big marketers are establishing separate, special funding
for projects,'' he added, which are often awarded to ``people like
us, who can bring big thinking to them separate from their roster
agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   And small can be beautiful in other ways, according to DeVito.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' he said, smiling, ``when the client calls and
says `What happened to our ad?' and you know what ad he's talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, said DeVito, 60, he remains respectful of the dominance
that large shops can assert over their smaller counterparts.
``Don't ever count out the big guys,'' he said, adding that
competing against them ``is what makes it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fitterman, 51, a copywriter, listed what she called the
``many benefits'' of working at a big agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a broad view, you work on lots of accounts and the
idea you have in the shower on Sunday morning can go around the
world,'' she said. ``That's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we felt it was time to move on and do our own thing,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fitterman left Ammirati Puris in 1996, a year after DeVito.
She had been a senior vice president and executive creative
director and he had been a vice chairman and the chairman of the
agency's worldwide creative council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not getting the personal reward out of the job that
matched the monetary reward,'' DeVito said, adding: ``The last
year, I was in 38 countries. It was fun and exciting, but often
lonely, waking up in the morning in a hotel room where you don't
know where you are and don't know where the bathroom is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fitterman said that after leaving Ammirati Puris, ``I
decided never to go back into advertising again.'' She paused, then
added, ``That lasted between six and nine months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One day the phone rang,'' Ms. Fitterman continued, ``and it
was Frank. He said `Let's do this,' and I said `Yes.' And he said,
`Do you mean it?'''
</P>
<P>
   The start-up of DeVito Fitterman was smoothed, DeVito said, by
the fact that both principals were ``financially secure'' after
departing Ammirati Puris.
</P>
<P>
   ``And thank you, Mr. Geier, who helped us do that,'' he added,
laughing. The reference was to Philip H. Geier Jr., chairman and
chief executive of Interpublic Group of Cos. in New York, which
owns Ammirati Puris and directed the skein of mergers that created
the agency from shops including SSC&AMP;B and Lintas Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito and Ms. Fitterman discussed their agency in a recent
interview, the first they have given since incorporating DeVito
Fitterman in June 1997. Their initial client, Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
hired them to create corporate brand advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The two ``met over a J&AMP;J ad'' at Y&AMP;R in the late '60s, Ms.
Fitterman recalled; DeVito left for SSC&AMP;B in 1984 and she followed
a year later.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito Fitterman continues to handle the corporate J&AMP;J
assignment, which has so far included emotional print
advertisements for a special issue of Newsweek magazine devoted to
``Your Child from Birth to 3'' as well as warm and fuzzy television
commercials focused on events like Mother's Day and Father's Day.
The campaign is centered on the word ``touch,'' carrying such
themes as ``Your touch and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, all the care in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, sassy humor is the hallmark of a campaign
introduced last month for Franklin, which awarded DeVito Fitterman
the consolidated assignment to develop product advertising that
also burnishes the Franklin brand image.
</P>
<P>
   For example, print ads for Rex, a line of small electronic
organizers, compare Rex with oversized electronic and paper
organizers by urging consumers to ``Lose weight ... fast!'' And a
poster showing a Rex tucked into a bikini bottom describes the
gizmo as a ``hip new organizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Cross, president and chief executive at Franklin in
Burlington, N.J., praised DeVito and Ms. Fitterman for offering
``big-company sophistication in a small-company package.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign just started to break,'' Cross said in a
telephone interview, ``but we're already getting calls and e-mail
from people saying they love the ads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've admired Frank's work for a number of years,'' he added.
``He used to do Diet Coke advertising and I used to be vice
president of marketing at Pepsi.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVito said a soft-drink account is high on the list of
wannahaves for DeVito Fitterman; the self-described ``beverage
junkie'' has worked on brands like Canada Dry, Dr Pepper and
Heineken in addition to Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pour it,'' he said, ``I've done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency is also pursuing accounts in such categories as
airlines, financial services and health care.

COURT REJECTS DALLAS INVENTOR'S BID FOR PATENT PROTECTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a
Dallas area inventor's bid for patent protection, ruling that he
waited too long after marketing his product to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling shortens the time an inventor has to perfect an
invention before applying for a patent.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Pfaff waited so long after selling his product _ a socket
to hold computer microchips during testing _ that he missed the
one-year deadline for applying for a patent, the high court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law says a patent cannot be obtained if an invention has
been on sale in this country for more than one year before the
application is filed.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaff had argued that the clock should have begun ticking later
_ after he'd perfected a working version of the device. While he
had detailed drawings of the device when he sold it to Dallas-based
Texas Instruments in April 1981 _ it took months to create a
working prototype. He didn't apply for the patent until April 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The high court rejected Pfaff's argument, saying the year begins
before an invention has been completed. In their 9-0 decision, the
justices said the clock starts when a pending invention is placed
on the market and its blueprints are sufficiently clear to enable a
skilled technician to build the product.
</P>
<P>
   Patent attorney Jay Alexander of Washington said the court's
ruling should serve as a warning to small inventors to pay
attention to patent questions before the work is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apply for a patent as soon as possible. That way you eliminate
the risk,'' said Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Large companies, by contrast, are generally well-versed in
patent law, Alexander said. Most have policies in place to ensure
they do not miss the one-year deadline for filing their
applications, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the justices upheld a federal appeals court
decision that stripped Pfaff of his patent. The U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit had ruled that Pfaff's April 8,
1981, agreement to sell 30,100 of his sockets to Texas Instruments
for $91,155 rendered his April 19, 1982, patent application invalid
due to the one-year time limit.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision marked a victory for Wells
Electronics of South Bend, Ind., which makes competing socket that
had challenged Pfaff's patent in court.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court for Northern Texas upheld the validity
of Pfaff's patent, prompting Wells Electronics to appeal to the
Federal Circuit, which hears patent cases.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court for the Federal Circuit said the clock began
when Pfaff signed the contract because his invention was
``substantially complete'' at the time of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The high court interpreted the Patent Act even more broadly,
saying the year begins when inventions that are sufficiently
described on paper are put on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The justices compared Pfaff's situation to that of Alexander
Graham Bell, who more than 100 years ago applied for his patent
before he had constructed a working telephone. The Supreme Court in
1888 upheld Bell's patent, ruling that he had described a telephone
with ``sufficient clearness and precision'' to merit the
protection.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, the high court noted that the plans Pfaff
delivered to Texas Instruments before signing the contract were
identical to those he submitted with his patent application more
than a year later. Therefore, the court concluded, Pfaff's proposed
socket product was ``ready to be patented'' at the time he reached
the agreement with Texas Instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary meaning of the word `invention' in the Patent Act
unquestionably refers to the inventor's conception rather than to a
physical embodiment of that idea,'' Stevens wrote. ``The statute
does not contain any express requirement that an invention must be
completed before it can be patented.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Their play outfits and their faces scrubbed, they
bounded out of their caseworkers' cars at the North Ward Cultural
Center here, which was decked out on this late-summer Saturday with
a big striped tent worthy of a wedding. Twenty-one children, 4 to
12, were reporting for a party _ hamburgers and hot dogs, sack
races and musical chairs, bags of goodies to be collected.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, they were here to be seen. This party was what
the New Jersey Department of Human Services calls a ``match
event,'' and the honored guests were seven adults who had completed
orientation sessions for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   While couples around the nation, in their classified ads and
``dear birth mother'' letters, plead for a baby to love, the state
of New Jersey pleads for families to love these children:
8-year-old Saraelle, looking quizzical as she peered at grown-ups
through coke-bottle glasses; Nije, also 8, smile blazing, busily
tugging his caseworker around; the brothers Milo and Omar, 12 and
10, sticking together all day, Omar in a royal blue t-shirt and
Milo in a red one that announced, ``The children are our future.''
</P>
<P>
   They were among about 100 children in foster care or group homes
who have no immediate prospects for families. The Division of Youth
and Family Services is campaigning on their behalf, with a $600,000
recruitment budget that the state provided last year and renewed
this summer: It has ads on buses and billboards, in public service
announcements and on flyers to be mailed with motor-vehicle renewal
forms. The children's pictures and profiles are published in a
glossy book (call 1-800-99-ADOPT). These are also on a web site
(http://206.228.220.32/njadopt_static/), which will soon have audio
and video clips.
</P>
<P>
   The department places about 700 children a year in permanent
homes, 85 percent to 90 percent of them ``special needs'' children
whose care continues to be subsidized: adoptive families are given
the same monthly stipend that foster parents receive until the
child is 18. Still, there are never enough parents. Donna Younkin,
the administrator of the adoption office, said New Jersey's state's
foster care population had grown 56 percent since 1994; ``we're
closing in on 3,000 kids,'' she said. Once adoptive parents are
interested and qualified, Ms. Younkin said, the social events are
among the happier methods of promoting matches. ``People get queasy
about it and say, isn't this terrible and awkward? But the kids
have a nice day out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Newark party, the hovering social workers acknowledged
the hopes and fears in play here. ``They know why they're here,''
said Zavier Mauldin. Some of them, he said, ``have been through
this over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospective parents were nervous themselves, with the
possible exception of Kendra Orta, a day-care worker, and her
husband, Orlando, who quickly fell in with bunches of kids. ``I'm
22 and my husband is 25,'' Mrs. Orta said. ``We want a family. We
decided to go this route first.'' The Ortas just moved to a
two-bedroom apartment and outfitted the bigger bedroom for their
first two children. ``We have one picked out, and we came here to
get another one,'' said Orta, a security guard who has already
advised his boss that the four-year-old boy they hope to bring home
soon will be spending time with him at work.
</P>
<P>
   Luce Ramirez, 48, who lives near the Ortas in East Orange, was
making plans for a daughter: ``I've got the school picked out, Our
Lady of Mount Carmel -- good Catholic discipline. Is this
obsessive? I already know what pediatrician to go to. I got the
name of a pediatric dentist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous,'' she added. ``I'm trying really hard not to let
my hopes get too high. What if I fall in love with this child, and
this child doesn't want any part of me?'' she mused, referring to
the face-to-face meetings that follow in the match-making.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the children, they understand, need a lot of healing.
It's a point made in the children's biographies: ``Behaviors which
Taiesha struggles with are enuresis, hiding food and acting out as
a result of past abuse,'' one says. The description of Naim, a
``mannerly and very likable'' 13-year old, notes that other
children ``have teased and ridiculed him, taken advantage of him
and even physically attacked him because of his thick glasses, poor
motor skills and low academic performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But this party was short on burdens. After the sack races and
lunch warm-up, the cupcake decorating and water-balloon lobbing, it
reached a crescendo with a boisterous musical chairs scramble to
the boom-box accompaniment of Kirk Franklin's ``Stomp.''
</P>
<P>
   As they left, the adults filled out forms on which they could
name one or two children they wanted to know more about, and
perhaps to meet again. Altogether, the seven chose 10 children.

PANTY HOSE ARE EXPENSIVE, SCRATCHY, MISERABLE _ AND SALES ARE
SAGGING
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday morning: Outspoken non-pantyhose wearer (me) begins The
Great Pantyhose Experiment. Goal: To determine whether the benefits
of wearing nylons _ i.e. look like Jamie Lee Curtis _ outweigh the
disadvantages _ i.e. feel like bratwurst.
</P>
<P>
   8:05 a.m. Search closet for hose-appropriate outfit. Find dusty
suit skirt unworn since last job interview. Rifle through dresser
drawers and locate unopened pair of ``nude'' pantyhose _
sandalfoot, light support. Attempt one-footed entry. Snag hose with
jagged edge of gnawed-on fingernail. Cuss. Begin sweating beneath
sheath of man-made material now vacuum-packed to thighs. Scowl at
husband after he admires legs for first time in months. Whine about
having to subject self to this merciless punishment.
</P>
<P>
   9:10 a.m. Politely tolerate curious stares from co-workers
demanding to know ``What's the occasion?'' Listen to every female
in office older than 45 invoke memories of garter belts and
stockings. Blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   2:30 p.m. Start feeling oddly grown-up. Clop down office hallway
in barely worn 3-year-old pumps exuding brassy confidence. Sit down
in cafeteria and cross legs, assuming ladylike demeanor. Consider
switching careers to marketing or law so would HAVE to shop at Ann
Taylor and dress like Ally McBeal.
</P>
<P>
   2:35 p.m. Realize above thought provoked by low-blood-sugar
delirium. Buy pack of M&AMP;Ms from vending machine. Yank up waistband.
</P>
<P>
   5:35 p.m. Peel off so-called second skin. Scratch legs like
flea-bitten dog. Cradle favorite jeans in arms and promise never to
betray again. Put pantyhose experiment on hold.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   There are a few women in the world who relish pantyhose. There
are a few more who don't mind them. There are millions upon
millions who would like to grab the guy who invented nylon by the
lapels and demand to know what the heck he was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Pantyhose bind. They sag. They're hot in the summer and cold in
the winter. They itch.
</P>
<P>
   The slightest of rough edges _ on fingernails, on chairs, on
file cabinets _ can turn an $8 investment into nothing more than a
handy way to store onions.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, as soon as women saw it was safe to ditch
pantyhose, thanks to the acceptance of casual business attire and
bare-legged fashion trends, they did. Sales started sliding after
1994, when the industry sold 1.6 billion pairs of sheer hosiery. In
1997, the figure had fallen to 1.3 billion, according to the NPD
American Shoppers Panel.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where innovation becomes a crucial part of marketing. In
the past few years, manufacturers have introduced body shapers,
hose that target a specific ``problem'' area (thighs, bottom, hips)
and mush it into place. Three-D stretch gets rid of the
ring-around-the-calf look. And the new ``compression'' hosiery,
like Hanes Revitalizing Collection, claims to improve circulation
in the lower limbs. (The compression squeezes feet and ankles to
prompt blood flow upward.)
</P>
<P>
   Breakthroughs notwithstanding, it's all basically torturous,
according to 100 percent of the working women we talked to at the
Fort Worth Outlet Square during a recent lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hot, they're uncomfortable, and I rip them
regularly,'' groans Kaycee Shane, a law student and part-time
intern in the U.S. Attorney's office. ``I wear them once, and I
throw them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Browsing in the Hanes outlet store, Kristi Willis and Christina
Jackson, insurance company employees, expressed similar disdain.
``They don't last very long, and they cost too darn much,'' Willis
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson admits to sometimes taking off her nylons while her boss
is at lunch. Women wear hose, she cracks, ``because it's a man's
world and they insist on it.'' She points to a pair of sheer black
thigh-highs. ``Like these. I buy these for my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, 7:45 a.m. Rouse in cold sweat, rattled from nightmare
in which all slacks hanging in closet turned to heavy-support
nylons. Notice new package of pantyhose next to bed, purchased
yesterday from local department store. Pull covers over head.
</P>
<P>
   7:50 a.m. Give in, remembering job is on line.
</P>
<P>
   8:05 a.m. File nails. Lie supine on bed and attempt to pull on
new ``compression'' hose, the industry's latest technological
advance. Wriggle, squirm, jerk. Snag in half-dozen places despite
(yes, despite!) in-home manicure. Feel like a sausage in casing.
Feel prickly sensation all up and down legs. On the other hand,
skirt seems loose; compression seems to be taking effect. Slip into
black pumps (a record two times in one month!).
</P>
<P>
   11:30 a.m. Graciously accept compliment on ensemble from
newspaper's society writer. Momentarily revisit Ann Taylor fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   11:55 p.m. Endure embarrassing catcall on street by Neanderthal
in pickup truck. Think pantyhose may present safety concern.
</P>
<P>
   1:10 p.m. Realize trips to the ladies' room taking several
minutes longer than usual. Realize I am walking like toy soldier in
compression hose, which are supposed to invigorate gams and
``enhance overall leg health.''
</P>
<P>
   5:50 p.m. Can't tell if legs are more or less invigorated than
usual. Can tell I am more aggravated than usual.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Mary Alice Smith wears pantyhose with shorts in the summer. She
buys mass quantities from the Hanes catalog _ no control top, thank
you _ and favors the patterned styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just looove pantyhose,'' says Smith, an associate professor
at Tarrant County Junior College. ``I think I was born wearing
them.'' But Smith grew up watching her mother put on makeup and
stockings every day, ``even if she was just going to sit around the
house.'' Her affection for nylons is kinda inbred.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for post-boomer women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has lost a whole generation of wearers,'' notes
NPD Group's Perry James. The company's research shows the average
age of sheer hosiery wearers has edged up to 46, from 42 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big pantyhose fan at all,'' says 26-year-old Amy
Hooper, owner of A. Hooper, one of Fort Worth's most
fashion-forward boutiques. ``The biggest plus to wearing pantyhose
is having that control top hold you in where you want to be held
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooper's customers, for the most part, don't want or don't need
``body shaping.'' And most twenty- or thirtysomething women grew up
wearing clothing much less constricting and less traditionally
feminine than the togs in their moms' closets. Plus, the look now
is barelegged. Even for winter, midlength skirts and tall boots are
far more runway-savvy than, say, black hose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever suggest wearing black hose,'' stresses Hooper.
</P>
<P>
   She does acknowledge that some businesswomen have no choice in
the matter when it comes to nylons. Hooper's advice: Pick a nude
hose (she prefers Donna Karan, The Nudes).
</P>
<P>
   ``Pantyhose are just not an essential piece in your wardrobe
anymore,'' she insists. For this season, at least.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday 8:30 a.m. Wake up late in midst of yet another
nightmare: This time, huge rip appears in $45 Austrian pantyhose
purchased at chic Dallas boutique. Oh, my _ realize I really did
buy $45 pantyhose yesterday at chic Dallas boutique in effort to
blow lid on myth that costly pantyhose are better than Target
brand. Don pair of white gloves and pull on ``Cosmetic'' color
nylons. Hmmmm. Try hard to deny noticeable difference between these
European hose and ones I've been suffering in. Admire legs.
Actually feel mobile. Actually feel comfortable. Spend next hour
searching for clothing to go with extravagant new leg wear.
</P>
<P>
   9:50 a.m. Set off to work _ very, very, very carefully.
</P>
<P>
   10:30 a.m. Wait for someone in office to notice stunning calves.
Reapply lipstick. Check hair. Wish nails were polished. Wish
earrings were bigger. Feel self being sucked into black hole of
Fashion Consciousness. Close eyes and try to picture favorite jeans
and sweat shirt.
</P>
<P>
   1:30 p.m. Can't stand it any longer. Announce to co-workers that
I am wearing $45 Austrian pantyhose soaked in lanolin for softness.
Allow lower leg to be stroked by numerous impressed women in office
who can ``sort of'' tell a difference. Insist they have GOT to try
these hose. Remember that no one I know, especially me, should be
spending $45 on a pair of nylons.
</P>
<P>
   4 p.m. Narrowly avoid running Euro hose on errant staple. Become
suddenly very tired of worrying more about pantyhose than important
things, like how to pay upcoming credit-card bill.
</P>
<P>
   6 p.m. Find self as eager to rid body of expensive pantyhose as
moderately priced ones due to overwhelming responsibility to avoid
snags. Make note to spend next available $45 on new pair of khakis.

TEXAS LAWMAKER SHUNS TV IN FIGHT TO KEEP JOB AS MAJORITY LEADER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an era when politicians live and die by
television, House Majority Leader Dick Armey has taken an unusual
approach in fighting to keep his job: No TV.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican, who faces two telegenic challengers, has
failed to make a single public appearance in the week since his
party took a drubbing at the polls. While his opponents have been
bashing him in live television interviews, Armey has been
campaigning the old-fashioned way in one-on-one telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   His low-key approach is a throwback to the days when leadership
contests were inside affairs, but the ability to perform well on
television is considered a key job requirement for House leaders in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an issue. It is something that all the members talk
about,'' said former Rep. Bob Walker, a confidant of retiring
Speaker Newt Gingrich. ``Dick has his moments on television, but
that is not one of his strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey's opponents have made that point again and again, both by
their words and by their repeated television appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communication is very key,'' Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma, a
Hall of Fame football star, said in his latest CNN interview
Tuesday. ``You can have a great message, but if you have a
messenger that people are afraid of or don't believe, you're not
going to connect.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone in the TV department, Rep. Jennifer Dunn of
Washington state declared her intention to run on CNN's Inside
Politics after hinting about it on a Sunday morning program.
</P>
<P>
   The TV-friendly pitch seems to be working with some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a new spokesman,'' said Rep. Jay Dickey of Arkansas, a
Largent backer. ``I think Dick could adjust. But when he stands up
to speak, people remember the old approach. We have to start
worrying about being liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Armey and Largent claim that they are rapidly collecting
the commitments they need to declare victory in a contest that will
be decided on Nov. 18, when the 223 House Republicans select
leaders for the new Congress. Dunn, the last to enter the race,
said she is also picking up support.
</P>
<P>
   A potential challenger, Rep. Howard McKeon of California, bowed
out and endorsed Armey Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm counting and recounting, because that's how we do these
things. But I'm pretty confident right now,'' Armey said in a
written response to questions from the Star-Telegram. ``This is a
matter of 223 people who will vote. I think it's best that we talk
directly, and hash out our differences within the family.''
</P>
<P>
   But the majority leader has failed to win backing from two
pivotal players in the leadership scramble, Rep. Bob Livingston of
Louisiana, the man in line to become House speaker, and Republican
Whip Tom DeLay of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who locked up the speaker's race Monday, told Armey
that he will stay neutral, but the two men have had a strained
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes without saying that Livingston doesn't want to spend
every day looking over his shoulder,'' said Ken Johnson, spokesman
for Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana.

<P>
   DeLay's refusal to back his fellow Texan came as no surprise
because the two conservatives have clashed repeatedly over
legislative strategy. Their relationship hit a low point last year
when DeLay's allies accused Armey of duplicity during an aborted
attempt to oust Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plotters felt they had Armey's support, the coup
fizzled when Armey reported the plan to the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one counts Armey out. The blunt-talking Texan
campaigned in 120 congressional districts and contributed $1.4
million to Republican candidates and campaign organizations in this
year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of Armey's advisers have urged him to be more
visible, Walker said the majority leader may be following the best
approach. The former Pennsylvania lawmaker has endorsed Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the less experienced candidates are going to find that
some of the time they have spent lining up television interviews
would have been better spent lining up colleagues on the
telephone,'' Walker said. ``If you're not getting your commitments,
it doesn't matter how good you are on television.''

PFIZER SAYS DRUG CAN HALT DISEASE THAT BLINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A major US pharmaceutical manufacturer and a New York foundation
Tuesday initiated a $66 million effort to attack a bacterial
disease virtually unheard of in developed countries that has left
nearly 6 million Third World residents blind and 146 million others
infected.
</P>
<P>
   A one-gram dose of an antibiotic called Zithromax given just
once a year can treat the disease, trachoma, an infection of the
upper eyelid caused by the chlamydia bacterium. People infected
develop painful, running sores on their eyelids that leave crusty
deposits on the eyelashes that, over time, scratch away their
corneas and leave them blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having sand in your eye all the time,'' said Heather
Lauver, assistant manager of corporate philanthropy for drugmaker
Pfizer Inc., which is teaming with the Edna McConnell Clark
Foundation on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the International Trachoma Initiative will seek to
eradicate trachoma in five countries, most likely Ghana, Mali,
Morocco, Tanzania, and Vietnam, identified by Harvard School of
Public Health researcher Michael Reisch as the most promising
candidates for a nationwide medical program.
</P>
<P>
   Trachoma has been found in dozens of countries, particularly in
sub-Saharan Africa, Indochina, and Iran, as well as parts of
Mexico, Brazil, and Australia. An estimated 540 million people are
at risk of developing trachoma.
</P>
<P>
   To support the program, Pfizer is donating $58 million worth of
Zithromax, and the company and the foundation are each putting in
more than $3 million to manage a comprehensive plan to eradicate
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Besides administering the antibiotic to hundreds of thousands of
people, the project will also fund eyelid repair surgery for people
with advanced trachoma, improved access to clean water and health
education, and campaigns to get people to wash their faces daily to
reduce the risk of transmission. Insects attracted to running eye
sores also spread it from person to person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concerted efforts using this strategy could readily eradicate
the world's leading cause of preventable blindness,'' said Dr.
Alfred Sommer, dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of
Hygiene and Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of Zithromax, which was introduced in 1992 and
has become the leading antimicrobial medicine in the United States,
as a cure for trachoma was shown in a 1996 study involving 10,000
Moroccans.
</P>
<P>
   The standard treatment for trachoma has involved a six-week
cycle of two daily applications of ointment. ``It's painful, and
there are a lot of problems with noncompliance,'' said Dr. Mike
Magee, Pfizer's senior medical adviser.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The first commandment for couples wanting to adopt babies is:
Put yourselves across. And they do, in spunky performances on
videotapes, in lush scrapbooks and in professional portraiture
smiling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Many speak on the Web pages that crowd electronic registries of
``waiting families.'' Gloyd and Penny, for example, say, ``We pray
daily for our birth mother and baby _ whoever and wherever they
are.'' David and Paula promise, ``This child will be overwhelmed by
love and affection.'' Rex and Carol wait, after 14 years of
marriage, with a spaniel named Brittney and a vacation home four
miles from Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   This is the essence of demand _ unhappily infertile couples _
competing for a smaller and smaller supply of white American-born
infants. It is an imbalance that professionals in the adoption
world are calling a crisis, allowing money to play a defining role
in determining who will succeed in this desperate quest for that
which cannot be legally bought or sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this marketplace, it's a sad reality,'' said Graham Wright,
president of the California Association of Adoption Agencies.
``Luck enters into it, but it's like anything else in life: If you
have enough money, you'll get what you think you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Many couples in search of a child are already depleted,
emotionally and financially, by drawn-out fertility treatments.
Still, they will pay $15,000 to $20,000 on average, even if they
have to mortgage their futures, to find their babies. Some will
spend much more before the day they appear in court to take legal
custody of their children. And a few, people who have the money for
intermediaries to do the work, pay up to $100,000 to bring home a
newborn.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption is, in a rough analogy to organ transplants, a legal
transfer not subject to purchase or bidding. Nowhere in the United
States is it legal to sell a child, and few say it should be. Nor
can anyone sell the right to be an adoptive parent: that is
conferred by the state, based on home studies conducted by social
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But scarcity has created a cast of thousands of intermediaries,
who can and do sell access to the young women who might relinquish
babies.
</P>
<P>
   Access can be sold indirectly, by an Internet service that sells
advertising space to couples, for example, or directly, by lawyers
or unlicensed brokers known as ``facilitators,'' who will either
shop couples to pregnant women or recruit those who agree to let
adoptive families be chosen for them.
</P>
<P>
   This has left only the thinnest line between buying a child and
buying adoption services that lead to a child. ``The effect is the
same,'' said Wright, whose agency, Future Families of Monterey Bay,
Calif., places older children for adoption and foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere the baby boomers set their feet, a cottage industry
springs up,'' said Bernie Riff, an adoptive father. Riff and his
wife, Vicki Young, adopted their daughter, Jessi, 2 1/2, with the
help of a facilitator after waiting a long time with an agency that
gave them, in Ms. Young's words, ``nothing but a binder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are consultants and facilitators,'' Riff said. ``There
are photographers, there are all these little marketing things.
People do videos. There's no limit to what you can spend on these
things if you're inclined to and have the resources.''
</P>
<P>
   State-licensed adoption agencies, once strictly controlled
charitable and paternalistic institutions, may be pained by the
intrusion of commerce, but now they, too, advertise on bus shelters
and billboards, and collect scrapbooks and videos from would-be
parents to show to birth mothers. They mine connections with
foreign orphanages. They do what they can do to increase their
supply of children. It is just one measure of growth within this
fragmented industry that the number of licensed child placement
agencies has increased by several hundred in just three years, to
1,764, according to the National Adoption Information
Clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   The states impose standards on child-placement agencies
requiring certified social workers to evaluate prospective parents,
counsel birth mothers and get relinquishment papers signed. They
limit payments that can go to birth mothers, who, above all, are
not supposed to profit from adoption, and they require reports to
the courts of all payments made by the adopting family.
</P>
<P>
   But the laws differ from state to state, creating a tangle that
itself keeps lawyers busy and would-be parents confounded. A few
states, like Massachusetts and Connecticut, prohibit independent
adoptions altogether; some that do allow it, like New York, hew to
the traditional model and limit lawyers' roles; California, the
most hospitable to the new entrepreneurialism, allows lawyers and
facilitators to recruit prospective birth mothers on clients'
behalf. Louisiana, known for its laxity, allows nonresidents to
adopt and to pay extensive living expenses for pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   The process, while hardly simple, is basically the same
everywhere. Every adopting couple typically begins with a home
study. If parents adopt independently, they will probably
advertise, although about a dozen states prohibit it. Pregnant
women who respond or are referred to them are screened, and
adoptive and biological parents exchange basic biographies. If all
goes well, the adoptive parents pay modest pregnancy-related
expenses for the birth mother and, shortly after birth, she legally
relinquishes the child. (If all does not go well, the biological
mother decides not to place the child, or, worse, tries to revoke
her consent later, the adoptive parents have gambled and lost.) Six
months to a year later, a court finalizes the adoption.
</P>
<P>
   An agency will bundle these services, with employees making
matches, counseling both biological parents and adopting couples,
coordinating medical care and legal services.
</P>
<P>
   The costs for domestic infant adoptions range widely. Some
people adopt infants, joyously and quickly, for $5,000 or $10,000.
They might, in an independent adoption, locate a woman in their own
state who has minimal expenses and is certain she wants to place
her child; without any legal or medical complications, the total
cost might be several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Placements by state agencies often cost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-ADOPTION-ECONOMICS-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: cost nothing. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there are couples who pay sums approaching $100,000 for a
closed adoption of a white newborn. These gray-market placements,
which usually involve questionable payments to birth mothers and
the brokers who find them, have prompted much legislation and
public attention; still, they are a tiny percentage of adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the stamp of the marketplace is apparent in one
troubling fact: In the baby bazaar, with children of varying
colors, cultures and conditions, something resembling a price
schedule has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   At many agencies, race determines fees, said William Pierce,
president of the National Council for Adoption, an advocacy group
for agencies. ``If you have 40 white couples chasing every white
newborn, you don't need a lesson in economics,'' Pierce said. ``The
only way to stay afloat is to reduce your charge for a black baby
and charge more for the white ones.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Product: Not Enough Babies To Meet the Demand &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If adoption is a growth industry, it is not because of any
significant increase in adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, according to a rare report on adoptions published by
the National Center for State Courts, the number of adoptions was
127,441, a figure that demographers believe has not changed
appreciably. The authors of the report estimated that two-thirds
were adopted by stepparents or relatives, or were older children
placed from foster-care programs.
</P>
<P>
   The other third, or about 43,000, constitute the heart of the
industry: children, domestic and foreign, placed with nonrelatives.
The National Council for Adoption estimates that infants, which it
defines as children under age 2, account for 48 percent of all
unrelated domestic adoptions or about 24,000 a year. At the same
time, according to a rough estimate by the adoption council, about
1 million families are seeking to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adoption from a domestic standpoint is in a period of
crisis,'' said Paige McCoy Smith, marketing coordinator for the
Gladney Center in Fort Worth, Texas, one of the nation's biggest
and oldest adoption agencies. Because less than 2 percent of
unmarried pregnant women are placing their babies for adoption,
they now have ``the option to be very, very selective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bartholet, a Harvard University law professor and
adoption specialist with two adopted children, agrees. Among young
pregnant women, she said, ``most of the pressure they are subjected
to is to either abort or keep.''
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, unmarried, pregnant women did not have many
options. Some went to places like Gladney or the Salvation Army's
Booth homes, where they awaited birth while social workers chose
adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1973, the year that abortion was legalized, about 9
percent of births to unmarried women in the United States resulted
in adoptions. By 1981 that percentage dropped to 4 percent, and by
1988 to 2 percent. While the number of unmarried women giving birth
has risen each year at least since 1965, the net result is a slight
decline in the number of American-born infants available for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, according to a rough estimate by the adoption
council, about 1 million families are seeking to adopt. The
old-line agencies tried to adapt by letting birth mothers choose
adoptive parents. But in the late 1970s, would-be parents began
defecting to lawyers who could help them adopt independently if
they _ or the lawyers _ could find a birth mother directly. The
scramble also invited a new type of adoption agency, promising some
kind of edge.
</P>
<P>
   American Adoptions of Overland Park, Kan., for example, has a
``traditional program'' in which pregnant women choose from an
array of profiles of families, but it advises many clients to sign
up instead for another program in which parents pay directly for
advertisements, and young women who respond are shown the profile
of that family first. In its letter to applicants, the agency says:
``Most traditional adoption programs provide the birth parents with
the opportunity to select their `ideal' family. Where does that
leave you?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Marketing: Advertising on Buses, Benches and Beyond &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Marketing came naturally to Arty Elgart, who started a
facilitation service after he adopted his son (from Gladney) 20
years ago. It was a matter of enthusiasm and altruism: Working out
of his auto-parts warehouse in Philadelphia, he made matches as a
favor for couples he knew, or friends of friends. By most accounts,
including his own, no one had seen anything quite like it before.
Elgart placed a small newspaper ad that asked, ``PREGNANT? Young
couple wishes to adopt baby. Call Mary, 289-2229.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of the sedate nonprofits that dominated the adoption
community, this crossed a line of propriety. Elgart's matchmaking
was legal, since he charged no fee and advertising was not
prohibited in Pennsylvania. But his marketing, which progressed to
benches, buses and Burger King tray liners, was called everything
from unusual to appalling.
</P>
<P>
   Elgart has long since turned his mission into a full-service
licensed adoption agency, named Golden Cradle, now in Cherry Hill,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golden Cradle started something,'' said Maxine Chalker,
executive director of Adoptions from the Heart, of Wynnewood, Pa.
When she started her agency in 1984, she said, ``in the phone book
there were maybe three ads under Adoption Services. Now there must
be 40.''
</P>
<P>
   A modest display ad for Adoptions From the Heart is among them.
The agency also advertises on bus shelters and in malls, and has
tried radio and television, though the response was disappointing.
``We're always trying to find new things,'' Ms. Chalker said. ``It
gets harder every year because of the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the competition comes from lawyers who handle
independent adoptions: ``Now everybody thinks adoption is easy
money, especially the attorneys,'' Ms. Chalker said. ``Now they're
hiring counselors to work in their offices, and setting up as
agencies without being licensed.''
</P>
<P>
   Adoptions From the Heart has 33 staff members and seven offices
in five states. The agency has an advertising budget of $371,000
this year, accounting for 16 percent of its total expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ad budget,'' Ms. Chalker mused. ``It's so embarrassing.
It's so much money, and that's just to stay in business.''
</P>
<P>
   To stay in business, Adoptions From the Heart has also extended
its connections in China and Vietnam; it has placed 114 babies from
China and 16 from Vietnam this year, compared with 47 American-born
infants. The agency charges a fee of $14,700 for placement of a
white American infant or toddler; legal fees are an additional
$2,000 to $3,000, and parents pay any medical costs not covered by
insurance. The cost of adopting from China is $17,235 and adopting
from Vietnam is $22,100.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our facilitator in Vietnam charges $10,000 per baby,'' Ms.
Chalker said. ``Can you imagine how rich she must be?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Sales Agents: Facilitators or Lawyers Help With the
Process &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The frontier state for the adoption business is California. The
state has long permitted lawyers to recruit pregnant women. Now,
facilitation services, which are unlicensed, are also recruiting
and screening birth parents, as well as coaching prospective
parents and finding them professional help.
</P>
<P>
   Facilitators operate in many states. While their activities
often come close to legal definitions of child placement, they are
generally too new or too few to prompt regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, legislation enacted last year to clarify
their role ended up legitimizing a whole new class of
entrepreneurs. Lil Snee, a facilitator in Los Gatos who co-founded
an informal trade organization, estimates that 40 to 50 are
operating in the state.
</P>
<P>
   For Ellen Roseman, a facilitator in San Anselmo, the main job is
coaching prospective parents. ``I make them read everything,'' she
said. ``It's like taking a college course.'' Then she helps them
piece together deals with pregnant women, lawyers and agencies,
often in other states. She charges a flat fee of $3,450.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-ADOPTION-ECONOMICS-ART-3RDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: of $3,450. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a recent support-group meeting at Ms. Roseman's house on a
winding lane in Marin County, casually dressed current and former
clients, many with babies in hand, exchanged stories of false
starts and disappointments. ``I think it will get easier with time
as people know what to expect, but for now, it's a free-for-all,''
said Riff, the father from Berkeley said over the potluck dinner
that followed.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Roseman, a former flight attendant and representative in
union negotiations, the enterprise is more like putting together a
business deal. ``You sit down and move around the pieces to do two
things,'' she said, ``to make sure it's legal and to save money.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not recruit pregnant women, but she gets referrals and
interviews candidates. ``To really get the birth parents ready,''
she said, ``you do what's called shaking them out of the trees. You
say, `If you have a little feeling down here telling you to keep
your baby, we've got to talk about that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roseman hounds prospective parents, too. With one, she said,
``I insisted that she hit a therapist's office two or three times a
week, get into meditation and get a massage to relieve her
anxieties.''
</P>
<P>
   Lil Snee, the Los Gatos facilitator, also does what she calls
``hand-holding,'' charging $2,900 for an 18-month contract.
Occasionally, clients pay her $95 a hour to interview a birth
mother. ``It just feels wrong'' for prospective parents to ask
questions ``about sexual partners, about how many men might be the
father of this baby,'' Ms. Snee said, so she asks the questions
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring the clients and the birth parents the kinds of
families they're looking for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That, Ms. Snee said, is her metier. ``Let's say you have a
Hispanic-black baby and you have 20 waiting families,'' she said.
``This birth mother is committed, intelligent, clean, but every
single waiting family wants an Anglo baby with blond hair. Or I
probably have about six cases where the babies are white, but maybe
the mother wanted a certain religion, or a home with no children in
the family. Maybe she did a little drugs and people are afraid of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In some states, matchmaking for a fee is illegal except by
licensed agencies. Among them is New York, where lawyers can handle
independent adoptions and advise their clients on finding pregnant
women, but not make such an introduction themselves. In New Jersey,
an individual _ say, a lawyer or social worker _ may make a match,
but may not charge for it.
</P>
<P>
   California's new law does restrict facilitators' practices. They
must identify themselves as such in their advertising and must tell
prospective parents that they are not licensed adoption agencies.
They must obtain a $10,000 insurance bond to cover claims. But the
state does not register nor license them, and it does not limit
their fees.
</P>
<P>
   Randall B. Hicks, an adoption lawyer in Riverside, Calif., and
the author of ``Adopting in America'' (Wordslinger Press, 1995)
calls facilitators ``a garage industry,'' he said, ``not licensed
nor trained to do anything.'' He also finds their fees, which can
exceed $12,000, out of line. ``They find a baby for you,'' he said,
``then they have to turn it over to a lawyer or an agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snee, who lobbied for a licensing system to give
facilitators credibility, accepts that that only lawyers can
transact the actual adoption. But she argues: ``We get so bashed.
We provide a service, and just because it involves adoption doesn't
mean we should be the saviors of the world and do everything for
free.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roseman contends that California's competitive marketplace
keeps fees down and that expenses for birth mothers are fairly
limited by the state courts. In the adoptions she handles, she
said, ``very little money changes hands.'' She earns about $100,000
a year from her business. ``This is a beautiful house in a
beautiful, expensive area,'' she said. ``But it's not from the
booty of adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana, on the other hand, ``is wide open,'' Ms. Roseman
said. ``I always joke, when I want to make a million dollars, I'm
going to open an agency in Louisiana and I'll be charging $30,000,
$40,000, $50,000. I'm going to get fat eating bonbons in
Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Factory: Low on Regulations, Louisiana Lures Many &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana is where Misty and Donnie Smoot ended up two years
ago, when an agency installed them in a slightly down-at-the-heels
apartment complex in Baton Rouge. ``I was down there the second
weekend after I found out I was pregnant,'' said Mrs. Smoot, who
lives in Nashville. Her husband added: ``They try to get you down
there and get you stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to find a birth mother anywhere in the country,
send her to live in Louisiana, pay her expenses and fees to
intermediaries, have her relinquish the child in Louisiana and
finalize the adoption there, all while living elsewhere. And some
couples who can afford it, most of them in the Northeast, do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Most states limit payments to medical, legal and strictly
defined living expenses. Louisiana does not, though all expenses
must be reported to the court that finalizes the adoption. The
state does not prohibit payments to intermediaries, and its
Department of Social Services, which regulates adoption, receives
no information on agencies' fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Smoots were recruited as birth parents for a couple whose
names they never knew. They were living in Tennessee and having
marital problems, Mrs. Smoot said, when she became pregnant.
Responding to a newspaper classified ad, they said, they spoke to a
man named Richard in Florida who explained that he had clients
interesting in adopting, and who referred them to an agency outside
Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   They were given first-class plane tickets for themselves and
their two young sons and moved into an apartment rented by the
agency, Beacon House. The agency paid rent and utilities, gave them
$150 a week for groceries and ferried Mrs. Smoot to doctor's
appointments and group meetings. Mrs. Smoot estimated that Beacon
House had 12 to 20 birth mothers in Baton Rouge while she was
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Smoots were never told much about the adoptive parents
assigned to them; they said they were given a copy of the couple's
home study and brief profile, without pictures. They spoke to the
couple once, by telephone. ``The father was the CEO of his company,
and their net worth was some ungodly number,'' Smoot said. ``The
whole home study was about money, money, money.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement unraveled when Mrs. Smoot was found to be
carrying twins. Beacon House assured them that both babies would be
adopted by the chosen parents, but the Smoots heard through the
birth-mother grapevine that, in the past, the agency had separated
twins without telling the birth parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Smoots switched agencies and went through with a semi-open
adoption, then returned to Tennessee. A month later, Beacon House
sued them for breach of a contract that obligated them to pay back
expenses if they placed their child through an agency or lawyer
other than Beacon House.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which sought $24,774, was dropped. Beacon House and
its director, Anne R. Hughes, who also acts as the agency's
attorney, declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   As the Smoots explained it, some women they met were drug users
who sought a means of support. Some never had any intention of
placing their children, Smoot said, ``but there was one girl there
who was giving up her sixth baby to Beacon House. There's several
who do that. It's like an employer-employee relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something the adopting parents need to know,'' he
continued. He said he and his wife were barely screened, either by
Beacon House or by the intermediary named Richard. ``They should
investigate the birth parents a whole lot more than they do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One source of referrals to Louisiana, according to lawyers and
investigators, was Richard Gitelman, whose facilitation service in
Florida was investigated in the 1980s after complaints were made.
The Smoots said that the ``Richard'' they talked to never gave his
last name, but several adoption professionals, who asked not to be
named, said he has referred birth parents to Beacon House.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; UNDATED: Beacon House. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gitelman is said to be favored by older, moneyed couples who
want quick, closed adoptions. Investigators have placed his fees at
$50,000 and up; Pierce at the National Council for Adoption said he
had seen a photocopy of a check written to Gitelman, with
endorsement, ``in the range of $75,000 to $90,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Gitelman, reached at his office number in Coral Springs, Fla.,
refused to discuss his fees or even to say whether he is still in
business. (His National Adoption Counseling Service was declared
inactive by the State of Florida in 1996 for failing to file its
annual report with the state.)
</P>
<P>
   Gitelman has never been convicted of anything, though he was
indicted and he agreed to a $7,500 fine and a year's probation in
Pennsylvania for interfering with the custody of a minor, a
pregnant Pennsylvania teen-ager he briefly moved to Louisiana in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Fees paid in Louisiana are difficult to track. Adoption
proceedings are sealed and courts do not submit records to state
regulators. But James Best, a district court judge in West Baton
Rouge Parish, where Beacon House is situated, said most infant
adoptions he had reviewed were smooth and unremarkable. When asked
if he had ever seen a $50,000 fee to a facilitator, Judge Best
said, ``If I ever did, I'd probably roll out of my chair and say
I'm in the wrong business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lucy McGough, a law professor at Louisiana State University
and head of the legislature's advisory committee on adoption laws,
said a few judges told her they had seen $50,000 fees and did not
know how to handle them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was infuriated,'' Ms. McGough said, ``because they were
reporting high charges and saying, `So what's it to you, Mac? All
the code says is we have to report it, and that's what were
doing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGough's committee is drawing up amendments to the adoption
laws; in a memo to the committee, Ms. McGough voiced concern over
``prime baby adoptions that can bring $75,000 to $100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she said, none of the parties are complaining: ``The
adoptive parents are happy as clams.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Market Price: Children Are Children, But Some Cost More &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For the old-line agencies in this marketplace, ``there are
Catch-22's everywhere,'' said Pierce of the National Council for
Adoption. They are torn between the principle that children should
not be discounted by race or disability and the reality that that
is how one creates a larger pool of parents. They are torn between
the principle that parenthood should not be charged for and the
reality that social services are expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies, many of which receive donations or government
subsidies, say that parents' fees could not cover their costs.
Wright in California notes that when licensed agencies work with
pregnant women, about 80 percent end up keeping their babies. And
for most agencies, he said, ``the cost of serving the 80 percent
can't be paid for by the fees of the other 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Gladney Center, fees do not come close to covering costs.
Thanks to its endowment and its large campus, where about half its
birth mothers live, Gladney can offer an array of services: three
dormitories, a health clinic, chapel, dining hall, swimming pool
and greenhouse, as well as high school and community college
courses, vocational training, legal representation and counseling
to be available for the rest of the birth mothers' lives.
</P>
<P>
   All of this costs the agency, on average, $32,000 per resident.
But Ms. Smith, the marketing coordinator, said the average
placement fee is $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many agencies, including Gladney, use sliding scales to
accommodate lower-income families. Still, Pierce said, ``the
economics of adoption is going to cause you to prefer the people
who pay the higher fee.''
</P>
<P>
   High fees help subsidize the work necessary to find homes for
hard-to-place children, at least in the agencies that undertake the
job, he said, adding that, in some states, agencies receive
``bounties'' to recruit adoptive families for children in foster
care or to place disabled children who are costly to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you have a kid who's HIV-positive in the hospital costing
$1,000 a day,'' Pierce said. ``To pay someone to find adoptive
parents is entirely reasonable, but what does that look like to the
public?''
</P>
<P>
   It may also look terrible to charge less to place minority or
special-needs children, but many agencies say they have little
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Gladney, for one, has a lower-cost program for African-American
and biracial children. ``Unfortunately, we had to create a separate
program because adoptive parents were simply not coming forward,''
Ms. Smith said. Under that program, the agency charges $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever handles them, adoptions in the over-$50,000 range almost
always involve American-born white infants. While most are
independent placements handled by lawyers, a few agencies market
themselves by at least hinting at results. Easter House, a Chicago
agency, notes in a letter to prospective parents that those
approved this year have waited an average of 34 days to be offered
a baby. The agency charges $45,000, ``plus some incidentals.''
</P>
<P>
   But high-priced agencies, whether blue-ribbon or gray-market,
have no shortage of customers. ``I hate to say this, because it's
going to sound crass,'' said Debra Harder, network director for
Adoptive Families of America, a Minneapolis-based support
organization. ``But there are people who have the basic philosophy
that the more I pay for something, the better it will be, not just
in terms of the product but in terms of appearances. It says a lot
about me if I drive a Lexus.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Imports: A Rise in Enterprise Taps Foreign Supply &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In international adoption, the scramble is entirely different:
it is for parents. The Adoptive Families of America's current
``Guide to Adoption'' contains ads for 35 agencies, 33 of which
advertise foreign programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your child is waiting for you,'' the headline on one
announces. ``We go with you to China!''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the long-established agencies involved in international
adoptions have ``an altruistic, mission-driven sense that every
child deserves a family,'' Ms. Harder said. ``Now, with additional
programs opening up in Russia and China in particular, folks are
seeing it as an entrepreneurial venture.''
</P>
<P>
   Adoption experts say international adoptions have generated lots
of new businesses, from charitable, church-affiliated agencies to
walkup offices run by people who make money change hands in
Bulgaria. Fees to foreign expediters, translators, lawyers and
orphanages are usually beyond the control of the American-based
agencies that make the placements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many prospective parents, not wanting the uncertainty of
dealing with birth mothers, never even consider domestic adoption
seriously. Adoptions from foreign countries are expected to
approach 15,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the supply in foreign countries now exceeds the demand
here. Susan Soon-Keum Cox, director of public policy at Holt
International Children's Services in Eugene, Ore., said the
increase comes largely from Eastern Europe and China. Russia, which
had no program five years ago, placed more children last year than
any other country, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As recently as five or ten years ago, there were many more
parents waiting to adopt than there were children,'' said Ms. Cox,
whose agency has placed more than 100,000 children. ``Now that's
entirely turned around. We're searching for families.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Irvin, state director of Family Adoption Consultants in
Macedonia, Ohio, is uneasy about having more children than families
waiting for placement. ``There are some real tensions now between
the child focus and the consumer orientation, the human services
model and the market forces,'' she said. ``Some families start
looking for the cheapest, the fastest, the `we promise you a child
that meets your quote-unquote specifications in so many months.'
Some of us who have been in the field for 20 years get worried
about this shift.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first commandment for couples wanting to adopt babies is:
Put yourselves across. And they do, in spunky performances on
videotapes, in lush scrapbooks and in professional portraiture
smiling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Many speak on the Web pages that crowd electronic registries of
``waiting families.'' Gloyd and Penny, for example, say, ``We pray
daily for our birth mother and baby _ whoever and wherever they
are.'' David and Paula promise, ``This child will be overwhelmed by
love and affection.'' Rex and Carol wait, after 14 years of
marriage, with a spaniel named Brittney and a vacation home four
miles from Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   This is the essence of demand _ unhappily infertile couples _
competing for a smaller and smaller supply of white American-born
infants. It is an imbalance that professionals in the adoption
world are calling a crisis, allowing money to play a defining role
in determining who will succeed in this desperate quest for that
which cannot be legally bought or sold.
</P>
<P>
   Many couples in search of a child are already depleted,
emotionally and financially, by drawn-out fertility treatments.
Still, they will pay $15,000 to $20,000 on average, even if they
have to mortgage their futures, to find their babies. Some will
spend much more before the day they appear in court to take legal
custody of their children. And a few, people who have the money for
intermediaries to do the work, pay up to $100,000 to bring home a
newborn.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption is, in a rough analogy to organ transplants, a legal
transfer not subject to purchase or bidding. Nowhere in the United
States is it legal to sell a child, and few say it should be. Nor
can anyone sell the right to be an adoptive parent: that is
conferred by the state, based on home studies conducted by social
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But scarcity has created a cast of thousands of intermediaries,
who can and do sell access to the young women who might relinquish
babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere the baby boomers set their feet, a cottage industry
springs up,'' said Bernie Riff, an adoptive father. Riff and his
wife, Vicki Young, adopted their daughter, Jessi, 2 1/2, with the
help of a facilitator after waiting a long time with an agency that
gave them, in Ms. Young's words, ``nothing but a binder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are consultants and facilitators,'' Riff said. ``There
are photographers, there are all these little marketing things.
People do videos. There's no limit to what you can spend on these
things if you're inclined to and have the resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The process, while hardly simple, is basically the same
everywhere. Every adopting couple typically begins with a home
study. If parents adopt independently, they will probably
advertise, although about a dozen states prohibit it. Pregnant
women who respond or are referred to them are screened, and
adoptive and biological parents exchange basic biographies. If all
goes well, the adoptive parents pay modest pregnancy-related
expenses for the birth mother and, shortly after birth, she legally
relinquishes the child. (If all does not go well, the biological
mother decides not to place the child, or, worse, tries to revoke
her consent later, the adoptive parents have gambled and lost.) Six
months to a year later, a court finalizes the adoption.
</P>
<P>
   An agency will bundle these services, with employees making
matches, counseling both biological parents and adopting couples,
coordinating medical care and legal services.
</P>
<P>
   The costs for domestic infant adoptions range widely. Some
people adopt infants, joyously and quickly, for $5,000 or $10,000.
They might, in an independent adoption, locate a woman in their own
state who has minimal expenses and is certain she wants to place
her child; without any legal or medical complications, the total
cost might be several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Placements by state agencies often cost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are couples who pay sums approaching $100,000 for a
closed adoption of a white newborn. These gray-market placements,
which usually involve questionable payments to birth mothers and
the brokers who find them, have prompted much legislation and
public attention; still, they are a tiny percentage of adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the stamp of the marketplace is apparent in one
troubling fact: In the baby bazaar, with children of varying
colors, cultures and conditions, something resembling a price
schedule has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   At many agencies, race determines fees, said William Pierce,
president of the National Council for Adoption, an advocacy group
for agencies. ``If you have 40 white couples chasing every white
newborn, you don't need a lesson in economics,'' Pierce said. ``The
only way to stay afloat is to reduce your charge for a black baby
and charge more for the white ones.''
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, unmarried, pregnant women did not have many
options. Some went to places like the Gladney Center in Fort Worth,
Texas or the Salvation Army's Booth homes, where they awaited birth
while social workers chose adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1973, the year that abortion was legalized, about 9
percent of births to unmarried women in the United States resulted
in adoptions. By 1981 that percentage dropped to 4 percent, and by
1988 to 2 percent. While the number of unmarried women giving birth
has risen each year at least since 1965, the net result is a slight
decline in the number of American-born infants available for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, according to a rough estimate by the adoption
council, about 1 million families are seeking to adopt. The
old-line agencies tried to adapt by letting birth mothers choose
adoptive parents. But in the late 1970s, would-be parents began
defecting to lawyers who could help them adopt independently if
they _ or the lawyers _ could find a birth mother directly. The
scramble also invited a new type of adoption agency, promising some
kind of edge.
</P>
<P>
   American Adoptions of Overland Park, Kan., for example, has a
``traditional program'' in which pregnant women choose from an
array of profiles of families, but it advises many clients to sign
up instead for another program in which parents pay directly for
advertisements, and young women who respond are shown the profile
of that family first. In its letter to applicants, the agency says:
``Most traditional adoption programs provide the birth parents with
the opportunity to select their `ideal' family. Where does that
leave you?''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing came naturally to Arty Elgart, who started a
facilitation service after he adopted his son (from Gladney) 20
years ago. It was a matter of enthusiasm and altruism: Working out
of his auto-parts warehouse in Philadelphia, he made matches as a
favor for couples he knew, or friends of friends. By most accounts,
including his own, no one had seen anything quite like it before.
Elgart placed a small newspaper ad that asked, ``PREGNANT? Young
couple wishes to adopt baby. Call Mary, 289-2229.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of the sedate nonprofits that dominated the adoption
community, this crossed a line of propriety. Elgart's matchmaking
was legal, since he charged no fee and advertising was not
prohibited in Pennsylvania. But his marketing, which progressed to
benches, buses and Burger King tray liners, was called everything
from unusual to appalling.
</P>
<P>
   Elgart has long since turned his mission into a full-service
licensed adoption agency, named Golden Cradle, now in Cherry Hill,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-ABR-ADOPTION-ECONOMICS-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: Cherry Hill, N.J. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Golden Cradle started something,'' said Maxine Chalker,
executive director of Adoptions from the Heart, of Wynnewood, Pa.
When she started her agency in 1984, she said, ``in the phone book
there were maybe three ads under Adoption Services. Now there must
be 40.''
</P>
<P>
   A modest display ad for Adoptions From the Heart is among them.
The agency also advertises on bus shelters and in malls, and has
tried radio and television, though the response was disappointing.
``We're always trying to find new things,'' Ms. Chalker said. ``It
gets harder every year because of the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the competition comes from lawyers who handle
independent adoptions: ``Now everybody thinks adoption is easy
money, especially the attorneys,'' Ms. Chalker said. ``Now they're
hiring counselors to work in their offices, and setting up as
agencies without being licensed.''
</P>
<P>
   The frontier state for the adoption business is California. The
state has long permitted lawyers to recruit pregnant women. Now,
facilitation services, which are unlicensed, are also recruiting
and screening birth parents, as well as coaching prospective
parents and finding them professional help.
</P>
<P>
   Facilitators operate in many states. While their activities
often come close to legal definitions of child placement, they are
generally too new or too few to prompt regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, legislation enacted last year to clarify
their role ended up legitimizing a whole new class of
entrepreneurs. Lil Snee, a facilitator in Los Gatos who co-founded
an informal trade organization, estimates that 40 to 50 are
operating in the state.
</P>
<P>
   For Ellen Roseman, a facilitator in San Anselmo, the main job is
coaching prospective parents. ``I make them read everything,'' she
said. ``It's like taking a college course.'' Then she helps them
piece together deals with pregnant women, lawyers and agencies,
often in other states. She charges a flat fee of $3,450.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent support-group meeting at Ms. Roseman's house on a
winding lane in Marin County, casually dressed current and former
clients, many with babies in hand, exchanged stories of false
starts and disappointments. ``I think it will get easier with time
as people know what to expect, but for now, it's a free-for-all,''
said Riff, the father from Berkeley said over the potluck dinner
that followed.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Roseman, a former flight attendant and representative in
union negotiations, the enterprise is more like putting together a
business deal. ``You sit down and move around the pieces to do two
things,'' she said, ``to make sure it's legal and to save money.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Hicks, an adoption lawyer in Riverside, Calif., and the
author of ``Adopting in America'' (Wordslinger Press, 1995) calls
facilitators ``a garage industry,'' he said, ``not licensed nor
trained to do anything.'' He also finds their fees, which can
exceed $12,000, out of line. ``They find a baby for you,'' he said,
``then they have to turn it over to a lawyer or an agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snee, who lobbied for a licensing system to give
facilitators credibility, accepts that that only lawyers can
transact the actual adoption. But she argues: ``We get so bashed.
We provide a service, and just because it involves adoption doesn't
mean we should be the saviors of the world and do everything for
free.''
</P>
<P>
   For the old-line agencies, ``there are Catch-22's everywhere,''
said Pierce of the National Council for Adoption. They are torn
between the principle that children should not be discounted by
race or disability and the reality that that is how one creates a
larger pool of parents. They are torn between the principle that
parenthood should not be charged for and the reality that social
services are expensive.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gladney Center, fees do not come close to covering costs.
Thanks to its endowment and its large campus, where about half its
birth mothers live, Gladney can offer an array of services: three
dormitories, a health clinic, chapel, dining hall, swimming pool
and greenhouse, as well as high school and community college
courses, vocational training, legal representation and counseling
to be available for the rest of the birth mothers' lives.
</P>
<P>
   All of this costs the agency, on average, $32,000 per resident.
But Ms. Smith, the marketing coordinator, said the average
placement fee is $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many agencies, including Gladney, use sliding scales to
accommodate lower-income families. Still, Pierce said, ``the
economics of adoption is going to cause you to prefer the people
who pay the higher fee.''
</P>
<P>
   High fees help subsidize the work necessary to find homes for
hard-to-place children, at least in the agencies that undertake the
job, he said, adding that, in some states, agencies receive
``bounties'' to recruit adoptive families for children in foster
care or to place disabled children who are costly to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you have a kid who's HIV-positive in the hospital costing
$1,000 a day,'' Pierce said. ``To pay someone to find adoptive
parents is entirely reasonable, but what does that look like to the
public?''
</P>
<P>
   It may also look terrible to charge less to place minority or
special-needs children, but many agencies say they have little
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Gladney, for one, has a lower-cost program for African-American
and biracial children. ``Unfortunately, we had to create a separate
program because adoptive parents were simply not coming forward,''
Ms. Smith said. Under that program, the agency charges $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   In international adoption, the scramble is entirely different:
it is for parents. The Adoptive Families of America's current
``Guide to Adoption'' contains ads for 35 agencies, 33 of which
advertise foreign programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your child is waiting for you,'' the headline on one
announces. ``We go with you to China!''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the long-established agencies involved in international
adoptions have ``an altruistic, mission-driven sense that every
child deserves a family,'' Ms. Harder said. ``Now, with additional
programs opening up in Russia and China in particular, folks are
seeing it as an entrepreneurial venture.''
</P>
<P>
   Adoption experts say international adoptions have generated lots
of new businesses, from charitable, church-affiliated agencies to
walkup offices run by people who make money change hands in
Bulgaria. Fees to foreign expediters, translators, lawyers and
orphanages are usually beyond the control of the American-based
agencies that make the placements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many prospective parents, not wanting the uncertainty of
dealing with birth mothers, never even consider domestic adoption
seriously. Adoptions from foreign countries are expected to
approach 15,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the supply in foreign countries now exceeds the demand
here. Susan Soon-Keum Cox, director of public policy at Holt
International Children's Services in Eugene, Ore., said the
increase comes largely from Eastern Europe and China. Russia, which
had no program five years ago, placed more children last year than
any other country, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As recently as five or ten years ago, there were many more
parents waiting to adopt than there were children,'' said Ms. Cox,
whose agency has placed more than 100,000 children. ``Now that's
entirely turned around. We're searching for families.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Irvin, state director of Family Adoption Consultants in
Macedonia, Ohio, is uneasy about having more children than families
waiting for placement. ``There are some real tensions now between
the child focus and the consumer orientation, the human services
model and the market forces,'' she said. ``Some families start
looking for the cheapest, the fastest, the `we promise you a child
that meets your quote-unquote specifications in so many months.'
Some of us who have been in the field for 20 years get worried
about this shift.''

Clinton impeached, but they are bitterly divided over everything

POOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASK COURT TO PLACE N.H. IN RECEIVERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ A group of school districts Tuesday asked the
state Supreme Court to throw the state into receivership if the
governor and Legislature fail to replace an unconstitutional school
funding system that relies almost entirely on local property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The motion also asks the court to appoint a special mediator to
broker an agreement between struggling school districts and a state
government unwilling to alter its unique tax structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schools won't close. The receiver would temporarily make
sure the funds are available to them,'' said Andru Volinsky, lead
lawyer for the Claremont Coalition of property-poor school
districts. The districts filed suit in 1991 challenging the
legality of a system that allows property tax rates to vary as much
as 16-fold between communities.
</P>
<P>
   Last December the court ordered the state to act by April 1 to
ensure that taxes are levied proportionally and that all children
are provided equal access to an adequate education. After April 1,
the current system will become illegal and towns will no longer be
able to collect the school portion of property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have agonized over how to comply with the order
without enacting a statewide sales, property, or income tax,
something Democratic Governor Jeanne Shaheen has sworn to veto.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the state asked the high court to allow the current
system to remain in place for two more years to give lawmakers more
time to craft a compromise and to win over legislators who feel
that the best response is to ignore the court order.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who feel, `Let's tell the court to pound
sand,''' said House Speaker Donna Sytek, a Republican who like
Shaheen opposes any broad-based tax.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen does not believe the court has the authority to appoint
a receiver empowered to spend money that under the state
constitution must be raised and appropriated by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think they don't,'' Shaheen said in a press conference late
Tuesday afternoon that set the stage for a head-to-head clash
between the two branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   The team of lawyers representing poor school districts
disagrees. When constitutional amendments conflict, for example, it
is up to the court, not the Legislature or governor to decide which
provision prevails, Volinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The state's request for a two-year delay would provide Shaheen
and legislators the time needed to bring a constitutional amendment
before voters, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do that, the optimal time for people to vote on the
ballot option would be at the same time as the February 2000
presidential primary,'' Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers find it unlikely that the court would grant a
lengthy extension, however, particularly since past amendment
proposals, including one backed by Shaheen, would have erased or
severely limited the court's authority over school funding issues.
</P>
<P>
   The school districts are asking that until the Legislature acts,
the state's entire $943 million general fund be used to finance
public education. Asked if doing that would mean that state
government would have to shut down, Volinsky replied, ``It would if
the Legislature doesn't act.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kirsten Albrecht and Alexis Oberdorfer are both 27-year-olds
born of one black parent and one white parent, and adopted, as
infants, by white parents.
</P>
<P>
   But in their strongly opposing views, they almost embody the
whole debate over transracial adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albrecht, who heads the Transracial Adoption Group, a Los
Angeles advocacy group with a roster of about 10,000 transracially
adopted adults, sees cross-race adoptions as a way to help black
children whose parents cannot raise them move into middle-class
American society, and, by creating interracial families, to help
that society become more accepting of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real aspect of transracial adoption being the most
successful affirmative action program of the 1970s, putting a large
number of black and biracial children into middle class families in
suburban settings,'' Ms. Albrecht said. ``I don't see it as a
second-best alternative, but as an inherently good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oberdorfer, a child-protection worker in Minneapolis, sees
those same adoptions as inherently difficult.
</P>
<P>
   She vividly recalls her childhood discomfort of feeling
different from her classmates, fantasizing about having long blond
hair, asking her mother when she would turn white _ and a painful
period in college when rumors spread that she was racist against
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have faces that reflected who I was,'' Ms. Oberdorfer
said. ``I remember how I would slump down, embarrassed when they
would talk about Africa or slavery in high school, and I could feel
everyone looking at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was in denial a lot. When people asked how if felt to be
black, I would say I'm as much white as black, why are you focusing
on the black.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oberdorfer has two white siblings who are her parents'
biological children and a half-black, half-Vietnamese brother,
found abandoned and starving in Vietnam, who was adopted at age 3
and had serious behavioral problems as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oberdorfer, who remains close to her parents and believes
they did their best in rearing her, rethought her racial identity
when she went to Tanzania in her sophomore year of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a turning point for me, the first time I felt part of
something,'' she said. ``I felt welcomed to the motherland. And
that experience of feeling welcomed, feeling part of something is
one I have only when I travel, whether it's in Africa or in Cuba.
Here, the whites don't consider me white, and the blacks often
don't consider me black.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Ms. Oberdorfer reached a more wrenching turning point,
one so significant in adoption circles that it became the basis for
a training exercise in a North American Council on Adoptable
Children curriculum for those considering transracial adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my grandfather died, the inheritance he left to my
brother and me was only half of what he left to our two white
siblings,'' Ms. Oberdorfer said, her voice beginning to waver and
her eyes filling. ``This is hard for me to talk about. My
grandparents never wanted me to be adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Oberdorfer's family ultimately equalized the
inheritance payments, the hurt remains, as do Ms. Oberdorfer's
conflicting feelings about transracial placement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When parents think about transracial adoption,'' she said,
``they need to think about whether their child will have role
models, peers in school or church, and whether they're willing to
take active steps to make their environment one that will be
comfortable for that child.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albrecht's group estimates that 175,000 black or biracial
children have been adopted in the United States by white parents
since 1968, but that there were fewer than 1,000 such adoptions
nationwide last year. But the only real certainty is that the
numbers have waxed and waned sharply in response to changing
attitudes and laws.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Child Welfare League of America's 1994 survey
of 22 state agencies, about 4 percent of domestic adoptions are
transracial. But a 1991 study by the Council on Adoptable Children
found that among private agencies that depend on fees from adopting
families, half of the African-American infants and two-thirds of
the Hispanic infants were placed in white homes.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies that specialize in placing black children have a far
more consistent record of finding African-American homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot depends on the agency's attitudes,'' said Toni
Oliver, founder and executive director of Roots, an Atlanta agency
that places children in foster care. ``I get calls from people
saying they can't find an African-American family for an
African-American child, because there aren't any in their state. I
say, `Oh, really, then where did that child come from?' And then
it's clear that they don't think of the community the child came
from as a source of worthwhile families.''
</P>
<P>
   Several studies over the last two decades have found that most
children adopted across racial lines do well in life, in both
professional achievement and personal satisfaction, and remain
close to their families. But while most studies find no significant
difference between the overall well-being of those adopted
transracially and those adopted into families of the same race,
some studies have picked up subtler indications that transracial
adoptees are more conflicted about racial identity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albrecht, adopted by two white divinity students active in
the civil rights movement, said she had not felt that conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was really positive that my parents hadn't gone
through the painful personal racial experiences that you go through
in this country,'' she said. ``They taught me that I could do and
be anything, because coming from white middle-class families, that
was their perception. And I think it was better than making me
feel, as some black parents do, that I'd always have to work harder
in a racist world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albrecht said that she did experience racism, ``but I came
home to a family that was in tune with being able to talk about
those things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always a little impatient when a prep-school educated,
law-school educated transracial adoptee working in one of the top
law firms says it was so terrible that he never learned to deal
with racism,'' Ms. Albrecht said. ``I think it's an advantage that
he learned to function in the world of power.''

NEW ADOPTIVE FAMILIES ARE REDRAWING RACIAL BOUNDARIES

<P>
   Until he was 3 years old, Ryan Golden had his own understanding
of race: boys were white like him, he figured, and girls, like his
African-American sister, Nikki, had dark skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, one day, he was in the bath with Nikki and
another girl and he had the realization: not all girls are black,''
said Ryan's mother, Kathy Golden, whose North Olmstead, Ohio,
family has grown to include two younger Hispanic girls, Abby and
Jenna.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 15 and 16, Ryan and Nikki are far more sophisticated
about race, but still casual about the differences between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so used to being a minority in a white school, it's not a
big deal,'' said Nikki, the outgoing one. ``Some people make
comments, like `You act like you're white.' And I say, `That's
really dumb. You can't act like a color.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good answer,'' said Ryan, smiling approvingly at his sister.
</P>
<P>
   When Bernie and Kathy Golden first contacted adoption agencies,
in 1981, they were told that the wait for a healthy white infant
would be eight years _ but much less for a child from another
country, or of another race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started down the track for a child from India, expecting to
get a child in February 1982, but instead, the agency called and
told us about Nikki,'' said Ms. Golden, 40. ``I was pregnant with
Ryan when we got the call, but I didn't tell them, because I knew
we wanted Nikki. Race was never an issue for us. I don't know why,
given that we're both Irish Catholics brought up in a very white
world. But we just thought, yeah, we can do this. My parents were
less comfortable with the idea, but that vanished the minute we
stopped by their house on the way home with Nikki and opened up the
baby blanket.''
</P>
<P>
   While multiracial living is almost a hallmark of the Tiger Woods
generation, it is families like the Goldens, with children of a
different heritage from their parents, that play it out on the most
intimate level.
</P>
<P>
   Such families are both a measure of, and a response to, a
changing social climate that has begun to melt some of the
boundaries that define racial territory.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of interracial and interethnic marriages has been
rising steadily for decades, according to the Census Bureau, and in
a test of new forms allowing people to check more than one race,
many people under 18 used that option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the whole notion of race is becoming more fluid,'' said
Claudette Bennett, chief of the bureau's racial statistics branch.
</P>
<P>
   But the process of choosing a child _ and which categories of
children to consider _ spotlights a family's deepest feelings about
race and culture. So it should be no surprise that race shapes the
adoption marketplace, as witness the bald fact that white children
usually cost more than black children, and that in the world of
international adoptions, Africa is almost ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 5,000 children were adopted from Europe,
more than 6,000 from Asia and exactly 182 from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a variety of reasons why people go to China for a
child,'' said Randall Kennedy, a Harvard Law School professor who
often writes about race. ``Part of it is that they can close their
eyes and imagine themselves the parents of a little Chinese girl,
but not of Shaniqua with the kinky hair. But another part, which
I've had white friends talk about, was the worry that given the
debate over transracial adoption, they'd be looked at coldly by
African-Americans if they adopted a black child.''
</P>
<P>
   Race also plays a role in decisions regarding the largest pool
of adoptable children, the 100,000 children in foster care in the
United States who need new parents. The black children who make up,
on average, 44 percent of those in state care are slower to be
adopted than the 41 percent who are white.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have families who say I'll take Hispanic, American Indian,
anything but black,'' said Joyce Wadlington, who is in charge of
recruiting adoptive families at the Cleveland child-welfare agency.
``I don't know exact numbers, but I'd say only about 5 percent of
the white families coming in are interested in black children.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons that American families turn to
international adoption rather than the public agencies that handle
foster care. For one, foster children are generally older, and most
people are looking for infants. Then, too, many foster children
come with siblings. Some white families say they have been
discouraged from seeking to adopt foster children of another race.
And many would-be parents worry about the lingering effects of the
abuse or neglect that landed the child in state custody, and the
possibility of the biological family's reappearance.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as though the universe of adoption comprises two
worlds _ one filled with couples looking for a healthy infant to
make them a family, and the other with older children in foster
care looking for parents _ whose orbits rarely connect.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there has been increasing recognition that
children benefit from feeling connected with their heritage. But
when the child's background is different from the parents', that is
a more complicated, and more self-conscious process. Though every
adopted child must deal with individual identity questions, those
who are adopted across race or culture lines also grapple with the
issue of group identity.
</P>
<P>
   The issues range from the cosmic to the quotidian: What if a
child adopted from Guatemala avoids the two other Hispanic children
in his class and says he hates the Spanish-speaking stores and
restaurants his adoptive parents seek out? Will a Chicago synagogue
be a comfortable place for a Chinese girl's bat mitzvah?
</P>
<P>
   Or, for the Goldens, who live in a mostly white suburb west of
Cleveland and run a wholesale window-covering business, how does a
white family learn about black hair care?
</P>
<P>
   ``When Nikki was a little baby, with little curls all over,''
Ms. Golden said, ``I took her downtown to a black hair shop, put
her down and said, `You have to help me learn.' They taught me
about oiling the hair, they taught me everything I needed to know.
By now, I can do extensions.''
</P>
<P>
   The deeper questions of racial identity are not so easily
answered. For the children adopted from overseas, there are new
institutions to bolster that connection. Korean adoptees can take
their pick of support groups, culture camps and guided homeland
tours of their birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   For American black and Hispanic children adopted into white
families, there are fewer formal supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do it yourself,'' said Ms. Golden, whose family
provided foster care three years ago for a biracial brother and
sister, until the sister's behavior problems became too disruptive.
``When Nikki was little, we would get together informally with
other white families who had black kids. And even now that they're
teen-agers, they stay in touch. It is important to have a racial
identity. Nikki was 4 or 5 when she started calling herself black.
We'd never told her she should call herself black, but she
identified that way very early.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-ABR-ADOPTION-RACE-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: very early. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Goldens agree that, when possible, a child should be placed
with a racially matched family. But they also say that their mixed
family has changed them profoundly, giving them a window on a world
in which differences are genuinely celebrated and race need not be
a divisive force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming a multiracial family opens up your eyes to the
richness and beauty of all that diversity,'' Ms. Golden said. ``We
celebrate Cinco de Mayo, we have black baby dolls, we have Hispanic
dolls. It's really transformed me. I'm much more aware of all kinds
of prejudice. I used to be a person who couldn't talk to someone
without blushing. I was really shy. But when someone in Bible
school calls your daughter a nigger, you have to confront them.''
</P>
<P>
   For one week in July, Camp Idhuhapi, a YMCA camp in the
Minnesota woods west of Minneapolis, becomes Camp Tiger, a place
where dozens of teen-agers adopted from Korea gather to explore
their cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining hall, David Gross and Mia White are making mahndu,
Korean dumplings, spooning the meat filling into egg roll wrappers
and sealing the edges, while they talk about who has the neatest
dumplings and who did not answer whose letters over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   It is desultory conversation, but the setting carries a profound
charge for the young people who come, year after year, to spend a
week with others who share their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Tiger is led by David Yoon. Mr. Yoon, whose parents are
Korean, was born and reared in Detroit and has been bridging the
gap between Korea and the United States, adoption and immigration,
since his first trip to culture camp after fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to my first culture camp, I thought it would be
very different to be with adopted kids,'' said Yoon, now a
24-year-old high school teacher in New Orleans. ``And the family
life is very different. But there is a lot that is the same about
the experience of being Korean in America. That's the common
ground. I saw one girl arrive yesterday, with fear in her eyes, and
I knew she had never seen so many Koreans in one place before.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Camp Tiger participants said that while they enjoyed
the Korean cultural activities, what drew them to culture camp was
less what they did there than simply being with others who were
like them, in a way that their parents were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to an all-white school, and I've had my share of people
make fun of me,'' David White said. ``All my friends are Caucasian.
It's a tough life to be by yourself. I come here, and I remember
how beautiful Asian can be. It makes you feel better to be in an
environment where everyone knows what you've been through.''
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of culture camps scattered across the nation,
most of them for Koreans, the largest, and oldest, group of
international adoptees. Camps have sprung up for Romanian, Russian
and Chinese adoptees, including day programs for those too young
for sleepaway camp. In Minnesota, there were four Korean culture
camps this summer, plus Celebrate Romania weekend, and La Semana
Culture Camp for families who have adopted Latin American children.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Tiger, while the teen-agers ate the Korean dinner they
had prepared, the parents who help out at camp talked about the
questioning their children had gone through, about the daughter who
said she would marry a ``regular'' _ that is, white _ boy because
it was easier, the son who only wants to date Asian girls and the
daughter who lay sobbing on the bed, asking why she had to look so
different that no one would date her.
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop to the singing and cooking and games, the campers
share stories of being mistaken for the only other Asian around, of
wondering whether colored contact lenses would help them fit in, of
having people they considered friends make insensitive remarks
about their having slanted eyes or a flat face.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the older campers, and counselors, also Korean adoptees,
said their parents had done a wonderful job of raising them and of
encouraging their connection to Korea: many learned of culture camp
while attending Korean dance classes or support group meetings.
</P>
<P>
   On a Friday afternoon in May 1996, the caseworker for Luis, a
10-year-old Puerto Rican boy, picked him up at school on
Manhattan's Lower East Side and took him to a spacious beige stucco
home in a New York suburb, where Charlotte and Scott, a white
couple who wanted to adopt him, were waiting to show him his new
room in his new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in with nothing but the clothes on his back,'' said
Charlotte, who asked that only first names be used to protect Luis.
``It's a day you never forget. You have this kid who crosses your
threshold, who all his life had been told to hate white people,
who's very vulnerable, and you immediately feel that he belongs to
you. He's upset, he's crying, and you have to comfort him, but he
doesn't know what to say, and you don't know what to say. What we
ended up with, what we talk about a lot, is how many changes he's
gone through, and how scary and confusing it must be. Then we went
to the Gap and bought him some clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis remembers the day, too. ``When they picked me up, I didn't
want to go,'' he said. ``They had to strap me down in the van. I
cried and did all that baby stuff. I'd never been in a house
before. I wasn't used to all the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, at 13, just back from a whale-watching camp, his
adoption finalized, Luis has a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels wonderful,'' he said simply, smiling out from the
flying-saucer toy he has stretched to frame his face like a
neon-pink crown. ``I trust them more, we talk more, we do things
together. They're my parents. Parents are someone that watches you,
that grounds you, and they're also friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis may not have come as far as children adopted
internationally, but his journey across ethnic and class lines has
been just as dramatic. Born in poverty on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan, Luis spoke Spanish until he was 5 and started school.
That was also the year he was removed from his parents' home, and,
after being shuttled around in foster care briefly, placed with a
Puerto Rican foster mother nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Luis knew little beyond his own neighborhood, and when he
arrived, Charlotte and Scott say, there was a lot of talk about
``you white people.'' They have tried to support Luis' sense of
himself as Puerto Rican, although, Scott said, none of the positive
stereotypes of Puerto Rican life _ extended family, strong sense of
religion, good food _ resonated with Luis' early experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted Puerto Rican food, so we ran around getting
recipes,'' Charlotte said. ``But when we served it, he'd say he
didn't like rice or beans or peppers. It turned out what he meant
he wanted was McDonald's. One Puerto Rican friend suggested a very
simple thing: if he says he wants to be a scientist, we say
something like, `The world needs more Puerto Rican scientists.'''
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic differences were never a serious issue in Luis'
adoption, and that seems right to Charlotte and Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in an absolutely ideal world, where you would be
deciding which of many families should get to adopt a child, all
this racial stuff, about providing direct role models to help kids
develop self-esteem, would make sense,'' said Scott, who, sensing
Luis' craving for adult attention, spends an enormous amount of
time coaching his soccer team, helping with homework, even watching
him play video games. ``But the basic thing every child needs is an
emotional foundation, and finding someone who will be there for
that is a far more important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis seems solidly and happily in place with Charlotte and
Scott, at ease performing on the piano or arguing with his parents
about which room he can use to watch ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing, actually, the thing he can't disentangle in
his mind, is sorting out what's race and what's wealth,'' Charlotte
said. ``It's confusing. I travel a lot for work, so we took him to
Russia, and now he thinks that's what white kids do. For us, this
has all the rewards of any kind of parenting, like when he was at
camp, and he called and told us everything he was doing. That's
what's thrilling, being included in his life. There are these very
touching moments, like when we go to Boston Market, and he insists
that we get the family meal.''

ADVERTISING: FLEDGLING AGENCY AIMS AT BIG THINKING IN SMALL
PACKAGES
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating to correct slug)   (dal) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two longtime creative executives who worked at big
agencies producing campaigns for big brands such as Diet Coke and
Kentucky Fried Chicken have quietly opened their own small shop.
</P>
<P>
   Frank DeVito and Betty Fitterman, who held senior positions at
Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising, SSC&AMP;B, Lintas Worldwide and Ammirati
Puris Lintas from the 1970s through the mid-1990s, are now partners
at DeVito Fitterman Advertising in New York. The fledgling agency
is handling accounts and projects with billings equivalent to an
estimated $35 million for clients of all sizes: large (Johnson &AMP;
Johnson), medium (Franklin Electronic Publishers Inc.) and small
(the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, or
Ascap).
</P>
<P>
   The opening of DeVito Fitterman seems an exception to the
pervasive trend that has been reshaping Madison Avenue: agencies
becoming bigger to serve their continuously growing clients. But
advertising sometimes follows physics in that an action can
generate an equal and opposite reaction.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito Fitterman represents ``a counterflow,'' said DeVito, an
art director, ``in that while major corporations are thinking
globally, at the same time they're asking for fresh thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some big marketers are establishing separate, special funding
for projects,'' he added, which are often awarded to ``people like
us, who can bring big thinking to them separate from their roster
agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   And small can be beautiful in other ways, according to DeVito.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' he said, smiling, ``when the client calls and
says `What happened to our ad?' and you know what ad he's talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, said DeVito, 60, he remains respectful of the dominance
that large shops can assert over their smaller counterparts.
``Don't ever count out the big guys,'' he said, adding that
competing against them ``is what makes it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fitterman, 51, a copywriter, listed what she called the
``many benefits'' of working at a big agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a broad view, you work on lots of accounts and the
idea you have in the shower on Sunday morning can go around the
world,'' she said. ``That's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we felt it was time to move on and do our own thing,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fitterman left Ammirati Puris in 1996, a year after DeVito.
She had been a senior vice president and executive creative
director and he had been a vice chairman and the chairman of the
agency's worldwide creative council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not getting the personal reward out of the job that
matched the monetary reward,'' DeVito said, adding: ``The last
year, I was in 38 countries. It was fun and exciting, but often
lonely, waking up in the morning in a hotel room where you don't
know where you are and don't know where the bathroom is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fitterman said that after leaving Ammirati Puris, ``I
decided never to go back into advertising again.'' She paused, then
added, ``That lasted between six and nine months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One day the phone rang,'' Ms. Fitterman continued, ``and it
was Frank. He said `Let's do this,' and I said `Yes.' And he said,
`Do you mean it?'''
</P>
<P>
   The start-up of DeVito Fitterman was smoothed, DeVito said, by
the fact that both principals were ``financially secure'' after
departing Ammirati Puris.
</P>
<P>
   ``And thank you, Mr. Geier, who helped us do that,'' he added,
laughing. The reference was to Philip H. Geier Jr., chairman and
chief executive of Interpublic Group of Cos. in New York, which
owns Ammirati Puris and directed the skein of mergers that created
the agency from shops including SSC&AMP;B and Lintas Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito and Ms. Fitterman discussed their agency in a recent
interview, the first they have given since incorporating DeVito
Fitterman in June 1997. Their initial client, Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
hired them to create corporate brand advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The two ``met over a J&AMP;J ad'' at Y&AMP;R in the late '60s, Ms.
Fitterman recalled; DeVito left for SSC&AMP;B in 1984 and she followed
a year later.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito Fitterman continues to handle the corporate J&AMP;J
assignment, which has so far included emotional print
advertisements for a special issue of Newsweek magazine devoted to
``Your Child from Birth to 3'' as well as warm and fuzzy television
commercials focused on events like Mother's Day and Father's Day.
The campaign is centered on the word ``touch,'' carrying such
themes as ``Your touch and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, all the care in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, sassy humor is the hallmark of a campaign
introduced last month for Franklin, which awarded DeVito Fitterman
the consolidated assignment to develop product advertising that
also burnishes the Franklin brand image.
</P>
<P>
   For example, print ads for Rex, a line of small electronic
organizers, compare Rex with oversized electronic and paper
organizers by urging consumers to ``Lose weight ... fast!'' And a
poster showing a Rex tucked into a bikini bottom describes the
gizmo as a ``hip new organizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Cross, president and chief executive at Franklin in
Burlington, N.J., praised DeVito and Ms. Fitterman for offering
``big-company sophistication in a small-company package.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign just started to break,'' Cross said in a
telephone interview, ``but we're already getting calls and e-mail
from people saying they love the ads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've admired Frank's work for a number of years,'' he added.
``He used to do Diet Coke advertising and I used to be vice
president of marketing at Pepsi.''
</P>
<P>
   DeVito said a soft-drink account is high on the list of
wannahaves for DeVito Fitterman; the self-described ``beverage
junkie'' has worked on brands like Canada Dry, Dr Pepper and
Heineken in addition to Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pour it,'' he said, ``I've done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency is also pursuing accounts in such categories as
airlines, financial services and health care.

SENIORS GET BOOST IN FIGHT AGAINST DRUG BENEFIT CAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Giving a ray of hope to seniors, the federal government
gave Medicare health maintenance organizations in Massachusetts an
unusual chance Tuesday to delay their plans to cap prescription
drug benefits for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The move was welcomed by advocates for seniors as an opportunity
to persuade HMOs to extend unlimited drug benefits for at least one
year instead of capping them beginning Jan. 1, as the health plans
have announced recently.
</P>
<P>
   So far, two big health plans, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Massachusetts and Tufts Health Plan, have indicated they were
willing to extend benefits for another year if Harvard Pilgrim
Health Care also agreed to do the same. But Harvard Pilgrim Health
Care Tuesday refused to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   Most HMOs in the state decided to proceed with limiting drug
coverage after a federal judge last month struck down a
Massachusetts law _ the only one of its kind in the country _
requiring Medicare HMOs to offer seniors a plan with unlimited drug
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, advocates and various politicians have feverishly
lobbied health plans to agree to a one-year moratorium on capping
drug benefits while policymakers try to hammer out a more permanent
solution to helping seniors pay for increasingly expensive
medications. Some health plans declined to offer a moratorium,
saying that the federal government locked them into the limited
benefits they had filed in May with &UR;  &LR;  the US Health Care Financing
Administration, the agency that regulates Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tuesday, HCFA, in a meeting with five health plans, opened the
door to a reprieve for seniors by saying that Massachusetts HMOs
have until Nov. 17 to change their drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But the opportunity is double-edged, because it also gives
HMOs a chance to scale back drug coverage as well as expand it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It's hopeful,'' said Clare D. McGorrian, attorney with
Health Law Advocates, a public interest law firm. ``Now there's
nothing in the way for HMOs to do the right thing. But it could
also go either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert A. Berenson, director of HCFA's Center for Health
Plans and Providers, said that while health plans are now free to
cut back their drug coverage, he encouraged them to offer the
unlimited drug benefit. &UR;  &LR; ``We were providing them with the
opportunity to provide a more generous drug benefit, but what they
do will be up to them,'' Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by HCFA's announcement, state Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, state Senator Mark Montigny
and Gov. Paul Cellucci have renewed their calls for a one-year
moratorium on capping drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to HMO executives Tuesday, Harshbarger said, ``I ask
you to do what is right for the elders of Massachusetts and
reinstate the unlimited drug benefit by taking advantage of this
golden window of opportunity that HCFA is providing to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said, ``It's clear that HMOs can voluntarily provide
full drug benefits to senior citizens. Every Medicare HMO in our
state should agree to provide these benefits. Seniors citizens
urgently need this coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources at Blue Cross and Tufts said the HMOs are willing to
consider a one-year moratorium if all health plans agree, but
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Fallon Community Health Plan and
United HealthCare of New England Tuesday declined to comment
specifically &UR;  &LR; Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are assessing the situation,'' said Patti Embry-Tautenhan,
a spokeswoman at Harvard Pilgrim. ``We're in the evaluation mode
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross, which has promised to set up a foundation to pay for
the medication of its seniors in Blue Care 65, said through
spokeswoman Susan Leahy, ``Specific plans are under review.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wardle, senior vice president of United, which has proposed
a $300-a-year limit on drug benefits for each beneficiary, said his
company will consider changing its proposed drug benefits, but
would not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon spokeswoman, Candy Race, said, ``We're evaluating our
options and we won't have an announcement for at least another 48
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Indeed, Fallon has the most to gain from HCFA's decision.
Until now, Fallon was the only HMO with plans to offer unlimited
drug benefits in 1999. The Worcester-based HMO feared that it would
be inundated with sick seniors with higher medical costs if it
remained the only HMO offering unlimited drug benefits. HCFA's
ruling now lets Fallon change that.

<P>
   Until he was 3 years old, Ryan Golden had his own understanding
of race: boys were white like him, he figured, and girls, like his
African-American sister, Nikki, had dark skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, one day, he was in the bath with Nikki and
another girl and he had the realization: not all girls are black,''
said Ryan's mother, Kathy Golden, whose North Olmstead, Ohio,
family has grown to include two younger Hispanic girls, Abby and
Jenna.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 15 and 16, Ryan and Nikki are far more sophisticated
about race, but still casual about the differences between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so used to being a minority in a white school, it's not a
big deal,'' said Nikki, the outgoing one. ``Some people make
comments, like `You act like you're white.' And I say, `That's
really dumb. You can't act like a color.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good answer,'' said Ryan, smiling approvingly at his sister.
</P>
<P>
   When Bernie and Kathy Golden first contacted adoption agencies,
in 1981, they were told that the wait for a healthy white infant
would be eight years _ but much less for a child from another
country, or of another race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started down the track for a child from India, expecting to
get a child in February 1982, but instead, the agency called and
told us about Nikki,'' said Ms. Golden, 40. ``I was pregnant with
Ryan when we got the call, but I didn't tell them, because I knew
we wanted Nikki. Race was never an issue for us. I don't know why,
given that we're both Irish Catholics brought up in a very white
world. But we just thought, yeah, we can do this. My parents were
less comfortable with the idea, but that vanished the minute we
stopped by their house on the way home with Nikki and opened up the
baby blanket.''
</P>
<P>
   While multiracial living is almost a hallmark of the Tiger Woods
generation, it is families like the Goldens, with children of a
different heritage from their parents, that play it out on the most
intimate level.
</P>
<P>
   Such families are both a measure of, and a response to, a
changing social climate that has begun to melt some of the
boundaries that define racial territory.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of interracial and interethnic marriages has been
rising steadily for decades, according to the Census Bureau, and in
a test of new forms allowing people to check more than one race,
many people under 18 used that option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the whole notion of race is becoming more fluid,'' said
Claudette Bennett, chief of the bureau's racial statistics branch.
</P>
<P>
   But the process of choosing a child _ and which categories of
children to consider _ spotlights a family's deepest feelings about
race and culture. So it should be no surprise that race shapes the
adoption marketplace, as witness the bald fact that white children
usually cost more than black children, and that in the world of
international adoptions, Africa is almost ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 5,000 children were adopted from Europe,
more than 6,000 from Asia and exactly 182 from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a variety of reasons why people go to China for a
child,'' said Randall Kennedy, a Harvard Law School professor who
often writes about race. ``Part of it is that they can close their
eyes and imagine themselves the parents of a little Chinese girl,
but not of Shaniqua with the kinky hair. But another part, which
I've had white friends talk about, was the worry that given the
debate over transracial adoption, they'd be looked at coldly by
African-Americans if they adopted a black child.''
</P>
<P>
   Race also plays a role in decisions regarding the largest pool
of adoptable children, the 100,000 children in foster care in the
United States who need new parents. The black children who make up,
on average, 44 percent of those in state care are slower to be
adopted than the 41 percent who are white.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have families who say I'll take Hispanic, American Indian,
anything but black,'' said Joyce Wadlington, who is in charge of
recruiting adoptive families at the Cleveland child welfare agency.
``I don't know exact numbers, but I'd say only about 5 percent of
the white families coming in are interested in black children.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons that American families turn to
international adoption rather than the public agencies that handle
foster care. For one, foster children are generally older, and most
people are looking for infants. Then, too, many foster children
come with siblings. Some white families say they have been
discouraged from seeking to adopt foster children of another race.
And many would-be parents worry about the lingering effects of the
abuse or neglect that landed the child in state custody, and the
possibility of the biological family's reappearance.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as though the universe of adoption comprises two
worlds _ one filled with couples looking for a healthy infant to
make them a family, and the other with older children in foster
care looking for parents _ whose orbits rarely connect.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption professionals say that many Americans have a
romanticized image of overseas orphanages, and an enormously
negative view of foster care _ the system this nation turned to in
preference to orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are choosing international adoption because they
think that the children available overseas won't be abused, won't
be from a dysfunctional family, will be from a better background
than the children in foster care here, that's not necessarily going
to be true,'' said Nancy Ward, a supervisor at the Children's Home
Society in Minneapolis, which handles many international adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Until the political opening of Russia in the early 1990s, most
children adopted internationally were Asians placed in white homes,
with Korea providing the largest contingent. But last year, for the
first time _ despite extensive publicity about emotional problems
among children adopted from Russian and Rumanian orphanages _ the
largest group, nearly 4,000 children, came from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always before, international adoption meant interracial
adoption,'' said Barbara Irvin, of Family Adoption Consultants,
outside Cleveland. ``In the good old days, I would stand up and
tell families doing intercountry adoption that they were about to
become a walking advertisement for interracial living, that they
would never walk into McDonald's unnoticed again. But that's less
true now.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-ADOPTION-RACE-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: true now.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Irvin said, however, that she was ``not always sure that
people who adopt a Caucasian child from Russia understand the
intercultural aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That child is Russian,'' she said, ``just like a Korean child
is Korean, and all children, whether or not they look different
from their parents, are curious about their background.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there has been increasing recognition that
children benefit from feeling connected with their heritage. But
when the child's background is different from the parents', that is
a more complicated, and more self-conscious process. Though every
adopted child must deal with individual identity questions, those
who are adopted across race or culture lines also grapple with the
issue of group identity.
</P>
<P>
   The issues range from the cosmic to the quotidian: What if a
child adopted from Guatemala avoids the two other Hispanic children
in his class and says he hates the Spanish-speaking stores and
restaurants his adoptive parents seek out? Will a Chicago synagogue
be a comfortable place for a Chinese girl's bat mitzvah?
</P>
<P>
   Or, for the Goldens, who live in a mostly white suburb west of
Cleveland and run a wholesale window-covering business, how does a
white family learn about black hair care?
</P>
<P>
   ``When Nikki was a little baby, with little curls all over,''
Ms. Golden said, ``I took her downtown to a black hair shop, put
her down and said, `You have to help me learn.' They taught me
about oiling the hair, they taught me everything I needed to know.
By now, I can do extensions.''
</P>
<P>
   The deeper questions of racial identity are not so easily
answered. For the children adopted from overseas, there are new
institutions to bolster that connection. Korean adoptees can take
their pick of support groups, culture camps and guided homeland
tours of their birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   For American black and Hispanic children adopted into white
families, there are fewer formal supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do it yourself,'' said Ms. Golden, whose family
provided foster care three years ago for a biracial brother and
sister, until the sister's behavior problems became too disruptive.
``When Nikki was little, we would get together informally with
other white families who had black kids. And even now that they're
teen-agers, they stay in touch. It is important to have a racial
identity. Nikki was 4 or 5 when she started calling herself black.
We'd never told her she should call herself black, but she
identified that way very early.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Debate: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pros and Cons &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Of Racial Matching &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Recent changes in federal law have re-ignited a longstanding
debate over racial matching, an issue still throbbing with the
passions released in 1972, when the National Association of Black
Social Workers declared that placing black children in white homes
was a form of racial and cultural genocide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Congress passed the Multiethnic Placement Act, making
it illegal to delay placing a child to find a racially matched
family, and emphasizing the need to recruit more minority adoptive
families. Two years ago, the law was changed again, making it
illegal to use race as a routine consideration in placing children.
</P>
<P>
   While the laws were touted in Congress as a means of cutting the
time children spend in foster care, many experts say that it is the
lack of interested families, not policies favoring racial matching,
that delays placement of older, dark-skinned children. The main
impact of the law, they say, will be to facilitate white families'
private adoptions of biracial infants.
</P>
<P>
   Many social workers of all races still believe that, when
possible, racial matching is in the child's best interest. But many
are confused about when and how to consider race in placements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a mixed message in the policy,'' said Madelyn
Freundlich, of the Evan Donaldson Adoption Institute in New York.
``On one hand, race and culture shall not be considered. On the
other, there shall be a lot of outreach to find minority families.
No wonder people who place children are very nervous about what to
say, worrying that they may be making a misstep, or being
scrutinized in such a way that it's a no-win situation to talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the concern is a growing body of legal battles,
including one now dragging through the Rhode Island courts, in
which white foster families and black blood relatives fight over a
child.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ward, who worked in the Detroit child welfare system before
going to Minneapolis, said her experience had convinced her that it
was difficult for white families to meet the needs of black
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be so in Europe, where the racism is different, but
here, I don't think most families are equipped to give kids the
coping skills they will need,'' she said. ``The history of racism
against blacks in this country is so deep, so ugly and so violent.
It's not that we don't have racism against Asians or Hispanics, or
that it's benign, or that white families are any better equipped to
help a Korean child fit in with Koreans, but in this society, that
has less severe consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you close your eyes and listen to African-American adults
who were raised in white families,'' Ms. Ward said, ``you would
think they were white. Things like that make it hard for them to
identify with the African-American community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goldens agree that, when possible, a child should be placed
with a racially matched family. But they also say that their mixed
family has changed them profoundly, giving them a window on a world
in which differences are genuinely celebrated and race need not be
a divisive force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming a multiracial family opens up your eyes to the
richness and beauty of all that diversity,'' Ms. Golden said. ``We
celebrate Cinco de Mayo, we have black baby dolls, we have Hispanic
dolls. It's really transformed me. I'm much more aware of all kinds
of prejudice. I used to be a person who couldn't talk to someone
without blushing. I was really shy. But when someone in Bible
school calls your daughter a nigger, you have to confront them.''

   &UR; Bound by Heritage: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bridging the Gaps &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; At Culture Camp &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For one week in July, Camp Idhuhapi, a YMCA camp in the
Minnesota woods west of Minneapolis, becomes Camp Tiger, a place
where dozens of teen-agers adopted from Korea gather to explore
their cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In the dining hall, David Gross and Mia White are making mahndu,
Korean dumplings, spooning the meat filling into egg roll wrappers
and sealing the edges, while they talk about who has the neatest
dumplings and who did not answer whose letters over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   It is desultory conversation, but the setting carries a profound
charge for the young people who come, year after year, to spend a
week with others who share their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Tiger is led by David Yoon. Mr. Yoon, whose parents are
Korean, was born and reared in Detroit and has been bridging the
gap between Korea and the United States, adoption and immigration,
since his first trip to culture camp after fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to my first culture camp, I thought it would be
very different to be with adopted kids,'' said Yoon, now a
24-year-old high school teacher in New Orleans. ``And the family
life is very different. But there is a lot that is the same about
the experience of being Korean in America. That's the common
ground. I saw one girl arrive yesterday, with fear in her eyes, and
I knew she had never seen so many Koreans in one place before.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-ADOPTION-RACE-ART-3RDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: place before.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Camp Tiger participants said that while they enjoyed
the Korean cultural activities, what drew them to culture camp was
less what they did there than simply being with others who were
like them, in a way that their parents were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to an all-white school, and I've had my share of people
make fun of me,'' David White said. ``All my friends are Caucasian.
It's a tough life to be by yourself. I come here, and I remember
how beautiful Asian can be. It makes you feel better to be in an
environment where everyone knows what you've been through.''
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of culture camps scattered across the nation,
most of them for Koreans, the largest, and oldest, group of
international adoptees. Camps have sprung up for Romanian, Russian
and Chinese adoptees, including day programs for those too young
for sleepaway camp. In Minnesota, there were four Korean culture
camps this summer, plus Celebrate Romania weekend, and La Semana
Culture Camp for families who have adopted Latin American children.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Tiger, while the teen-agers ate the Korean dinner they
had prepared, the parents who help out at camp talked about the
questioning their children had gone through, about the daughter who
said she would marry a ``regular'' _ that is, white _ boy because
it was easier, the son who only wants to date Asian girls and the
daughter who lay sobbing on the bed, asking why she had to look so
different that no one would date her.
</P>
<P>
   As a backdrop to the singing and cooking and games, the campers
share stories of being mistaken for the only other Asian around, of
wondering whether colored contact lenses would help them fit in, of
having people they considered friends make insensitive remarks
about their having slanted eyes or a flat face.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the older campers, and counselors, also Korean adoptees,
said their parents had done a wonderful job of rearing them and of
encouraging their connection to Korea: many learned of culture camp
while attending Korean dance classes or support group meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several said wistfully that they had sometimes wished for
parents of their same culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had kind of an identity crisis in junior high school, after
a bunch of Hmong families moved into my neighborhood,'' said Eva
Margolis, a counselor who is a student at Occidental College in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the Hmong students, speaking Hmong with their
parents, being who they were being, I was really jealous. For a
while, I just wanted to hang out with the Hmong kids and their
parents, and I kept thinking what it would be like if I had parents
who were the same as me. That's when I started teaching myself
Korean. I do think the best thing is if Korean kids could be
adopted in Korea. But that would only work if that culture changed
enough so that they would be accepted.''

   &UR; Bound by Choice: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Tough Journey &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To a New Home &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On a Friday afternoon in May 1996, the caseworker for Luis, a
10-year-old Puerto Rican boy, picked him up at school on
Manhattan's Lower East Side and took him to a spacious beige stucco
home in a New York suburb, where Charlotte and Scott, a white
couple who wanted to adopt him, were waiting to show him his new
room in his new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in with nothing but the clothes on his back,'' said
Charlotte, who asked that only first names be used to protect Luis.
``It's a day you never forget. You have this kid who crosses your
threshold, who all his life had been told to hate white people,
who's very vulnerable, and you immediately feel that he belongs to
you. He's upset, he's crying, and you have to comfort him, but he
doesn't know what to say, and you don't know what to say. What we
ended up with, what we talk about a lot, is how many changes he's
gone through, and how scary and confusing it must be. Then we went
to the Gap and bought him some clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis remembers the day, too. ``When they picked me up, I didn't
want to go,'' he said. ``They had to strap me down in the van. I
cried and did all that baby stuff. I'd never been in a house
before. I wasn't used to all the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, at 13, just back from a whale-watching camp, his
adoption finalized, Luis has a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels wonderful,'' he said simply, smiling out from the
flying-saucer toy he has stretched to frame his face like a
neon-pink crown. ``I trust them more, we talk more, we do things
together. They're my parents. Parents are someone that watches you,
that grounds you, and they're also friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis may not have come as far as children adopted
internationally, but his journey across ethnic and class lines has
been just as dramatic. Born in poverty on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan, Luis spoke Spanish until he was 5 and started school.
That was also the year he was removed from his parents' home, and,
after being shuttled around in foster care briefly, placed with a
Puerto Rican foster mother nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Luis knew little beyond his own neighborhood, and when he
arrived, Charlotte and Scott say, there was a lot of talk about
``you white people.'' They have tried to support Luis' sense of
himself as Puerto Rican, although, Scott said, none of the positive
stereotypes of Puerto Rican life _ extended family, strong sense of
religion, good food _ resonated with Luis' early experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted Puerto Rican food, so we ran around getting
recipes,'' Charlotte said. ``But when we served it, he'd say he
didn't like rice or beans or peppers. It turned out what he meant
he wanted was McDonald's. One Puerto Rican friend suggested a very
simple thing: if he says he wants to be a scientist, we say
something like, `The world needs more Puerto Rican scientists.'''
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic differences were never a serious issue in Luis'
adoption, and that seems right to Charlotte and Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in an absolutely ideal world, where you would be
deciding which of many families should get to adopt a child, all
this racial stuff, about providing direct role models to help kids
develop self-esteem, would make sense,'' said Scott, who, sensing
Luis' craving for adult attention, spends an enormous amount of
time coaching his soccer team, helping with homework, even watching
him play video games. ``But the basic thing every child needs is an
emotional foundation, and finding someone who will be there for
that is a far more important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little demand for children like Luis, older children in
foster care, who often have medical or emotional problems.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500,000 children in state care nationwide, about 100,000
need adoptive homes. But in 1995, the last year for which
statistics are available, only 27,000 were adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do this because it's where the need is
greatest,'' Charlotte said. ``Most of our friends thought we were
crazy. Adopting an older child from foster care is not something
people like us are supposed to do. There's an assumption that
you're doing this because of infertility, which was not our
situation. And there's a perception that all the kids in foster
care are crack babies who are going to grow up to be drug
addicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, 38, the research director for an educational media
company, and Scott, 39, a pension-fund manager who had worked in a
summer camp for emotionally disturbed teen-agers, knew not to
expect an easy adjustment, immediate bonding or perfect behavior.
</P>
<P>
   And it has often been rocky. At the beginning, especially, Luis
had frequent rages, in which he would call them names, fight or
break a window.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first came, he was suspended from school for getting
in a fight,'' Charlotte said. ``I thought, `Oh my God, he'll be
marked for life as the bad kid from the city.' But he's very
sociable. And he made friends very quickly. He's an amazing kid.
He's amazingly resilient.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-ADOPTION-RACE-ART-4THTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: amazingly resilient.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even for a resilient child _ and determined parents _ the long
adoption process took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about adjusting to the child, which is certainly
an issue, but far more agonizing was having this bevy of social
workers and others in your life, and having the adoption, which we
were told would take about six months, stretch out to two years,''
Charlotte said. ``Until the adoption was finalized, we were just
foster parents, and if we went out of state, even to Newark
airport, we had to get permission. If he needed medical care, like
when he got the chicken pox, we couldn't take him to our doctor, we
had to go to the clinic where they took Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, around the time the adoption was finalized, Luis'
behavior took a nose dive after having smoothed out some.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a really bad few months there, remember?'' Scott asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Luis says. ``I try not to remember bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was about the adoption being finalized,'' his
father says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Luis says. ``It took, like, duh, 20 years. It was
weird, to think that I was going to be changed forever. I didn't
think it was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After the adoption, Luis went for the first time to visit his
previous foster mother, wearing his soccer gear and showing off the
trappings of his new life.
</P>
<P>
   He seems solidly and happily in place with Charlotte and Scott,
at ease performing on the piano or arguing with his parents about
which room he can use to watch ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing, actually, the thing he can't disentangle in
his mind, is sorting out what's race and what's wealth,'' Charlotte
said. ``It's confusing. I travel a lot for work, so we took him to
Russia, and now he thinks that's what white kids do. For us, this
has all the rewards of any kind of parenting, like when he was at
camp, and he called and told us everything he was doing. That's
what's thrilling, being included in his life. There are these very
touching moments, like when we go to Boston Market, and he insists
that we get the family meal.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bound by Blood: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2 Kinds of Family &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fight Over Boy &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If there is any single case that illustrates the intricacies of
how the Multiethnic Placement Act affects adoptions, it may be In
Re Justin, which has been making its tortured way through the Rhode
Island courts for more than two years _ half the lifetime of the
brown-skinned boy at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Justin was born to a Hispanic father and a 17-year-old black
mother who was living in foster care with an aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was 13 months old, Justin has lived with Ronald and
Sharon Lapierre, foster parents who are white, and Eric, an older
boy they had previously adopted out of foster care. The Lapierres
want to adopt Justin, too, and the Rhode Island Department of
Children, Youth and Families has approved their petition to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But Justin's extended family wants him back. Justin's
grandmother, Linda Saxon, expressed interest in adopting Justin
soon after he was taken from his mother, who had a history of drug
abuse. But in 1996, Ms. Saxon died of a heart attack. Justin's
caseworker took him to the funeral, and after the service,
Christine Thompson, Justin's cousin and godmother, told the
caseworker that she wanted the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The fight for Justin has become a Solomonic tug of war: The
Lapierres argue that Justin's solid attachment to them must not be
disturbed, and that the research points to good outcomes for
transracial adoptees. Insofar as they raise the race issue, it is
to stress that under federal law, racial-matching policies are
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thompson does not frame the case as a racial one, but argues
that blood ties are paramount, that religion and heritage _ a word
some see as a stand-in for race _ must be considered, and that the
state public welfare office has unfairly failed to consider
Justin's extended family members as candidates to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   The competing claims are so strong that some experts in the case
recommended an unusual open adoption, with the Lapierres adopting
and Ms. Thompson having the right to visit. But Rhode Island law
makes no provision for such a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The case sounds many of the themes that mark the short history
of transracial adoption. Until the civil rights movement, most
adoption agencies did not serve African-Americans, and black
children whose parents could not raise them were generally cared
for, informally, by relatives or neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget that adoption agencies didn't start working with
black families until the late 1950s and 1960s,'' said Carol
Williams, who heads the Children's Bureau of the United States
Department of Health and Human Services. ``Then, with the civil
rights movement, there got to be a significant amount of placement
across racial lines, in the era of love is all you need. It was in
reaction to that history of exclusion, and that idea of color
blindness, that the National Association of Black Social Workers
said that identity is important, that race matters.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, when public welfare agencies pulled away from
transracial adoption, white families complained that
racial-matching policies were keeping them from parenting children
who needed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a predictable swing of the pendulum that got us to the
Multiethnic Placement Act, and then the amendments,'' Ms. Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth-Arlene W. Howe, of Boston College Law School, sees the new
laws as a way to give white parents easier access to the growing
number of babies born to unmarried white mothers and black fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new law on racial matching is really about helping white
parents to assert their right to adopt whatever child they
select,'' said Professor Howe, who has testified for Ms. Thompson
in the Justin case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thompson, a single 27-year-old credit specialist who lives
in Cranston, R.I., stresses her continued relationship with Justin
while he lived with his mother, then in supervised visits she and
the mother made while he lived with the Lapierres, and finally, in
a few overnight visits from Justin that she was granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying a white family should never adopt a black
child,'' said Ms. Thompson, who was last allowed to see Justin in
March, ``but here you have a child whose blood relatives want him,
relatives who can give him a true sense of belonging. There are
thousands of children in foster care who desperately need adoptive
families. Why are they trying to take this child, whose family
wants him? Frankly, I can't imagine a case in which the headline
would read, `State Favors Black Foster Parents Over White Blood
Relatives.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Lapierres' lawyer, Keven McKenna, said that as foster
parents, his clients may not speak to the media. But they have
assembled an impressive list of experts on transracial adoption to
testify for them in the closed-court hearings that will soon yield
a decision one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transracial adoption is a tremendously complicated issue,''
said Kennedy, one of two Harvard Law School professors who provided
testimony backing the Lapierres. ``You're talking about kids,
you're talking about groups. And one of the uglier things that's
not often spoken of that's also going on is resentment of white
yuppie infertile couples. I've had people come up and say, `How can
you defend these people _ they've got everything else, now you want
them to have our children.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But what we're talking about is who is `our children,'''
Kennedy said. ``Black children, American children, all children?
When people talk about how tough it was growing up in a mixed-race
family, I always ask, compared to what? Weren't there any
advantages? Don't people growing up in a mixed-race family get a
different view of human possibility?''

WITH A CLICK, A NEW ERA OF MUSIC DAWNS
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 15.) 
(dal) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A specter is haunting the music business: the
prospect of listeners getting the music they want directly from the
Internet, free of charge. Right now, all it takes to make a
recording executive nervous is the mention of MP3, a powerful piece
of software that allows users to zap music all over the Internet,
unchecked and untithed.
</P>
<P>
   For utopians, MP3 is a way to liberate music from the clutches
of gatekeepers and profiteers, and perhaps to return music to its
intangible essence. But the recording business sees MP3 as a
Pandora's box of copyright destruction, unleashing anarchy and
piracy while robbing musicians of royalties and record labels of
capital.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, both sides are correct. There's bound to be serious
legal scuffling between people who own copyrights and people who
believe in the hacker credo that information wants to be free.
</P>
<P>
   Yet recorded music is considerably more than a corporate revenue
source, and the implications of digital distribution go far beyond
the particulars of software and gadgets and royalty collection. For
listeners, music has never been about its physical form, but about
what's in the grooves or magnetic particles or digital pits; it's
the information, not the plastic. Digital distribution can turn
that sentiment into a reality. And that shift could alter the way
music is made, released, sold, stored and valued.
</P>
<P>
   It will affect everyone from listeners to musicians to
record-store clerks to manufacturers of CD shelves, and it will
certainly disrupt the routines that have grown over a century of
recorded music. It means listeners can have more choices while
musicians may get away with making fewer of them. It means recorded
music will be more accessible but also, perhaps, less respected and
inviolable. Music that isn't in solid form may just not seem as
significant as those antique CDs. It could move closer to the
spontaneity of live performance, but it will also demand less of a
commitment. Instead of a lifelong companion, music could be a
one-click stand.
</P>
<P>
   Music has been inextricable from technology from the moment
someone tapped together two particularly resonant sticks. And in
the last century, the technology of recorded music _ microphones,
cylinders, 78-rpm disks, LPs, cassettes, CDs _ has affected
everything from the length of songs to the lineup of ensembles to
the environments that music is made for. Where would psychedelia be
without headphones or hip-hop without booming car stereos?
</P>
<P>
   The way music reaches the public also affects its development,
because listeners as well as musicians are shaped by what they get
a chance to hear; in the past, that often meant songs geared above
all to the perceived needs of radio programmers. The Internet has
already changed the prospects for listeners who might once have
been condemned to the offerings of a local Top 40 radio station,
MTV and a few stores at the mall; now, Internet radio stations
offer a world of options.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, purchasing music has been a more serious
undertaking than simply tracking it down. High CD prices discourage
people from owning music they might have liked, even if they can
find the recording. But digital distribution almost certainly will
change the way people buy music. The new model could be like a
jukebox, with listeners paying for each song or group of songs they
download. Better yet, it could resemble cable television, with
subscribers paying a monthly fee for all the music they want to
download, and revenues distributed on the basis of popularity. (Of
course, with MP3 around, other listeners may just head for free
sites and nab what they can.)
</P>
<P>
   If monthly subscribers could download a song or an album on a
whim _ not just to hear it once but to replay it often enough to
understand it _ general listeners' tastes could broaden and budding
musicians could learn new vocabularies. The process wouldn't
necessarily build new Top 10 hits, which would still need mass
broadcast exposure. But it could make all sorts of niche-music
purveyors happy. And it would be likely to prove that people's
tastes aren't as constricted as radio formats pretend they are.
</P>
<P>
   For people with the right kind of equipment, free Internet music
is already here. MP3 is just one form of digital distribution of
music; the other two widely used methods, called Liquid Audio and
a2b, offer more control to the people making the music files
available, notably by eliminating unauthorized copies. What makes
MP3 appealing, however, is its absence of constraints; it puts
users in charge.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 (short for MPEG-1, Layer 3) is what computer types call a
compression algorithm. It shrinks packages of information, making
it practical to send them across the Internet. Computer programs,
video clips or songs _ any digital information _ can then be
decompressed upon arrival for playback. MP3 is part of Windows 98,
and it's widely available from sites on the Internet; it's on its
way to ubiquity.
</P>
<P>
   While a standard music CD holds 650 megabytes of information, or
about 77 minutes of music, using MP3 the entire Beatles catalog can
be packed onto one CD-ROM. The watchdogs at the Recording Industry
Association of America have found such a disk offered for sale, a
blatantly illegal bootleg. Still, MP3 music isn't by definition
illegal. One enterprising company, MusicMatch Inc., has packed 152
songs from independent (read: mostly unsigned and eager for
attention) bands onto a CD-ROM that's perfectly legit.
</P>
<P>
   But the wider significance of digital distribution is that the
actual CD-ROM will be unnecessary. (Think of the ecological
benefits of having fewer plastic CD's or cassettes in the world.)
Try an Internet search for ``MP3'' and your favorite band, and
you're likely to turn up MP3 songs just waiting to be downloaded
directly to your hard drive. Listen to them, save them or erase
them; it's no big deal. Some may be concert recordings or other
rarities, while others come directly from commercial CDs, processed
through MP3 programs that are delicately named ``rippers.'' At the
moment, most home computer users still find MP3 unwieldy; even
compressed songs take considerable time to download through
ordinary telephone lines and modems. But on college campuses and
other places where computers hook up to the Internet through fast
T-1 connections, music via MP3 is a fact of life. The rest of us
will have to wait until we get cable modems, which speed up
Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   For the recording business, true panic set in when a company
named Diamond Multimedia announced it was bringing out a portable
MP3 player this month for about $200, the same price as the first
Walkmans. Instead of carrying around a computer for playback, MP3
users will have a pocket-size gadget; input the MP3 files and hit
the highway or the beach. The recording-industry association
obtained a temporary restraining order on the MP3 player, charging
that it was a bootlegging machine, but the manufacturers prevailed
in a higher court by arguing that it's only a playback device, not
a recorder.

CENSUS CHIEF DECRIES DELAY IN APPROVAL OF COUNT METHOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The new director of the US Census Bureau said
Tuesday the continuing political fight over how to conduct the 2000
Census endangers the agency's ability to take an accurate count of
all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the decision is delayed, the more difficult it will
be to conduct something of this magnitude,'' said Kenneth Prewitt,
who was appointed by President Clinton in May and confirmed by the
Senate just before it adjourned last month. ``Time is the only
resource you can't make up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau's method of counting people in 2000 has turned
into a huge brouhaha between Democrats and Republicans on Capitol
Hill. In October, Clinton and House GOP leaders agreed to disagree
in the 1999 catch-all spending bill by funding the bureau only
through June 15 and giving Congress eight more months to resolve
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Supreme Court will hear arguments Nov. 30
on whether the Census Bureau may use statistical sampling, or
estimating, in its 2000 count. Historically, the agency has
depended entirely on a head-by-head enumeration to get census data,
and two lower courts have ruled this year that it is illegal to do
it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   By its own estimation, the Census Bureau in 1990 missed about 10
percent of the US population, with the most dramatic undercount
among African-Americans and Hispanics. The agency was charged with
finding a more accurate and inexpensive way to do the census in
2000; its solution was sampling.
</P>
<P>
   But because census data determines how the 435 House seats will
be divided among the states, members of Congress care deeply about
the count and changes in the populations of the districts that
elected them. The White House expects sampling would count more
minorities, who traditionally vote Democratic. Many Republicans see
sampling as a way for Democrats to cook the census books and then
redraw what are now GOP districts.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said it is ``very, very far-fetched'' to suggest the
Census Bureau, a highly technical and professional bureaucracy,
could or would manipulate the samples to produce data to please
Democrats. ``No good statistician doesn't believe in sampling; it's
an oxymoron,'' said Prewitt, noting that the agency itself has
sampled the population in different surveys for years.
</P>
<P>
   But a decennial census is a multibillion-dollar undertaking that
recruits a 250,000-member army of enumerators and can take a decade
to plan. The problem for Prewitt is that his agency must be ready
on April 1, 2000, to kick off the census, which must be completed
by Dec. 31, 2000. Yet for the foreseeable future the administration
and the Congress will be at odds over how it will be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-December, Prewitt told reporters Tuesday, the bureau will
produce a blueprint for a traditional enumeration and follow-up
survey to gauge the undercount in the event the Supreme Court
disallows sampling or the GOP-led Congress passes a law barring
census sampling for reapportionment purposes. The White House has
asked for an expedited court decision; it is not expected before
March.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt, an Illinois native who headed the National Opinion
Research Center at the Univeristy of Chicago and has authored a
dozen books on social science, said he would not second-guess the
legal and political wrangling or predict whether the new GOP House
leaders would temper their opposition to sampling. But he
emphasized that every day of delay risks a Census Bureau less
prepared for its enormous task.
</P>
<P>
   One example, Prewitt said, is the design of the census telephone
system. Under a traditional headcount, which requires census takers
to make many calls to verify addresses and locate people, the
bureau needs a phone system that handles more outgoing than
incoming calls. A census with sampling would require just the
opposite, since the public theoretically would be calling in more
often to discuss survey questions. He said the telephone system
alone takes a year to set up.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over methodology has also caused the bureau to put a
hold on plans for its census-awareness advertising campaign, he
said, because no one is sure exactly what the campaign should
direct the public to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain point these decisions add up, in money and in
taking an accurate census,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans wanted the bureau's funding to end in March,
forcing a political showdown then. But Clinton pressed for and won
June 15, putting more pressure on agency planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Director Prewitt is worried, he really needs to talk to
Bill Clinton,'' said Christin Tinsworth, a spokeswoman for GOP
Representative Dan Miller of Florida, chairman of the census
subcommittee and a sampling foe. ``We want a good relationship with
the new director, but there's a concern that the administration has
put so much emphasis on sampling as the panacea that it's hard for
them to back down.''

 UNDATED: a recorder.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sooner or later, the hardware won't matter. Digital players _
whether they use MP3 or some other format _ will be in people's
pockets, and songs will be instantly available.
</P>
<P>
   Digital distribution is likely to revolutionize the economics of
the music business. Some advantages of large recording companies,
like their centralized manufacturing and distribution and their
domination of retail display space, vanish if the Internet becomes
the main outlet for music. With current mail-order Internet stores
like CDnow, an album on Kill Rock Stars Records can already have
the same visibility as one on Columbia or Atlantic. Of course,
without the cost of manufacturing a recording and getting it to a
store, music could also be made available at lower prices. But that
would cut profits.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies fear that with boundless free music around,
people are going to be less willing to pay $17 for 10 songs on a
CD. Their worries may be slightly exaggerated. Up to a point,
people don't shop for music like buying groceries; people are
looking for a specific performer and a specific song; they won't
change brands for a better price. But if superstar albums can be
duplicated and sent over the Internet via MP3, with no way of
collecting royalties or profits, who's going to finance the next
million-dollar recording projects and video clips? Expect recording
companies to push their music even harder for soundtracks,
commercials and other uses that will generate licensing fees
upfront. And expect the more greedy musicians to start thinking
``hit jingle'' as well as ``hit single.''
</P>
<P>
   As the recording companies have contended since the introduction
of the analog cassette, unauthorized copying could leach away the
investments that record companies have typically made in musicians
and marketing. The companies' edge, in the past, was that their
product offered higher recording quality, better packaging and more
convenience. But digital copies are indistinguishable from
originals. If one is available from Capitol Records for full price
and another is available free from, say, www.piratetunes.com, even
a band's most dedicated fans may be torn.
</P>
<P>
   With free copies available, legally or illegally, there's
increased pressure to make music more affordable; a fan might be
willing to support a performer for 75 cents a song, but not for
$1.50. At least one company, GoodNoise, has decided to sell music
as MP3 files for a low price, figuring that it will be paid for the
first copy, if not the rest. It's following the model of computer
software makers, who have grown resigned to having their programs
passed around.
</P>
<P>
   Record labels could continue to offer music from their roster
before anyone else had it, and they could present themselves as
reliable sources, free of viruses and true to the performers'
wishes. (There's plenty of computer software around for making
music, which could lead to all sorts of edited, bowdlerized and
brutalized versions of songs. Why don't we remove that Mariah Carey
vocal and substitute my cousin? Or her cat?) Many albums now reach
their highest position on the charts the week they are released,
and companies could hold on to that part of the market. They could
also remind fans that legitimate releases support the musicians who
made them, appealing to conscience or loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Another primary function of record companies is promotion:
advertising, publicizing, getting music played on radio and
television and subsidizing bands on the road. That kind of clout
will remain important, especially as choices proliferate. Popular
music needs stars, who shape and share a culture's fantasies while
they contribute to the bottom line. One of the genuine pleasures of
popular music is knowing that you're not the only one listening to
a hit but part of a figurative community of fans who all have
something in common, even if it's just liking the way Scary Spice
dances.
</P>
<P>
   Digital distribution, by providing many more choices, could well
affect the magnitude of pop stardom the way competition from cable
television has affected the audience for network television. But
the craving to be part of a phenomenon won't go away. While many
listeners will be able to delve into niches, the mass market that
creates hits (which in turn subsidize projects like recording the
classical repertory) is used to having music sorted by MTV and
radio programmers. Amid a bewildering number of options, the record
companies that can draw attention to their releases will still have
an edge.
</P>
<P>
   With digital distribution, musicians at two extremes of the
business _ steady-gigging live bands and established superstars _
could choose to bypass recording companies entirely. Those whose
music is based on live performance rather than studio assemblage
can record cheaply and quickly; those who have already bought
mansions and soccer teams could finance their own studio time
instead of getting advances from recording companies. Either way,
they could simply place their music directly on the Internet, as
many grass-roots musicians have already done. (Not using other
people's money for recording could have another side effect:
cutting down on studio time and budgets.) Some musicians might put
the music out free to make themselves known to fans, to entice
people to buy concert tickets and T-shirts or just for the fun of
being heard. Recording music, already a do-it-yourself operation
for many musicians, could become synonymous with releasing music to
the world.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, could create a flood of 10th-rate material, doing
for music what Internet bulletin boards and chat rooms have done
for literature. When musicians had to depend on record companies to
get their efforts to the public, they had to convince other people
that their tunes were worth preserving and marketing. Recording
companies are notorious for missing innovations and pressuring
musicians toward last week's commercial directions. But they're not
all bad. Despite the amount of junk they release, they also perform
useful reality checks, winnowing the vast numbers of hopefuls and
helping musicians make the transition from basements or clubs to
recordings that bear up to repeated listening. Recorded music and
live music work differently; the whiz-bang thrills of a live punk
band, for instance, may seem unsubtle and even monotonous the fifth
time through.
</P>
<P>
   For every musician like the Artist (formerly known as Prince),
who comes up with more good music than a traditional record company
can handle, there are dozens who should discard more than they do.
About 30,000 albums are already released every year by record
companies large and small. Imagine how much music would emerge if
no one was writing rejection letters.
</P>
<P>
   As releasing music becomes a casual decision, the length of
those releases will turn unpredictable. We're used to thinking that
music comes in two sizes _ songs and albums _ but digital
distribution brings more flexibility. The limitations of Edison
disks shaped the three-minute pop song; the necessity of flipping
over an LP built the habit of programming an album in two parts. In
the long run, the album is also a technological artifact, an
artistic unit engendered by physical limitations.
</P>
<P>
   When music is downloaded, packages no longer have to be uniform.
Musicians might release a song, or three, or 53, on any schedule;
they could put out a song the day it was recorded. They could
release collections like commercial versions of albums and,
simultaneously, as the musical equivalent of director's-cut films.
Musicians could also stop making a lot of tough decisions. They
could offer alternate versions of songs; they could record every
show of a tour, digitize it and encourage fans to assemble their
own sets. (Somewhere on the Internet, Phish fans are probably doing
that right now.)
</P>
<P>
   But with digital distribution, musicians could no longer govern
the package that listeners receive. Some fans would want
everything, including what used to be obscure B-sides from singles
and alternate versions; others would just click on to the hits,
ignoring a band's less commercial efforts. Downloaded music would
encourage listeners to build their own programs _ album-length or
not, one performer or many. Listeners might riffle through a
performer's whole career or pick through a favorite genre or put
together an assortment of old and new hits. Current record
companies that have been heavily pushing soundtrack albums are
already training listeners to concentrate on the immediate pleasure
of a hit song rather than taking the time to get to know a
musician's full scope.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners could also reshuffle their music at whim, since no
collection would have to be permanent. If a song is always
available electronically, there's no need to hold on to a CD. With
full-scale digital distribution, the Internet itself becomes a
music library, and home shelves can be emptied. Listeners could
download what they want, listen to it as long as they're
interested, and move on. Music would stop being something to
collect, and revert to its age-old transience: something that
transforms a moment and then disappears like a troubadour leaving
town. But there's a tradeoff for the convenience; the music might
seem disposable. Musicians could soon come to miss the kind of
sustained attention that fans used to give to a brand-new album,
playing it repeatedly from start to finish. Downloaders have short
attention spans, and like other Internet phenomena, digital
distribution is a temptation to surf.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of some centralized music archive, out of listeners'
hands, is not entirely reassuring. There are dire possibilities of
surveillance; I could always pay cash at a record store for a
Barenaked Ladies album, but I certainly wouldn't want some Internet
monitor to know that I was downloading it. Meanwhile, what happens
when a control-freak musician decides to erase his inspired but
erratic early recordings, or some bureaucrat gets a court order to
delete all the gangsta rap? At that point, the anarchic copying and
free circulation allowed by MP3 become a blessing. Somebody is
bound to have the missing songs tucked away on their computer,
ready to be resuscitated and out of any company's control.
</P>
<P>
   Other entertainment moguls may be quietly gloating over the
music business' digital quandaries. They shouldn't get too
comfortable. After all, movies are next.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The District of Columbia is recycling trash again.
Squadrons of work crews are busy fixing streets. New parking meters
have replaced their vandalized ancestors. For the first time in
years, residential real estate prices are going up.
</P>
<P>
   In small ways and large, the nation's capital is on the mend. A
near decade of financial chaos, rising crime rates and spiritual
malaise has given way to balanced budgets, business expansion,
safer streets and the possibility of true reform in the city
government.
</P>
<P>
   Many problems persist, of course. The District Police Department
is still a work in progress, with a new chief working out
inefficiencies of the past. Many of the city's public schools need
better teachers and smaller classes. Budget projects reflect a need
for $500 million a year in additional help from the federal
government to cover annual expenses.
</P>
<P>
   And racism in a city where blacks constitute a 57 percent
majority remains near the surface. When two white candidates won
seats on the City Council last week to give whites a majority for
the first time, many blacks around the city, including outgoing
Mayor Marion Barry, raised concerns about a white majority not
being sensitive to black concerns, like maintaining a summer jobs
program and preserving the city-owned hospital that serves a large
portion of the poor community.
</P>
<P>
   But even with those challenges, many local officials, including
Barry's successor, Anthony A. Williams, 47, are predicting that the
city is well beyond the worst of times and that the sunset of
Barry's career is ushering in a new era for the city, its politics
and its residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale of zero to 10, with 10 the best, I'd say we're at
five and climbing,'' said Williams, a Democrat, whose victory last
Tuesday has given rise to much of the optimism now pervading the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Even Congress is impressed. ``The city is moving in the right
direction,'' said Rep. Thomas M. Davis III, R-Va., who has been
involved in district matters in the House for the past four years.
Of Williams, he added: ``Our job now is to give him the tools he
needs to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the new mayor promises to be different in style and
effectiveness from Barry, who is retiring after 16 years in office
over the last two decades, the city, itself, has changed, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, on that same scale of municipal viability, the
district would barely have nudged a one. The city was mired in debt
and deficit spending. Service agencies were broken. Violent crime
was rampant. Barry blamed his predecessor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, for
all the problems, and she blamed him.
</P>
<P>
   Congress stepped in to change much of that. With Republicans in
control for the first time in 40 years, lawmakers created a
financial control board in 1995 and stripped Barry of virtually any
meaningful role in running the city. He and his supporters
complained, but the positive results proved to be unambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   The control board is now ready to shift authority for running
the city back to the new mayor upon his inauguration on Jan. 2, and
if the city can balance its budget for two more years, the control
board, by law, will shut down.
</P>
<P>
   It was Williams' role in the revival that brought him to the
attention of voters. Hired as the city's chief financial officer in
October 1995, he effectively served as intermediary between the
control board and city leaders, vowing to resign within a year if
he could not straighten out the mess. In general, he recommended
tough decisions to set the city's finances straight, and for the
most part, the control board agreed with him despite Barry's
frequent objections.
</P>
<P>
   But as a lifelong numbers-crunching bureaucrat, Williams had
never contemplated running for office and certainly not in a city
where Barry held almost Svengali-like sway over much of the
electorate since his first run for mayor in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   A series of events changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   The district's problems through the early years of the decade
had quietly led to a shift in the electorate. An increasing number
of middle-class families, most of them black and many of them Barry
supporters, left for the better schools and safer streets of the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   While that continued, an overall population decline that began
in the 1950s and included many white families also narrowed the gap
with whites, who have been a minority group in the district since
the late 1950s. The exodus enabled whites _ and to a lesser extent,
the growing populations of Hispanics and Asians _ to gain growing
influence in citywide elections.
</P>
<P>
   Whites now account for about 32 percent of the city population,
an increase from 29 percent in 1990. Blacks make up about 57
percent, a decrease from 60 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The white influence never seemed more pronounced once Barry
announced in May that he would not seek re-election. Soon, three
leading members of the City Council _ Harold Brazil, Kevin P.
Chavous and Jack Evans _ declared themselves candidates to succeed
him. But none had a distinctively sharp political persona, and many
voters regarded them as part of the problems, not solutions.
</P>
<P>
   In district political circles, Williams, who is black, was
widely viewed as the outsider because he is a native of Los Angeles
who only moved to the district five years ago. But he was also seen
as someone who had answers, a perception that was especially
widespread among middle-class and affluent whites _ voters who
abandoned their earlier allegiance to Barry after his 1990
conviction on a drug possession charge. As a group, they were also
more likely to vote than any other in the city.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Williams built a strong coalition of enough blacks
and whites to win 50 percent of the vote in a seven-way race in the
Democratic primary. In the general election, he won every precinct
of the city to gain 66 percent of the vote, to 30 percent for his
Republican challenger, Carol Schwartz, another member of the city
council.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout in Ward 3, the area of the city with the highest
concentration of whites and affluent voters, was 49.4 percent,
highest in the city. The turnout in Ward 8, the poorest in the city
with the highest concentration of former Barry supporters, was 25.2
percent, lowest in the city.
</P>
<P>
   To Williams, the election was a mandate to continue the tough
choices and build on what he perceives as the district's assets _
strengths that were largely obscured by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to be a great success story,'' Williams said
in an interview this week, giving shape to his short-term
priorities. ``Every city wants to be all things to all people, but
every city has to find its niche markets. We are still the federal
center. We have a stable employment base. Last year we attracted 24
million tourists. Every diplomat in the world has been here _ hello
_ that has got to be good for international trade. We have a lot of
competitive assets.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Barry was always eager to sell the city's assets _ even
now he is in Cameroon on what he said is a trade mission _ his
efforts in this final term have been marginal, largely because of
his diminished powers.
</P>
<P>
   Other local leaders, meanwhile, have embarked on a full-scale
economic development program that they believe is vital to the
city's future in the wake of the 60,000 jobs that were lost in the
city through the reorganization of the federal and municipal
governments in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The planning group, which includes federal agencies, local
agencies and private organizations like Fannie Mae, as well as the
control board, has targeted six major industries _ some of the
niche markets Williams mentioned _ to exploit for job expansion and
economic growth to enable the district to compete with
faster-growing suburbs in Maryland and Virginia. The mayor-elect
said he has already discussed other initiatives with Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone further and faster than any other city in the
same situation,'' Williams said. But mindful of daunting challenges
ahead, he conceded that he would have to convince both Congress and
district residents that he was the right choice for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still shocks me to think that I'll be mayor of this city,''
Williams said of his rise and the moment at hand. ``One minute,
it's electrifying; the next, it's terrifying. There are a lot of
expectations. But ultimately, they are all motivating. I know what
I can do, but the whole thing is amazing.''

<HEADLINE>
BOARD OKS BILINGUAL EDUCATION, SPECIAL ED LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ The state Board of Education Tuesday voted to
ask state lawmakers to dramatically restrict the time a child
spends in a bilingual education class _ to one year _ and to make
it harder for students to qualify for special education classes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the board decided that talented would-be teachers
should not have to go through an education school to become
certified.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairman John Silber said potential teachers such as
highly educated people leaving the military or mothers looking to
reenter the work force should be able to become certified without
earning an education degree _ for example, by taking a training
course and passing the state's teacher test.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only a small number enter teaching without attending
traditional teaching colleges.
</P>
<P>
   In its special education proposal, the board voted to ask the
Legislature to replace the state's special education mandate of
facilitating the ``maximum possible development'' of students with
the federal standard of providing a ``free and appropriate public
education.''
</P>
<P>
   At its meeting Tuesday, in the Seven Hills Charter School, the
board also voted to ask the state to force families to pay for
their own expert second opinions if the state declares their child
ineligible for special education and they wish to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes drew fire from special education advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents rely on'' the higher state standard ``to ensure their
children receive equal educational opportunity,'' said Julia
Landau, a lawyer with the Massachustets Advocacy Center, an
education watchdog agency in Boston. ``We would strongly oppose
those provisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tom Louie, director of Mass English Plus, criticized
what he described as the board's efforts to ease the state toward
conservative English-only education policies. Currently, students
can be taught in their native language until they attain
proficiency in English _ which takes an average of three to five
years, according to advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be forcing students into the mainstream before they
are ready,'' Louie said. ``Ideologically, they want to move
everyone to English only. This is not based on educational
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Silber and other staunch critics of bilingual education said
children languish for years in segregated classrooms without
learning English quickly enough. Tuesday's proposed changes include
allowing districts to choose their own methods of teaching children
with limited English skills.
</P>
<P>
   The board also focused on refining efforts to recruit and retain
more highly qualified teachers, including a proposal that teachers
seeking master teacher status pass the state's teacher test to be
eligible for the annual $5,000 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The board remained strangely silent on a proposal by newly
elected Governor Paul Cellucci to test all teachers, with Silber
Tuesday declining to discuss his own view on such widespread
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Board member James Peyser, who supports teacher testing, wants
the issue on next month's board agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, recertification means accumulating professional
development points,'' Peyser said in an interview. ``It doesn't
measure anything except how many workshops and graduate programs a
teacher attended.''
</P>
<P>
   The board Tuesday also asked the Legislature to reconsider how
the state plans to disburse the new $20,000 signing bonus, designed
to attract more highly qualified people to the teaching profession.
</P>
<P>
   Next fall, education officials said as many as 50 new teachers
will each get $8,000 the first year and $4,000 in each of the
following three years. The board, concerned that teachers will
simply leave after the first year's payment, wants lawmakers to
flip the formula so that new teachers get $4,000 in each of the
first three years and $8,000 in the fourth year.

 &HT;    Some of basketball's finest will wait to make commitments
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Several of the country's top high-school players will
be making their college choices today, as the one-week
early-signing period for basketball begins. But the player some
recruiters regard as the nation's best won't be among them.
</P>
<P>
   Donnell Harvey, a 6-foot-8, 225-pound power forward from
Randolph-Clay High in Cuthbert, will wait until spring to make his
decision. Harvey, rated the No. 1 prospect nationally by The
Sporting News in a recent composite poll of five recruiting
analysts, is working to improve his academic transcripts and
college-entrance test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still wide open right now,'' Randolph-Clay coach Joe
Williams said. ``I don't think he's going to sit down and do
anything until he gets his test scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, a fourth-team Parade All-America selection last year,
averaged 17.4 points, 14.8 rebounds and three blocks per game as a
junior. His stock soared this summer with exceptional performances
at the Adidas/ABCD Camp in Teaneck, N.J., and the Vegas Big-Time
Tournament in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Dennis Rodman without the tattoos,'' said Bob Gibbons,
the North Carolina-based recruiting analyst. ``Donnell's a warrior.
Over the years, one of the difficult things for me has been to look
inside a player's heart. But there's no mystery here. This kid just
loves to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's size and potential have coaches from coast to coast
flocking to the tiny South Georgia town. Harvey says he has
narrowed his list of schools to five _ Georgia, Clemson, Auburn,
Alabama and Florida. Harvey recently eliminated Georgetown,
Connecticut and Texas. Kentucky and Georgia Tech apparently backed
off because of his apparent academic difficulties. Harvey's only
official visit has been to Georgia; he will make an unofficial
visit to Florida this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson could have the inside track on Harvey after landing
former Mitchell-Baker High star Ronald Blackshear, a close friend
of Harvey who is attending Hargrave Military Academy in Virginia
this year. The pair attended Midnight Madness at Clemson, and
Blackshear committed to the Tigers shortly thereafter. Harvey also
is good friends with Georgia forward Jumaine Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a leader,'' Harvey said. ``Whatever school I
attend will be my choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's quick ascent started three years ago when Wallace
Prather Jr., coach of the Atlanta Celtics, the city's top AAU
basketball program, was combing the state in search of a big man.
That's when Prather caught his first glimpse of Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   By mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Prather had traveled to Cuthbert to scout Randolph-Clay guard
Jeffrey Braswell, who was described as a ``can't-miss'' prospect by
Williams. Instead, Prather found Harvey, a lanky, awkward forward
with unpolished skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I got down there, their coach asked me to take a look at
Donnell,'' Prather recalled. ``Immediately, I saw that he had the
potential to be a great basketball player. At the time, there was
really a drought of big men in the state. We'd been playing on the
national circuit with all guards, and we really needed a wide body
in the paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Harvey prepares for his final prep season, he's the one
attracting the interest of nearly every top Division I program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so quick that there's very few big men that he reminds
you of,'' Prather said. ``He's working on his perimeter game, so
he's starting to develop the characteristics of Dominique Wilkins.
But he's such a great rebounder, that he reminds me of Bill
Russell. Somehow, he tends to get his hands on about all the
rebounds if they're in the proximity of his reach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebounding just comes easy to me,'' Harvey said. ``We have
some other scorers on my team and we just go out and play. I'm not
worried about my statistics. That's why I love Dennis Rodman,
because he goes out and plays hard every game.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rodman comparisons stop with Harvey's size, extremely
long arms and rebounding. Harvey is the antithesis of the Chicago
Bulls star's flamboyance; he's soft-spoken _ on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a totally unselfish kid that's not as interested in
scoring as he is in rebounding,'' said Karl McCray, director of
Atlanta's Bureau of Recreation, which oversees the city's AAU
program. ``He's very low-key. He's not very talkative, he's almost
shy and you've got to pull things from him. He won't get on the
court and start bragging or taunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey attributes his modesty to his upbringing. He shares a
home in Shellman, which is just minutes from the high school, with
his mother, Laura Powell, and two brothers, Diedrick and Travious.
Harvey's parents are separated, and his mother works the 12-hour
night shift at a manufacturing plant in nearby Eufaula, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Donnell and Diedrick, who now attends East Mississippi Junior
College in Scooba, Miss., played one season of varsity basketball
together at Randolph-Clay. Diedrick also hopes to earn a college
scholarship; he's talking with Georgia and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about going to the same school,'' Diedrick Harvey
said. ``When we were younger, we'd go at it a lot on the courts,
but then he outgrew me. ``
</P>
<P>
   Both players developed their skills in pick-up games at a local
park. Donnell was a late bloomer and didn't start playing
basketball competitively until the sixth grade. He says his first
love was football because of its physical nature _ he was always
much bigger than his classmates, earning him the nickname, ``Big
Donnie.'' Basketball didn't come as easy, though, as he spent his
first two years on the junior-varsity team on the bench. He finally
earned a starting role as a freshman on the varsity squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to work hard to get where I am today,'' Donnell Harvey
said. ``I just had problems playing early. I had problems getting
on the court. I wasn't playing _ period.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Harvey caught the attention of college recruiters
at the ABCD Camp when he delivered a monstrous dunk over NBA-bound
Rashard Lewis, a 6-10 center from Alief-Elsik High in Alief, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis made an effort to defend Donnell at the free-throw
line,'' Prather said. ``Donnell got down in a triple-threat
position and took a jab step. Lewis froze and then Donnell took one
dribble and leaped over him for a big dunk. He threw Lewis back
into the basket because he's so much stronger. He's stronger than
most big men.''
</P>
<P>
   In May of this year, Harvey helped the Celtics win Gibbons'
Tournament of Champions, averaging 12.4 points and 12 rebounds in
the event. He returned to New Jersey for the ABCD camp in June as
one of the tournament's premier players, averaging more than 15
points and 10 rebounds in all-star games.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Harvey was snubbed for most valuable player honors
at ABCD, which went to Leon Smith of Chicago, a top-25 recruit
nationally, who reportedly might enter the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of used to not getting much recognition,'' Harvey
said. ``I try not to worry about it too much.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith paid for the oversight a few days later at the Vegas
Big-Time tournament. The players met in the playoffs of the
224-team tournament, and Harvey completely shut down Smith,
finishing with nine blocked shots in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He absolutely blocked everything Leon had to offer,'' Gibbons
said. ``The story in Las Vegas was that Harvey kicked his butt.
Smith was yelling over to his coach to take him out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Harvey faces perhaps his biggest challenge over the next
six months. He says he needs to raise his SAT score by nearly 100
points. He's taking two classes twice weekly at Darson Private
School in Albany, in addition to a full workload at Randolph-Clay,
to raise his grade-point average. Harvey expects to receive his
latest ACT score this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going well,'' Harvey said. ``I think I'll qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   On the court, some recruiters say Harvey needs to improve his
shooting range and free-throw shooting. Although he's an
exceptional rebounder, runs the floor well and has the ability to
put the ball on the floor, his offensive game is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have him rated the top player in the country,''
Gibbons said. ``But I think the one void in his game is that he
doesn't have outside-scoring ability. He's limited in his shooting
range. If he's going to be a Dennis Rodman, he has to improve his
offensive skills.''

 &HT;    Chris Edwards makes own mark
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Georgia Tech linebacker Chris Edwards has felt his share of
pressure. That's what happens when you graduate with a Parade
All-American label from a high-school football powerhouse like
Washington County.
</P>
<P>
   Those expectations were compounded by the comparisons _
self-inflicted and otherwise _ to his cousin Robert Edwards and
friend Takeo Spikes, both Washington County graduates and now two
of the top rookies in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   So when Edwards spent most of his first two years at Georgia
Tech on the bench or in the training room with injuries, it was
tough to take. But not as tough as finally getting healthy this
season, having two linebacker spots open up with the departure of
Keith Brooking and Ron Rogers and still failing to break into the
starting lineup. Two games into this season, Edwards was ready to
quit.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't show up to practice one day during the off-week before
the North Carolina game. His coaches couldn't find him, and
linebackers coach Ted Roof called Edwards' mother back in Warthen
to let her know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubted about whether I still wanted to play or not,'' said
Edwards, who spent the day at a friend's house.
</P>
<P>
   After taking some time to himself, Edwards got on the phone. He
called his parents, his high-school coach Rick Tomberlin, his
cousin, his friend Spikes. All told him the same thing: he'd be
making a huge mistake to quit football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't understand it,'' his mother Sophia Edwards said.
``I told him even if you don't want the football part, you've got
to think of the education part. Don't work at Wal-Mart the rest of
your life like I do. . . . I told him he couldn't live in Robert's
shoes. Do what's right for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, who has been an honor student all along, took their
advice, talked with his coaches and returned to practice the
following day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided everything will work out,'' Edwards said. ``I
wanted to come back and practice hard and show them I was committed
to still playing football. Ever since then, I'm having more fun
playing. I'm glad I stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was playing about 20 snaps a game on defense, in
addition to his special-teams duties, when linebacker Matt
Uremovich got suspended, and Edwards got another opportunity for
more playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Against Florida State, O'Leary wanted to use Edwards more
because of his speed, so for much of the game he moved Delaunta
Cameron to inside linebacker and put Edwards at outside linebacker.
Edwards responded by tying for the team lead in tackles with nine.
He was rewarded with the second start of his career on Oct. 31
against Maryland and had another nine tackles. He's been working
with the starting unit since and should start when Tech plays
Clemson on Thursday in an ESPN game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now as I see Chris developing, he's playing with a lot
more confidence,'' coach George O'Leary said. ``He's making more
plays. Basically he's what we recruited.''
</P>
<P>
   For Edwards, reaching this point has been both a huge relief and
well worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any regrets,'' Edwards said. ``I've had to grow
up and learn from my mistakes. I think it's made me a stronger
person. . . . When I look back, I see a lot of things I could have
done differently. It was just a whole learning process. If you want
something, you've got to work hard for it. You're not going to be
able to do it on talent alone. You have to keep it in perspective.
When you come to college, everybody else is the same, just as good
as you. It makes you appreciate it more, the ability God gave you,
when you have to work for it.''

KOSOVO SEPARATIST REBELS ON THE REBOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia _ The separatist Kosovo guerrillas, who
sprang out of nowhere this spring and were then pummeled by a
Serbian offensive in the summer, are bouncing back more resilient
and better organized than expected, Western officials said, much to
their surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army is conducting a major reassessment,
reorganization and rearmament, raising concerns in Washington just
as an unarmed, 2,000-member multinational force is readied to
verify the cease-fire in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas have killed at least six Serbian policemen in the
two weeks since some Serbian forces withdrew from Kosovo under an
agreement reached between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials here said Tuesday they were concerned about
threats from Serbian leaders Monday to take matters into their own
hands unless the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe did so.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-nation, Vienna-based organization, which is charged with
creating the 2,000-person team, has not formally begun its main
work. The head of the OSCE effort, U.S. Ambassador William Walker,
is expected in Kosovo on Wednesday for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   A top strategist of the guerrilla forces, Naim Maloku, who was a
captain in the Yugoslav army and the first senior professional
soldier to join the guerrilla forces, said the West should not be
surprised by what they see.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made tactical, organizational and propaganda mistakes,'' he
said of the Kosovo Liberation Army's operations. ``But now we are
trying to institutionalize and give the forces a reasonable
political leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloku, 40, who is considered a moderate and a pragmatist in a
force that has its share of hotheads, said in an interview Tuesday
that U.S. officials were ``making a mistake'' by expressing concern
about guerrillas taking up positions occupied by the vacating
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, he said, when the Serbian onslaught became too
intense many of the fighters fled to the hills with the civilians
and have now returned with their uniforms back on. ``The fighters
are from among the people,'' he said. ``It's only natural they
should come back with them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tall and well-built, Maloku wore a uniform that came from
various sources _ German made camouflage pants and jacket, a khaki
German army sweater with the German colors still attached at the
sleeve, a Yugoslav army pistol at his waist and the red and black
emblem of the Albanian double-headed eagle on his cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaner and meaner'' is how a NATO diplomat summed up the
Kosovo Liberation Army ``They are far from defeated, their morale
is high.''
</P>
<P>
   A NATO officer who last month described the guerrillas as ``not
destroyed but dismantled'' acknowledged this week that he had been
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where they're coming back, they're coming back pretty good,''
he said. ``There appears to be more structure, there seems to be
some definitive organization. The wild card in all this is what the
Kosovo Liberation Army is up to.''
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas are now parading around villages that were
deserted only 10 days ago, in full gear, rifles over their
shoulders and pistols at their hips. Many seem to be concerned with
family matters and can be seen carrying their children. But others
are manning checkpoints and at night clearly aiming to unsettle the
Serbian forces. Last week, the guerrillas allegedly shot at
civilian Serb workers as they left a mining facility.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the cease-fire verification work is being done by
diplomatic observers, including a group from the United States who
were shown bodies believed to be of two Serbian policemen on the
street in the town of Malisevo on Monday. The men appeared to have
been killed by the guerrillas in retaliation for the killing of
five guerrillas last week.
</P>
<P>
   Such retaliatory actions were to be expected, Western officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest concerns is the more sophisticated weaponry
acquired by the guerrillas. Like most guerrilla groups, the Kosovo
fighters are reluctant to show outsiders their gear. But two weeks
ago a former Western military officer and member of the diplomatic
observer mission was shown a new range of weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The officer in the observer mission was taken aback when a
powerful U.S.-made Barret sniper rifle was brought out for display.
He was told the guerrillas had more of them and additional ones
would be coming in. The Barret rifle is capable of ``blowing a head
off from a mile away,'' the NATO officer said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO official said the guerrillas could not defeat the
Yugoslav army and Serbian police in straightforward battle. But
with their new weapons, healthy flow of cash from the Albanian
diaspora in Europe, Britain and the United States, and better
organization, they could keep up a ``low-intensity conflict,'' the
NATO officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Maloku, the guerrilla strategist, said he is one of ``more than
10'' former Yugoslav army officers who have been leading the
liberation forces. He is a celebrated figure here because the Serbs
announced he was dead only to have him return to Kosovo last spring
to do battle.
</P>
<P>
   Maloku, a Kosovo Albanian, had been an officer in the Yugoslav
army in Slovenia, a former republic of Yugoslavia, after his
military school graduation in 1981. In 1986, he was thrown into a
military prison for his political activities. After his release in
1988 he left the army and headed a chemical engineering institute
in Slovenia, all the while playing an active role in the Albanian
diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   After the well publicized massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians
in Kosovo by Serbian forces last March, he started to head back
home via Tirana, the capital of Albania. In northern Albania, just
as he was about to cross the border into Kosovo, he sensed the
Serbs had set a trap for him and at the last minute, he changed his
plans. The Serbs ambushed some returning men, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the guerrillas had these former Yugoslav army
officers on hand, including some many who had fought the Serbs in
Bosnia and Croatia, plenty of errors were made in Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Too many volunteers joined the fighting force without any
vetting or control. Village defense units tried to defend
themselves by building trenches which became easy targets. The
Serbs came along with artillery and tanks and many of the fighters
had to flee, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, plans were being made to make the Kosovo
Liberation Army more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Maloku said he hoped a political settlement with the Serbs,
being worked on the by the United States would soon be reached. If
it was not in place by before spring, the fighting would restart
when the snow melted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the pent up fury that Serbs had created among the ethnic
Albanians would express itself again but in more effective ways, he
said. Explaining why there was little hope of restraining the
Kosovo Liberation Army, Maloku put it in simple, stark, village
terms:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Serbs spend 30 minutes burning the house of an old man
who has spent 40 years building it, isn't it natural that he would
give his sons to the cause?''

 &HT;    49ers offense to be big test for Falcons defense
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle took a
second on Tuesday to think about what it takes to build a good run
defense, one like Atlanta's, which is ranked No. 2 in the NFL and
allowing 76.6 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good question.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons (7-2) play the San Francisco 49ers (7-2) Sunday
in the soldout Georgia Dome for first place in the NFC West,
they'll face the No. 5 rushing team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons gave up a season-worst 161 yards to San Francisco in
losing Sept. 27. The run defense has improved since.
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle said it takes attitude, first and foremost. It takes
players such as Lester Archambeau, who has played very well not
only at left defensive end but also in relief of injured left
tackle Travis Hall.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a surprise. Archambeau leads the team with four
forced fumbles, is tied with right end Chuck Smith for the team
lead with seven sacks, is fourth with 54 tackles, fourth with 15
quarterback pressures, has recovered two fumbles and has two
tackles for losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lester is one of those guys who always comes in early, and
stays late,'' Tuggle said. ``He's one of the most intelligent guys
you could ever meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the most talented guy on our defense, but he's a guy
you would want to take with you in a bar fight, because you know
he's going to battle. That's what you need on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have been near the top of the NFL in run defense
most of the season, and when they held the Patriots to just 18
yards on 14 carries last Sunday, they jumped from No. 4 to No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't go so well when they played the 49ers in
September. Atlanta held 49ers running back Garrison Hearst -- who
was leading the NFL in rushing at the time -- to 57 yards on 18
carries.
</P>
<P>
   But quarterback Steve Young rushed for 50 yards, and fullback
Marc Edwards busted a 32-yarder on a misdirection play up the
middle -- the longest run Atlanta has given up this season.
</P>
<P>
   That play was symbolic of the way the 49ers running game works,
and Archambeau, Smith, Hall, right tackle Shane Dronett, Tuggle and
linebackers Cornelius Bennett and Henri Crockett will have to be on
the lookout for more of the same Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst was the deep back, and Edwards was offset behind the
right tackle. Both backs went right, except Hearst kept going, and
the Edwards cut back left, took a handoff and found running room
for a big gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They even pulled a guard to make it look like a toss sweep,''
Archambeau said. ``Their offensive scheme is based on movement and
speed, pulling guards, and (cut-blocking).
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hearst has) got great speed and the quickness and run to the
corner. They try to spread you out so you can't maintain the gap
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Falcons have maintained the gap-control
scheme that is the basis of their run defense and the key to
eliminating cutback lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the run has to be stopped by your front seven, . . .
and the biggest key is that (defensive line coach) Bill Kollar and
(linebacker coach) Don Blackmon have done a great job teaching
everyone how important gap control is,'' said Rich Brooks,
assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody maintains . . . a three-yard gap (between himself
and the next defender),'' Brooks said. ``They don't just start
chasing the ball all bunched together.''
</P>
<P>
   When Archambeau was traded from Green Bay in 1993, he had a
reputation as a light player who was quick and could play against
the run. In his early years in Atlanta, however, he was on the
sideline on passing downs.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-year veteran from Stanford has developed into an
all-around player, as his career-high 8.5 sacks last year would
attest. But he's still more respected against the run; his 54
tackles are fourth behind Bennett (75), Tuggle (61) and free safety
Eugene Robinson (55).
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, it's a couple things. One, I'm getting a lot more
opportunities than in the past,'' said Archambeau, who last year
forced five fumbles and recovered three. ``Plus, the more practice
you get at something, the better you get. And anytime you're
playing with a quality group, it elevates your play. Playing next
to Travis helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody likes to talk about the super-sized defensive linemen,
but Kollar is happy with the 6-foot-5, 275-pound Archambeau.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not that big. He's not that strong. He's just a football
player,'' Kollar said. ``Because he is so intelligent, . . . he
makes the formation calls out there. He's sort of the quarterback
for the defensive line.''
</P>
<P>
   Smarts and size are great, but Archambeau, 31, said attitude is
most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a front, we talk about being dominant, and not letting
anybody else knock us around,'' he said. ``We don't have a
330-pounder, but those guys can't play every down anyway, and they
can't run to the ball like we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think attitude is a huge part of this game. If
you sit there and say, 'I'm an undersized guy,' you're going to get
killed. You have to say, 'I'm going to go toe to toe with this guy,
and he's going to have his hands full.'''
</P>
<P>
   That challenge comes on Sunday.

 &HT;    Commentary: Nobody else a DiMaggio
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
</P>
<P>
   ``A nation turns its lonely eyes to you,
</P>
<P>
   ``Woo, woo, woo.... ``
</P>
<P>
   One generation knew him from that line in a song from the movie
``The Graduate.'' And probably wondered who he was. Maybe the only
ballplayer I know who had a song written about him, and it was so
full of yearning. Another generation knew him as Mr. Coffee. He
stood there and just as sincerely as could be told us about the
finer points of this coffee-making gadget. He made $100,000 a year
doing it, as much as he made playing centerfield for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   There may have been another ballplayer who played the game with
such grace as Joe DiMaggio, but I doubt it. You wonder what makes
the impression of such an athlete stick in your mind for so long.
You had to see him run, long, flowing strides, catch a fly ball,
make the artful throw back to the infield. Then you would have
known.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was his quiet reserve that set him apart. You'll
notice there has been no glut of ``Joe D., The Real DiMag'' or
``Joe DiMaggio _ My Story'' books on the market. He was, and is, a
very private man who never cared to sell himself. He was Joseph
Paul DiMaggio and he belonged to himself. I've had breakfast with
him, lunch with him, dinner with him, played golf with him and sat
watching the sun go down with him. I never had the courage to pry
into the inner DiMaggio. Sure as hell not to ask him about Marilyn
Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   There is the story worth repeating, of Marilyn returning from a
tour of our military bases overseas while they were married. Joe
met her at the plane and was asking her how the trip went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Joe,'' she gurgled, ``there were thousands of them. You
never heard such cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, Joe said, ``Oh, I think I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank heaven, he played the game when he did. It would be
sickening to see him in those leotards players wear today, flopping
down around the ankles like pajamas. He was a player for the age he
lived in. In the right city, New York, New York. Jim Murray once
wrote, ``That's what a ballplayer should look like,'' and I second
the motion.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged .325 at bat and drove in 1,537 runs, but there is no
way you could translate the way he moved into statistics. One of my
first memories of him is a negative one. It was in the World Series
of 1947, sixth game, I think. He hit a drive deep into leftfield
and the little reserve Dodger outfielder, Al Gionfriddo, made the
catch leaning over the bullpen gate. DiMaggio rounded second and
kicked the dirt in frustration. For the record, Gionfriddo never
played in another major-league game.
</P>
<P>
   The record that DiMaggio still holds is the 56-game hitting
streak. It looks safe forever. I hope it is. Yet, he was not voted
into the Hall of Fame in the first round, if you can believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Joe is looking at the dark side of life now. Pneumonia and
assorted complications has him in a hospital in Florida. These
Yankee fans, who need a touch of his class, didn't get to see him
throw out the first ball in the World Series. This is not written
to beat the Grim Reaper but more to celebrate in advance his 84th
birthday, coming up Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   About the only line Red Smith wrote that I disagreed with had to
do with DiMaggio, the very last line Red ever wrote. ``Some day
there would be another Joe DiMaggio,'' he said in the last column
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so. I hope not, anyway.

 &HT;    Positive attitudes, exceeded expectations give Arkansas push
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. _ Running back Madre Hill, elder statesmen of
an Arkansas football team experiencing an unexpected renaissance,
refuses to be satisfied merely by getting in the game.
</P>
<P>
   After missing the last two seasons with twin surgeries to repair
ligament damage to both knees, Hill didn't want to play out the
string, salvaging some consolation at the end of a career that
could have been special.
</P>
<P>
   When Houston Nutt was hired last winter to replace Danny Ford,
the energetic former Arkansas backup quarterback immediately asked
his troops to engage in a series of grueling off-season workouts.
Nearly all of them jumped at the chance, including Hill, and his
revival in many ways reflects a bright future for a program that
has struggled since joining the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The work _ and the upbeat attitude Nutt has injected along with
it _ has paid off handsomely for the 10th-ranked Razorbacks, who
play at top-ranked Tennessee on Saturday in a clash of undefeated
SEC teams.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas is one of the biggest surprises of the year. The
Razorbacks sport an 8-0 record, its best in 10 seasons, and have a
perfect 5-0 slate in the SEC. After having trouble putting away
Kentucky, South Carolina and Auburn, the Razorbacks _ projected in
one preseason poll to finish last in the SEC West _ are now primed
for the Cotton Bowl. Other prospects include the Sugar and Citrus,
but Hill doesn't want to settle for those.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it great now for us? Sure it is. But it can get a whole lot
better,'' Hill said. ``I'd like to be sitting here talking about
having won the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas, which drubbed Ole Miss 34-0 last week, is seventh in
the Bowl Championship Series standings. An upset against the
Volunteers would thrust the Hogs closer to the Fiesta Bowl,
although both teams figure to meet again in the SEC championship
game next month.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who suffered his first knee injury in Arkansas' loss to
Florida in the 1995 SEC title game, is 8th in the SEC in rushing
with 560 yards and gradually is looking like the man who set a
school record with 1,387 yards in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The returns of Hill and fellow tailback Chrys Chukwuma, who
missed last year with a back injury, have meant everything to the
Hogs on offense. Chukwuma's 562 yards is 5th in the SEC. Last year,
Arkansas had one of the poorest rushing games in the country, and
finished 4-7. Now, All-American guard candidate Brandon Burlsworth
helps pave the way for a balanced attack, and a more aggressive,
blitz-happy defense is fourth nationally against the run.
</P>
<P>
   But even Nutt, 41, who has been confident without the swagger,
seemed a little taken aback at his team's lofty status going into
its biggest challenge of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought we would be 8-0? he said. ``Now, we
thought we were going to have a good team, but to be 8-0 and
playing the No. 1 team in Knoxville?
</P>
<P>
   Nutt, who earned plaudits at Murray State and last year in his
only season at Boise State, was on the job at Arkansas for six
months before he signed a contract, in a gesture of goodwill. He is
his own offensive coordinator, hired his brother, Danny, to be his
running-backs coach and has a sharp eye for detail.
</P>
<P>
   On the sidelines, he is a constant whirlwind, congratulating
good plays with gusto and flailing his arms to the home fans to get
them off their feet. There's nothing fancy about his playbook,
although it's decidedly more wide open and modernized than Ford
ever contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty much doing the same things we were doing last
year,'' starting linebacker Quenton Caver said. `` The coaches are
very alive, we believe in what they're doing, and it's easy to go
out there every day in practice and on Saturday and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Nutt has been careful to acknowledge the strong foundation laid
by his predecessor, with 19 of 22 starters returning from last
year, and says his veterans haven't needed much prodding: ``They
believe good things are going to happen to them, and they're
expecting to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior quarterback Clint Stoerner has been one of the
ringleaders. ``I think that attitude has helped us get here,''
Stoerner said. ``We know Tennessee is a great football team, but
we're going to go in there with a good attitude and a commitment to
win.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ben Boucher looked in the mirror several months ago and decided
he did not want to be bald like his father. So, like millions of
other balding men, Boucher, a 25-year-old animator in Montreal who
is a long way from losing his hair, picked up a prescription for
Propecia, Merck &AMP; Co.'s hair growth pill, and patiently awaited the
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that I've actually grown more hair,'' Boucher
said. ``But Propecia has stopped my hair from falling out. And I'm
happy for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher does have his reservations. He does not like having to
take Propecia once a day, at some $50 for a month's supply. At
first, he had been worried about a possible loss of sexual desire,
one of the drug's side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The experiences of Boucher and others illustrate why so-called
lifestyle drugs like Propecia have had a mixed sales record so far.
Unlike traditional medications that relieve pain or cure an
illness, these drugs typically help people feel good about
themselves, including their hair lines and sex lives. For many
potential customers of lifestyle drugs, the price of a dose of
self-esteem may be a little too high.
</P>
<P>
   Lifestyle drugs were once considered potentially bigger
blockbusters than those that treated diseases. Indeed, some
pharmaceutical executives believed that to be big sellers,
lifestyle drugs merely had to prevent a condition from growing
worse instead of curing it. But that has proved overly optimistic.
While some lifestyle drugs _ most notably Viagra, Pfizer Inc.'s
impotency pill _have generated huge worldwide sales, many others
have yet to live up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Propecia, for example, had only $45 million in U.S. sales
through the third quarter, roughly a third of what analysts had
originally projected. Sales of Nicotrol, Johnson &AMP; Johnson's
smoking cessation products, are off 47.9 percent this last year,
while sales of Nicoderm, SmithKline Beecham PLC's patch, have
fallen 12.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such disappointments illustrate how lifestyle drugs can be much
more difficult to sell than traditional medications. For one,
insurance companies seldom pay for them, severely limiting the
likelihood of repeat uses. And consumers have come to expect more
from lifestyle drugs than they do from treatments for other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Lifestyle drugs must not only work quickly to justify their
upfront costs, they must be generally free of side effects to avoid
turning off potential customers. If the drug does not meet these
expectations, patients can immediately stop using them with little
downside, since the ailments that lifestyle drugs treat are far
from life threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these products are viewed, fairly or unfairly, as
being on the fringes of medicine,'' said Neil Sweig, a
pharmaceuticals analyst with Southeast Research Partners. ``There's
some controversy surrounding them if they have not been released to
cure arthritis or some other disease. They are just not considered
part of the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that many consumers associate lifestyle
drugs with over-the-counter wrinkle creams, hair-growth potions and
the like. Earlier experiences with goops, tonics and gimmicks have
made these consumers skeptical about lifestyle drugs unless they
provide measurable improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not always easy to find,'' said David Saks, a managing
director of Gruntal &AMP; Co. who tracks the pharmaceutical industry.
``You can tell when Viagra is working, but most take some time. It
would be great that you could take a pill to grow hair in the
morning and by the afternoon you'd look like a model for GQ.''
</P>
<P>
   Huge advertising campaigns have not been enough to stir up
enthusiasm. To advertise Propecia, the tracking service Competitive
Media Reporting says, Merck spent $39 million through July _ more
than 80 percent of the drug's sales in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the difficulties in marketing lifestyle drugs,
pharmaceutical companies can't seem to roll them out fast enough.
Schering-Plough Corp., pending regulatory approval, will market
Vasomax, another pill for impotence, with the help of Zonagen, a
tiny Texas biotechnology company. TAP, a unit of Takeda Chemical
Industries, hopes to introduce a fast-acting tablet for impotence
that is placed under the tongue, while Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. is
working on a compound to remove sun spots.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of finding another blockbuster like Viagra or
Zyban, Glaxo Wellcome PLC's smoking cessation pill, is generating
the sudden glut. Drug makers can pocket more revenue from feel-good
treatments than they can from some treatments for cancer and heart
disease. Although Viagra's sales have recently begun to slow, its
$1 billion take this year should be one-third more than that of
Gemzar, Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.'s popular anticancer drug.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies can also usher in more innovations with lifestyle
drugs than with their traditional disease-fighting staples. Before
Glaxo Wellcome introduced Zyban, last June, the entire smoking
cessation market consisted of inhalers, gum or patches. By
introducing a twice-a-day pill, smokers had a convenient choice
they apparently liked. Sales of Zyban reached $83.6 million in the
United States through June, some 50 percent more than many analysts
had projected.
</P>
<P>
   That is an especially nice bounty, given that lifestyle drugs
typically have higher profit margins than traditional medications.
Propecia was originally introduced as Proscar, Merck's prostate
reduction drug, while Zyban was first rolled out by Glaxo Wellcome
as Wellbutrin, an antidepressant. By releasing two drugs off what
was essentially one research and development budget, Merck and
Glaxo Wellcome can notch profits from a lower sales base, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Merck spokeswoman denied that the company spent less on
Propecia's research and development. Glaxo Wellcome did save money
on its research and development for Zyban, though the company noted
that separate clinical trials were conducted to test the
anti-smoking use of the drug.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   So far, convenience and product efficacy have been the litmus
tests for lifestyle drugs. Nowhere have those issues been as hotly
contested as in the hair-growth market. The two leading products _
Merck's Propecia and Rogaine, a topical liquid made by Pharmacia &AMP;
Upjohn Inc. _ can improve hair growth in some men but are far from
the wonder remedies many men seek.
</P>
<P>
   Rogaine, which is applied twice daily, primarily works on the
crown of the head instead of the full scalp, little help for
someone with a receding hairline. And Propecia's results do not
appear to be much better.
</P>
<P>
   Merck conducted three clinical trials of Propecia with 1,879
men, 1,215 of whom were followed for as long as two years. None of
the men in the studies grew back a full head of hair, though
scientists found that 83 percent of them had kept their hair or had
grown more. The trouble is that of the men who took Propecia in the
studies, the hair growth on only 5 percent of them was rated
greatly improved, compared with 30 percent who were rated slightly
improved and 31 percent moderately improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Propecia works on about half of my patients,'' said Dr. Marc
Avram, director of the cosmetic surgical unit at New York Hospital.
``But you have to pick your patients. I wouldn't give it to a man
whose head is shiny bald, and it won't bring a receding hairline
forward. It's most effective, I think, in holding on to the hair
that you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Propecia and Rogaine have been far from stellar.
Analysts had predicted Propecia would reach $300 million in sales
this year; it is now clear that it will not reach half that. Even
through Rogaine's sales are up 8.3 percent, to $70.7 million in the
United States through September, the jump appears to be more from
gains related to retailers increasing their inventory in
anticipation of a special sales promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Propecia and Rogaine have other troubles. The ideal lifestyle
drugs are not only effective, they work almost instantaneously. The
grand champion of effectiveness and fast onset of action is Viagra,
which works within an hour or so of ingestion. And while men may
stare at their mirrors for several months wondering if Propecia is
working, there can be little doubt about Viagra's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Immediacy is also crucial for smoking cessation drugs. Since
smokers are increasingly using them to satisfy a nicotine urge in
situations in which they cannot light up, a quick onset of action
is crucial. That has helped the category leader, SmithKline
Beecham's Nicorette gum, whose sales have risen 18.7 percent in the
last year even as the entire nonprescription U.S. smoking cessation
market has declined 1.8 percent, to $568.3 million, according to
Information Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smokers get a more immediate feedback with Nicorette than the
patch,'' said Dr. Peter Proctor, a Houston cosmetic dermatologist
who used Nicorette 14 years ago to quit smoking. ``You get oral
gratification with Nicorette, something you want after giving up
cigarettes, and you don't really have that with the patch.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when smokers want smoking-cessation drugs, dealing with
their insurance companies can be discouraging. Determined to give
up smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, Bob Gelman, a 53-year-old
lawyer near San Francisco, bought a three-month supply of Nicorette
gum and had his doctor write a prescription for Zyban, the popular
smoking cessation pill. Gelman did not expect his insurer, Blue
Cross of California, to pay for Nicorette but was incensed when it
declined coverage for Zyban.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back and forth with the insurance company for a month
arguing over Zyban,'' Gelman recalled. ``Then I learned that Zyban
is really Wellbutrin, an antidepressant. So I get a prescription
for that, and they covered it. But I was really irritated. Was I
going to take Zyban for recreation?''
</P>
<P>
   There are other hurdles facing the widespread acceptance of
lifestyle drugs. Consumers will tolerate moderate side effects from
pills that control serious illnesses _ say, diabetes or epilepsy _
but not from miracle hair growers or smoking cessation pills.
Propecia's popularity has been hurt by the possibility that it can
decrease libido or damage an unborn fetus if it is accidentally
handled by a pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   And while lifestyle drugs are aimed at a broad market, they do
not appeal to everyone. Women tend to like them far more than men.
With the exception of Viagra, men have had little patience for
lifestyle drugs, usually discarding them when they are not
immediately effective. For example, women buy 60 percent of the
three top smoking cessation drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason so many women take these types of drugs is
that men tend to have trouble admitting they have a problem,'' said
Dr. David Krueger, a psychiatrist in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a pharmaceutical company introduces the ultimate novelty
drug, booming sales cannot last forever. After hitting 50,000 new
prescriptions a day in May, Viagra is now notching about 15,000,
according to IMS Health, a health care consulting firm. Analysts
say that Viagra has simply lost some of its initial curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can knock the success of Viagra,'' Sweig said. ``Maybe
people could say that baldness wasn't a serious enough condition,
and that's why some of those products didn't sell so well. But I
don't think anyone would say that about impotence.''

COVETED COLLECTIONS OF ART AT AUCTION
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Sotheby's and Christie's prepare for their big
fall sales, which begin Thursday night with Christie's sale of
contemporary art, auction house experts are as concerned about the
world financial markets as they are about the number of collectors
prepared to buy art. More than any other segment of the art market,
auctions rely on buyers' confidence. When the mood in a salesroom
is buoyant, so are the prices. But nervousness can be equally
contagious, making even those who came to bid get cold feet.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that the art market always mirrors the stock
market. In 1987, just three weeks after the market plunge labeled
Black Monday, Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art auction topped
$100 million in sales for the first time in its history, a 45
percent increase from six months before. This season, while
pessimists are saying that the problems in the economy are deeper
and more widespread than in the last 11 years, auction house
officials are trying to paint a rosy picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of the financial markets has given people pause, but
the sky has not fallen in,'' said Charles Moffett, co-chairman of
Sotheby's department of Impressionist and modern art worldwide.
With the Dow Jones industrial average at around 8,900 points, he
continued, ``a huge amount of wealth has been created.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there enough wealth to support the staggering number of works
on offer during the next two weeks, when an estimated $400 million
worth of paintings, drawing and sculptures by artists like van
Gogh, Picasso, Cezanne and Modigliani go up for sale?
</P>
<P>
   ``The real test of this market will be in the grade-B works,''
said Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's in America. ``But
the indications from collectors worldwide suggest that the art
market is still healthy. In the area of top-quality works there
will always be buyers, and prices will always be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes this season from last is the large number of
special collections coming to auction. In fact, Sotheby's has so
much to sell in just two evenings that the auction house is
beginning its Impressionist and modern art auction and its sale of
contemporary art at 6:30 p.m. rather than at the usual 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest collection of the season is the group of 39
Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and modern artworks being sold by
the financially troubled Reader's Digest Association. The
collection was formed by Lila Acheson Wallace and her husband,
DeWitt Wallace, who founded Reader's Digest in 1922. They began
buying art in the 1940s and continued through the 1960s. The
collection, valued at $100 million, is uneven. There are some
extraordinary works, but also some that are considered mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   The best painting and sculptures are world-class. The cream of
the collection includes a Giacometti sculpture, ``The Forest: Seven
Figures and a Head'' (1950), depicting a group of tall, slender
figures with the bust of a man thought to represent the artist's
brother, Diego. Sotheby's has estimated that the sculpture could
sell for $4 million to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wallace loved nature, which explains why there are many
landscapes, garden scenes and flower paintings. Few works in the
collection can top Monet's ``Lily Pond'' (1917-1919), a more
colorful rendering of the artist's famous waterlilies than most.
Monet was working on this painting while he was creating ``Large
Mural Decoration,'' the two rooms of large-scale paintings of his
waterlily pond that are in L'Orangerie in Paris. Sotheby's
officials predict the work will bring $9 million to $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Portraits were also an interest of the Wallaces. For sale are
two by Modigliani. Both are of Jeanne Hebuterne, the artist's wife.
One, painted in 1918, shows her sitting in a pale-blue upholstered
chair posed like an 18th-century Madonna. The other, painted a year
later, depicts Hebuterne perched on a more fragile chair with one
hand touching her shoulder. Both are estimated to sell for $9
million to $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the category of portraits, however, it is Christie's that has
the blockbuster, a self-portrait by van Gogh that the artist
painted in 1889 as a present for his mother, Anna Cornelia Carbent
van Gogh. Experts believe it is the last self-portrait he painted
before his death in 1890.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The work, ``Portrait of the Artist Without His Beard,'' was
painted when van Gogh was ill in St. Remy and wanted to reassure
his mother that he was all right. It shows him with heavily
chiseled features and an intense stare and without a beard, since
he thought that he looked younger and healthier when clean-shaven.
The work is estimated to sell for $20 million to $25 million, which
would make it the highest-priced painting of the two weeks of
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The self-portrait has been in the same collection for over 30
years, and the fact that van Gogh self-portraits rarely come to
auction makes the sale of this painting an event,'' said Franck
Giraud, head of Christie's 19th- and 20th-century art. ``As soon as
word got out that it was available, we had major collectors
expressing serious interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The van Gogh is one of 10 works being sold by the heirs of
Jacques Koerfer, a German-born collector and former chairman of BMW
AG who died in 1991. This is the fourth block of Koerfer property
that Christie's has sold in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Another important painting from the collection is Cezanne's
``Chateau Noir'' (1904), which was once in the collection of Lord
Kenneth Clark, former director of the National Gallery in London.
Christie's estimates it will sell for $5 million to $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also for sale at Christie's on Nov. 19 is a group of paintings
from the collection of Harry Torczyner, a Belgian-born writer,
scholar and collector who was also Magritte's lawyer. Fourteen
Magrittes form the core of the collection, and some are among the
artist's best-known images. One of the most widely recognized,
``Son of Man'' (1964), depicts a man in a bowler hat with a green
apple obscuring his face. It, too, carries a $2 million to $3
million price tag. These works have not been on the market because
Torczyner bought them directly from Magritte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boatmen in Argenteuil,'' a Monet in Christie's Impressionist
and 19th-century sale next Wednesday, has not been on the market
for 103 years. It is a sun-dappled scene of sailors and rowers
painted in 1874. ``It is the quintessential Impressionist picture,
especially the way the artist captured the early morning light on
the water,'' said Giraud. The work comes from heirs of the Parisian
dealer Paul Durand-Ruel and is estimated to sell for $6 million to
$8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Christie's starts things off with its sale of
contemporary art, which the auction house now defines as art from
1970 to the present. It is a small but interesting sale of 50
works, and it features paintings and sculpture by such artists as
Robert Gober, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Cindy Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sale reflects the new spirit of the department,'' said
Philippe Segalot, Christie's new head of contemporary art
worldwide. ``We're selling cutting-edge contemporary art that's
more challenging and sexy. The sale starts with several works from
the 90s by artists like Gober, Matthew Barney and Felix
Gonzalez-Torres, who have been popular at auction before.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's sale of contemporary art has a far different
complexion, in part because the auction house defines contemporary
art as works from 1945 to the present. Its sale, scheduled for
Tuesday evening, casts an even broader net than that. Because of
the number of pictures in its sale on Monday night, Sotheby's will
begin Tuesday's sale with a collection that includes modern and
contemporary works belonging to the Boston collectors Herbert and
Mildred Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Mrs. Lee began buying what were then considered
adventurous works. Now, they are viewed as downright desirable.
Besides its contemporary offerings, the collection includes some
older works, like a 1929 Calder and a 1952 Picasso. But all eyes
will be on Jasper Johns' ``White Numbers'' (1958), an
encaustic-onlinen painting of numbers in a progression from zero to
nine repeated horizontally and vertically in thick, gestural
strokes. It is expected to bring $7 million to $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinarily important work,'' said Tobias Meyer,
who runs Sotheby's' contemporary art worldwide. ``In light of the
recent purchase of Johns' `White Flag' by the Metropolitan Museum,
this is now one of the last white paintings by the artist
available.''

UPSET OVER BANANA TRADE, U.S. THREATENS TO TAX EUROPEAN IMPORTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration threatened Tuesday to
place 100 percent tariffs on wine, cheese and other imports from
Europe if the European Union did not lift its trade restrictions on
bananas sold by American companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner,
said at a news conference that the European nations would challenge
such duties in the World Trade Organization. ``In resorting to
unilateral action, the United States is setting itself above the
law and resorting to the principle of might is right,'' he
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Ziegler, a spokesman for the office of the U.S. trade
representative, Charlene Barshefsky, disagreed, accusing the
European Union of having failed to change its trade policies after
being ordered to do so by the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is consistent with our rights,'' Ziegler
said, ``and represents a measure of frustration that the European
Union continues to disavow its obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest round in a long struggle between the United
States and Europe over trade in bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities here said it was highly unlikely that the stiff
tariffs threatened Tuesday would ever be imposed. They said the
administration had made a bold move to get the European Union to
pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Clinton administration made similar threats to
place high tariffs on Japanese luxury cars and on Chinese textile
products, but withdrew the threats after those countries made
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the United States has complained that the big
American fruit distributors, Chiquita Brands International and the
Dole Food Co., were restrained from selling Latin American-grown
bananas in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has conceded that its regulations have
favored bananas from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries that
were once colonies of European nations. European officials contend
that the economies of these former colonies would be devastated if
they had to compete with lower-cost Latin American producers whose
bananas are sold by the American companies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the World Trade Organization, which administers trade
agreements and monitors national trade policies, ruled in favor of
the United States and ordered the European Union to modify its
regulations. The Europeans did so, but the Clinton administration
maintains that the modifications were, in Ziegler's words,
``nothing but window dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the main beneficiaries of increased banana sales in
Europe would be Carl H. Lindner, a Cincinnati investor who controls
Chiquita Brands and is one of the largest donors to political
campaigns in the United States. During the 1996 presidential race,
Lindner was an overnight guest of President Clinton in the Lincoln
Bedroom, and he allowed Bob Dole, the Republican candidate, to use
his family's aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to this year's congressional elections, Lindner, his
family and his company, the American Financial Corp., donated more
than $850,000 to candidates and parties, according to the Center
for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan watchdog organization that
monitors campaign finance practices. More than three-quarters of
the total went to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In a notice published Tuesday in the Federal Register, the
office of the U.S. trade representative said it would announce on
Dec. 15 exactly which products would be subject to the 100 percent
tariffs. They would go into effect Feb. 1.

REPUBLICANS SPLIT ON EVERY ASPECT OF IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 C.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After their election debacle and growing public
fatigue over the inquiry against President Clinton, House
Republicans are still feuding about the impeachment end game.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans know that the public does not want President Clinton
impeached, but they are divided over everything from which
witnesses to call, and how many, to how long to conduct the inquiry
and whether it should even be brought to a vote on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee seems likely to vote on articles
of impeachment in the coming weeks, but the panel is divided over
tactics. One faction, sensitive to criticisms of a proceeding with
only one witness testifying, is pressing for testimony from other
central players, including one of Clinton's closest White House
confidants, Bruce Lindsey.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the committee chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, eager
to keep the inquiry from dragging into next year when the
Republican majority will shrink by five seats, wants to wait until
after Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, testifies on Nov. 19
before deciding who else, if anyone, to call.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the committee, a small but growing number of Republicans
say the chances of impeaching the president are diminishing, and
that the committee should chart a graceful exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there are not enough votes to move this through the
House,'' said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind. Souder said that barring new
information, he would vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Packard, a California Republican and chief
vote-collector for Rep. Robert Livingston, the likely successor to
Newt Gingrich as speaker of the House, also voiced doubts.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is clearly going forward, Packard said
in an interview, but in the full House, ``we may not have the
votes. And in the Senate it is even less likely.''
</P>
<P>
   If the full House does not vote for impeachment, Packard said he
would like to see the whole subject dropped and does not want to
move to another alternative like censure. ``We either have the
votes or we don't,'' Packard said, adding that he spoke only for
himself and not for Livingston. ``I prefer it just die than just
create another option.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Livingston said he would wait for the recommendations
of Hyde and the committee. But he also said, ``The American public
have certainly indicated in the polls that they don't see it as an
impeachable or dismissible offense, and that would have to be
considered in the political arena.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The internal debate comes a day after Republicans and Democrats
drew ammunition for their respective positions from 19
constitutional scholars at a 10-hour subcommittee hearing. House
Democrats and the White House were quick to condemn the
Republican-led hearing as a rush to judgment.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed, from the very start, we heard strong statements
judging the evidence already and people, before they had even had a
chance to listen to the scholars, deciding and announcing what they
were planning to do,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, and again at a private meeting this morning,
several committee Republicans pressed Hyde to consider calling more
witnesses. This strategy aims in part to deflect criticisms that
the White House is not being permitted to question its accusers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been the potential for more witnesses because
the president has to be given some opportunity to rebut the
evidence,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say more witnesses might also be needed to clarify
conflicting statements if Clinton denies or refuses to answer some
of the 81 questions the committee asked last week about lying under
oath, witness tampering and obstruction of justice.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said the committee needed to find a
middle course between calling only Starr and conducting a fullblown
investigation into Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the Republicans' list is Lindsey. Calling the
White House aide as a witness became a more distinct possibility
after the Supreme Court on Monday refused to shield Lindsey from
questioning by prosecutors on what conversations he had with
Clinton about Lewinsky.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about it, yes,'' Hyde said on Monday. A top aide
to Hyde said Tuesday that no decisions on future witnesses have
been made.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the White House would ``take a view'' on Lindsey's
testifying if the committee asks, but the White House has tried at
every step to keep Lindsey from testifying.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Starr. Republicans voice concern that Democrats will
try to turn the inquiry into a trial of the independent counsel.
Gearing up for that, Republicans on the committee have received a
staff memorandum that outlines ``positive points'' about Starr as
well as responses to Democratic attacks on the independent counsel.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats initially wanted to call Starr to put him on the
defensive. Now, however, some Democrats say Starr might be a
credible witness, and others are complaining the hearing only gives
him a chance to recoup public credibility.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``How preposterous is it to invite the independent counsel who
is not a witness to anything, and who has already given us nearly
500 pages of what he thinks?'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California
Democrat on the committee.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are struggling with the end game, too. Many, like Rep.
Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts, are pressing for an alternative to
impeachment, like censure, despite Republicans' rejecting that idea
as a bad precedent.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats want to call more witnesses; some don't. ``How do
you determine what the president did if you don't cross-examine a
lot of witnesses?'' asked Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. ``If you
don't, then you're having the House act as a rubber stamp for Ken
Starr.''  &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With House Republicans torn over how far to push
the impeachment case against President Clinton, a bloc of moderate
GOP members Tuesday was poised to pressure party leaders to
speedily resolve the crisis, possibly short of an impeachment vote
in the full House.
</P>
<P>
   With as many as 40 members, the GOP moderate group could exert
powerful influence on Republican leaders by threatening to vote
with Democrats to kill the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the moderate bloc, led by Representative Nancy
L. Johnson of Connecticut, said several members are expected to
push for an alternative to Clinton's impeachment after the GOP
leadership races are resolved next week and the House Judiciary
Committee completes its inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the Judiciary Committee, which is controlled
by some of the GOP's staunchest social conservatives, will approve
articles of impeachment against Clinton as soon as early December.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than prolong the process by voting to send the
articles to the Senate for a trial, the House moderates are
expected to press GOP leaders to forge a compromise that calls for
sanctioning Clinton short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The possible alternatives include a motion to send the articles
of impeachment back to the Judiciary Committee with instructions to
replace them with a resolution calling for a reprimand or other
sanction.
</P>
<P>
   The moderate group, which played a key role in countering
conservative social and environmental initiatives in the current
Congress, includes two other New Englanders, Representatives
Charles F. Bass of New Hampshire and Christopher Shays of
Connecticut, as well as GOP lawmakers from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anything in the Starr report that would justify
removing the president from office,'' Shays said. ``We need to get
on with the nation's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Tuesday Club, the moderate group also includes
Banking Committee Chairman James A. Leach of Iowa, and several New
Yorkers, including Representatives Rick A. Lazio and Jack Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates have no connection to the so-called ``breakfast
club,'' a bipartisan group of Judiciary Committee members who are
considered open to alternatives to impeachment. Nearly every
Republican on the Judiciary Committee is considered conservative on
social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the lesson from the '98 election was that too many
within the Republican Party, especially the leadership, focused too
much on issues like impeachment and were less concerned with the
bread-and-butter issues people care about,'' said Johnson's chief
of staff, Dave Karvelas. ``We can't go overboard in one area to the
detriment of other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Judiciary Committee prepares to conduct its only major
hearing of the impeachment inquiry, a high-profile session next
week with independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, Republicans were
not alone Tuesday in fretting about the course of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reluctance of moderate Republicans to prolong the
inquiry, the House Democratic leader said he believes the GOP's
``dominant view'' is to keep the case alive next year in the 106th
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Richard A. Gephardt issued the partisan analysis
a day after most Republicans on the Judiciary Committee reaffirmed
their commitment to vote on articles of impeachment against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dominant view in the Republican Party is that this ought
to go on and on and at some point it will lead to impeachment in
the House,'' Gephardt said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, who met Tuesday with Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee, said the process also could be prolonged by the scramble
for GOP leadership posts after the resignation of Speaker Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worry is that their lack of defined leadership will kick
this over to next year,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Judiciary Committee members from both parties geared
up for Starr's hearing on Nov. 19, an appearance that is expected
to rank among the top Capitol Hill spectacles in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the panel met to prepare strategy to defend Starr
against Democrats attacks on his eight-month, $4 million
investigation of Clinton's consensual sexual affair in the White
House with former intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the defense plan, GOP members reviewed a summary of
``positive'' talking points about Starr, including statements such
as, ``Judge Starr is one of the country's premier lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some committee Democrats, who earlier had pressed for Starr's
appearance, have grown less enthusiastic amid concerns that Starr
could shine as witness, seizing the public's approval as Oliver
North did in the Iran-Contra hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility also exists that Starr could inflict additional
damage on Clinton by disclosing information about the independent
counsel's investigations into other matters, such as White House
political operatives possessing confidential FBI files and the
firing of White House travel office workers.
</P>
<P>
   But some committee Democrats appeared determined to
cross-examine Starr vigorously over his handling of the Lewinsky
matter and other areas of his four-year, $40 million investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little doubt that Republicans are using this hearing
as a vehicle to try to rehabilitate Ken Starr's credibility amid
charges of conflict of interst, unlawfully leaking information, and
failing to disclose the basis on which he expanded his jurisdiction
to Lewinsky,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a
Massachusetts Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. ``All of the
controversies have resulted in his credibility being undermined.''
</P>
<P>
   The highest ranking Judiciary Democrat, Representative John
Conyers Jr., has been among Starr's most vocal critics. Starr has
never been questioned under oath in Congress about his
investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Meehan said Republicans plan to place five-minute limits on
each committee member's cross-examination of Starr, which he said
could prevent a thorough review of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to adequately cross-examine Ken Starr, a prosecutor
would need at least two days,'' said Meehan, a former county
prosecutor. ``All we're going to get is five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican committee aides said Starr may testify for two days,
which would permit each of the panel's 37 members to conduct
additional rounds of questioning.

NEW GERMAN LEADER LAYS OUT GRAND AMBITIONS, BUT SCANT ON DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Proclaiming that Germany has ``come of age'' and should
feel ``neither superior nor inferior to anyone,'' Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder said Tuesday that the return of the capital to
Berlin next year represented ``a new beginning'' for a country
still divided and afflicted by high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural speech to Parliament, Schroeder, the first
Social Democratic chancellor since Helmut Schmidt resigned in 1982,
laid out a program of sweeping ambitions but scant detail that
seemed unlikely to end questioning about what his ``New Middle'' in
German politics really means.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor suggested that Germany had now emerged once and
for all from its postwar tutelage _ ``Today our democracy is no
longer a tender seedling, it is a strong upstanding tree'' _ but
appeared to leave open the question of exactly how the emergent
society he once again called the ``Berlin Republic'' would be
invigorated.
</P>
<P>
   The ``flagship project'' of the new ``Red-Green'' coalition of
Social Democrats and environmentalist Greens would be ``the
ecological renewal of our country in a spirit of solidarity, with a
modern, social market economy as our goal,'' Schroeder said in
Bonn, the current seat of government.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that the social-market model that was the basis
of Germany's postwar growth is under extreme pressure from the
rising costs of pensions and unemployment benefits and appears to
have lost the ability to create jobs. More than four million
Germans, more than 10 percent of the workforce, are without work.
</P>
<P>
   Ecological renewal will in practice be costly _ gasoline and
other energy prices are to rise as a result of new taxes, and the
nuclear power stations that provide about a third of Germany's
energy needs are to be gradually phased out. But Schroeder said he
would use the energy tax revenue to reduce labor costs, thus
providing a potential incentive for companies to hire, while the
quest for new sources of energy would eventually stimulate
innovative technology and job-creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A speech by the new chancellor in a situation like ours should
have more concrete goals and steps for the coming months,'' said
Franz Schoser, a political analyst at the Association of German
Industry and Trade. ``Most companies will in reality have higher
taxation for the next two years, and we do not think this is the
way to tackle unemployment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder said German companies would ``eventually'' be
taxed at a maximum rate of 35 percent _ a sharp drop from the
current maximum rate of about 47 percent _ and announced that an
``Alliance for Jobs'' bringing together business and labor unions
to discuss new ways to create employment would convene for the
first time next month. Unions applauded this step.
</P>
<P>
   How jobs would be found was left unclear, and Schroeder appeared
to stand on both sides of the fence on the question of reforming
social security.
</P>
<P>
   He attacked the high cost of Germany's welfare state, saying
there are ``grounds for believing that it is our social security
system and its high costs that drive ever more people into
circumventing the system, into illegal jobs,'' and declaring that
``the way we organize social security is in fact endangering or
destroying jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   These statements amounted to a public avowal of what many
Germans privately concede: that they are often better off
collecting comprehensive benefits and working in the ``black''
economy than looking for a legal job.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Schroeder announced that among his
government's most immediate steps would be the reversal of the very
limited cutbacks of social security undertaken by the previous
government. Curtailment of sick pay and limits on protection
against dismissal _ two measures passed by the center-right
government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl _ would be rescinded as of
Jan. 1, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   His program was bluntly attacked by Wolfgang Schauble, the
combative new leader of the Christian Democrats, who replaced Kohl
this month. ``I have not found anything of the new center, but
plenty of the old left, and even more confusion,'' he said. ``Your
speech was remarkably vague.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Schroeder's message appeared vaguest on the most
critical and difficult question _ how to create jobs _ and bolder
on the idea that Germany has entered a new phase of national
self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   German nationality would be opened to many more foreigners
because ``our national consciousness depends not on some `law of
descent' of Wilhelmine tradition but on the self-assured democracy
we have become,'' Schroeder said, referring to the 1913 citizenship
legislations. He plans to abandon that law's insistence on ``German
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears that a ``Berlin Republic'' may sound ``too Prussian and
authoritarian, too centralist,'' are completely unfounded, the
chancellor said. Rather, the new capital would symbolize a
``completely nonaggressive'' vision of ``solidarity and innovation,
enterprise and civic spirit, ecological responsibility and
political leaders who see themselves as modern managers of
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where Is Schroeder?'' the weekly magazine Der Spiegel asked
this week, on a cover showing the chancellor's blue eyes peeking
through the clouds. The question reflected a sense that he has not
yet asserted his authority over the new government.
</P>
<P>
   The answer Tuesday appeared to be that the chancellor has a
strong sense of the new German spirit he wishes to embody _ one
that has found a strong echo with his people _ without having firm
ideas about how to bring that spirit to life.

ISRAELI CABINET SET TO ENDORSE PALESTINIAN PACT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After a nearly two-week delay, the Israeli Cabinet
will meet Wednesday to approve the new Israeli-Palestinian accord,
renewing deliberations suspended after a suicide bombing in
Jerusalem last Friday, the government announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet meeting was announced under intense U.S. pressure to
resume the process of ratifying the agreement, which has been
repeatedly postponed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since the
accord, known as the Wye Memorandum, was signed in Washington on
Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which calls for an Israeli troop withdrawal from
13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown
on violent militants, was supposed to be carried out over 12 weeks
from Nov. 2, but it has been delayed pending Israeli ratification.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from rightist allies, including Cabinet members
critical of the accord, Netanyahu has demanded assurances that the
Palestinians are combating terrorism and arresting wanted suspects,
and that they will vote again to cancel clauses in the PLO charter
that call for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Wednesday's Cabinet meeting cited
Palestinian anti-terrorist steps, but added that approval of the
accord would include a condition that the Palestine National
Council, the broadest decision-making body of the PLO, must vote to
change the charter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cabinet will meet tomorrow at noon to complete the
discussion and to approve the Wye Agreement,'' said a statement
from Netanyahu's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister decided to convene the Cabinet after
receiving reports that the Palestinian Authority has begun taking
practical steps against the terrorist infrastructures and the
terrorists in its area,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack in Jerusalem on Friday, in which 24 people were
wounded and the two bombers were killed, the Cabinet suspended its
deliberations, saying it would meet only when it was satisfied that
the Palestinian Authority is waging an ``all-out war'' on militants
who have carried out two suicide bombings since the accord was
signed.
</P>
<P>
   David Bar-Illan, a spokesman for Netanyahu, said Tuesday that
there had been ``satisfactory'' reports from Israeli security
agencies that the Palestinians had taken ``some concrete steps
against terrorists, and that they are planning to take even more
steps.'' He added that these steps ``are different, qualitatively
and quantitatively, than before.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After Friday's attack, which was claimed by the Islamic Holy War
movement, the Palestinian security forces said they had rounded up
members of the organization in the West Bank. The Palestinians were
also reported to be pursuing the head of the cell that carried out
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Palestinian charter, the statement added: ``In
the event that the government ratifies the Wye agreement, the
following condition will be attached to the decision:
`Implementation of the rest of the agreement will be conditional
upon the convening of the Palestine National Council and on the
vote to amend the charter as promised.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have insisted that the council will not hold a
vote in addition to a resolution it took in April 1996 to cancel
the clauses in its charter that call for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye agreement says council members and other Palestinian
officials will be invited to a meeting addressed by President
Clinton to ``reaffirm their support for the peace process'' and for
decisions by PLO executive bodies confirming nullification of the
offending clauses.
</P>
<P>
   After the Wye agreement is ratified by the Israeli Cabinet, it
will be be debated in Parliament, where it is expected to win broad
approval, with the support of the Labor opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu faces strong resistance from some members of his
rightist coalition who oppose the further handover of territory to
the Palestinians. They have vowed to join forces with the
opposition to topple the government in parliamentary votes later
on.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Israeli ratification of the accord raised
cautious hopes among Palestinian officials, who have condemned the
repeated delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they will ratify the accord, and I hope that they will
refrain from any statement to undermine the effort to build a level
of trust that is needed,'' said Saeb Erakat, a senior Palestinian
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Netanyahu will look at the bigger picture,'' Erakat
added. ``We will continue carrying out our obligations to the
letter.''

LIVINGSTON PUTTING TOGETHER LEADERSHIP STAFF BEFORE WINNING
SPEAKER'S POST

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana began putting
together new leadership staff and working on committee assignments
Tuesday even though he has not yet been officially elected as the
new speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who is expected to be tapped Republican members on
Nov. 18 to replace Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., met in the evening with
outgoing speaker to discuss the transition of power.
</P>
<P>
   Working in his office across from the Capitol, Livingston
continued placing phone calls to members to shore up support. He
told many of them that he would likely name Rep. C.W. ``Bill''
Young of Florida to take Livingston's old post as chairman of the
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNN, Livingston said he hopes that his
tenure as speaker will be almost ``boring,'' when compared to
Gingrich's four-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   He called himself a conservative, but said he would replace the
``flamboyance'' and partisan conservatism of the Gingrich era with
a more pragmatic management style designed to overcome legislative
logjams of the kind that forced two government shutdowns in 1995
and early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being simply conservative and making grand speeches doesn't do
any good if we can't get the bills through the House and Senate and
on the president's desk,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to allow committee chairmen greater freedom than
Gingrich did and said he said he would not inject himself into the
impeachment inquiry being conducted by Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston promised that his first act as the new speaker will
be to introduce legislation that will take the Social Security
Trust Fund off budget. The surplus trust fund has been used in the
past to help balance the federal budget, a process that Livingston
and other members on both sides of the aisle say has undermined its
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has not been elected yet, Livingston said has
discussed all kinds of leadership business of leadership business
like arranging the schedule for ``freshmen orientation'' later this
week. The next speaker will also be involved in making revisions in
the House rules that often led to angry show-downs with Democrats
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Livingston told members plans to remain neutral in
the three other battles being waged for the jobs of majority
leader, GOP conference chairman and head of the Republican National
Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey of Irving currently holds the the No. 2 post of
majority leader, but faces a tough challenge from Reps. Jennifer
Dunn of Washington and Steve Largent of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   There was also talk around Capitol Hill Monday that Rep. Bill
Thomas of California, who currently chairs the House Oversight
Committee, may decide to challenge Armey, whom many members blame
as much as they do Gingrich for the loss of five GOP House seats to
the Democrats in this year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the opposition, Armey aides said he was confident that
he has enough committed votes to come out ahead of any of his
challengers when members meet next week to cast their secret
ballots for the new leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   Armey will have to get a majority of the 222 votes expected to
be cast in the Nov. 18 election. ``We know how to count votes,''
his press secretary Michelle Green said, when asked if Armey has
enough support.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Largent, a hard-line conservative and former pro football
star, said he was prepared to call what he described as an Armey
bluff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a head fake when I see one,'' he said, adding that his
internal counting shows the Texan way short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the incumbent majority leader hasn't locked up
his re-election bid . . . sends a clear signal that the caucus is
not behind Dick and is seriously weighing a change,'' Largent said.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's bid for re-election has apparently been undermined by
the fact that House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas has yet to
throw the full weight of his vote-getting organization behind him.
Although DeLay is expected to vote for his fellow Texan, Republican
aides said that Armey has not yet asked his colleague for help.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because the two have not been on the best of terms
since last year when DeLay ended up taking most of the blame for a
failed coup that conservative members mounted against Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Armey was involved early on in discussions among conservatives
about removing Gingrich, but bailed out of the insurrection after
it became clear that he might lose his leadership post in the
process. His flip-flop ended up alienating a lot of conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who was blamed by some of his colleagues for the GOP
losses as well, is the only Republican leader who is not facing a
challenge in his re-election bid. Members who intend to support him
say that he is still considered the best at pulling together the
votes needed from both sides of the aisle to pass crucial
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Although DeLay, one of the most conservative members of
Congress, has said little since the election about the upheaval
within the leadership, he has moved quickly to mend fences with
angry Republicans who believe his job should be up for grabs as
well. In addition to throwing his whip organization behind
Livingston, he has also been calling members on behalf of moderate
Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia who challenging conservative John Linder
of Georgia for head of the party's congressional campaign
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Delay's support, Davis is believed to have the job
all wrapped up over Linder, who was appointed to his position two
years ago by Gingrich. &QL;

NASA WEIGHS RUSSIAN REQUEST TO CHANGE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NASA is considering a last-minute request from the
Russian Space Agency to change the planned orbit of the upcoming
International Space Station, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the flight of the first part of the space station less than
two weeks away, the Russians have raised the possibility of putting
the new complex in an orbit much closer to their old Mir station
than originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   While NASA says it is considering the change proposed by Russia
at face value, some experts on the Russian space program question
the motives behind the request. Putting the new station near Mir
could be part of a plan to delay the decommissioning and
destruction of the older station, critics suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This move on the orbital changes would open up all sort of
options for the Russians,'' James E. Oberg of Houston, a former
NASA engineer who is an expert on the Russian space program, said.
``The actual game plan may take a while to come clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Russian economy has resulted in little money
for the Russian Space Agency, raising doubts as to whether the
limited resources available could support both the new program and
Mir. To ease these concerns, the Russians have promised NASA they
would discard Mir next summer, but Russian nationalists have
campaigned recently to preserve the station, a symbol of the
nation's achievements in space.
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne Brown, a NASA spokesman, said Tuesday that the agency
received the Russian request late last week and would make a
decision on the proposed change by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians said they wanted to transfer some equipment off
of Mir to the International Space Station and that this orbital
change would make it easier,'' Brown said. ``The request only
concerned moving internal equipment from Mir, not transferring
modules from Mir to the new station.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Russian and American space planners were discussing
the ramifications of such an orbital change on building the new
station, as well as how any equipment transfer would take place.
Making such a change would require a lot of last-minute work,
including making new orbital calculations and adjusting the
timelines of upcoming missions that have to be coordinated with the
first flight, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and 15 other nations plan to begin building
the new space station in orbit on Nov. 20 when the Russians launch
a module called Zarya that will supply power and propulsion during
the early stages of construction. The Russians want to launch
Zarya, build in Russia under U.S. contract, 10 hours later than
planned so that its orbit ends up close to Mir's.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to lift off in the
predawn hours of Dec. 3 with the second station part, an
American-built connecting passageway called Unity that will be
attached to Zarya. If the Russians change their launch time, the
shuttle takeoff also would have to change.
</P>
<P>
   Oberg said Tuesday that when the Russians reach agreements, it
is not uncommon for them to seek seemingly minor changes as a
deadline approaches. ``The fact that the Russians waited two weeks
before launch to pull this rabbit out of the hat suggests that
there is some kind of trick here,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Russia suggested that two of the newer laboratory
modules on Mir, Spektr and Piroda, be moved to the new station to
substitute for new research modules it promised the new project but
cannot afford to build. However, the other station partners
rejected the notion.
</P>
<P>
   Having the two stations in close orbit makes it easier to send
material back and forth between them, or to divert cargoes from one
to another, Oberg said. For instance, he added, if Russia becomes
dissatisfied with the international project for any reason, he
said, this gives it an option of taking its modules off the new
station and attaching them to Mir.

GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES, OPPONENTS PREDICT PROBLEMS WITH NEW `INSTANT
CHECK' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN DRAKE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gun control advocates and opponents Tuesday expressed concerns
about the new phase of the Brady gun control law that institutes
instant criminal background checks for firearms purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   The new phase, to begin Nov. 30, eliminates the five-day waiting
period to do a federal criminal background check for handgun
purchases. Instead federally licensed gun dealers will be required
to do an instant check on purchases of handgun and rifles.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI was to use an electronic system similar to those used
for credit cards to handle the instant checks, but that won't be
ready before January, according to Emet Rathbun, the FBI unit chief
in charge of setting up the system. Instead, FBI staff will man
toll-free telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   State and local authorities will have the option of keeping a
waiting period and can conduct their own background checks, as
California will, for example. But Houston law enforcement officials
said they will convert to the new federal system.
</P>
<P>
   In the Houston area, both city police and sheriff departments
now check local, state and federal criminal records. Even an
outstanding warrant for an unpaid traffic ticket or missing an
appearance in court can disqualify a purchaser, said Capt. Don
McWilliams, spokesman for the sheriff's department.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office runs about 750 checks a month, 9,000 a
year; police have reviewed 2,649 and rejected 370 between 1994 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Brady law, named after Ronald Reagan's press secretary who
was shot in a presidential assassination attempt, was passed in
1993. Pro-gun groups such as the National Rifle Association fought
the law in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The Violence Policy Center, a national gun-control group, issued
a report Tuesday that raised questions about how the new federal
system will work, particularly in states such as Texas that will
drop local background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control groups are concerned that local mental health
records won't be included in the new national database. Those
records are usually not on computer, and many states have records
protecting them.
</P>
<P>
   But Rathbun said the new federal system will contain about
350,000 records of the mentally unstable, though that does not
include people deemed unstable by private or local institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A new law about misdemeanor domestic violence convictions also
has gun control groups concerned, although it faces court tests
over its constitutionality. The Lautenberg law, named after
Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, prohibits law
enforcement officers and military personnel who have been convicted
of a domestic violence misdemeanor from carrying guns.
</P>
<P>
   Records often do not reflect domestic violence convictions,
listing it instead as a misdemeanor assault or disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   If a buyer has a common name that matches a convicted felon's
name, the National Instant Check System (NICS) staff will tell the
gun dealer to delay the sale while they investigate the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The burden of proof is on the FBI, though, to prove the case
within three federal working days, not counting the day of the
inquiry. After that, the buyer can purchase the firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates agree with pro-gun groups that the process
could overwhelm NICS staff. Most firearm purchases take place on a
Saturday and aren't spaced evenly through the week. The FBI could
get between 30,000 to 40,000 inquiries on a Saturday in November or
December, according to the FBI and the Texas Gun Owners
Association. The phase kicks in at the height of hunting season,
especially in Texas, and at the beginning of the gift-giving
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI will have 200-300 people at the toll-free call-in
center, where operators will punch in a buyer's information. Eighty
percent of the time the operator will tell the dealer to proceed
with or deny the sale. But if the buyer appears to have a criminal
background, the operator passes the case to one of 513 workers who
must determine if the buyer really matches the record, and if that
record disqualifies the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The center will operate 17 hours a day, seven days a week. &QL;

<P>
   Since the dawn of the recording era, collections of songs and
arias have held a special place in the hearts and on the shelves of
music lovers. Early on, listeners themselves bunched 78s together
to form extended programs. But with the advent of the long-playing
record in the late 1940s, full-length recitals and concept albums
arrived prepackaged.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, Italian opera arias commanded pride of place
within the genre, and they still do, as yet another recording from
the Three Tenors attests. But disks of German lieder or even French
and Russian repertory have never been in short supply. And
occasionally, a set of Spanish or even Scandinavian songs peppers
the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Arias from American operas, however, have not found much of a
home on record. Until recently, in fact, American operas themselves
have largely been ignored. Now the release of two CDs by the
sopranos Dawn Upshaw and Renee Fleming suggests that the tide may
be turning. The two albums, Ms. Upshaw's ``World So Wide''
(Nonesuch 79458-2) and Ms. Fleming's ``I Want Magic'' (London 289
460 567-2), concentrate on repertory that most listeners will find
unfamiliar, though several of the composers _ Gershwin, Copland,
Barber and Bernstein among them _ are household names.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, ``The World So Wide'' is a follow-up to ``I Wish
It So,'' Ms. Upshaw's exceptional 1994 collection of American
theater songs, also on Nonesuch. There, the soprano applied her
warm, agile, eager sound to music by Bernstein, Weill, Sondheim and
Marc Blitzstein. On her new record, the repertory falls primarily
into two categories: arias in some way associated with the American
heartland (selections by Copland, Carlisle Floyd and Douglas Moore)
and items in which an urban esthetic prevails (works by Bernstein,
Barber, Weill and John Adams). One piece, ``Oh Yemanja,'' composed
by the Cuban emigree Tania Leon, fits neither grouping.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Upshaw begins with ``Laurie's Song'' from Copland's 1954
opera ``The Tender Land,'' in which an intelligent but sheltered
girl on the cusp of adulthood muses about her future. The soprano's
earnest expression and crisp diction perfectly suit this music,
with its clean lines and simple orchestration.
</P>
<P>
   And the soprano is no less persuasive in ``This Is Prophetic''
from Adams' ``Nixon in China,'' which had its premiere in 1987. The
combination of the composer's repetitive style and the librettist
Alice Goodman's sententious lyrics might make this a dreary
exercise, but Ms. Upshaw, as Pat Nixon, finds poetry in these
hypnotic strains, and point, too. (When she utters the line, ``let
Gypsy Rose/ Kick off her high-heeled party shoes,'' it is
impossible not to crack a knowing smile.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What a Movie,'' an unapologetic showstopper from Bernstein's
``Trouble in Tahiti'' (1951), finds Ms. Upshaw, as a suburban
housewife named Dinah, relating the plot of a harebrained film.
Here, Ms. Upshaw, using a variety of inflections, reveals her
unrivaled affinity for musical comedy, which this pastiche
satirizes in grand fashion, complete with blaring brass, xylophone
and snare drum.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leon's ``Oh Yemanja,'' from her 1994 chamber opera ``Scourge
of Hyacinths,'' is a mother's prayer for her son's well-being.
Based on a radio play by the Nigerian Wole Soyinka, the work
concerns a young man's attempt to flee persecution. In this spare
music, the soprano's focused timbre conveys both maternal concern
and a faintly exotic atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Upshaw is at her best in music like the languorous,
sentimental ``Willow Song'' from Douglas Moore's ``Ballad of Baby
Doe'' (1956), in which the singer's personal magnetism combines
with the material to form an irresistible mixture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lonely House,'' from Weill's evocative ``Street Scene'' of
1947, places the soprano in a very different world, singing words
Langston Hughes wrote for a tenor. Yet Ms. Upshaw, with all the
assurance of a jazz diva, lends this soliloquy an urbane
world-weariness.
</P>
<P>
   In a bold move, Ms. Upshaw tackles ``Give Me Some Music,'' one
of Cleopatra's arias from Barber's ill-fated ``Antony and
Cleopatra,'' composed for the 1966 opening of the new Metropolitan
Opera House in Lincoln Center. This is grandiose, even
grandiloquent, music, and though the soprano can't summon the
majesty one associates with Leontyne Price, who created the role,
Ms. Upshaw imparts an earnest eroticism to strains in need of a
human touch.
</P>
<P>
   The disk concludes with the ravishing ``Ain't It a Pretty
Night'' from Carlisle Floyd's ``Susannah'' (1955). A wrenching tale
of a woman wrongly accused of being ``of the devil,'' the work is a
rare example of an American opera that has enjoyed continual favor
and a measure of renown. Ms. Upshaw sings this moving aria of a
young woman's dreams and the comforts of home with a freshness and
sense of wonder few can match.
</P>
<P>
   For support, Ms. Upshaw could hardly do better than the
Orchestra of St. Luke's under David Zinman's direction; a keen
interpreter of American music, Zinman skillfully guides these
accomplished players through a host of American idioms.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming's ``I Want Magic'' also provides a superb showcase
for the rich variety of American operatic music. Moreover, it
presents Ms. Fleming's opulent, mellifluous, multi-hued soprano in
material well suited to her gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The disk opens on a haunting note, with ``I Have Dreamt'' from
Bernard Herrmann's ``Wuthering Heights,'' an opera completed in
1951 but not staged until 1982. As Emily Bronte's doomed heroine
Cathy, Ms. Fleming compellingly blends plushness with implicit
melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Letter Song'' from ``The Ballad of Baby Doe'' also works
well for the soprano. In this anguished aria, Ms. Fleming
communicates heartbreak without overstatement. And in ``Monica's
Waltz'' from Gian Carlo Menotti's ``Medium,'' which had its
premiere in 1946, the soprano handily masters the challenge of
voicing two characters, the medium's daughter and the servant,
Toby.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming even makes her mark in such familiar music as
``Summertime'' and ``My Man's Gone Now'' from Gershwin's 1935 opera
``Porgy and Bess.'' The competition may seem insurmountable, but
the soprano's sumptuous approach has legitimate appeal, and her
glittering sultriness is hard to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bernstein's ``Glitter and Be Gay,'' Cunegonde's campy
coloratura scena from ``Candide'' (1956), receives a strange,
pushed reading, with the soprano adopting and then abandoning what
sounds like a German accent. This account is less characterful than
Ms. Upshaw's performance on the ``I Wish It So'' album, nor can it
compete in vocal pyrotechnics with a version recorded live last
year by the French soprano Natalie Dessay at the EMI centenary
gala.
</P>
<P>
   In the two arias from ``Susannah,'' which she will sing at the
Metropolitan Opera in the spring, Ms. Fleming is at her most
inspired. Employing a subtle Southern drawl, she invests ``Ain't It
a Pretty Night'' with even greater emotional urgency than Ms.
Upshaw. And in ``The Trees on the Mountains,'' her straightforward
tenderness and incisive vocalism prove overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Word From Tom,'' from Stravinsky's ``Rake's Progress''
(1951), may seem an odd choice for this disk, but the Russian-born
composer had been an American citizen for several years when he
wrote the opera. Regardless, Ms. Fleming's vibrant, affecting
performance is its own defense.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Upshaw, Ms. Fleming has included an aria by Barber, but
here the choice is ``He Has Come, He Has Come'' from ``Vanessa,''
which had its premiere in 1958. Ms. Fleming is convincingly fervid
in this music, but she lacks the neurotic appeal that made the
legendary Eleanor Steber so gripping in the role.
</P>
<P>
   Given that she just starred as Blanche in the premiere of Andre
Previn's ``Streetcar Named Desire,'' Ms. Fleming understandably
concludes her CD with an excerpt from the new opera, ``I Want
Magic!'' More arioso than aria, the piece represents Blanche's
credo as told to Mitch, and Ms. Fleming, her Southern accent firmly
in place, sings it with an ardency perhaps only a creator can
bestow.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be music's version of a royal flush, Ms. Fleming's
accompaniment comes from the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and its
maestro, James Levine. Their support contributes to this album's
success not only by providing distinguished, polished playing, but
also by lending undeniable cachet to the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   One hesitates to maintain that the release of two new
recordings, even such fine ones, marks a sea change in the fate of
American arias on disk. Yet by giving their voices to the cause,
Ms. Fleming and Ms. Upshaw have raised the profile of music they
hold dear. Lovers of great singing should take note (if they
haven't already) and turn their attentions to this repertory as
well.

COMMENTARY: OF FROGS AND NEWTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One show was about a frog.
</P>
<P>
   The other, a Newt.
</P>
<P>
   I was trying to watch the last gasp of Newt Gingrich on C-Span
on Monday night. But when he held up that laminated copy of the
original Contract With America, bragging once again that it had
been printed in TV Guide, treating it as reverently as if it were a
sacred piece of 18th-century parchment, talking about the little
holes he had punched in the contract as each item became law, I
lost it.
</P>
<P>
   TV Guide. That's an excellent idea. What else is on?
</P>
<P>
   I clicked over to Fox. There, on ``Ally McBeal,'' was another
amphibian expiring in an undignified manner. The pet frog of Ally's
boss, a lawyer known as The Biscuit, ended up being served to him
as dinner in a Chinese restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   I began flipping back and forth between Ally and Newt,
mesmerized by the juxtaposition of two of the most neurotic
creatures of modern America. There they were, hollow cheek by plump
jowl. The lawyer in the micro-minis and the speaker in the
pinstripes. Two revolutionaries who have graced the cover of Time.
Two famously nutty, adolescent, undisciplined, self-absorbed
figures with eating problems, a habit of driving feminists crazy
and a talent for tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   They are chatty icons of the if-it's-about-me-it's-interesting
view of life. They spent all their time inventing and reinventing
themselves. Her inner thoughts are acted out as fantasy sequences.
His inner thoughts are also pathologically transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Noonan's observation in The Wall Street Journal about Newt
could also apply to Ally, that he ``did not sense that an unshared
thought can have power, that the face you have when you have an
observation that you're too circumspect to share is an interesting
face, and an interesting face has a certain mystery . . . and
mystery has a certain power.''
</P>
<P>
   What was really intriguing, flipping between them, is how
quickly revolutions in our culture grow stale. In the rush of TV
imagery, spectacles that are hot turn cold so swiftly they can
freeze meat. For Newt, the golden age was only four seasons ago.
For Ally, it was last season.
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper columns, Ms. Noonan and David Broder drew parallels
between Gingrich and Richard Nixon, predicting that the speaker was
relentless and would not be absent long from the political arena.
He could have used his Gopac dinner as a trampoline to leap into
the next phase of his career. But, like Ally, he turns himself
inside out, putting the wounded inner child on display for everyone
to see. He makes his frat-boy doppelgaenger at the other end of
Pennsylvania Avenue seem mature. The routines are so tired that one
of the Gopac zealots was caught on camera nodding off.
</P>
<P>
   I flipped back to Ally. Billy, the tiresome ex-love-of-her-life,
was still moping around the show, while she was consigning another
loser boyfriend to the Dumpster _ a sight gag from last season.
</P>
<P>
   I flipped back to Newt. Relief! ``Finally,'' he was finally
saying.
</P>
<P>
   I flipped back to Ally. They were back in the unisex bathroom, a
setting that has lost its novelty as a device for overhearing
confessions to the sound of rushing and flushing water.
</P>
<P>
   I flipped back to Newt. ``Second,'' he was saying. Uh-oh. Now he
was sounding like an old Quincy Jones production. ``The world has
been good to us,'' he said, ``and we have been good to the world.''
(The world refused to comment.)
</P>
<P>
   Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, C-Span touted on
screen the show next up: ``Impeachment interpretation hearing.
C-Span tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's something to be said for commercials and ratings.
C-Span has turned politics into a TV series that nobody has the
power to pull.
</P>
<P>
   I flipped to Ally. I don't care what she says in interviews.
She's shrinking. Her hands look like claws. She needs an infusion
of Chubby Hubby.
</P>
<P>
   I flipped back to Newt. He's not shrinking. I was thinking about
some of the best closing lines of great political speeches, even by
losers.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1980 Democratic convention, Sen. Edward Kennedy brought
down the house with this finale: ``The work goes on, the cause
endures, the hope still lives _ and the dream shall never die.''
Newt, who so often overreached for grandiosity, also seemed to be
going for the poetry, but fell short with this clunker: ``The venue
changes and the cause lives on.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Ally might say, the cause changes but the venue lives on.

A CELEBRATION OF THE SPIRITUAL WHERE SOME SEE SIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 15)  
 (bl)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Life is a battle for the human soul between the
forces of the sacred and the profane. Or so it would seem even to a
casual voyager through theological musings on dance over the last
four centuries. Dance, like sex, was marginally allowable as a
duty, a way of maintaining a healthy body. Otherwise, dancing led
to perdition. ``Of the 500,000 fallen women in the United States,
over 300,000 started from the ballroom,'' W.W. Hamilton, a Baptist
minister from Virginia, stoutly proclaimed early this century.
</P>
<P>
   But dance has a connection to the spirit that is intimate,
immediate and unavoidable. An art that merges abstraction and the
literal physicality of the human body, dance became
self-referential in the mid-20th century, making a virtue of being
about nothing more than the body itself.
</P>
<P>
   Yet dance has remained singularly capable of evoking the spirit,
whether in the soul of a dancer who has achieved selflessness in
motion or in the soul of the viewer identifying with that physical
exaltation.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in theaters a few blocks apart in Brooklyn, two
programs will address and seek to incorporate and represent the
spirit. The dance in those programs is worlds apart in time,
history and geography. The Madras-based Chandralekha, whose new
full-evening ``Raga: In Search of Femininity'' is to open Wednesday
for four performances at the Majestic Theater, presented by the
Next Wave Festival of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, comes from the
East and a culture that at least by Western standards is permeated
with the spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   A performer of the Bharata Natyam school of stylized Indian
dance-drama, Chandralekha left the field to devote herself to
political activism. When she returned in the mid-1980s, it was to
create a form of dance that merges traditional Eastern and modern
Western movement forms in the service, largely, of summoning the
spiritual. Her ``Raga'' aims to embody the unseen self ``that
hovers in between,'' that ``is neither man nor woman,'' in the
words of a poem by the 10th-century poet Devara Daslmayya that
partly inspired the piece. Chandralekha's innovations, while
acclaimed internationally, have been controversial at home in
India. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three choreographers whose work will be shown in ``Dance and
Spiritual Life,'' the second event, are a part of a long, though
largely unacknowledged, tradition in American modern dance.
Unusually, attention will be paid to the potential of dance to
connect the spirit and the body in the one-performance program
Saturday, which features choreography by Dianne McIntyre, Bebe
Miller and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, three black choreographers who
have been prominent on the American modern-dance landscape during
the last several decades.
</P>
<P>
   Their work will be presented by 651, An Arts Center at the
Academy Opera House, with free ancillary workshops and discussions
on the subject of dance and the spirit, particularly in black
American culture, to be given this week in various locations in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly does ``spirit'' mean in these far-flung contexts?
For Chandralekha, ``sensuality, sexuality, spirituality are all
unified in the body,'' as the choreographer told Shanta Gokhale in
a recent interview in Persona magazine. ``My work is about linking
inner and outer spaces. We live in the body without understanding
its vital parts and points and without the knowledge of how to
bridge the inner-outer divide.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, body and spirit are separate entities in the works
in ``Dance and Spiritual Life,'' with the yearning, vital distance
between them the subject of much of the choreography. The dancers,
singers and actors in Ms. McIntyre's ``Love Poems to God,'' a
collaboration with the composer and poet Hannibal Lokumbe, engage
in ``intimate conversations with God in a way that is very
personal,'' Ms. McIntyre said.
</P>
<P>
   A funny, sad and awesome vision of God emerges in Ms. Zollar's
``Transitions,'' a ritualistic piece built around the dancers'
taped memories of their ideas of God from childhood on. Ms.
Miller's ``Blessed,'' performed to a cappella gospel music by an
Australian group called the Cafe of the Gate of Salvation, comes
closest to an abstract blending of mind and soul.
</P>
<P>
   None of these works refers to specific religious tradition.
American dance studios, unlike foxholes, seem to be home to a fair
share of nonbelievers. ``Religious imagery is not paramount to the
delineation of spiritual content,'' the dance historian Joe Nash
said. Nash will participate in Dance in the Black Church, a ``Dance
and Spiritual Life'' discussion Thursday night at the Cornerstone
Baptist Church in the Bedford Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha Graham uses religious imagery to further her thesis
about the spiritual nature of Joan of Arc in `Seraphic
Dialogues,''' he said , but what about Doris Humphrey's ``Day on
Earth'' and the serene, quasi-spiritual look it takes at the human
life cycle? ``There's no religious imagery there, but the quality
comes through,'' Nash said. ``Eleo Pomare's `Blues for the Jungle,'
a dance about violence in the city, is a choreographer's response
to suffering humanity. The church finale in Alvin Ailey's
`Revelations' serves as the inspiration for the whole work, but the
spirituality that comes through is because of the rich images he
has created, the blending of the music and the movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Isadora Duncan said that dance is the divine expression of the
human soul. Ted Shawn and Ruth St. Denis talked about the spiritual
component of dance. ``Even in Merce Cunningham's `Summerspace,'
where the dancers blend with the background, there is a feeling of
mystery,'' Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit was always at the heart of American modern dance.
But scholars did not wish to write about this area. It wasn't until
years later, when people began to look more deeply into modern
dance, that they began to see the ritual aspects, the spiritual
elements. And now is a time when people are discussing this
question of spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   Paleolithic-era cave drawings suggest that dance or formal,
ritualized movement symbolized everyday activities in primitive
life. Movement has been an integral part of religious ritual
through time, and there has been a recent resurgence of interest in
liturgical dance in America.
</P>
<P>
   Dance is finding its way back into religious services and the
personal investigation of faith in ways that range from Kathleen
Sumler's 20-year-old dance ministry at the Allen AME Church in
Jamaica, Queens, to JoAnne Tucker's newly developed workshops in
exploring Talmudic and Biblical texts through dance improvisation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There has been a huge increase in the number of black-dance
ministries in this country over the last two decades, although
dance as a vehicle of prayer is still frowned upon by many
traditional black churches. Much recent dance by black
choreographers makes room for the spiritual openly and in
distinctive ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a very strong element in the African-American
community,'' said Ms. Zollar, who is black. ``It's not something
that we're embarrassed or cynical about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our culture accepts the externalization of the spirit through
speech and the emotions. I think for us it comes from Africa. A
pope once said that one reason he wanted to do so much work there
was that atheism didn't exist in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   But burrow deep enough into the traditions and history of any
religion and it is possible to find a remarkable universality in
the expression of the spirit. And the traditions of the sacred, as
represented in churches and synagogues, and the profane, as
represented in dance studios and on dance stages, have much in
common.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker and her Avodah Dance Ensemble, a New York-based
Jewish liturgical dance company, have worked with Rev. Lloyd Casson
at the St Andrew's and St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in
Wilmington, Del., which has merged black and white congregations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has talked about how important it is for each of us to go
as deep as we can in our own tradition to find, underneath, the
deep river from which we could all draw,'' said Ms. Tucker, who
also teaches at the Hebrew Union College. Like Chandralekha, Ms.
Tucker believes in the conservation of tradition. ``The deeper we
go in to understand how we work with what we have, the more that's
leading us to something very common.''
</P>
<P>
   There are startling similarities between Ms. Sumler's
description of her work and the choreographers' depictions of the
ways dancers open themselves up, as Ms. Zollar puts it, to allow
creative energy to flow through them. ``You come to a place where
you don't even know how you did what they did,'' she said. ``In
sports they call it the Zone, where you're almost not the doer.
When you see it happen, it is a religious experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sumler and her 300-member dance ministry, composed of men,
women and children from 7 to 77, begin services with an
improvisational dance of praise and worship, in which they empty
themselves of ``immediate things and center our thoughts on the
Lord.'' ``People are coming in with issues,'' Ms. Sumler, a former
dancer and currently a professor of dance at Hunter College, said
of the congregants. ``They're losing their home. They've lost their
job. The bill collectors are coming, or someone needs a heart
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand in the gap, as soldiers in the army dancing the fight
for them no matter what their issues are. They should be able to
leave there changed. If not, we're not doing our job. And that
means we have to get out of ourselves so that they don't see us
dancing, they see God in the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McIntyre, in turn, talks of the process of surrender to the
dance, for performers and their audiences, in similarly mystical
terms. ``Some kind of love has taken the mover,'' she said. ``It's
in their movement. It's a deep commitment. They have surrendered to
the dance, and their dance is an offering, to the audience. They
have become that dance, that moment, that gesture. We don't see
their ego. All that is gone. They've let themselves be erased.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of erasure of self is epitomized in Humphrey's ``Two
Ecstatic Themes,'' a 1931 solo in which the dancer becomes her
simple ``circular descent'' and ``pointed ascent.'' But it has not
been easy to find _ or articulate _ in Western dance. And the
possibilities for it have diminished over the centuries in Jewish
and Christian religious tradition, as the mind has taken over the
body in services.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Tucker, the separation from an early Talmudic emphasis
on the earthy, on ``basicness,'' came when Jews lost their land and
went into exile. ``It used to be that you looked out your window
and you saw what time to pray,'' Ms. Tucker said. ``We're so cut
off from all that.'' Ms. Sumler speaks of the replacement of dance
as worship by ``law,'' the churchly precepts of right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, however, it has never been possible to separate
completely the body and the soul in dance or religion. ``From the
15th century to the present, `graceful' has been the single
adjective most used to describe good dancing,'' Ann Wagner writes
in ``Adversaries of Dance: From the Puritans to the Present,'' a
book published last year by the University of Illinois Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the antidance literature, the absence of grace in its
theological and esthetic dimensions, coupled with the presence of
law, is striking. The fruits of the law are fear and retribution.
The law can produce justice but not joy. By contrast, a positive
affirmation of life flows from the concept of grace.'' Dancing, Ms.
Wagner writes, is in its essence celebration: ``It is testimony to
God's creation _ a human being with an infinite capacity for
expression and joy in motion.''

BOY, 9, FACES PROSECUTION IN RAPE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A 9-year-old Boston boy is facing criminal charges
after he allegedly raped a 9-year-old girl in June, authorities
said Tuesday. The boy is the youngest criminal defendant in recent
Suffolk County history.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin 2d Tuesday confirmed
the prosecution and said the boy is the youngest person his office
has charged since he became district attorney in 1992. The Boston
police Sexual Assault unit has investigated cases involving young
children, but the 9-year-old boy is the youngest to face charges,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's attorney said the complaint was unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin said the allegation against the boy raises broad
questions about the negative, societal influences that lead some
children to allegedly commit adult crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not self-learned'' behavior, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of questions that have to be answered,'' about
the case, Martin said. ``We're figuring out how it is going to be
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Boston police spokeswoman Sergeant Margot Hill, the
girl reported the alleged attack to a third person who informed the
girl's mother in late July. The mother telephoned Boston police on
the emergency line that day, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives from the Sexual Assault Unit interviewed the girl
this summer. She was interviewed again on Aug. 20 and Martin's
Child Abuse Unit asked police to obtain criminal complaints in
Boston Juvenile Court, Hill said. A charge of rape against the boy
was issued following the hearing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's Boston attorney, Chester Darling, said Tuesday he
hopes Martin's office will quickly resolve the case without further
damaging the boy and his family, whom he described as a ``family of
hard-working people.'' The boy is with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Darling added, ``I have every confidence that a complete review
of the case by a reasonable person at the office of DA Martin will
result in the withdrawal of this outrageous and essentially
unfounded complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Darling criticized the quality of the Boston police
investigation, calling it an ``atrocity. The investigation in this
case was just the very least they could do in order to generate the
(criminal) complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hill defended the quality of the investigation and dismissed
Darling's criticism of police as a commonplace defense attorney
tactic. ``It was done by the book,'' she said. ``The investigation
will prove its worth in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, children as young as 7 years old can be
criminally prosecuted and committed to the Department of Youth
Services once found delinquent by the courts, according to DYS
spokesman Glenn Daly. Daly said DYS can retain custody, in certain
cases, to the age of 21.
</P>
<P>
   In the current DYS population, courts have committed 356
children who are 13 years old or younger. Daly said DYS now has
custody of five children who are 10 years old; nine children who
are 11 years old; 76 children who are 12 years old and 266 who are
13 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Some are kept in locked facilities while others are living with
their families, although they remain committed to DYS. Still others
are in residential treatment facilities appropriate for their age
group, Daly said. Teenagers and the pre-teens are not mixed by DYS.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 2,608 youths in DYS custody cover the ages from 14
to 18, Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston case, it is possible the boy will not end up being
committed to DYS. Some other form of intervention, such as
counseling, could be ordered, officials said. A pre-trial
conference is set for Boston Juvenile Court in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Krane, a urologist at the Boston University Medical
Center, said Tuesday that men from infancy to old age get erections
and thus it is physically possible for a 9-year-old to commit a
rape.

NIGHTTIME HEART ATTACKS MORE LIKELY TO KILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Beware the Monday nights of winter. A heart attack
could be lurking.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the risks of heart attack increase on Mondays and in
the winter, but a heart attack at night is more likely to kill than
one that occurs during the day, said researchers at the 71st
scientific sessions of the American Heart Association here.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. C. Michael Gibson, director of invasive cardiology at
Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pa., compared 813
patients who went to the emergency department for a heart attack
between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. with 433 who arrived between 6 p.m. and 6
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He found the risk of dying for the evening patients was nearly
twice that of the daytime patients.
</P>
<P>
   The major difference between the two groups was the time delay
between recognition of symptoms and arrival at the hospital.
Evening patients tended to arrive at least 30 minutes later, Gibson
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said treatment for the two groups was the same as was the
type of medications. Patients underwent angioplasty as often at
night as during the day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This underscores the importance of people coming to the
hospital as soon as possible at night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If night is dangerous, so is winter, said Dr. Robert A. Kloner,
director of research at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He analyzed the deaths from heart disease that occurred in Los
Angeles from 1985 until 1996. Most of the 9,328 deaths occurred in
December and January, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers had pinpointed the winter months as more
risky for heart attacks earlier, they had done the work farther
north where the cold weather stressed hearts, Kloner said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles weather is mild, indicating that other factors could
be at work, he said. Conversely, the lowest numbers of deaths
occurred in June, July, August and September, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rates in December and January were 33 percent higher''
than the rates in those hot weather months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stress of holidays appears to be at fault, Kloner said.
Death rates appeared fairly steady until Thanksgiving, when they
started to rise, he said. The increase continued until about a week
after the New Year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He advised avoiding stress, salt and excess alcohol during these
difficult months.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael K. Gruska, a post-graduate student at
Hanuschkrankenhaus in Vienna, Austria, found that heart attacks are
more likely to occur on Monday, even in the retirees among the
1,500 people who suffered heart attacks between January 1995 and
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He said the risk of having a heart attack on Monday is 1.2 to
1.4 times greater than on other days in the week.
</P>
<P>
   For workers, going back to the job could trigger the attacks, he
said. Retirees could suffer attacks because of returning to normal
social activities, he said. &QL;

INDONESIAN PARLIAMENT MEETS TO CHART FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ As opposing groups of demonstrators threw
rocks and wood spears at each other, the Parliament met on Tuesday
for the first time since the ouster of President Suharto to chart a
course toward a more democratic government.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations, along with widespread fears of riots and
mistrust of the parliamentary process, are signs of the difficult
road ahead as Indonesia seeks to recover from the 32-year
autocratic rule of Suharto that ended when he was forced to resign
in May.
</P>
<P>
   The session is being held at a time of economic collapse,
political infighting, almost daily demonstrations and rising crime
and social tensions in the fourth most-populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   The special session, called by President B.J. Habibie, is
expected to schedule a general election for early next year. That
would be followed by an electoral assembly next December to select
a president who would take office in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But a meeting of the leading opposition figures on Tuesday
demanded a faster timetable, and students demonstrators insisted
that Habibie step down immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The main complaint against him is that he was Suharto's chosen
vice president and that he does not represent a clean break from
the past. But in view of the economic and political turmoil that
Suharto left behind, one foreign analyst said, ``even God would be
hated.''
</P>
<P>
   In what might be a holdover from Suharto's secretive system or
might be a sign of the government disarray that is also his legacy,
nobody outside the leadership seems to know exactly what the
parliamentary session will seek to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to setting an electoral timetable, it was widely
expected to address the dominant role of the military in politics
and society and, perhaps, also how to account for the hidden wealth
of Suharto, who lives quietly at his modest house here.
</P>
<P>
   In a broader sense the Parliament faces a most unlikely task,
how to legislate away its own power. The 1,000-member assembly is
almost entirely made up of elected and appointed members who owe
their positions to Suharto and his old order of government.
</P>
<P>
   The levers of power that were created to perpetuate his
autocracy have now been called on to turn against themselves and
institute a more open and democratic system.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to look at it is as an old elite that is trying
desperately to stay in power,'' Daniel S. Lev, an expert on
Indonesia at the University of Washington, said. ``The likelihood
that it will save itself by its own bootstraps is slim.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, beyond a heavy cordon of soldiers, the delegates
could almost hear the shouts of demonstrators who were not prepared
to accept anything less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new groups that are coming up are filled with anger and
resentment, and although they may not have political power, they
have an awful lot of social support,'' Lev said. ``That anger is
one of the healthiest prospects in Indonesia. People will in effect
contain the government by hating it.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement that ousted Suharto has retained much of its
momentum, fueled by discontent over the pressures of an imploding
economy. Unemployment and inflation continue to rise, although the
sliding currency has stabilized in value for the moment and food
distribution and supplies have remained steady in this sprawling
nation of more than 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial target of the reformers is the military, which was the
backbone of Suharto's repressive system and remains the most highly
organized social and political force throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are demanding that the 75 seats in the 500-member
national assembly that are reserved for the military be reduced or
eliminated. Military and parliamentary leaders suggested this week
that the military role would shrink over time, but their statements
were vague.
</P>
<P>
   Along with their demands for quick elections, the opposition
leaders insisted that the military role in the government be phased
out.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition leaders, meeting at a house on the outskirts of
the capital, were a roll-call of the democratic challengers that
the old-line leaders are likely to face in the next elections. They
include Megawati Sukarnoputri, the widely popular daughter of
Suharto's predecessor, Sukarno; Amien Rais, energetic leader of an
aggressive Muslim organization; Abdurrahim Wahid, the highly
respected but ailing leader of a larger and more moderate Muslim
organization; and the sultan of Jogjakarta, a new young face on the
scene who enjoys a small but devoted local following.

<P>
   Employees at Amazon.com, the popular Internet bookseller,
recently received in their e-mail a directive from senior
management that struck some as Orwellian.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an event that the Seattle-based company designated
``Sweep and Keep,'' employees were instructed to purge, among other
things, e-mail messages that were no longer required for business
or not subject to legal records requirements. Free lattes would be
dispensed in the cafeteria to those who complied immediately, the
directive said.
</P>
<P>
   This Amazon ``document retention'' policy, which requires
employees to expunge electronic files regularly, was followed a few
weeks later with guidelines for ``document creation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply put, there are some communications that should
not be expressed in written form,'' the Oct. 20 memo stated.
``Sorry, no lattes this time!''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind monopoly power in the marketplace; the real lesson
corporate America is taking away from the Microsoft antitrust trial
is that old e-mail can be a mine field of legal liability, not to
mention a source of public embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-profile court battle between the Justice Department
and the Microsoft Corp., e-mail has emerged as the star witness _ a
fact that appears to be giving pause to corporate executives
accustomed to clicking ``send'' without a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love e-mail,'' said Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief
executive. ``I think it is changing the world. The problem is
somebody can take it out of context and use it against you, and we
have to guard against that.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, like many companies, had embraced e-mail as the
preferred way to communicate about business matters. Instant,
convenient and at least putatively private, it allows the lowliest
employee to discourse with the most exalted. And it provokes
spontaneous, if not always eloquent, brainstorming among colleagues
who might otherwise keep their thoughts to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Amazon, which to many people symbolizes a progressive
Internet culture, is among the growing ranks of companies that are
imposing new restrictions on e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier policies prohibiting abusive or harassing
electronic messages, the new rules tend to curb types of expression
that have long been deemed acceptable business discourse. And when
such exchanges must take place in writing, the prevailing
philosophy would have them expunged as quickly and ruthlessly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   This backlash underscores a paradox of the information age:
while instantaneous electronic communication often helps increase
productivity and innovation, the privacy of workplace
correspondence and accountability for what is written are growing
concerns for many employers.
</P>
<P>
   Often, e-mail is more a conversation that happens to be written
down than an actual letter, and it is often more revealing than
either. It has thrived largely because of the assumption _ some
would call it the illusion _ that the rapid-fire confessional
exchanges that e-mail seems to encourage will never be divorced
from their context.
</P>
<P>
   But that is often not the case in legal disputes, where e-mail
is increasingly being treated as the ultimate window into the true
thoughts of executives and the inner workings of an enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Microsoft trial's electronic highlights: the company
chairman, Bill Gates, in a sworn deposition, flatly contradicts his
e-mail statements, and an e-mail from James Barksdale, chief
executive of Netscape Communications Corp., to America Online's
chairman, Steve Case, in which he refers to Case as ``Franklin D.''
and himself as ``Joseph Stalin.'' The reference implies a
comparison between the two executives in their war against
Microsoft and the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union
fighting Nazi Germany in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in the Sun Microsystem lawsuit against Microsoft over
the Java programming language, a federal court in San Jose, Calif.,
has seen a great deal of embarrassing e-mail from both companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the very attributes that have made e-mail so
popular _ chief among them its tendency to induce off-the-cuff
candor _ are driving managers to conclude that its use must be
reined in, its tracks dusted over.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, message-retention policies have been primarily
designed for disk space management,'' said Jim Browning, a senior
research analyst at the Gartner Group, a consulting firm. ``The new
question is how quickly should e-mail be deleted to prevent it from
becoming a danger to the organization?''
</P>
<P>
   Browning said that anxious calls from clients had been rising in
tandem with headlines about the Microsoft trial. Earlier this
month, a client called looking for what he characterized as an
``e-mail shredder.'' Another wanted a ``Mission Impossible'' e-mail
product that would self-destruct the message after it was read.
``That option doesn't exist today,'' Browning said.
</P>
<P>
   But such anxiety is not unreasonable. E-mail that someone thinks
has been erased often still exists somewhere, perhaps on the hard
drive of one or more recipients or of someone to whom it was
forwarded. People often do not realize they have set their software
to leave e-mail on the server, the computer that acts as an
electronic post office. And erased files can sometimes be
reconstructed with special software that reassembles discarded data
from the digital ghosts left behind on hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group recommends policies that help employees
understand what a company considers appropriate business language.
</P>
<P>
   For example, said Joyce Graff, Gartner's research director for
the electronic workplace: ``You talk about `fair competition'; you
don't talk about `slaughtering' them. No warfare language. That way
you have fewer messages you have to worry about in the files.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 83 million Americans who now use e-mail in the workplace
know, it is easily and often forwarded, copied and stored in
perpetuity on everything from company backup tapes to personal Palm
Pilots. The fact that people are disinclined to erase old e-mail
has not been lost on lawyers, who routinely request e-mail as part
of the discovery process in civil and criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lipstein, a Washington-based antitrust lawyer, said a
company's e-mail was a treasure trove of evidence ``because that's
when you catch people in their unguarded moments.'' Lipstein, who
specializes in subpoenaing computer records from multinational
corporations, added, ``I've seen e-mail that makes me cringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several executives said they regretted the new
atmosphere of deliberation and delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It slows down communication if everybody is stopping and
thinking about what they write,'' said Tom Jermoluk, chief
executive of At Home, a company that provides Internet access over
cable television lines. ``It's chilling. I don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Jermoluk, whose company was dragged into the
Microsoft antitrust dispute because of an e-mail message a senior
manager had written titled ``Gates on the Warpath,'' said he had
instructed the company's lawyer to write a more restrictive policy
to regulate e-mail and record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting desires to engage in frank, private
communication and to escape public accountability for it are by no
means new. Corporations have for decades trashed acres of files _
albeit with the added incentive that paper takes up a lot of space.
</P>
<P>
   And well before the first subpoena for a document, Socrates
warned that writing ideas down was a bad idea because, among other
things, one could never know who might read them. Plato countered
that a culture that had to commit everything to memory was limited
in its intellectual possibilities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The quandary of archived records, said Neil Postman, a professor
of media studies at New York University, has been around ``ever
since phonetic writing became a critical part of Western culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every important new technology is a Faustian bargain,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, employers are choosing censorship. More than 20
percent of the respondents in the American Management Association's
annual survey this year said that they monitored employee e-mail,
compared with 15 percent who said they did so in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Classes with titles like ``E-Mail 101'' are getting healthy
enrollments. Bloomberg, the financial news service, installed a
system last month that searches e-mail for offending words. If it
finds one, a warning pops up before the e-mail is sent: ``This is
inappropriate language to use in correspondence with any customer,
and a copy of this message will be immediately sent to your
superior.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers at Polk Co., a data resource firm in Southfield, Mich.,
recently discovered that 10 percent of employees had from 5,000 to
10,000 e-mail messages saved on hard drives. A delete-fest is being
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Microsoft trial has done is to say that if people are
using this as an electronic filing system, it could be a dangerous
medium,'' said David Zaccagnini, Polk's vice president for
information technology. ``That's what the Microsoft trial really
means to corporate America.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without formal policies, executives said they were
sanitizing their own e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I self-consciously tone my language down,'' said John Gage,
chief scientist at Sun.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Prusak, executive director of IBM's Institute for
Knowledge Management, is wary of inhibiting the use of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``With e-mail, you get an optimization of a firm's knowledge,''
Prusak said. ``You know Queen Elizabeth I said, `I don't wish to
build windows into men's souls.' That's in a sense what we're
beginning to do, and I find it very threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Iran-Contra investigations in which Col.
Oliver North's e-mail detailed illegal aid to the Nicaraguan
rebels, courts ruled that most government e-mail must be saved as a
public record. That has changed attitudes toward e-mail among
federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an enormous increase in information requests
from Congress, which has a very legitimate oversight function,''
said Sally Katzen, who formerly headed the Clinton administration's
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. ``But the call for
e-mails _ which in many instances are very susceptible to being
incomplete, cryptic and misunderstood _ has led a lot of people to
shun the use of e-mail, and I think that's most unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some critics say that unless e-mail comes to be viewed
through a more appropriate legal lens, companies, governments and
individuals will lose the full benefits of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is perhaps the most contextually sensitive piece of
writing that we have, and culturally we're going through this stage
where we don't understand how to read it,'' said Lawrence Lessig, a
Harvard University law professor. ``The clumsiness that the legal
system has in dealing with this will lead to losing some of its
value unless we learn how to put it into context and properly weigh
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's own personal e-mail became a source of controversy last
year when he was named special master by the judge hearing the
Microsoft antitrust case. Microsoft contended that he was biased,
citing an e-mail message he had sent to a Netscape executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people now who will not send me things in e-mail,''
Lessig said.

 &HT;    World War I veteran part of a vanishing breed
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The macabre vision is 80 years old but remains shockingly alive
in James Lindsey's mind.
</P>
<P>
   On the edge of a bomb crater, a legless German soldier sits
upright in death, staring ahead as if awaiting Lindsey's unit. The
dead man's pack is still strapped to his back, propping him up. In
his pack, the soldier carries a rotten loaf of bread and three
photos: one with three proud mustashioed men in uniform. Another
has one of those men posing with a woman and a small boy. The third
has the woman alone with the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was his wife and baby,'' said Lindsey, a reed-thin,
102-year-old Jonesboro resident who in 1918 was an artillery gunner
with American Expeditionary Forces as the Yanks blasted through a
tough but sagging German Army.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey keeps the photos in a box in his home. They are among
the few mementos he retains of the Great War, save some medals,
discharge papers and a vivid memory. A few years ago, a friend
tried to track down the dead German's name, to no avail. The man
remains anonymous, one of millions who virtually vanished on the
battlefields of World War I, a conflict that ended 80 years ago
today with Germany's surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Originally called Armistice Day, the Nov. 11 holiday was changed
in 1954 to Veterans Day to commemorate all Americans who have
served, although many believe the celebration has faded like the
old soldiers it honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you move further away from a war, people forget their
veterans,'' said Bob Ritter, an Air Force pilot and Vietnam vet who
oversees Atlanta's Veteran's Day parade, the nation's second
largest. The 135-unit parade starts today at 11 a.m. at Peachtree
Street near Pershing Point, traveling south to 11th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey himself is truly a vanishing breed, a relic of a war
that has faded in American memory. Out of 4.7 million Americans who
served in World War I, fewer than 3,000 are still alive, said
Muriel Sue Parkhurst, director of the Veterans of World War I of
USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost the forgotten war and they are the forgotten
veterans,'' said Parkhurst. But those vets don't worry about that,
she said, ``They're more concerned with going to X-rays, or about
meals on wheels or a great-grandchild coming for a visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, too, doesn't dwell much on the past. He eats big (Red
Lobster is a favorite), drives a new Saturn, drinks an occasional
beer or whiskey sour and dates a 83-year-old woman. ``No
hanky-panky,'' says the widower of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, Lindsey was watching TV when the grainy and
jerky images of World War I appeared. He can't believe how ancient
it all now seems.
</P>
<P>
   But his own recollections aren't grainy.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 11, 1918, Lindsey was in the Argonne Forest in Belgium.
``The Argonne was desolate. All the trees were shot up. No leafs.
No branches. Just trenches and mud,'' he said with a far-away
stare. ``I can still see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of the pending armistice were thick and soldiers were
light-hearted, remarkably jovial. But then came word that Americans
were going over the top. ``We heard the machine guns,'' he said.
``Some of those boys were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   And then it was still. ``Eleven o'clock,'' he recalls, breaking
into a smile that shows nearly all his dentures. ``Boy, what a
happy day.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebrating ebbed when hordes of gray, haggard men appeared
on the horizon, pleading for food. The once mighty German army was
now a straggling band of beggars.
</P>
<P>
   Out there, Lindsey saw a bit of his grandfather, the original
James Lindsey, a Confederate sharp-shooter, who also tasted bitter
defeat. ``He told me once he was once so hungry that they ate corn
out of horse manure,'' said Lindsey.
</P>
<P>
   The old veteran then paused to recount his war's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called it the Great War to End All Wars, that was our
slogan. Of course, twenty years later we were back at it'' in War
War II.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there was Korea. And Vietnam. And the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   World War I was a historical maelstrom that tore apart the
Russian, German, Turkish and Austro-Hungarian empires and laid the
groundwork for World War II and the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million died in the war (about 115,000 Americans)
where modern technology outstripped antiquated military tactics and
legions were mowed down in futile frontal charges against machine
guns, obliterated by artillery barrages or were gassed.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, who two years ago toured a local elementary school to
tell his long-ago stories, survived the gas attacks and artillery
barrages so bright ``you could read a newspaper at night.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, with an almost bubbly enthusiasm, he recalls the
aerial battles that broke up the grim monotony of the soldiers
below in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dogfights were something,'' he remembered. ``We'd stop
what we were doing and watch. They'd be shooting and swirling and
diving.''
</P>
<P>
   His hands weave circles, ``We'd cheer when one went down. Now
that was exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Parkhurst said old vets like Lindsey are treasured links to the
past. ``Were a society of fresh faces and don't have time for
them,'' she said. ``One day, they'll be gone, along with their
stories. And we're going to regret it.''

SEIZED BY FAME, AND JARRED BY IT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Can I have your autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   The request, from a New Jersey man awaiting his car at a parking
garage near Times Square, seemed to hit Stephen DeRosa like a slap
in the face. ``Are you crazy?'' screeched DeRosa, who had just
finished another breakneck performance in ``The Mystery of Irma
Vep,'' Charles Ludlam's Gothic romp at the Westside
Theater/Downstairs. ``Surely you must be mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, fame.
</P>
<P>
   After years of temping, working in a video store and living off
the kindness of his mother, DeRosa is unaccustomed to life as an
actor with a recognition factor. He signs the man's Playbill:
``You're silly!,'' and ducks inside his own red Mercury Mystique,
visibly unnerved by the brush with celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after the revival of ``Irma Vep'' opened to gushing
reviews and packed houses, DeRosa is still adjusting ``to life in
the theah-tah,'' he said, with an Olivia De Havilland flourish.
</P>
<P>
   He already has a budding fan club _ well, mostly retired
teachers from his days at P.S. 193 in Whitestone, Queens. And even
though his performance thrusts him into four disguises, strangers
do occasionally recognize him on the street. ``It must be the
nose,'' said DeRosa, a slight, shamelessly self-deprecating
30-year-old with thinning hair and basset-brown eyes who seems to
take great pleasure in talking about psychotherapy, his
mollycoddling mother and ``the dark years'' he spent as an
underemployed actor.
</P>
<P>
   Not that a steady paycheck has affected his style of life. He
still lives at home in Yonkers, dreams of the day he can afford to
move to Manhattan, and carries an unshakable fear of the minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about the job so far is being able to see my
therapist twice a week,'' he said before a recent show, sipping a
decaffeinated espresso at a restaurant on Theater Row and venting
feelings of guilt for having ordered two appetizers, a main course
and dessert.
</P>
<P>
   His frenetic personality is tailor-made for the whirligig of
``Irma Vep,'' a cross-dressing sendup of both highfalutin and cheap
horror films. He alternates as Jane Twisden, a prim, tight-jawed
chambermaid, and Lord Edgar Hillcrest, a stodgy Egyptologist whose
first wife, Irma Vep, has died under mysterious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   He also makes a brief appearance as ``the intruder,'' a
homicidal ghoul who looks like a cross between a werewolf, the
Phantom of the Opera and ``someone with a really bad thyroid
condition,'' as the actor described it.
</P>
<P>
   DeRosa's characters dart in and out after the instant costume
changes that are the play's hallmark. In one scene, he struts
offstage as the tweedy Lord Edgar and is back six seconds later as
Jane, in flannel nightgown and five-foot-long auburn braid. The
secret? ``Velcro, Velcro and more Velcro,'' DeRosa said. ``That is
the real mystery of `Irma Vep.'''
</P>
<P>
   His onstage sparring partner and the director is Everett
Quinton, who played DeRosa's roles 14 years ago when Ludlam first
produced and starred in ``Irma Vep'' in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Ludlam, who died in 1987, was both companion and mentor to
Quinton, and DeRosa said he was ever mindful of the author.
``Sometimes, the legacy of Charles Ludlam can be overwhelming,'' he
said. It is a legacy so weighty that DeRosa said he was still
afraid to watch a videotape of Ludlam's performance.
</P>
<P>
   From the look of the current revival _ and according to those
who have seen both it and the original _ DeRosa and Quinton are
well matched for this tightly choreographed farce that would surely
crumble under the weight of clashing egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles had this incredible generosity that's necessary to
make such an intense play work,'' Quinton said. ``Stephen has that
generous spirit and a real respect for the play. And that's not
just spin.'' About his co-star, DeRosa says simply, ``I feel like
I'm working with Sid Caesar or Milton Berle.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that DeRosa is dead wood. He can provoke laughter with a
flash of Jane's brittle smirk or with lines like ``Here's your
toddy,'' delivered in an accent that he admits he stole from the
English maid on ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times, Peter Marks called DeRosa ``Tim
Conway to Quinton's Harvey Korman'' and described his performance
as ``consistently smashing.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Offstage, DeRosa is a volley of cartoonish voices, one-liners
and goofy facial expressions. ``He's one of the most wildly funny
people I've ever met,'' said the director Mark Lamos, who worked
with the actor in ``Love's Fire,'' a series of one-acts by
well-known American playwrights based on Shakespeare's sonnets.
</P>
<P>
   DeRosa made his acting debut at 12, when he starred as Tevye in
his elementary school production of ``Fiddler on the Roof.'' The
show's producer, Sally Berkowitz (who was also his sixth-grade
teacher and forms the core of his fan club), still insists that
young Stephen was better than Zero Mostel. ``So many people wanted
to come see him, that we had to do the show twice,'' she crowed.
</P>
<P>
   Louisa DeRosa, his mother, couldn't agree more. ``Stephen began
acting right after he was born,'' she said without a hint of
exaggeration. ``At six weeks, he was posing for photos with his
hand on his chin.'' Mrs. DeRosa was often so busy running her
fast-food restaurant in Rockefeller Center that the babysitter for
her only child was often the family television set. ``His first
words were actually from a commercial,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, he spent his free time chatting with customers at his
mother's restaurant or exploring midtown. Mrs. DeRosa called him
the Mayor of 48th Street because he would roam the block and
conduct mock interviews with strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to imagine a fat, annoying 8-year-old with a tape
recorder,'' DeRosa said. ``That was me.''
</P>
<P>
   He describes his parents as theatrical, larger-than-life people,
``the kind of folks who live for today, even if it's a little bit
reckless.'' His father, a storefront lawyer in the Bronx, was a
cigar-smoking, wisecracking man with a penchant for gambling and
martinis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more Joe Pesci than `Father Knows Best,' '' DeRosa said
of the elder DeRosa, who died when his son was 15. ``My mom is sort
of like Auntie Mame,'' he added. ``She's very self-dramatizing and
she believes that vanity is a virtue. For a long time, she was
obsessed with me getting a toupee.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have been acting all his life, but it was only two years
ago that DeRosa actually got paid to perform _ in the Acting
Company's well-received ``Love's Fire.'' DeRosa got himself noticed
in the play by Tony Kushner, the massively titled ``Terminating, or
Lass Meine Schmerzen Nicht Verloren Sein or, Ambivalence,'' in
which he was cast as a neurotic gay man who desperately wants to
sleep with his former therapist, a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read through the script, I thought, `Tony Kushner must
have consulted my therapist,' '' DeRosa said.
</P>
<P>
   In more serious moments, he talks about the frustrating years he
spent looking for acting work or trying to get by as a clerk at
Blockbuster Video. After graduating from the Yale School of Drama
in 1995 _ he applied three times before getting accepted _ he was
unprepared, he said, for the endless rejections from casting
directors. ``I figured I'd come out of Yale and they'd be clamoring
to hire me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he put together a cabaret act at a piano bar in
Greenwich Village and called it ``Wake Up and Smell DeRosa, or How
I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Unemployment.'' The title
turned out to be a cruel joke on its author, who fell into a deep
depression when the show closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it my Dostoyevsky period,'' he said. ``It really made
me question my decision to go into acting, and at that point I
almost quit.''
</P>
<P>
   He credits his mother with persuading him to stick with it.
``She would make me some food and say, `There's always tomorrow.'''

 &HT;    Amway climbs natural gas pyramid
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amway's 25,000 Georgia distributors _ known for
selling everything from cosmetics and skin care products to
dishwashing liquid and dietary supplements _ will try their hand at
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   In a novel arrangement, the consumer products company will
promote natural gas sold by Virginia-based Columbia Energy, which
is trying to capture some of Atlanta Gas Light's 1.4 million
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its deregulation law, Georgia is the first target for
what the two companies said will be a coast-to-coast joint energy
marketing program that will add electricity and other products and
services as state deregulation laws permit.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Dawson, Columbia Energy vice president and general manager
of mass marketing, said that Amway is ``uniquely positioned to link
consumers with the savings they can realize through deregulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Energy is one of 19 companies that have been certified
to sell natural gas in the Georgia market.
</P>
<P>
   John Parker, Amway's director of North American distributor
relations, said the privately held company's part-time Georgia
distributors would tout Columbia Energy when selling other Amway
products to consumers. The consumers will be referred to a
dedicated Amway toll-free telephone number at Columbia Energy,
where they can contract for natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Amway customers will be asked for their distributor's
identification number, which will allow the distributors to earn
$15 commissions per customer, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Additional bonuses and commissions will be paid to Amway
distributors under the company's multilevel marketing plan. Parker
declined to identify the totals. He said Amway will pay commissions
to its distributors and receive payments from Columbia based on how
many customers sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said Amway has similar arrangements with MCI, Avis car
rentals and Voice Tel, a voice mail service. He said Amway
customers would get no deal that Columbia is not offering to the
general public.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Davis, a spokesman for the Public Service Commission, said
the commission would ``monitor the sales tactics'' Amway uses for
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been highly controversial because of its
reliance on multilevel marketing and revival-type meetings to rev
up the sales force. The Federal Trade Commission ruled in 1979 that
Amway's marketing arrangement was not an illegal pyramid scheme but
ordered the company to stop setting retail prices for its
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Amway reports $5.7 billion in annual sales,14,000 employees and
a network of 1.2 million distributors in the United States. It
houses its distribution center for the Southeast in Norcross, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Energy is a subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, which
is also parent of Columbia Gas of Ohio and distributes gas to 7
million customers in15 states and the District of Columbia.

 &HT;    WolfeBy Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tom Wolfe is baffled that some critics are portraying
him as a modern-day Sherman who has burned Atlanta in his sizzling
new novel, ``A Man in Full.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't there to praise Atlanta nor to bury it,'' Wolfe says
in an interview in his suite at the Carlyle Hotel. ``To me, it's an
exciting backdrop for a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Washington Post critic Jonathan Yardley calls ``A
Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $28.95) ``a thermonuclear
explosion'' and writes that Sherman, unlike Wolfe, at least allowed
the residents to evacuate the city before destroying it.
</P>
<P>
   And weeks before the book was published Friday, the Buckhead
Coalition withdrew a luncheon invitation because members were upset
about the way Wolfe portrayed Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that I am completely buffaloed,'' Wolfe says
softly in a voice still tinged with a Virginia accent. ``I can't
imagine what they could have read that gave them that idea.
Besides, I never got the invitation in the first place.'' After
hundreds of inches of pre-publication stories and interviews about
the book, Wolfe begins his publicity tour in earnest this week.
With 1.2 million copies of the novel in print, the publisher has
booked Wolfe with dozens of interviews; a public reading tonight at
New York's Town Hall theater; appearances on David Letterman,
``Good Morning America,'' and ``Today''; a party at the Pierre
Hotel; and an interview Thursday with PBS' Charlie Rose.
</P>
<P>
   And next week, Wolfe heads to Atlanta for a book-signing gala at
Borders Books and Music in Buckhead, a speech at the Atlanta
History Center, a $600-a-plate dinner to benefit the Margaret
Mitchell House, lunch at the Piedmont Driving Club and other
activities.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares to come to the city he is accused of torching,
Wolfe talked about what he learned about Atlanta during his months
of research with the help of his friends, developer Mack Taylor and
his wife, Mary Rose Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was your first impression of the city and how did it
change?
</P>
<P>
   A: My first impression . . . was the skyscrapers. When I started
the book back in 1989, they were still building skyscrapers. It was
like a duel or a tournament of great developers. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The big difference from the beginning was filling in the whole
map of Atlanta and discovering that there are about two-thirds of
Atlanta you don't see. The whole area south of Ponce de Leon is not
even mentioned in the guidebooks. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get beneath the surface of the city and find what
you were looking for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mostly through talking to people. You can only see so much.
Mary and Mack introduced me to a lot of people. I talked to a lot
of them and they introduced me to others. It was very eye-opening
to see south Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was your impression of the politics of race in Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   A: The details were all new to me and fascinating. I don't know
of a comparable situation. Here you've got the city of Atlanta with
no more than 400,000 people, of which probably most are black.
Around it, however, you've got 12 or 14 counties in which people
are moving in droves. There are probably 3 million people living
around the city. Three million people and they're making their
money in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   These people in the counties around Atlanta are mostly white.
You've got some Asians moving into Chamblee and Doraville _
``Chambodia'' _ but mostly those around the city are white and this
led to ``the Atlanta way,'' which is best exemplified by one story
I was told that's in the book. It had to do with a meeting about
running a highway through south Atlanta. This very well-spoken
lawyer speaking for the business interest was trying to overcome
opposition from neighborhoods in south Atlanta, saying, ``We're all
in this together; we have to have a mobile city for traffic and
commerce.'' And this one minister spoke up and said, ``Brother, I
don't mean to interrupt you, but I think we can speed things up a
whole lot here. I'd like to cut straight to the checkered flag.
What it gets down to is, you got the money, we got the power. We
want the money.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   I don't think of Atlanta as a graft-stricken town as New York in
days gone by. What the ``Atlanta way'' means is, you build us the
things we need _ day care centers, parks, recreation halls _ and
we'll see what we can do to help you with some of your business.
</P>
<P>
   The airport is a prime example. I gather that (former Mayor)
Maynard Jackson insisted that 30 percent of contracts go to
black-owned firms, and he later said with considerable pride that
the airport created 25 black millionaires. This relationship
between the black power structure and predominantly white business
structure is one of the things I found most interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several critics have not been pleased with the novel's
ending, where your character Conrad Hensley introduces Charlie
Croker to the Greek philosopher Epictetus and Stoicism. Were you
satisfied with it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Speaking only for myself, I was rather pleased with it. I did
try to tenderize Charlie Croker for a religious message by bringing
him down so low that he was going to hang on to anything. The poor
guy was about to lose everything, he's totally humiliated in front
of all the people he cares about in Atlanta, when suddenly this boy
materializes who offers him the hope and the way. Now, I thought it
was beautiful, but it either works or it doesn't. I thought the
lovely thing about Stoicism is that it is so totally different from
people's approach to life in this country today. This Stoicism is
very stern stuff. Once I put my character Conrad in jail, I
suddenly thought of a book that was written, I think, by a pilot
named Robinson Reasoner, who had been in jail in Hanoi for seven
years. And he wrote in this book that if he had not had a course in
philosophy at the Naval Academy, he could never have survived. He
remembered about 10 minutes from one class on Epictetus, in which
the philosopher said they can't make you admit to anything that is
not true. You're free as long as you have reason.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What most impressed you about the plantation life you
describe in the book?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was the most conspicuous form of consumption I had ever
seen in my life. I thought the ultimate was in New York. In the
plantation belt of South Georgia, you've got plantations of 15,000,
25,000 acres or more devoted solely to shooting quail for 13 weeks
out of the year. I think at tax time there may be some mention of a
farming enterprise. It's mostly shooting quail at enormous expense.
I was at a quail plantation one evening at dinner and the host says
exactly what Charlie Croker says in the book. He said, ``How's your
quail?'' and I said, ``Delicious,'' and he said, ``They ought to
be. Each bird cost $5,792.'' He'd just divided the number of birds
shot during the year into the cost of the place, and it was
exorbitant.
</P>
<P>
   I was particularly intrigued by the fact that it was not enough
just to have the money, to own the plantation. You also had to be
man enough to keep it. You had to be willing to deal with animals
and men with your own hands, or with shotguns, if necessary. If you
couldn't, you didn't deserve a plantation. You couldn't be some
tenderfoot who comes out with a shotgun at the appointed hour. You
had to be a man.
</P>
<P>
   It's very, very Southern. A lot of the book has to do with
manhood and what it means to be a man.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Obviously this is a testosterone-laden novel. How do women
figure into the story?
</P>
<P>
   A: On the quail-shooting plantations, the women are there to
approve of this very masculine world, and they should at least
support the premise of man's role as a hunter and a gatherer.
</P>
<P>
   At one point I thought of taking hunting lessons just so I could
take my son hunting. It's well worth maintaining the Southern code
of manhood. It's not something ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you shoot while you were there?
</P>
<P>
   A: No I was on the buckboard. . . . I was a tenderfoot. If I had
been out there in the field, a lot of people likely would have been
in danger. I was offered the opportunity, and I think everyone was
relieved when I declined.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In The Wall Street Journal, there was a lot of buzzing in
town about who is exactly in this book. Obviously you did not pick
one developer for your main character, but which people did you
meet that left a great impression on you?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lot of the developers did. John Portman is an extraordinary
figure, as both a developer and major architect. Tom Cousins,
Charlie Ackerman . . . The developers have really been stars in a
way that you don't see in many other places. In New York, you
mention Donald Trump, but after that, name another name.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When the out-of-town media came to town for the Olympics,
almost everyone said Atlanta had no soul, no defining identity. Do
you agree?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think what the New Yorkers were probably saying was that
you couldn't duck out of your hotel downtown and find marvelous
boutiques and so on. Atlanta is nothing like New York in that
respect. All of the boutiques are in malls like Lenox Square and
Phipps. It's not dominated by one area the way Charleston or
Savannah is. But Atlanta is in some ways the city of the future.
I'm not the first one to say this. There's a wonderful book called
``Edge City,'' in which the author points out how Buckhead became
an edge city and how the minions of commerce have relocated to
Perimeter Center and beyond. That's really the future of America's
cities. I think Atlanta manages to maintain a Southern politeness.
</P>
<P>
   All of these things made me realize Atlanta was the place to
write about in this story. It's exciting.Q: You weren't too kind to
the High Museum crowd in the book with your scene about the
homoerotic art exhibit, were you?
</P>
<P>
   A: At first I had this book situated in New York. Charlie Croker
was an Atlanta developer who wanted to come to New York and become
a national figure. Then I realized that was unlikely, because a
developer would be a bigger figure in Atlanta than he would be in
New York. Anyway, . . . there was going to be this opening at the
Whitney Museum, but I was bored with it. I had done the New York
party scene before.
</P>
<P>
   But when I finally moved it to Atlanta, with an exhibit of
homoerotic art, my belief was that this would be a bit of an issue
in Atlanta and among the board members of the High Museum. I also
posited the notion that since this had already been pronounced an
important discovery, these homoerotic paintings by a dead artist,
if they didn't show them, then some museum in New York would show
them and they would look like they were in Dogpatch. My assumption
was they would have to hold their noses and have the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: No one would criticize it because it would make them appear
unsophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   A: Right. That's the great modern sin: to be considered
unsophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you a little nervous about speaking at the Piedmont
Driving Club after your depiction of the Freaknik incident in the
novel?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was actually told by a member of the club about the
essentials of the Freaknik scene when the Driving Club was
surrounded. I have some pictures from a recent Freaknik, and I
think my description is pretty tame.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Time magazine speculated on who might be in the movie. Is
there a film deal yet?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. A couple of producers have looked at it and they can't
figure out a way to make it in the confines of two to three hours.
And after what happened to my last book and film, I'm not exactly
biting my fingernails over this. If it happens, I think it would
have to be five or six hours long. Maybe HBO would do it. I
couldn't stand to see it with commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any idea about who you would like to see cast in the roles?
</P>
<P>
   A: I cannot think of anyone to be Charlie Croker. Broderick
Crawford would have been a good one. But he's not available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Tommy Lee Jones has the testosterone and the Southern accent.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's a thought. Maybe you can do better than I can.
</P>
<P>
   Q: More than a decade ago you took American novelists to task
for not writing big, sweeping novels in the style of Dickens or
Zola. Has that situation changed?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I see it more profoundly than ever before. A man has just
written a novel called ``Thumbsucker'' about someone who sucks his
thumb for the first 21 years of his life. Somehow, ``thumbsucking''
sums up most of American fiction today. . . . This is an amazing,
bizarre, baroque country that nobody is looking into. There should
be 20 or 30 novels about a city as rich in material in Atlanta by
now. That's true for Dallas and Chicago and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your next book?
</P>
<P>
   A: I want to do a novel about education. I know that sounds
dull, but I think it's anything but dull. I think it can be
fabulous.

ELECTION RESULTS WEREN'T AS BAD AS THE REPUBLICAN REACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The frenzy of hand-wringing and upheaval in the
Republican Party has obscured an important and unmistakable
reality: While the party suffered a defeat in last Tuesday's
election, it was not as devastating as Republicans make it seem.
</P>
<P>
   Their reaction, more than the results, has made the election
seem like a rout.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans forced out Speaker Newt Gingrich, and many of his
lieutenants may soon find themselves relegated to the back benches.
They are plotting to oust the party chairman, Jim Nicholson, as
well as the heads of the Senate and House campaign committees. And
Republicans of all ideological stripes are describing the outcome
as ``a wake-up call'' that should send the party in a new
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious reason for the intense reaction is that
Republicans are deeply disappointed. President Clinton's scandal _
and the history of a president's party almost always forfeiting
seats in a midterm election _ led Republicans to propel themselves
into expectational overdrive. They had publicly declared their hope
that the party would pick up enough Senate seats for the 60 votes
needed to block a Democratic filibuster. And party leaders had
forecast pick-ups of as many as 30 House seats.
</P>
<P>
   The recriminations are also being fueled by the factions and
interest groups of the Republican Party, who seized on the results
to press their own agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition,
Tuesday attributed the outcome to the failure of Republicans to
reach out to religious conservatives on matters like abortion.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mark Miller, executive director of the
Republican Leadership Conference, a moderate group, said
Republicans appeared to be too harsh and too preoccupied with a
social agenda like curbing late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996,
faulted the party for neglecting minority voters throughout the
midterm campaign, saying that Republicans should ``help all people
get a shot at the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans said their big failure was concentrating too
much on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make it a referendum on a president with a 67 percent
approval rating, as they tried to do, you shouldn't be surprised if
the election goes against you,'' said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge,
a moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the billionaire publisher who is courting
religious conservatives in his quest for the presidential
nomination in 2000, said Republicans should have been more
aggressive, not less, in capitalizing on the White House scandal.
Party leaders, he said, ``should have declared without hesitation
that the president lied under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   One after another, Republican governors accused Republicans in
Congress of not sufficiently following their leadership on matters
like education and taxes. Environmental groups proclaimed that the
results showed that Republicans should not be contemptuous of
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any good interest group representative will make a compelling
case that the election results demonstrate the wisdom of their own
agenda,'' said Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster in
Atlanta. ``They are claiming verification for their preconceived
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cries of alarm do not match reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news for Democrats is this is an election where we
should have put them away,'' said John Morgan, a Republican
consultant and demographer. ``The bad news for the Democrats is
they're still the minority party.''
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans lost the California governorship, they
defeated Democrats in gubernatorial contests in the seven other
most-populous states, most of them in landslides. While Republicans
lost a net of five seats in the House, they still control the
chamber for the third consecutive election, a feat they have not
performed since 1930. While Republicans did not build on their
margin in the Senate, they still dominate the Senate with 55 seats,
and they still claim the highest number of Republicans elected to
the Senate since 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the popular vote, Republicans are still the majority
party, an analysis by Morgan shows: Roughly half a million more
people voted for Republicans for House seats than for Democrats. In
races for governor, 4.5 million more people voted for Republicans
than for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It solidified the status quo,'' said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy
Thompson, a Republican who was re-elected in a landslide. ``If
there was a really big backlash, Republicans would have lost
control of the House.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some races were so close that one overlooked fact is that
Gingrich's chief tormentor in Congress, Rep. David E. Bonior of
Michigan, the second-ranking Democrat, was re-elected by a
disquieting margin of less than 15,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chairman of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, tried to defend the failure of his
committee to capture seats by reciting statistics about how few
Senate Democrats had been defeated since 1980. ``We've clearly had
a tough time knocking their incumbents out for quite a while,'' he
said in a speech here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans are not interested in excuses or
rationales. They wanted big wins. And now they want heads to roll.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, McConnell said he had finally learned an old rule
of politics: Never, ever, raise expectations before an election.
</P>
<P>
   His prediction for the Senate outcome in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game will be to hold the Senate,'' McConnell
said as he cautiously tried his spin for the next campaign. ``Let's
keep our ambitions here in touch with reality.''

 &HT;    Abortion site web master claims anthrax threat madeBy Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Neal Horsley, the Carrollton, Ga. web master of an
Internet site criticized for targeting abortion providers, received
a letter claiming to contain deadly anthrax, he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley, whose web site is being investigated by the U.S.
Justice Department in connection with the Oct. 24 shooting death of
a Buffalo doctor who performed abortions, said he opened the letter
at the post office and immediately turned it over to the Carrollton
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agents believe the letter was a hoax, but it has
been sent to a federal laboratory for analysis, which will
determined of it contained the lethal bacterial agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I grasped what it was saying, I immediately folded
it back up and put in back in the envelope,'' Horsley said Tuesday.
``I had no reason to suspect there was something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Horsley, a 54-year-old computer consultant, said the letter was
in a business envelope with a clear window listing his address. The
post mark was from Forth Worth, Texas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The message was printed and centered, with the first line
reading, ``You have been exposed to anthrax.'' A second line, also
centered, listed a strain number, which Horsley could not remember.
The third line ``just berated me.'' But by that time, the father of
three said he was so shaken, he returned the letter to the envelope
without reading it in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Similar letters were received by two Catholic parishes in
Indianapolis and Cheektowaga, N.Y., as well as the Chicago office
of the Pro-Life Action League. The letters to Indianapolis and
Chicago also had Texas postmarks. The letter to the New York church
was from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   After Horsley brought the letter to the police department,
officers triple-wrapped it and placed it in an evidence can before
calling the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to Capt.
Brad Robinson. ``We didn't actually look at the letter,'' he said.
``But we did handle it appropriately in case it was dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI did not return phone calls for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley went through a hazardous material washdown at Tanner
Medical Center in Carrollton as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought out the rubber suits and the breathers,'' Horsley
said. Tim Padgett, the Carroll County Emergency Management Agency
director, confirmed the West Georgia Regional Hazardous Material
Team was called out to decontaminate Horsley. Horsley was expected
to be fingerprinted by the FBI in order for agents to determine
which prints on the letter are his and which ones aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is an infectious bacterium used in biological warfare.
When inhaled, it can cause respiratory death within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley, a 1985 graduate of Westminster Theological Seminary
near Philadelphia, was thrust into the national spotlight after he
crossed Dr. Barnett Slepian's name off a list of 225 doctors on his
web site, after Slepian was shot to death in his Buffalo home.
Horsley's site, ``The Nuremberg Files: Visualize Abortionists on
Trial,'' features images of fetus body parts and includes a list of
doctors that perform abortions - bordered by dripping blood. Some
doctors' names are accompanied by personal information, such as
photos, home addresses, names of children and wives. When a doctor
is killed, the name is crossed off. When wounded, the name is
grayed.
</P>
<P>
   Four Georgia doctors are included on the list. None would
publicly comment on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood, mentioned the
site in a national press conference one day after Slepian's death,
accusing Horsley's web site of inciting violence.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley denied Feldt's claims and said Planned Parenthood has
slandered him and endangered his life and his family's.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really knew I existed until she did this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from Planned Parenthood, the organization
disagreed that he was virtually unknown before the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violent, anti-choice extremists have known about his site for
quite some time,'' according to the statement. ``We wanted to make
sure the rest of the country knew what was going on. His web site
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the the shooting death of Slepian, Horsley said the site
has had more than 2 million hits. Two days after the Planned
Parenthood press conference, he said he recorded 400,000 hits.
Internet specialists said there is no way to verify or contest
Horsley's claims.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley said he started the web site about three years ago after
he could not find a publisher for his books. Formerly a Southern
Baptist, Horsley said he was essentially ``excommunicated'' from
two churches after heavily pushing an anti-abortion agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet allowed him the freedom of speech he craved.
His web site, with 15 different categories, contains everything
from doctors' lists to where to get anti-abortion posters and
literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been made to sound like I'm nonchalant about the
death of this doctor. But that's not it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the problem was, was this doctor was killing human
beings. And even though he's been given permission by our
government, I contend no one can take the life of another without
risking their own.''
</P>
<P>
   But Horsley said he plays no part in the violence against
abortion providers. He says he is a reporter who is merely
soliciting and providing information. Critics argue Horsley's web
site is designed to foster violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not come right out and say, `Go out and kill these
people,' but with the blood dripping around the list, I think it's
certainly implied,'' said Sharon Lau, a National Abortion
Federation spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department Monday named a task force to examine
violence against health care providers. The panel will also look at
web sites -- with Horsley's being at the top of the list. But
Associate Attorney General Raymond C. Fisher said it was unclear
whether there could be ``a specific remedy for it.''
</P>
<P>
   And several free speech organizations maintain, the web site
should not inspire a clarion call for Internet censorship. The
American Civil Liberties Union says it is naturally concerned about
the first amendment issues. However, ACLU spokeswoman Emily
Whitfield says the organization's focus right now is Slepian's
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first amendment issues are complicated,'' she says, ``but
what is very important to us is that a man has been killed in cold
blood. When civil rights leaders in the1960s were gunned down, they
weren't talking about hate speech they were talking about murder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The site is chilling,'' says Barry Steinhardt of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation, (http://www.eff.org), staunch and
vocal advocates of free speech on the Net. ``But it doesn't
advocate violence, it doesn't advocate the providers who are listed
be harmed. In fact it actually provides very little information
about the providers besides their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I find it disturbing and chilling. I don't know how you
would write a law that prohibits a Website from publishing the
names of abortion providers that also prohibits the pro-choice
Websites from publishing lists of providers that gives referrals
and information.''

 &HT;    TV and the Web declare victory
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's election night at CNN Interactive. This is
serious business and all hands are on deck. Spread out over three
floors of Atlanta's CNN Center, the online team includes editors,
producers, programmers and extra staffers flown in from Washington,
D.C., to augment CNN's Atlanta staff. Workstations have been moved
down to the election newsroom/command center where the election
news pages will be designed and posted to the Web site at
http://www.cnn.com.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN team has been ready to roll since 2:30 in the afternoon,
with a Web site designed to mirror the TV coverage as closely as
possible. As the night unfolded, behind the scenes action
intensified moment by moment. Here's a two-hour slice of that
night.
</P>
<P>
   _ 6 p.m.: Polls have closed in Kentucky and Indiana and that's
the green light for the intensive election coverage to begin. The
interactive team swings into action. The interactive newsroom is
wired into the cable network's control room so online
editor-in-chief Scott Woelfel and his staff can hear the network's
election calls when their TV counterparts do. What this means for
the Web site is they'll be posting election results in tandem with
the network. The disembodied voice of CNN political director Tom
Hannon is filtered over loudspeakers to the Web team. During the
evening, he'd announce which races are about to be called on air
and the Web site team responded by posting a ``news alert'' at the
top of the site.
</P>
<P>
   _ 6:15 p.m.: CNN spokesman Kerrin Roberts says the 24 writers
and six technical support people working in the CNN.com newsroom is
a considerable increase from normal news days. There are also 10
staffers operating the ``Web farm'' that monitors traffic to the
site, and tracks the online ads and stress on the servers. Nearly
everyone at CNN.com has been called in for the election coverage
except eight people who remain upstairs covering non-election news,
including Hurricane Mitch and John Glenn's space mission.
</P>
<P>
   _ 6:30 p.m.: CNN.com's editor-in-chief Scott Woelfel sits in the
center of the newsroom directing the action. ``This is one of the
best uses of the Net for real-time news,'' he says. ``You can drill
down in the site and find as much information as you want while the
TV carries you forward through the evening. It's a nice
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Election director Carin Dessauer is a few seats away talking on
the phone and operating a computer terminal. Piles of Papa John's
pizza boxes, soda, and leftover Halloween candy clutter a table
under a bank of monitors of CNN's various networks. A huge easel is
set up where election results are recorded by hand as they are
announced.
</P>
<P>
   _ 7:05 p.m.: Polls have closed in most of the Eastern time zone
and returns are expected to start rolling in fast and furious.
``Our job right now is to make sure the pages are light and we have
adequate bandwidth,'' says technical product manager Dennis Backus,
who agrees with Woelfel that TV and the Web make an idea
combination for election night news and information. ``People want
info and they want it now. Our job is to figure out how to keep
them interested beyond the headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Over in a corner of the room where the live video is fed to the
Web, someone suggests the real story of the evening is all the male
staffers are wearing ties.
</P>
<P>
   _ 7:15 p.m.: Things are beginning to get busy. Several people
are talking on cell phones, checking their pagers and huddling over
computers. Programmers upstairs monitor server capacity to make
sure every user who tries to access the CNN site is able to. ``This
is so much more relaxed than in '96,'' says technical product
manager Rob Leary, despite the frenzy going on around him. ``We're
still tweaking stuff,'' he says, ``but that's so much better than
pages not showing up at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want users to be able to get to the information they want
in no more than three clicks,'' he says. ``We also want a simple
and familiar design that we can break down into separate pages if
the traffic gets too heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 7:30 p.m.: Several executives are crowded around one computer
screen checking out competing election coverage on MSNBC and
ABCNews.com. While people are amused by ABCNews.com's gaffe, which
sent dummy election results out over the Web on Monday night, the
network is careful not to be too smug. ``There but for the grace of
God, it could have been us,'' someone says and suddenly
ABCNews.com's misfire isn't quite as amusing.
</P>
<P>
   _ 7:45 p.m.: Soon it becomes clear many races across the
country, including the Georgia gubernatorial race, are too close to
call. ``Should we make a 'too close to call' area?'' someone shouts
to no one in particular. It's deemed to be an excellent idea and a
list of states with tight races is compiled and posted.
</P>
<P>
   After a time, someone notices Georgia is missing from the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just too bad, isn't it. It's going to have to wait,''
says a harried producer, working two terminals at once. However,
others insist it can't wait and someone is dispatched to add
Georgia to the 'too close to call' list, and add it as quickly as
possible. Vice president and general manager Mark Bernstein says
the things CNN does on the fly are what make the Web site really
work. ``We have a passion for news, and it shows in the things we
can do on the fly.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 7:46: A call for a ``winner card'' comes over the speakers for
South Carolina Sen. Ernest Hollings. CNN.com posts a news alert
projecting Hollings winning the Senate race. While the cable
network is in a commercial break, CNN.com posts a news alert on the
Web site, edging out the network by a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ 8 p.m.: Staffers in the CNN ``Web farm'' monitoring traffic to
the site estimate CNN.com is getting viewed at the rate of
12,000-13,000 pages per minute. While traffic is steady, the
biggest surge is expected in the morning when users are trying to
access election results as well as other information.
</P>
<P>
   _ Election producer Dessauer says her main concern throughout
the evening was to make sure the lines of communication between the
Web site and the cable network were open. ``Given we were the two
CNN networks doing live election coverage, we wanted to be sure we
were organizing our coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never know what's going to happen in terms of the
whole election story,'' says Dessauer, a veteran political reporter
with 13 years experience. ``For an election night, editorially, you
can't predict every story _ each time there is a new story we know
there are more people coming to the site and making sure we can
provide the data in real time and that went like clockwork.''

 &HT;    Cox Communications making digital strides
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The numbers aren't big but Cox Communications is
starting to show some impressive jumps in the numbers of customers
signing up for its new digital services during the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   In total, the company now has about 110,000 customers using
either its new high-speed access to the Internet, digital
television or digital telephone services. That number represents a
tiny portion of the company's 3.8 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it's a sizeable increase from the 7,000 a year ago
who signed up for the company's initial digital service, high-speed
access to the Internet through Cox(at)Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider this a terrific accomplishment,'' said Jimmy
Hayes, Cox Communications' chief financial officer. ``There's a
clear appetite for these services. We're seeing penetration rates
higher than initially thought.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the number of customers ordering Cox
Communications' digital telephone service jumped more than 100
percent between June and September to 18,200, according to the
company's latest figures.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications now offers telephone service in five of its
10 markets and this business generated $8.7 million in revenue from
both commercial and residential customers in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are impressive early numbers,'' says Bruce Leichtman, a
media analyst at industry consultant the Yankee Group. But
Leichtman, added, it was important to remember the number of
digital customers remain small compared to overall subscribers _ at
least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Digital services are the key to Cox Communications' growth
strategy. The company is trying to reposition itself as a provider
of all kinds of telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Cox Communications has spent hundreds of millions
of dollars during the past several years rebuilding its cable
systems to handle digital traffic. Such capacity is necessary if
the company's networks are to carry everything from telephone calls
to e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Now that rebuild is almost completed and the company is slowly
but surely marketing new digital services to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox is probably tops in the industry for using all the weapons
in cable TV's arsenal of new digital services,'' says Leichtman.
``The company is doing more with their cable plant than any other
operator.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications' biggest seller so far is digital television,
which offers both sharper pictures and many more channels. As of
Sept. 30, the company had 54,609 customers ordering digital
television. That represents a 70 percent increase from June.
</P>
<P>
   For high speed Internet access through cable modems, Cox
Communications had 46,777 customers as of Sept. 30, up 37 percent
from June. This service, sold under the Cox(at)Home brand name,
generated $5.1 million in revenue during the third quarter. It's
now offered in eight markets.

 &HT;    Indian-American session first of its kind in region
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Indians have cut a wide swath in high-tech
entrepreneurial. This week in Atlanta, that business know-how will
try to capture the imagination and money of potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast's first workshop designed to introduce the
nation's venture capitalists to Atlanta's Indian-American high-tech
community, Entrepreneurs' Workshop '98, starts Friday and runs
through Saturday, at the Swissotel in Buckhead near Lenox Square
mall. Similar events have been held in California and
Massachusetts, but this is the first in Atlanta, and in the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of three of the five most successful Indian-founded
companies in the U.S. are scheduled to speak, including Ashutosh
Roy, co-founder of WhoWhere?, an Internet directory bought in
August by Lycos for $133 million in stock; Shrikanth Chari,
co-founder of CyberMedia, which was bought in July by Network
Associates for $133 million; Yogesh Sharma, editor of SiliconIndia
magazine; Sunil Wadhwani, co-founder of Mastech; and Ajay Shah,
co-founder of SMART Modular Technologies, a California-based maker
of computer memory products. Mike McQuary, president of Atlanta's
MindSpring, the Southeast's largest ISP, also will speak.
</P>
<P>
   Indian-Americans and start-up money are not strangers.
Synchrologic, a company that recently moved from the Georgia Tech
Advanced Technology Development Center to Alpharetta, was founded
by Sanjoy Malik in 1995. Manhattan Associates, an Atlanta company
that makes software for distribution centers, was co-founded by
Deepal Raghavan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like that cultural group has some knack for
entrepreneurship,'' said Alan Taetle, of Noro-Moseley Partners, an
Atlanta venture capital firm and co-sponsor of the workshop.
</P>
<P>
   Ravi Kalakota, head of Georgia State University's Center for
Digital Commerce, attributes the success of Indians in America to
the Immigration and Naturalization Services' involuntary and
thorough screening process.
</P>
<P>
   Kalakota said there were two waves of recent Indian immigration.
Those who made up the first wave, in the 1970s and 1980s, were
highly educated and came out of Indian universities, as did
Kalakota in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult to come in those days,'' he said.
``Getting a visa was very difficult back then; you had to have
financial aid at a top American university just to get one. The
process weeded out a lot, so the people who came up to 1990-1991
were really the best people India produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalakota also attributes the success of Indians in America to
the Indian education system. He said the typical math taught in
American universities is what is taught in Indian high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Math and science are emphasized. That sort of raises that
threshold quite well and it makes a big difference,'' he said.
``But it's only math and science. We have none of the social
skills, so it evens out in the long run.''

 &HT;    Inventor thinks up way to wake up and call someoneBy Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Patrick Herold believes his invention is going to make
the world a more pleasant place to wake up, ``one morning at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Herold, an Atlanta businessman, was recently issued U.S. patent
No. 5832067 for a ``method and apparatus for integrating telephone
signals with an alarm clock.'' He calls it a ``new clock radio.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more than a clock radio, however. It's a telecommunication
device that delivers predetermined messages in the morning when you
awake _ more pleasant messages than commercial radio broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like any other clock radio, except it has both a
phone line and power line,'' said Herold, who operates a billing
and collection service for telecommunications and Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hook it up, then call an 800 number and arrange with the
provider what you want to hear when you awake,'' he said. ``It
could be your favorite song, an inspirational message, a reminder
of your mother's birthday, whatever.'' The service could also
operate via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, when homes become more automated, Herold envisions
that the system could be used to trigger other electronic or
computerized devices that would permit people to wake up not only
to desired messages, but to pleasant surroundings of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, you could arrange to be awakened by classical
music and, if it's sunny outside, your blinds could be opened
electronically,'' he said. ``If it's raining, the coffee pot could
be switched on, along with a slow turning on of dim lights.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman struggling to change a flat tire on her car alongside
the expressway sparked an idea for Ricky Vann. ``Gee whiz,'' he
thought, ``wouldn't it be nice if she could just push a button to
lift the car?''
</P>
<P>
   The thought _ and Vann's subsequent efforts to make it reality _
recently led to Vann being issued U.S. patent No. 5813661.
</P>
<P>
   The patent protects an ``electromagnetic jack system'' for
lifting portions or all of a vehicle. ``It could be installed on
new vehicles when they are built, and added to older vehicles,''
said Vann, a Loganville resident.
</P>
<P>
   The system consists of four electromagnetically operated jacks
attached to the bottom of the vehicle at each corner, and a
dashboard-mounted console to control current flow to the
electromagnets.The jacks can be used individually to life one tire,
or all together to lift the entire vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Vann said each jack consists of two electromagnets placed within
a shaft with a flat base that lowers to the ground when needed.
When activated from the control panel, the two electromagnets are
charged with like polarity, which _ as science students will know _
causes a repelling effect that pushes the two electromagnets apart.
This provides the lift to jack up the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   When the tire is replaced, the control panel changes the current
flow to cause unlike polarity between the two electromagnets.
Unlike polarity attracts, which permits the two electromagnets to
come together, retracting the jack and lowering the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a push-button world in many ways,'' said Vann. ``Why
not this?''

DRUG TO PREVENT BLINDNESS TO BE PROVIDED TO VULNERABLE COUNTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide can be
effectively treated by a single dose of an antibiotic once a year,
health workers said Tuesday, and they announced a major push to
distribute the drug in five countries.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, trachoma, is caused by strains of the chlamydia
bacterium. An estimated 6 million people worldwide have been
blinded by trachoma, which is outranked only by cataracts as a
cause of blindness.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization set up a new strategy earlier this
year in an effort to eliminate trachoma as a major cause of
blindness by the year 2020. Tuesday, officials of Pfizer Inc.,
which sells a long-acting antibiotic against the disease, and the
Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, a leading charity organization in
New York, announced that they were starting a $66 million program
to help carry out WHO's strategy in Ghana, Mali, Morocco, Tanzania
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Women are two to three times more likely to be blinded by the
disease than men, presumably because women have more contact with
children. As with many other diseases, children are the prime
source of spreading the trachoma bacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis.
</P>
<P>
   The infection produces a sticky discharge from the eyes and a
runny nose. One attack provides little protection against another
one. Repeated infections over a number of years can scar the inner
eyelids, which turn inward, causing eyelashes to rub against the
cornea. The damage leads to blindness.
</P>
<P>
   The discharge provides an easy route of bacterial spread from
person to person, particularly in families with young children. In
areas of poverty and poor sanitation, flies are attracted to the
sticky discharge, and epidemiologic studies strongly suggest that
flies can also spread the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the World Health Organization developed a
broad new strategy to eliminate blinding trachoma. The strategy
calls for developing clean water supplies to encourage improved
personal hygiene. It also calls for minor eye surgery which, when
needed, can be carried out in villages with rudimentary health
facilities. Another feature is once-a-year administration of the
long-acting antibiotic, azithromycin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Dr. Robin L. Bailey and colleagues at the London School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine noticed a report in the journal
Lancet of a study indicating that a single dose of azithromycin
cured 78 percent of trachoma infections. Since then, the findings
have been verified elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Azithromycin administered in communities under supervision
proved as effective as application of an eye ointment containing
another antibiotic, tetracycline. There is poor compliance with the
recommended course because the ointment is uncomfortable,
particularly for children, and must be applied twice a day for six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer officials said that azithromycin, called Zithromax, is
its leading antibiotic, accounting for $1 billion in sales a year.
Pfizer said it would would donate enough Azithromax to treat 3
million people over the next two years at a cost of about $60
million. The Clark foundation will pay an additional $6.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Cook, an official of the Clark Foundation and an
expert in tropical diseases, said one measure of success would be
if the program reduced the prevalence of trachoma infections by 50
percent to 75 percent in children 5 years and younger within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, trachoma infects more than 150 million people. The
disease is most common in Africa, the Middle East and parts of
Asia. In some areas, more than 50 percent of children are infected.
An additional 540 million, or 10 percent of the world's population,
live in areas where they are at risk for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Trachoma was once a scourge in the United States and Europe. A
century ago, immigrants arriving at Ellis Island were examined by
doctors who would routinely snap back the eyelids over a button
hook to screen for trachoma. Detection of the disease meant certain
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, trachoma has been eliminated as a major public
health problem in most Western countries through good sanitation,
largely without antibiotics. However, antibiotics have been useful
in speeding elimination of blinding trachoma in areas where it is
highly prevalent. Cases still occur sporadically on some Indian
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization, a U.N. subagency, has said that
``recent community trials using azithromycin as a single dose
against trachoma have demonstrated a very good therapeutic effect
for 6 to 12 months in reducing inflammatory disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva-based health organization recommended community-based
distribution of the antibiotic in villages where more than 20
percent of children aged 1 to 10 years are infected. For
communities with less than a 20 percent childhood infection rates,
WHO called for treatment on a house-by-house basis.
</P>
<P>
   WHO said that further research is needed to determine if
azithromycin needs to be repeated after one year and how often.
</P>
<P>
   Eradication of trachoma infection is not thought possible
because the bacterium is ubiquitous, Cook said.

2000 PRESIDENTIAL RACE LOOMS OVER SOCIAL SECURITY DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eager to show voters that Washington is not
completely mired in partisanship, leaders of both parties have been
proclaiming their enthusiasm in the aftermath of the elections to
tackle the big issues, Social Security foremost among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all, now we must address the challenge to save Social
Security for the 21st century,'' President Clinton said. Rep. Bob
Livingston of Louisiana, who will succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker,
said much the same thing in setting out his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that it were so easy.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a year of debate over the best way to insure that
Social Security can handle the impending retirement of the vast
baby boom generation, there are no signs of emerging consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is further complicated by political factors, from
the turmoil within the Republican leadership to the presidential
aspirations of some of the main players.
</P>
<P>
   And hanging over the process is the stomach-churning volatility
in the stock market, which complicates efforts to push for a Wall
Street solution to Social Security's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both parties are pressing ahead. Clinton is planning a
White House conference on the subject next month. Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has scheduled a
hearing for Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston has promised that pragmatism will prevail over
ideology in the House, suggesting a willingness to bridge the gulf
between the conservative vision of Social Security as an
individualized system for saving and investment and the insistence
by liberals that it remain a guaranteed, collective shield against
poverty among the elderly. Clinton has stressed that any solution
will have to be bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there is little to pull them together. Republican
leaders, convinced that the Democrats will otherwise find a way to
burn them on the issue, insist that Clinton, who has remained
resolutely vague about his thinking, go first by presenting a
detailed proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't holler down to the Congress and say, `Hey, we need to
do something about Social Security, good luck,''' said Sen. Trent
Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House has resisted setting out a position, saying
that to do so would polarize the debate from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans generally want to allow individuals to invest a
portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in stocks and bonds,
an approach also favored by a few leading Democrats, including
Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats oppose any shift from a guaranteed retirement
benefit, but are willing to consider having the government itself
seek a higher return for Social Security by investing its trust
funds in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Should he move toward private investment accounts, Clinton would
run into opposition from many of the same liberal constituencies,
especially organized labor, that helped revive his party's fortunes
in last week's election. Democrats may be less likely to compromise
if they believe they have a shot at regaining control of the House
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore will no doubt be wary of any plan that
would alienate core Democratic groups and give his most likely
rival for his party's 2000 presidential nomination, Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, an opportunity to lock in support from the
party's left. On the other hand, Gore also has to be concerned
about a challenge in 2000 from Kerrey.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the main question is how hard to push for a big
tax cut to reassert their conservative agenda _ and whether
Democrats would respond by accusing them of squandering the surplus
and endangering the financial security of coming generations of
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are still optimists in both parties, including Rep.
Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota, the point man on the issue for House
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In blocking Republican efforts to cut taxes this year and
demanding that the surplus be set aside until Social Security is
fixed, Pomeroy said Clinton ``reminded Republicans that this is a
powerful issue, that it works to the Democrats' advantage, and the
way to get it off the table is to come up with a bipartisan fix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their right-wing base is clamoring for a tax cut,'' Pomeroy
said of the Republicans, ``but doing it in the absence of Social
Security reform is a high-risk business, so before they get to the
tax cut they have to take care of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Democrats, we have a Democrat in the White House and we
have a budget surplus, so the time to do this is now. So this is a
fortuitous point in which both parties have it in their
self-interest to get it done, and a budget surplus to help us do
it.''

AMA JOURNAL, IN SHIFT, FOCUSES ON ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As more and more Americans turn to herbal remedies,
chiropractors and massage therapists, spending at least $27 billion
a year on those and other forms of alternative health care, the
medical profession is scrambling to catch up to the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, for the first time, an entire issue of The Journal of
the American Medical Association was devoted to alternative
medicine, and this week the AMA itself is publishing 60 more
articles on related topics in nine of its other journals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Lundberg, the journal's editor, decided a year ago to
take on the subject, in response to demand from doctors who wanted
scientifically sound data on treatments and products that so many
patients were asking about.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven research studies being published in The Journal of
the American Medical Association, three showed alternative
treatments to be useless, but four identified treatments that
seemed to work. ``In God we trust,'' Lundberg said at a news
conference the organization held here to present the findings.
``All others must have data.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he said the combination of positive and
negative studies in the journal came about naturally, and not by
the editors' design. ``That's just how it shook out,'' Lundberg
said, adding that the editors had no stake in proving or disproving
particular treatments. ``We just wanted good science,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The journal's approach stands in contrast with that of the other
leading journal in the United States, The New England Journal of
Medicine, which during the past year has published a series of
negative reports and editorials about various alternative
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal of the American Medical Association includes a study
by Dr. David Eisenberg, an assistant professor of medicine at
Harvard and director of the Center for Alternative Medicine
Research and Education at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,
in Boston. Eisenberg conducted a survey showing a sharp increase in
the use of alternative medicine by Americans from 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg's first survey on this subject was published in The
New England Journal of Medicine in 1993. He declined to explain why
the new one is appearing in The Journal of the American Medical
Association instead.
</P>
<P>
   In their survey, Eisenberg and his colleagues define alternative
medicine to include chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy,
biofeedback, megavitamins, homeopathy, relaxation techniques,
guided imagery, spiritual healing by others, self-help, commercial
diets, folk remedies, hypnosis, diets like those based on
vegetarianism or macrobiotics, herbal remedies and forms of
``energy'' healing that involve touch, magnets or other devices.
</P>
<P>
   In the studies published Tuesday, researchers found good results
using Chinese herbs for irritable bowel syndrome; saw palmetto, an
herbal product, for bladder symptoms caused by prostate
enlargement; yoga for the wrist problems caused by carpal tunnel
syndrome; and an acupuncture-like treatment for encouraging fetuses
in the breech position to turn in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   The studies found no benefit in using chiropractic manipulation
for tension headaches; herbal supplements containing the herb
Garcinia cambogia for weight loss; and acupuncture to control pain
from nerve damage caused by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1990, 61 million Americans were estimated to have used some
form of alternative medicine. By 1997, the figure had risen to 83
million. Visits to practitioners of alternative medicine also rose
sharply, to 629 million in 1997 from 427 million in 1990. Those
figures stand in marked contrast with visits to establishment
doctors, which dropped to 386 million in 1997 from 388 million in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Chiropractors and massage therapists accounted for half of all
the visits to alternative practitioners. And the most frequent
users were people age 35 to 49, with college educations and annual
incomes of more than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the group includes baby boomers, Eisenberg predicted
that their demand for alternative treatments would only increase
over the next 20 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers are the strongest message that the market can
deliver to the medical establishment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the figures do not mean that people are abandoning
traditional medicine, Eisenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the contrary,'' he said, ``the overwhelming majority who
are using alternative therapies are also seeing their medical
doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, more than half the alternative remedies
were used not to cure illness but to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   One figure that worries him, Eisenberg said, is that few people
tell their doctors what alternative therapies they are using, and
that such reticence may lead to harmful interactions with
prescription drugs. Eisenberg said the current climate of ``don't
ask, don't tell'' could harm patients, and he urged doctors to ask
patients in a nonjudgmental way about all remedies and treatments
that they might be trying.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern, he said, is that people with serious illnesses
like cancer will try to take care of their own symptoms with
drugstore or herbal potions, losing precious time and letting the
disease advance.
</P>
<P>
   In a decidedly unorthodox report, at least by Western standards,
the journal reported a study of a treatment involving the burning
of a cigar-shaped roll of herbs near an acupuncture point on the
outside of either little toe of a pregnant woman whose fetus was in
the breech position. The purpose was to stimulate the fetus to turn
around for a normal, head-first delivery. The smoldering plant,
Artemisia vulgaris, also called mugwort, or, in Japan, moxa, is
held as close to the toe as a woman can tolerate without her
feeling pain.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, moxibustion, has been used in China to turn
breech fetuses ``since ancient times,'' said the authors of the
report, Dr. Francesco Cardini, a physician in private practice in
Verona, Italy, and Dr. Huang Weixin, of the Jiangxi Women's
Hospital in Nanchang, China.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is thought to make the fetus more active somehow,
and more likely to somersault into the right position for birth.
</P>
<P>
   To test the theory, Cardini and Huang studied 260 women at two
hospitals in China in the 33rd week of their first pregnancy, after
ultrasound scans showed their fetuses to be in the breech position.
In a woman pregnant for the first time, if a baby is breech by the
33rd week, the odds are high that it will stay that way. Breech
fetuses can be injured during birth, and in the United States they
are often delivered by caesarean to avoid the risk. In China,
moxibustion is often used to try to get the fetuses to turn.
</P>
<P>
   In Cardini's study, women were picked at random to receive
either moxibustion or no treatment. The treated women would sit or
recline, and their husbands would burn the moxa sticks near their
little toes at a location called acupoint BL67, or Zhiyin, for 30
minutes at a time once or twice a day for one or two weeks. BL67 is
one of 364 most commonly used acupuncture points on the human body,
and it is also stimulated to treat kidney and bladder problems and
pain caused by the sciatic nerve.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks, 75.4 percent of the babies in the moxibustion
group had turned, as compared with 47.7 percent in the untreated
group. Later, 75.4 percent in the moxibustion group were born
head-first, and the figure in the other group rose to 62.3 percent,
but only because doctors turned some of the breech fetuses manually
just before birth.
</P>
<P>
   Cardini said it was impossible to tell whether the effects had
come from the sensation of heat to the toes, or the fumes from the
mugwort. But since moxibustion is cheap, easy and harmless, it is
worth trying, he said. If it fails, Cardini said, doctors can
always try to turn the baby before delivery. But, he added, Western
women may be put off by the strong, resinous odor of burning
mugwort. ``It is a very Eastern smell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Nagey, an associate professor in gynecology and
obstetrics at the the Johns Hopkins Medical School, in Baltimore,
said that although moxibustion had been a source of levity among
some American doctors, ``I don't want to put it down,'' adding,
``There may be something here.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will take further research to sell him on moxibustion,
Nagey said, because of some questions about the study. He said the
effects of the treatment might have been due to the relaxing
effects on the women of resting and having their toes ministered to
by their mates. The experiment would have been better, Nagey said,
if the untreated women had also been assigned daily rest periods
with their partners. In addition, he said, he wondered whether the
women in the study were truly a typical sample of pregnant women,
because the researchers had a long list of conditions they could
invoke to exclude a woman from the study.
</P>
<P>
   Following are other alternative remedies reported to work in The
Journal of the American Medical Association:
</P>
<P>
   _ A mixture of 20 or more Chinese herbs used for inflammatory
bowel syndrome, a hard-to-treat condition affecting millions of
people, which can cause severe abdominal pain and constipation or
diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yoga, for the wrist pain and other problems caused by carpal
tunnel syndrome, a disorder brought on by typing and other
repetitive motions.
</P>
<P>
   _ The herbal remedy saw palmetto (Seronoa repens) for bladder
problems caused by enlargement of the prostate gland.
</P>
<P>
   The treatments found not to work included chiropractic
manipulation for tension headaches, the popular herb Garcinia
cambogia for weight loss and the use of acupuncture to control pain
from nerve damage caused by HIV.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers cautioned that these studies were the beginning
of scientific investigations into alternative treatments, and not
the final word. Dr. John McConnell, chairman of the urology
department at the University of Texas Southwestern medical school,
in Dallas, said, ``We have an obligation medically to determine
whether these things are effective.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell questioned some of the positive studies on saw
palmetto, because it was found to work as well as a drug that
itself does not work in many patients. In addition, he said, there
are so many different saw palmetto formulations on the market that
it is hard to know which one might work, or why.
</P>
<P>
   ``When patients ask me about it I tell them I think from the
data that the agent is quite safe, and if they want to take it as
an alternative approach that might provide some partial
improvement, I don't object,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   What worries him, though, is that some men will unknowingly take
saw palmetto for symptoms that are really caused by prostate or
bladder tumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great fear of men going to the supermarket for two
years straight and getting their saw palmetto and not realizing
they have a growing cancer,'' McConnell said.

JUDGE SENTENCES MAN TO 30 DAYS IN JAIL FOR FAILING TO FILL OUT
JUROR QUESTIONNAIRE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A man who defied a judge by refusing to fill out a
juror questionnaire in a capital murder case was found in contempt
of court Tuesday and jailed for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge W.R. Voigt also fined Harold Leland Crouch
$500. The judge said afterward he felt the sentence necessary to
protect the integrity of the court and the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying to the court, `I'm not going to participate in the
process because I don't agree with the law,' that's not the way it
works,'' Voigt said.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch spent part of the day in a holding cell near the
courtroom and was still being booked into the county jail late
Tuesday. He was being held without bail because none is normally
granted in this kind of contempt case.
</P>
<P>
   Summoned to jury service, Crouch ended up in Voigt's court,
where a jury is being selected for the upcoming capital murder
trial of Raymond Reese, 50, who is accused of killing his
common-law wife's daughter and son-in-law on Oct. 27, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The state is seeking the death penalty and that requires
individual questioning, or ``voir dire,'' of potential jurors. As
part of that process, those summoned must fill out a standard juror
information form and a longer capital murder questionnaire before
being questioned by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The forms save prosecutors and defense attorneys time and helps
them to spot potential biases or other problems while agreeing to a
jury. And that helps prevent costly retrials and appellate
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Voigt and lawyers involved in the case, Crouch
would not fill out the forms and said the mere fact that he was
summoned qualified him for jury duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent of the jury system is to select qualified people at
random and assume them to be representative of the population,''
Crouch wrote on his capital murder questionnaire. ``Everybody
meeting the qualifications on the jury summons is qualified to sit
on this jury. The court needs no additional information.''
</P>
<P>
   In the rest of the spaces for answers on the forms, Crouch wrote
``not available,'' Voigt said. Court officials weren't even sure of
his age or address.
</P>
<P>
   Voigt called Crouch forward, told him that state law requires
jurors to submit to voir dire and ordered him to fill out the
forms. He also warned him of the possible penalties _ up to six
months in jail and a $500 fine.
</P>
<P>
   But Crouch said he wasn't familiar with any such legal
requirements and continued to refuse to fill out the forms.
</P>
<P>
   Voigt wasn't buying his argument about being automatically
qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get 12 fair jurors who hold no bias for either side
and who are prepared to receive the law and the evidence,'' Voigt
said later. ``Until you question them (potential jurors) and
examine them, you don't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   No information about Crouch was available because he hadn't been
booked into jail and jailers would not relay to him a reporter's
request for an interview, saying they were not sure if he had a
lawyer yet.
</P>
<P>
   Courthouse sources did not know his exact age or address, but
believed him to be in the mid-40s and possibly from Kingwood,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A phone listed under the same name in Kingwood was picked up by
an answering machine with the recorded voice of a man identifying
himself as ``Harold.'' No relatives of Crouch's could be located
for comment either.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Kari Sckerl, who is handling the Reese case, knew
nothing about Crouch. But she and defense attorney Brian Coyne, who
is representing the defendant, praised Voigt and said they were
frustrated by Crouch's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen it happen before and I was offended by the
juror's refusal to be part of the process,'' Sckerl said. ``If we
live in this country and we take advantages of the benefits of this
country then we have a duty to follow the laws of this country. He
was in direct violation of the law and a court order, I was
offended and glad the judge held him in contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyne echoed that sentiment, saying the juror forms are an
important tool and help ensure a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Voigt's action was greeted with grins, shaking heads and
raised eyebrows around the courthouse. Many prosecutors and lawyers
expressed strong support, but some others, who didn't want to be
named because they appear before Voigt, thought the 30 days was a
bit severe.
</P>
<P>
   Voigt, who was defeated in the Republican primary and leaves the
bench at the end of the year, has held jurors in contempt before,
including one who had overslept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel (jury service) is very important and that's why I did
this,'' Voigt said. ``(Crouch) had an obligation to carry out his
duties as a citizen and if we get to a point where people say, `I
follow the laws that suit me,' then we have anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Crouch was found in ``direct'' contempt he actually has
no due-process rights, other than to file a direct appeal with the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct'' contempt is when someone disobeys a judge's order in
the courtroom. There is no review hearing and no bail, unless the
person cited is an officer of the court. That's because a judge,
who has wide discretion in such cases, can issue a final finding
when the contempt occurs.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court in Austin could grant Crouch a bail while they
review his case, but several attorneys said Tuesday that hardly
ever happens unless the punishment for ``direct'' contempt is
considered too severe. &QL;

CREDIT CARD CRUNCH: LENDERS' NEW RULES HIT CONSUMERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN DRAKE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumers are paying a higher price for borrowing with plastic
as lenders continue to raise their fees by changing the rules for
little-noticed credit card penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The rules make credit cards more costly in several ways,
including making late fees more common and expensive, slapping on
higher default rates more often and enabling consumers to run
higher balances adding to their interest costs and fees.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows how ``banks are pulling out all stops in order
to increase profits from fee income,'' said Linda Sherry, editorial
director of the group Consumer Action, which did the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers say the critical report ignores the many cards available
to consumers with lower interest rates and fees that don't include
those added charges.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates admit that credit card interest rates are
much lower, especially introductory offers ranging from zero to
four percent. But strict conditions and harsh penalties are buried
in fine print that the consumer groups say most consumers never
read or won't understand until the fee hits.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Action surveyed 117 cards from 74 banks during August
and September and released the report jointly with the Consumer
Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there are thousands of different credit cards,
Sherry said the survey is representative because the survey focused
on the handful of large lenders who hold a lion's share of the
market, issuing cards through different companies.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to consumers using a low-interest credit card for
initial, expensive purchases. After they build up a balance, which
will be easy to do this time of year with the holiday spending
season looming, they are stuck with a card with a lot of burdensome
fees attached.
</P>
<P>
   The companies make it easier to keep the balance by reducing the
required minimum payment. If customers pay at this rate, it will
take far longer to repay the amount as interest on the debt builds
up.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, companies are shortening the time customers
have to send their payments in and the leniency periods _ the time
after the payment is due before companies slap on a late fee _ and
that fee is also going up.
</P>
<P>
   They make it easier to fatten your balance by setting soft
limits _ rather than denying charges when a borrower hits a limit
they charge a fee of $20 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The fees make falling behind on a large balance an increasingly
expensive mistake. Companies use expensive penalty rates _ a higher
interest rate imposed after missing several payments. Penalty rates
can be as much as 25 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Consumer Action's Sherry said the practices
described in the survey ``will entrap people who are deadbeats or
poor, and it will get the rest of us who are busy or on vacation or
lose a bill.''
</P>
<P>
   But the American Bankers Association said now is a great time to
shop for a card, and the big borrowers mostly likely to be hit by
these fees are a slim minority of credit card users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annual fees are almost non-existent on standard cards and
interest rates have dropped,'' said Donald Ogilvie, an executive
vice president for the bankers association, in a statement. ``To
find the right card, consumers can choose from thousands of
products created by more than 6,000 card issuers. The current
credit card environment gives them more and cheaper options than
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the increased and higher fees the survey reports, Ogilvie
said nine of 10 people avoid fees by paying their accounts on time
and a majority of consumers pay $3 or less a month.
</P>
<P>
   George McCain of First USA, the credit card division of Bank
One, disagreed with consumer advocates' entrapment theory - that
credit companies in general target people they know can't pay so
they can reap profits from late fees and penalty rates. He said his
company seeks out customers with good credit history.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One's fee and rate practices were typical of many companies
profiled in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One has no leniency period after the due date, before it
slaps on a $29 late fee. Its default interest rate of 22.99 percent
kicks in after paying late by 30 days twice in six months, or
paying late by 60 days once in 6 months _ a typical industry
practice.
</P>
<P>
   John Russell, head of Bank One's corporate communications,
placed the issue in terms of market behavior. Interest rates were
18 to 24 percent in 1995, and now have dropped to around 6 percent.
``So, as interest rates have gone down, these fees have gone up,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry wide trends ``are a reflection of what's happened
in the market'' and a response to consumer behavior, said Kathleen
Shilkret, spokeswoman for Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   As for credit practices of Wells Fargo, Shilkret said ``we're
trying to provide consumers with the right sort of credit for
them,'' based on their credit history.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo has four different cards with varying interest
rates, 12.50 percent to 20.5 percent, that are issued based on
credit history _ better rates for consumers with better credit
histories. All four cards have a penalty rate of 23.90 percent,
which is sixth highest on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there is no leniency period, so the $29 late fee is
imposed immediately after the due date, if the payment does not
arrive. The report noted this late fee was a mere $5 in 1995. The
annual fee is $18 and the over-the-limit fee is $29.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America, another bank with operations in Houston (and
which recently merged with Nations Bank), does not have a leniency
period, has a 22.4 percent penalty rate and an interest rate as
high as 21.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Wyss, spokesperson for the company, referred questions to
the American Bankers Association because ``we view the report as an
industry matter.'' &QL;

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15)  
 (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been meaning to lobby this newspaper for a series on secret
vices. Critics, staunch in their advocacy of the pure and
upstanding, would confess what they listen to, read or look at when
no one is paying attention. It would be like Sottha Khunn eating
Mars bars after a night cooking at Le Cirque 2000, or Oscar de la
Renta sitting at home in his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   The profound and the worthy can be tiring, and there is nothing
like a little smallness to ease our passage from one Bach B minor
Mass to the next Elliott Carter Double Concerto.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness of this sort applies also to the performances we like:
ones that we know are ``wrong'' but that are irresistible
nonetheless. Stokowski's Bach, jacked up for 100 musicians, makes
the musicologist's hair curl but makes mine stand on end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dialogues and Discoveries: James Levine: His Life and His
Music,'' by Robert C. Marsh, new from Scribner, tells of a young
Levine shyly confronting that most scrupulous of musicians, George
Szell, with the sin of conducting in 4/4 a Mozart andante that is
explicitly two to the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something Viennese that is very hard to explain,'' Szell
answers almost apologetically. Bruno Walter, when asked why he
ignored an apparently obligatory repeat in the Brahms Third
Symphony, confessed simultaneously to his incorrectness and his
compulsion to keep going at the double bar.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent information alters our memory of first impressions,
but elements never leave us. How can anyone who grew up on
Rimsky-Korsakov's lapidary version of ``Boris Godunov'' abandon it,
even knowing how much the integrity of Mussorgsky's original has
been compromised? The two versions are like separate works, each to
be cherished.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague and opera expert I know falls prostrate before the
Saint-Saens Trumpet Septet. No one plays the Scriabin Piano
Concerto these days, if anyone ever did, but its softly wandering
slow movement still haunts me. Why, indeed, do the small and the
wayward hypnotize us when the Beethoven ``Hammerklavier'' Sonata
and the Mahler Third Symphony stand nearby?
</P>
<P>
   Explain, in particular, the attractions of Federico Mompou, a
determinedly minor composer of piano music and the occasional song,
who in the wash of 20th-century history is a tiny ripple at low
tide.
</P>
<P>
   Mompou, who lived from 1893 to 1987, divided his long life
between Paris and his native Barcelona, Spain. He shared
friendships with Ravel and all the major French composers, but his
name is rarely mentioned by their biographers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hough, an English pianist with an inquiring mind, has
evidently caught the Mompou virus, too, and has recorded 32 of his
little pieces for Hyperion. Hough, an escapee from the competition
wars, has never burst into flame, but his deep curiosity and
affection for the out-of-the-way gives significant new credibility
to historical footnotes like Hummel and Scharwenka.
</P>
<P>
   He also, in his program notes, has a way with words: ``In the
light of Artur Schnabel's quaint yet charming generalization,
`Mozart is a garden; Schubert is a forest _ in sunlight and shadow;
Beethoven is a mountain range,' perhaps Mompou is a window box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs and Dances,'' ``Magic Songs,'' ``Preludes,''
``Dialogues,'' ``Charms'' and ``Landscapes'' inhabit this CD.
Simple tunes and dances are often linked, and then there are mood
pieces like ``The Lake,'' with its motionless broken chords and
softly tolling treble notes.
</P>
<P>
   Mompou's piano music is usually as easy to play as it is to
understand, and for the amateur player beaten down by an evening of
Mahlerian grandeur at Carnegie Hall, I recommend it as a late-night
restorative.
</P>
<P>
   In one, isolated way, Mompou is like Kurt Weill, who wrote
accessible songs made durable by their hidden complications. Mompou
adds compromising notes to diatonic chords, creating states of
ambiguity. The shape of the tune is unequivocal, but the
indeterminate harmonies are like softly spoken, unanswered
questions.
</P>
<P>
   For a listener whose formative years were the 1940s and 50s, the
link between Mompou's extended chords and those of bebop is
natural. The pull of youth is strong, and this may be why a heart
that understands the rectitude of hard-edged 1920s Gershwin still
gravitates toward the Gershwin of Nelson Riddle.
</P>
<P>
   Can we explain Mompou's charm? One clue is this: In almost all
of these pieces there is a turning point, a modulation or melodic
alteration, that directs the expected toward the better than
expected. We know precisely when it will arrive, but it never fails
to please. These points are like hinges on which the naive and the
sophisticated are made to swing.
</P>
<P>
   Hough, in general, plays this music very well. He is especially
good at resisting the virtuoso's tendency to think big in small
spaces. Beginning the recital with the E major ``Song and Dance''
(``Cancion y Danza'' No. 7) makes a splendid advertisement for what
is to come, but I deeply regret Hough's rubato hesitations in what
is clearly straightforward melody.
</P>
<P>
   I remember Mompou on an ancient Angel LP giving the same note
values their literal worth, and to magical effect. Does my memory
play tricks? The record, anyway, is so worn from use as to be
unintelligible.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable sins of Hough's Mompou are those of omission. One
hopes he will find enough extra material, and sufficient public
interest in it, to do another Mompou recording, one that will
include the ``Intimate Impressions'' and its irresistible
``Gitano'' at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he can find a singer for the equally magical three songs
of ``Combat del Somni.'' Perhaps Mompou's work takes up too little
space for such added ventures. But then, lack of size is its
attraction.

ARMEY STILL STRUGGLING TO KEEP NO. 2 JOB IN HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dick Armey of Texas appeared to be ahead on
Tuesday in his struggle to keep his job as House majority leader,
the No. 2 leadership position, but a lingering dissatisfaction with
him and his two current opponents prompted rumors of a fourth
candidate's entering the race.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Reps. Steve Largent of Oklahoma and Jennifer Dunn of
Washington have entered the race for the leader's job, which
involves scheduling and managing floor votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers on Tuesday raised the possibility that Rep.
William Thomas of California, who sometimes supports abortion
rights, might be drawn in, but his aides said that he would have no
immediate announcement. Another possible candidate, Rep. Howard
McKeon of California, decided not to enter the race and threw his
support to Armey.
</P>
<P>
   The result of this uncertain battle, along with a contest over
the fourth-ranking position of chairman of the party caucus, a job
that includes spreading the party message, will determine the
public image the party presents in the House.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the campaigning seems based more on personal
ambition than on any carefully plotted ticket-balancing, a victory
for Armey would reflect a sense that the departure of Speaker Newt
Gingrich was enough of a change in top positions. An upset victory
by Largent would give the party a strikingly conservative cast
while te selection of Ms. Dunn, would make her the highest-ranking
woman in congressional history and instantly send a new message
about the party that for nearly two decades has worried about its
relative lack of support from women.
</P>
<P>
   A victory in the race for the caucus leadership by Rep. J.C.
Watts of Oklahoma, the only black Republican member of Congress,
would send a comparable message for a party that got only 11
percent of black votes in last week's House elections. He is
challenging Rep. John Boehner of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, who currently holds the position of
majority whip, is unchallenged in his bid for re-election to the
position.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, now the presumptive speaker
pending two formal votes, met for more than an hour on Tuesday
afternoon with Gingrich, whom he forced from office with his
announcement Friday that he was challenging him. The two discussed
the transition of power to Livingston and covered such topics as
making sure that the 17 incoming freshmen Republicans were on board
with the leadership. Livingston called Gingrich ``a brilliant man''
and said he had been ``gracious'' in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the races for two of the leadership positions,
another big big question mark in the House is who will replace
Livingston as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, one of the
two most important committees in the House. Republicans said that
Rep. C.W. Young of Florida, who is next in line because of
seniority and who is in the same conservative-pragmatist mold as
Livingston, would probably get the nod from the new Speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's supporters say he has more than 100 of the 112 votes
needed to secure re-election to his post but that they have had
difficulty in reaching embers who are on vacation and difficulty in
securing commitments over the telephone for what will be a
secret-ballot election on Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're almost at a majority, but you don't stop at 112, you
build in a cushion,'' said Michele Davis, Armey's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's opponents said his support was thin and could vanish in
the secret balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick here is trying to hold your votes til the end,'' Ms.
Dunn observed on CNN. Her aides said on Tuesday she had reached
nearly 100 members and was ``encouraged'' by what appeared to be
soft support for Armey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a head fake when I see one,'' Largent said in a
statement. The Hall of Fame football player asserted that Armey had
less than 40 votes. ``There is a huge block of undecided members.''
</P>
<P>
   What is keeping this race alive is the apparent dissatisfaction
with all three options. Armey is known for verbal gaffes that many
say have caused too much embarrassment to the party. Largent is
perceived as too hard-core conservative. Ms. Dunn is perceived as
having too mixed a record on abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the abortion debate were unhappy with her,
reflecting the difficulty for any politician in trying to take a
middle position on this most inflammatory of issues. An aide said
that in discussions on Tuesday, Ms. Dunn was discovering that her
abortion votes would be used as a ``litmus test'' in her race for
majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee gave her a positive rating
of 80 out of 100 this year. The National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League gave her a positive rating of 17. Still, that
was higher than the zero it gave to all the other candidates for
all the other leadership posts. Her 17 stemmed largely from her
support for family planning.

 Matt Wolf is an American journalist who writes about the arts from
London.  
 (af)  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Ralph Fiennes devotees will recall that the 1992
television film, ``A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia,'' more
or less introduced the actor to the United States. It's unlikely,
however, that viewers also caught the fleeting presence of a
younger Fiennes, Joseph, playing Ralph's onscreen brother. (So tiny
is the part that the lesser-known Fiennes does not make the credit
roll.)
</P>
<P>
   Six years, and many more substantial parts later, 28-year-old
Joseph Fiennes is emerging as a name to reckon with on his own. His
role next month as Gwyneth Paltrow's Bardic suitor in ``Shakespeare
in Love'' is expected to clinch him as a separate but equal talent
to that of his Tony-winning, Oscar-nominated brother.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Fiennes particularly welcomes comparisons, however
inevitable. Although he talks freely about his family _ he and
Ralph are two of seven children _ Joseph wants recognition for his
merits, not his surname. (At least he is spared the pronunciation
issue: after the success of Ralph _ as in `Rafe' _ everyone knows
Fiennes is pronounced fines.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put in a lot of work, and I just get a bit concerned when
people think, `Oh, he's got the job because of x, y and z.' '' said
Fiennes recently at a trendy West London ``gastro-pub.''
</P>
<P>
   Those worries will likely recede once more people see the
younger actor's work. Joseph can be thought of as putting a kinder,
gentler _ OK, cuter _ face on Ralph's well-known intensity. Just as
it is hard to imagine the doe-eyed Joseph playing the SS officer
Amon Goeth in ``Schindler's List'' _ his brother's career-making
part _ it is equally hard to envision Ralph bringing the same
innocent ardor to ``Shakespeare in Love'' or ``Martha _ Meet Frank,
Daniel, and Laurence,'' the English romantic comedy due in the
United States this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the single Fiennes seems to have cornered the young
swain market. This fall, one could not navigate the London
Underground without seeing his face advertising the new film
``Elizabeth,'' in which he plays Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester,
with the single word ``Lover'' emblazoned across the poster.
</P>
<P>
   In context, it's little surprise that his other credits include
a Romeo for the complete spoken-word Shakespeare recorded by
Arkangel as well as the smoldering young haberdasher in the Peter
Whelan play ``The Herbal Bed'' for the Royal Shakespeare Company in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Spencer wrote of the performance in The Daily Telegraph
that Fiennes conveyed ``raw anguish as the self-tormenting lover.''
(That character's name, incidentally, was Rafe.)
</P>
<P>
   ``His passion is very hot, I think,'' said Adrian Noble,
artistic director of the RSC, who had watched Ralph emerge within
the same company nearly a decade before. ``I wouldn't call Joe a
cuddly actor. He's not warm in that sense; he's warm in the heat of
passion.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the charm he projects in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' playing
a heartsick young Elizabethan poet-playwright named Will
Shakespeare, ``I don't think Joe plays it,'' said the film's
director, John Madden (``Mrs. Brown''). ``I think he simply has it.
There's an openness there, and a kind of vulnerability, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be why Fiennes speaks of wanting to be cast against
type _ of playing Mercutio, say, instead of Romeo. In the London
production of Nick Grosso's play ``Real Classy Affair,'' he played
a smooth-talking hipster whose shiny suits hide a malevolent
spirit. A forthcoming film, ``Rancid Aluminum,'' casts him as a
psychopathic Irish bookkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, Fiennes will travel to Miami to make his first
American film, ``Forever Mine,'' directed by Paul Schrader. ``I
have to age up 15 years, and get shot in the face,'' said Fiennes,
sounding pleased. ``It's character acting again. You can't beat
it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not in my memory has Broadway witnessed a
resurrection comparable to the one on view at the 1,700-seat
Minskoff Theater where, one year ago, the critical consensus was
that the musical adaptation of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' was DOA.
You might have expected that the show, with book and lyrics by Nan
Knighton and music by Frank Wildhorn, would have been interred with
dignity, then forgotten. But no.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of Wildhorn's ``Jekyll and Hyde'' helped to sell
tickets. So did the big, boldly engaging performance by Douglas
Sills, who made his Broadway debut in the title role. As inert as
the show was, it hung on, just barely, at last to be saved and
maybe even turned into a hit. An association of big-spending,
deep-pocket types provided the means by which ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel'' was able to have its somewhat belated out-of-town
tryout tour without ever leaving the Minskoff.
</P>
<P>
   The revisions went into rehearsal in September, while the cast
continued to play the original production at night. After an
eight-day shutdown beginning Oct. 1, the show began what were, in
effect, several weeks of previews prior to the return of the
critics earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a virtually different show, still headed by Sills,
but with two new co-stars, Rex Smith and Rachel York. It has been
assembled mostly out of material that was already there, a lot of
it rewritten, pared down and rearranged by Ms. Knighton and
reimagined by Robert Longbottom, the new director and
choreographer. You should remember Longbottom as a member of the
team responsible for last season's haunting succes d'estime, ``Side
Show.'' He has also been directing and choreographing the annual
``Radio City Music Hall Christmas Spectacular'' since 1994, which
may have given him a special insight into the kind of show ``The
Scarlet Pimpernel'' was meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   Market researchers, who are now required in our big-buck
theater, told the new producers that people who had seen the show
didn't know what it was about. That may have been true of some
angry 4-year-olds. The other respondents, I suspect, really meant
that the show was so languidly paced, so awkwardly staged and so
uninflected that they couldn't have cared less about what was
happening on the stage. Their minds had wandered.
</P>
<P>
   In adapting Baroness Orczy's 1905 romantic novel as a musical,
Ms. Knighton was forced to do a certain amount of truncating, but
she hardly made it difficult to follow. Her book was and is an
adequate re-creation of the tale about Percy Blakeney, the dashing
English knight who masquerades as a fop to disguise his activities
saving aristocrats from the Terror of the French Revolution. What
the show lacked was the comic point of view and the energy to
prevent it from looking as glum as a failed, socially irresponsible
``Les Miz'' spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' is now what it should always have
been: a light-hearted, prettily appointed entertainment, still sung
in the manner of old-time operetta, but a show that moves with
speed, sometimes wit and is never solemn for very long. There is
even a touch of Grand Guignol theatrics. One of the principal
characters is guillotined, not offstage but before the eyes of the
happily disbelieving audience.
</P>
<P>
   Even the score sounds better, not necessarily the ballads, in
which singers seem always to be searching for some marshmallow
truth within, but the mock anthems, such as ``Madame Guillotine''
and ``Into the Fire,'' and the comic numbers. The big, strapping
Sills has great fun with these, especially ``The Creation of Man,''
in which Percy, in his foppish guise, leads the members of his
league in a celebration of outrageous male plumage.
</P>
<P>
   Sills is a true singer, but he also enunciates the lyrics in a
manner that recalls the crisp relish of Rex Harrison in ``My Fair
Lady'' when he wondered why a woman couldn't be more like a man.
Sills continues to dominate the show, though now the show is
working with him, instead of ignoring him.
</P>
<P>
   A continuing problem: The Minskoff sound amplification system
has a way of rendering many of the love songs unintelligible, the
words emerging as meaningless syllables no matter who is singing.
Is it because the love songs tend to be thunderously
overorchestrated while the anthems and the comedy numbers are
presented less ornately?
</P>
<P>
   Rachel York, last seen on Broadway as the brassy Chicago moll in
``Victor/Victoria,'' is the new Marguerite (originally played by
Christine Andreas), Percy's baffled French wife. You wouldn't know
that bubble gum had ever passed her lips. She looks and even sounds
a bit like Isabelle Adjani at her most queenly. Also singing well
is Rex Smith, who is in for Terrence Mann, the original Chauvelin,
Marguerite's former lover and evil revolutionary zealot.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' is not exactly a dancing show,
Longbottom appears to have altered and made coherent what
choreography there was before. Andrew Jackness has augmented his
lovely, Gainsborough-esque scenic design with one new set. Jane
Greenwood's costumes remain a dazzling tribute to conspicuous
consumption whenever the occasion allows.
</P>
<P>
   As welcome and as astonishing as this salvage operation is, it
is also another reminder of the way in which other entertainment
interests are now shaping the Broadway landscape. One of the
principal new producers is Radio City Entertainment, a division of
Cablevision Systems Corp., which is also the parent of Madison
Square Garden. ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' is seen not only as a
Broadway investment, but as something that will eventually be
filling large arenas all around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The success of a Broadway show's possible second, third and
fourth companies has always played a part in the fortunes of
producers. Now it seems possible that the demands of this national
market will more directly affect what appears on Broadway. Carried
to its logical extreme, Broadway could become just another regional
outlet for products expected to sell equally well in the Deep
South, Salem, Ore., or Yuma, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   It's Broadway as a franchise business. But is it a franchise
business that would devote the same interest to saving something
far more idiosyncratic? For example, ``The Capeman,'' last season's
Paul Simon show, which was ineptly written and staged, though it
had one of the best scores Broadway has heard in years?

 UNDATED: in years?  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good news: Richard Benjamin and Paula Prentiss have taken over
the roles originated so memorably by Alan Arkin and Elaine May in
``Power Plays,'' the Off Broadway hit that opened six months ago at
the Promenade Theater. Benjamin and Ms. Prentiss, who are man and
wife, turn up in the theater far too infrequently. They are assets
of singular comic dimension: he of the uncanny timing, furrowed
brow and the crazily earnest persona, which was defined when he
played the Philip Roth surrogate in ``Goodbye, Columbus''; she of
the style and chic of a fashion model, but a fashion model with the
mysterious, dizzy intensity of, say, a theoretical mathematician.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has admired their film work now has the opportunity
to see them in something that seems as made for their talents as it
was for those of their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining in the four-actor cast, and better than ever, are
Jeannie Berlin (Ms. May's daughter) and Anthony Arkin, the son of
Alan, who directed the original production as well as the new cast
members.
</P>
<P>
   The program of three short comedies (two by Ms. May and one by
Alan Arkin) continues to be a delirious entertainment. If the tone
and the balance of the performances have shifted a bit, that's a
reflection of the public personalities of the new stars. This is
particularly apparent in Ms. May's play, which opens the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way of All Fish'' is about the hilarious, possibly
life-and-death struggle of wills that erupts between two highly
motivated women. Ms. Asquith (Ms. Prentiss) is a self-absorbed,
high-powered Manhattan career woman, maybe a literary agent who
deals only in six-figure properties. In the other corner is her
drudge of a secretary, Miss Riverton (Ms. Berlin), who aspires
beyond her capabilities. She expects to be elevated to the post of
Ms. Asquith's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   As the two share Japanese takeout (and a lot of wine) in the
office at the end of a long week, Ms. Asquith is suddenly forced to
notice her secretary for the first time. Miss Riverton, her tongue
loosened by alcohol, talks dreamily about attaining fame by
assassinating someone famous. ``I'm a special person with no
special abilities,'' she says. She is convinced that assassination
is her only route to immortality. The challenge is to choose a
victim whose fame won't overshadow the new-found celebrity of the
assassin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prentiss' wheeler-dealer has the spacey manner of a woman
who has used her arrogant, eccentric manners to demolish all
opposition. Suddenly, unlike Ms. May's resourceful Ms. Asquith, the
character appears to be without defenses. When Ms. May played the
role, Ms. Asquith looked and sounded so much like Miss Riverton
that, in spite of their unequal positions in life, they could have
been the mother and daughter they actually are. They were more
evenly matched. The battle then was equally funny, but the stakes
were of a different nature.
</P>
<P>
   In the present staging, there is some doubt whether Ms. Asquith
will be able to check Miss Riverton's hilariously raging ambitions.
The power has clearly gone to the younger woman, who is almost as
dangerous as she dreams of being.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat similar shift in emphasis occurs in the program's
second play, Arkin's ``Virtual Reality,'' a small, comic
chef-d'oeuvre that, when first seen, I mistakenly described as
having the manner of an actor's exercise. It is now clear that the
work is far more subtle, more deft than that. It is a seriously
comic, shaggy-dog sketch that simultaneously makes use of two
different realities.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that of the garage where, late one night, two hoods
who don't know each other meet by prearrangement to prepare for an
operation, the nature of which is never revealed. De Recha
(Benjamin), prides himself on going by the book. He plans ahead.
Lefty (Anthony Arkin), his younger associate, is more laid back,
pragmatic. De Recha somehow persuades Lefty that they must
inventory their gear, though it hasn't yet been delivered and
though they have no way of knowing what it will include.
</P>
<P>
   To the younger man's astonishment, he finds himself not only
swallowed up in De Recha's fantasy as they inventory the
nonexistent gear, but also enthusiastically helping to create
another world that replaces the reality of the barren garage. It's
madness of a marvelous theatricality. Toward the end, the two men
are huddling in a make-believe tent they have just unpacked and
erected, in a feeble attempt to escape the sub-zero cold of a
mountain top they have created.
</P>
<P>
   In the original production, Alan Arkin's De Recha appeared to be
touched by a streak of brilliant lunacy; Benjamin's De Recha
destabilizes Lefty by firm persistence, only to be engulfed by the
younger man's even more dangerous fantasies. Both interpretations
are valid, both hugely funny.
</P>
<P>
   All four members of the cast unite in ``In and Out of the
Light,'' which concludes the program. This is Ms. May's blissful,
burlesque-like mini-farce set in a dentist's office. A proper,
long-married Jewish dentist (Benjamin) is planning his first
extramarital fling with his sexy nurse (Ms. Prentiss), a former
exotic dancer.
</P>
<P>
   The obligatory interruptions are effected by his son (Anthony
Arkin), who wants to confess that he is 1) gay and 2) planning to
drop out of dental school, and a hysterically neurotic woman (Ms.
Berlin), who is every dentist's worst nightmare of a needy patient.
</P>
<P>
   There is still joy in chaos at the Promenade.

CLINTON WARNS U.S. WILL LIMIT CHEAP IMPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said for the first time Tuesday
that the United States would not tolerate the ``flooding of our
markets'' with low-cost goods from Asia and Russia, particularly
steel, that are threatening the jobs of American workers.
</P>
<P>
   The president's statement came days after a White House meeting
of top executives of steel companies and the United Steelworkers of
America, which helped get out the vote for Democrats last week,
playing a pivotal role with other unions in the party's success in
midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting in the Cabinet room, which included Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore and top Cabinet officials, Clinton's aides
said the White House would not grant the unions' demand to cut off
imports of steel that are apparently being dumped in the American
markets. But on Tuesday, the president warned that foreign nations
must ``play by the rules,'' appearing to signal that the United
States would press other nations to restrict their exports to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks, which came in an address to the President's Export
Council, an advisory group, creates an apparent conflict in U.S.
policy, which until now has indirectly encouraged economically
troubled countries to export their goods. But with the United
States as the strongest and most open economy, Japan in deep
recession and Europe still closed to many goods, most of those
imports have come here, creating a political problem the White
House must now deal with.
</P>
<P>
   How to deal with the flood of imports, and the soaring trade
deficit they are creating, has touched off a significant debate
within the administration. Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin,
who has led the effort to design rescue packages for Asian nations,
Russia and Latin America, has urged Clinton to be cautious in
limiting the ability of those nations to export goods to the United
States, their main source of hard currency now.
</P>
<P>
   Any effort to cut off the American market, Rubin noted Tuesday
in a sharp exchange with George Becker, president of the
steelworkers' union, could ``have consequences that are adverse to
workers in other industries and consumers'' who have benefited from
low-priced imports.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has also cautioned that any move by the United States to
shut off its markets could be taken as a signal by other nations
that they are free to do the same. ``We don't want to encourage
greater protectionism abroad,'' he told Becker during the meeting
of the Export Council.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of Commerce William Daley; the U.S. trade
representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and the president's political
advisers have all urged more aggressive action, noting that layoffs
have already begun in the steel industry and warning that they
could spread elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gore, who is increasingly attentive to the demands of
both business and labor unions, warned a group of top European
executives that ``the United States cannot be the importer of only
resort'' for the world's ailing nations. The phrase has since been
repeated by others in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Daley has, characteristically, been blunter. Noting that imports
of Japanese-made hot-rolled steel, used for construction products,
had increased fivefold this year, he said on Friday that ``we
cannot sustain these rates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We alone cannot absorb all of Asia's imports,'' Daley added.
``We will not be the dumping ground for troubled economies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at Japan's trade surplus with nations outside
Asia,'' he said. ``It is almost three and a half times as large as
it was a year ago. This is a major source of instability. And such
instability _ caused by boatloads of cheap imports _ can lead to
political unrest, as people fear for their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Daley inched toward action: The Commerce Department
issued a ruling that allows the complaints of the steel industry
and unions to be heard on an expedited basis. Clinton noted that
decision in his speech Tuesday. The Commerce Department and the
International Trade Commission share authority for ruling on
whether dumping is taking place and for imposing compensatory
tariffs. Setting limits on imports would almost certainly violate
international trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, the president had not publicly discussed the
problem of rising imports from Asian or other troubled nations. In
fact, the administration had indirectly encouraged those imports:
Agreements between the International Monetary Fund and Indonesia,
Thailand and South Korea all assume significantly increased exports
by those countries, because their devalued currencies make their
goods less expensive abroad. The Treasury Department signed off on
all those accords after detailed study of their economic
assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the political costs of those accords are becoming
clear. The steel industry has been the first to scream, and the
loudest, but makers of auto parts, machine tools and semiconductors
are also complaining that foreign goods are being sold here at
prices below their production costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly an effort now to try to take pressure off
the U.S. market as the main buyers of Asian goods,'' C. Fred
Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in
Washington, said on Monday. Bergsten noted that the ``flood'' the
administration is now complaining about is only at its beginning
stages: Only in recent months have the Asian countries hit hardest
in the economic downturn begun to gear up their exports.
</P>
<P>
   Becker, the steelworkers' union leader, has been complaining
that the administration's response is too slow and cautious. ``The
crisis is here and now,'' he said late last week. ``The industry is
on the verge of a catastrophe that will almost certainly dwarf the
steel disasters of the '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent much of his speech Tuesday insisting that the
burden of reviving Asia falls on Japan, where he is scheduled to
visit next week after attending a meeting of Asian leaders in
Malaysia. The White House hinted Tuesday, however, that Clinton
might have to curtail or even cancel the trip, depending on the
showdown with Iraq over U.N. inspections.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate appearance in front of the export council, Ms.
Barshefsky expressed mounting frustration with China, which so far
has made no new proposals for market liberalizations that would
pave the way for its entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, and particularly during his trip to China,
Clinton and his aides have been upbeat about China. But Ms.
Barshefsky said China had been retreating on reforms and that its
bureaucrats had ``become somewhat more entrenched.'' To save their
own jobs at a time of government downsizing in Beijing, Ms.
Barshefsky said, ``they think it is wiser to take a hard line, to
say `no' to the United States.''

BRAZILIANS SCALE BACK PLEDGES TO CUT BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The Brazilian government, which
recently pledged to slash discretionary spending by $7 billion in
an urgent attempt to boost its economic credibility, has released
new budget figures that show the true reduction will run about half
the promised amount.
</P>
<P>
   Total spending would actually increase next year.
</P>
<P>
   The original spending cuts, announced two weeks ago, were part
of an anxiously awaited program to raise government revenues next
year by $23.5 billion, and represented Brazil's commitment to
fiscal house cleaning and to shrinking its dangerously high budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The package was crucial for Brazil to qualify for a backup loan
from the International Monetary Fund and other sources, including
the U.S. government, and to counter a $30 billion hemorrhage from
Brazil's foreign reserves, which have fallen to about $42 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is concerned that a default in Brazil
_ the world's ninth-largest economy and home to more than half of
South America's 300 million people _ could trigger repercussions
around Latin America, the destination of some 20 percent of U.S.
exports.
</P>
<P>
   With the IMF aid package expected to be announced within days,
the revised 1999 budget sent to Congress on Monday suggests that
Brazil may have overstated the level of actual government savings,
and it raised questions about the true size of the government's
effort.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Planning Minister Paulo Paiva and Martus Tavares, the
government's executive secretary, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   David Fleischer, a professor at the Federal University of
Brasilia and president of the Brazilian chapter of Transparency
International, said the spending cuts were designed to restore
confidence abroad with a show of discipline that is partly
illusion. ``Maybe about half the savings is real,'' Fleischer said.
``The other half is pre-packed fat. They stuffed it all in the
budget in late August.''
</P>
<P>
   The figure of $7 billion in budget cuts is not entirely without
foundation. But it is based on savings from a generous 1999 budget
that, from the moment it was released in August, was acknowledged
to be unrealistically optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The budget projected 4 percent economic expansion for 1999, just
after Brazil had doubled the ceiling on interest rates to almost 50
percent, to counter a $1 billion a day flight of dollar reserves
from the country after the Russian collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after it was released, the government conceded that the
economy, instead of growing, would shrink by 1 percent next year,
and some independent economists predict a more severe recession,
noting that high interest rates are choking off the supply of
capital for private industry.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to this year's spending, the government's budget for
next year shows some $3.8 billion in actual savings on
discretionary expenses, with the budget dropping to $29.8 billion.
The original budget for next year projected $36.4 billion on
discretionary expenses, which include a range of programs,
including land purchases for agrarian reform and to extend basic
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Brazilian government's overall budget, because of
court-ordered increases in salaries and benefits, will increase
$1.9 billion next year, to $154.2 billion, despite its claims to
austerity.
</P>
<P>
   Though some economists, like Paulo Rabello de Castro, of the
Rio-based Atlantic Institute, say they are confident that Brazil is
on the road to righting itself, they appear discouraged by its
current response to the crisis. Even before this week's details
appeared, economists criticized the Government for relying heavily
on taxes increases and pension dues to raise more than half the
promised revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is already
fighting skepticism abroad, after he announced another austerity
package a year ago, only to drop it as elections neared.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're in a situation like Brazil is in, you usually have
to do more than enough to win back confidence,'' Castro said.
``What came out of 1999 budget was slightly less than enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandre Barros, a political scientist and consultant in
Brasilia, said he believed the big question surrounding Brazil was
not so much the size of the cuts made now, but the government's
ability to sustain lean spending practices over time.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I want to see is down the road,'' Barros said. ``What
happens after three or six months as the immediate pressures
recede, and people say, `Okay, Mr. President, why don't you revoke
this or that austerity measure?'''

MCLAREN FITS RIGHT IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At the end of the workout, he rested on his knees at
the far end of the ice, sweating, panting, and looking spent.
However, Kyle McLaren more than survived his first practice of
1998-99 with the Bruins and was officially back in the fold. Coach
Pat Burns said the 21-year-old defenseman, who came to terms late
Monday night on a three-year contract, was good enough to jump
right into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins next play the Rangers Friday night, and barring
anything unforeseen, McLaren, who missed the first 15 games of the
year in a contract dispute, will be in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like another training camp starting over with
everybody in,'' said Burns, who in the last week welcomed back
Anson Carter and said goodbye to Ted Donato, who was traded to the
Islanders for mammoth forward Ken Belanger. ``We're certainly a lot
bigger, I noticed that. Ray Bourque looks like a little guy out
there. So, that's going to help us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good because management has made the commitment that they
want to win and the coaching staff has certainly made our
commitment. Now the players have to make the same commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren confessed to being a little tired after his workout at
the rink outside Boston. He had been skating with a junior team in
Rhode Island, but as both coach and player said, the pace just
isn't the same as the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they're working hard and they think they're in top
shape until they get a couple of these practices in and then the
reality sets in that they're not in as great a shape as they
thought they were,'' said Burns with a wicked grin. ``Skating at
their pace and skating at my pace are two different paces, that I
can assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   While McLaren is working on shaking off the rust, shaking off
his residual bitterness at the negotiations may not be as easy. He
took the difficult haggling very personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' he said, ``I've missed 15 games which I don't
think I should've missed. It could've easily been done in August or
early September but it dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to turn the page now. It's something I'll never
forget. It's tough, because it's the way they do business, it's the
way they've always done business, and I don't see it changing in
the future. I just hope when some younger guys come up like Joe
(Thornton) and (Sergei Samsonov), they don't have to go through
what I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frustrated. Each day goes by and you wonder if you're
doing the right thing. My options were limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they were nearly nonexistent. The IHL is no longer
accepting NHL holdouts, McLaren couldn't join Team Canada unless he
had the Bruins' permission (he didn't), and sitting out all year
would have been counterproductive to everyone's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either sign the deal or sit out, and I think it was a
time of my life where I had to choose between playing hockey and
not playing hockey,'' he said. ``I don't think it's the greatest
deal for me but it's satisfactory where I can get the job done here
and see what happens after the three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put in three years of good hockey and I wanted to be
rewarded. I didn't like the way they negotiated with me but I'm
going to turn the page and just play hockey. Right now, I'm a
little frustrated. I don't know why it didn't get done earlier. I
was just happy to be with the guys and the coaching staff. Right
now, I'm not worried about my contract, it's over, it's in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren resents the fact that other players, in his mind, were
taken care of better than he was by the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in need of offense at the beginning of the season so
they signed Jason (Allison),'' he said. ``They felt they could get
away without me and they have. I don't feel I'm giving in right
now, I feel like I'm accepting the best offer I could've gotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frustrated they were offering me insufficient numbers.
We battled for two months just to get it up a little bit, but
trying to squeeze blood out of a rock, it's hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, McLaren sees himself as a victim of his own
union's collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the first players that came out of the new CBA
where the middle (career) players have no rights,'' he said. ``I
knew that. But if you have three strong years, maybe you should
throw that out and just go by (the merit of) their years and (the
Bruins) didn't do that. They basically wanted to say I have no
rights and the leverage is in their hands and that's why I was
frustrated. Any players who have three good years should get
rewarded for it and I don't think I was. I'm for the NHLPA and what
they've done, but I don't like the fact that teams can say, `You've
got no rights.'''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren admitted to second guessing himself occasionally during
the lonely times he was sitting out while the team was playing.
But, ultimately, he trusted his gut instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I did the right thing,'' he said. ``I'll keep saying
it my whole career.''

ARMEY STILL STRUGGLING TO KEEP NO. 2 JOB IN HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 5th through 9th grafs for minor re-editing to clean up copy)  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dick Armey of Texas appeared to be ahead on
Tuesday in his struggle to keep his job as House majority leader,
the No. 2 leadership position, but a lingering dissatisfaction with
him and his two current opponents prompted rumors of a fourth
candidate's entering the race.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Reps. Steve Largent of Oklahoma and Jennifer Dunn of
Washington have entered the race for the leader's job, which
involves scheduling and managing floor votes.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers on Tuesday raised the possibility that Rep.
William Thomas of California, who sometimes supports abortion
rights, might be drawn in, but his aides said that he would have no
immediate announcement. Another possible candidate, Rep. Howard
McKeon of California, decided not to enter the race and threw his
support to Armey.
</P>
<P>
   The result of this uncertain battle, along with a contest over
the fourth-ranking position of chairman of the party caucus, a job
that includes spreading the party message, will determine the
public image the party presents in the House.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the campaigning seems based more on personal
ambition than on any carefully plotted ticket-balancing, a victory
for Armey would reflect a sense that the departure of Speaker Newt
Gingrich was enough of a change in top positions. An upset victory
by Largent would give the party a strikingly conservative cast
while te selection of Ms. Dunn would make her the highest-ranking
woman in congressional history and instantly send a new message
about the party that for nearly two decades has worried about its
relative lack of support from women.
</P>
<P>
   A victory in the race for the caucus leadership by Rep. J.C.
Watts of Oklahoma, the only black Republican member of Congress,
would send a comparable message for a party that got only 11
percent of black votes in last week's House elections. He is
challenging Rep. John Boehner of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, who currently holds the position of
majority whip, is unchallenged in his bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, now the presumptive speaker
pending two formal votes, met for more than an hour on Tuesday
afternoon with Gingrich, whom he forced from office with his
announcement Friday that he was challenging him. The two discussed
the transition of power to Livingston and covered such topics as
making sure that the 17 incoming freshmen Republicans were on board
with the leadership. Livingston called Gingrich ``a brilliant man''
and said he had been ``gracious'' in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the races for two of the leadership positions,
another big question mark in the House is who will replace
Livingston as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, one of the
two most important committees in the House. Republicans said that
Rep. C.W. Young of Florida, who is next in line because of
seniority and who is in the same conservative-pragmatist mold as
Livingston, would probably get the nod from the new Speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's supporters say he has more than 100 of the 112 votes
needed to secure re-election to his post but that they have had
difficulty in reaching embers who are on vacation and difficulty in
securing commitments over the telephone for what will be a
secret-ballot election on Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're almost at a majority, but you don't stop at 112, you
build in a cushion,'' said Michele Davis, Armey's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's opponents said his support was thin and could vanish in
the secret balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick here is trying to hold your votes til the end,'' Ms.
Dunn observed on CNN. Her aides said on Tuesday she had reached
nearly 100 members and was ``encouraged'' by what appeared to be
soft support for Armey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a head fake when I see one,'' Largent said in a
statement. The Hall of Fame football player asserted that Armey had
less than 40 votes. ``There is a huge block of undecided members.''
</P>
<P>
   What is keeping this race alive is the apparent dissatisfaction
with all three options. Armey is known for verbal gaffes that many
say have caused too much embarrassment to the party. Largent is
perceived as too hard-core conservative. Ms. Dunn is perceived as
having too mixed a record on abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the abortion debate were unhappy with her,
reflecting the difficulty for any politician in trying to take a
middle position on this most inflammatory of issues. An aide said
that in discussions on Tuesday, Ms. Dunn was discovering that her
abortion votes would be used as a ``litmus test'' in her race for
majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee gave her a positive rating
of 80 out of 100 this year. The National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League gave her a positive rating of 17. Still, that
was higher than the zero it gave to all the other candidates for
all the other leadership posts. Her 17 stemmed largely from her
support for family planning.

DRUGS KILL PAIN, INFLAMMATION WITHOUT CAUSING STOMACH PROBLEMS,
COMPANIES SAY
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two large drug companies say they have developed a new class of
drugs that can relieve pain and inflammation without the
gastrointestinal side effects of current drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, G.D. Searle and Co., a division of Monsanto Co.,
and Merck and Co. reported results of tests of the new drugs
Tuesday in San Diego at the annual meeting of the American College
of Rheumatology.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if the results will hold up in further
tests, or if the Food and Drug Administration will accept the
companies' claims for the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies said low doses of the new drugs appeared to be
as effective in relieving pain and inflammation as the highest
doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen and
dicolfenac. They reported that the new drugs, called cox-2
inhibitors, do so without causing stomach pain, bleeding or ulcers
_ the major side effects that thwart the use of the other
painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies have long sought to discover such drugs, which
would be an enormous boon to people who, like those with arthritis,
need to take painkillers daily.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs have generated enormous publicity as the companies and
some eager doctors have hailed them as the start of a new era both
for patients and for the drug's makers, who stand to profit greatly
if the companies' claims are proven.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting provided the first display of the companies'
results from large and long-term studies of cox-2 inhibitors. The
results have not yet been scrutinized independently by other
scientists. Yet the promise is tantalizing, the company officials
say, since ulcers and bleeding can be serious, even deadly, side
effects of current drugs.
</P>
<P>
   About 13 million Americans take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, according to data supplied by Merck. Of them, 76,000 are
hospitalized each year for ulcers caused by the drugs, and about
7,600 die from those ulcers. About one in three people who take the
drugs for long periods end up with gastrointestinal bleeding. The
large studies have found no such complications with the new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Searle, which is based in Skokie, Ill., presented data Tuesday
from a 12-week study of 1,004 patients with osteoarthritis who were
randomly assigned to take one of three doses of its drug,
celecoxib, or the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug naproxen or a
placebo. The two highest doses of celecoxib were as effective as
naproxen in relieving pain and inflammation, the company reported,
but those taking the new drug had no more gastrointestinal side
effects than those taking the placebo.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, an advisory committee to the FDA will decide whether
to recommend that Searle's drug be approved for treating arthritis
patients. Merck, of Whitehouse Station, N.J., said it would send
its marketing application to the FDA by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For now, scientists are finding themselves in a sort of
equipoise. Some are daring to hope that a new age is dawning while
others are cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be hyperbolic,'' said Dr. Lawrence J. Marnett,
associate director of the cancer center at Vanderbilt University
and a consultant to Monsanto, which is based in St. Louis, ``but I
think it's going to be revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Michael Lockshin, an arthritis expert who is director of
the Barbara Volcker Center at Cornell University's medical school
in New York City, is less comfortable making predictions. ``I'm
looking at this with a stand-back-and-see-where-it-goes attitude,''
he said. ``I'm just not standing here with my tongue hanging out
waiting for these drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. James R. O'Dell, chairman of the rheumatology department
at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, warned that
cox-2 inhibitors were not miracle drugs as safe as placebos.
Aspirin and similar drugs, for example, can decrease blood flow to
the kidney. ``That problem may be lessened but may not be
eliminated with cox-2 inhibitors,'' he said.

UNDATED: he said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story of the cox-2 inhibitors began about a decade ago in
three separate university laboratories, where scientists were
concerned with basic questions about cell biology and tumor growth.
All had the same aim _ to find proteins produced by cancer cells
but not by normal cells. And each lab independently came up with
the same surprising discovery: an enzyme called cyclooxygenase that
appeared whenever cells became cancerous or began proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   To the scientists, cyclooxygenase was not new. It was made all
the time, in virtually every cell, and it was blocked by aspirin
and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. But here was
something they did not know: A different cyclooxygenase,
abbreviated cox, that was only made when cells were growing, which
occurs during inflammation. Because aspirin blocks inflammation and
also causes bleeding _ an effect that has nothing to do with cell
growth _ all three scientists had the same reaction. ``I
immediately thought that this is telling us something very exciting
about aspirin and aspirin-like drugs,'' said Dr. Daniel L. Simmons,
director of the Cancer Research Center at Brigham Young University
in Provo, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   It meant, Simmons and the other discoverers of the enzyme
realized, that aspirin and similar drugs might be blocking both
cyclooxygenases. And if there were a drug that blocked just one of
the enzymes, the one that is made in growing cells, if might soothe
pain and inflammation, caused by the proliferation of white blood
cells of the immune system, without causing bleeding problems and
ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Simmons and the directors of the other two research
groups, Dr. Harvey R. Herschman, the director for basic research at
the cancer center at the University of California in Los Angeles,
and Dr. Donald A. Young, a biochemist at the University of
Rochester, were basic scientists, not drug developers. Drug
companies, however, rushed to the scene as soon as they learned
what had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto learned about Dr. Simmons' work by sheer coincidence,
at a seminar. Simmons was then invited to the company on April 15,
and two weeks later, Simmons gave Monsanto his cox-2 materials. In
return, Simmons said, he sought and received a two-year, $100,000
research grant from Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Merck's scientists got started almost a year later, also
learning about cox-2 by happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bennett Shapiro, director of the company's basic research,
met the discoverers of cox-2 at a small scientific meeting that he
had considered skipping. Once he heard their discovery, Shapiro was
stunned. He went back to Merck where, he recalled, ``I said, `I
really think we ought to hit this hard.'''
</P>
<P>
   By summer, 150 scientists, virtually the entire laboratory at a
Merck research center in Montreal, were doing nothing else but
looking for drugs that most efficiently blocked cox-2.
</P>
<P>
   In record time, Searle and Merck began testing their drugs in
patients with arthritis. Shapiro said the speedy time from
laboratory to the FDA, six and a half years, was all but
unprecedented. By contrast, Shapiro said, the Merck laboratory that
took on the cox-2 project had spent 20 years on its previous
project, which culminated in the development and marketing of an
asthma drug.
</P>
<P>
   While the cox-2 studies were under way, the companies realized
that they might have more than just an arthritis drug on their
hands. ``Several bombshells hit the scientific world,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   First was the observation that people who take nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs have about half the incidence of colon
cancer as those who do not take the drugs. The cox-2 inhibitors may
be just as effective as aspirin or similar drugs, said Dr. Raymond
N. DuBois of Vanderbilt. In 1993, he found that 85 percent of colon
cancer tumors had ramped up their production of cox-2. Merck and
Monsanto are now starting studies to see if cox-2 inhibitors can
prevent colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies found that there was less Alzheimer's disease in
people who took nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Merck and
Monsanto said they were also starting studies to determine if the
drugs could prevent that disease.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Young said, there is hope that cox-2 can prevent
the breakdown of bone that occurs in osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``These would be some of the most exciting drugs of the century
if it all works out,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, O'Dell cautioned, all that can be said is that the new
drugs are as effective in alleviating pain and inflammation in
arthritis patients as the existing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, but safer.

STOCKS SLIP FOR 2ND STRAIGHT SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks slipped again Tuesday, as sellers emerged late
in the day to push prices down for a second straight session.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and analysts cited a variety of reasons for the selloff.
There is continuing concern about a slowdown in the growth of
corporate earnings. Doubt persists that the Federal Reserve's
policy-making committee will cut interest rates at a meeting Nov.
17. Renewed weakness in Asian markets, as well as heightened
awareness that hostilities may soon break out again in Iraq,
increased the jitters. And after rocketing higher for eight
straight sessions, the market apparently still needed a breather.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a continuation of the consolidation that started on
Monday,'' said Marshall Acuff, an equity strategist at Salomon
Smith Barney. ``Our market has come a long way _ it got some
support early in the session but then faded at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 33.98 points, to close at
8,863.98. More than 669.7 million shares were traded on the New
York Stock Exchange, up from slightly less than 600 million Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market measures, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index slipped 1.94 points, to 1,128.26. The Russell 2000 index of
small capitalization stocks fell 1.57 points, to 396.86. But the
Nasdaq composite index, aided by gains in several Internet stocks
and Intel, the big semiconductor manufacturer, rose by 4.57 points,
to 1,865.62.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was hurt by continued weakness in oil and financial
company stocks. Shares of J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. fell again Tuesday,
losing 2 1/2, to 97 5/8. American Express slid 2 1/8 to 92 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron and Exxon, also Dow components, weakened as well.
Chevron lost 1 15/16 a share, to 80 1/2. Exxon fell 1 11/16, to 70
5/16.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont, the nation's biggest chemical company, was the Dow's
biggest loser. The stock fell 2 3/4, to 59 1/4, after BASF AG,
Europe's biggest chemical maker, said that its business in the
third quarter fell short of expectations, with little prospect for
improvement this year.
</P>
<P>
   The declines in those stocks more than offset strong
performances from IBM and McDonald's, other Dow components.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a wave of optimism about computer sales, IBM hit an
all-time high Tuesday, rising 3 15/16 a share, to 155 5/16.
McDonald's rose 4 1/8, to 71 3/16, after the company told analysts
that sales are improving here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares were broadly higher, and were helped in no
small measure by wild, nearly manic buying of Internet stocks. For
the second straight day, stocks in companies like Yahoo and Ebay
rallied on speculation that holiday shopping using the Internet
will jump.
</P>
<P>
   Online companies represented half of Tuesday's top 20
most-active issues. Yahoo shares rose 11 13/16, to 176 9/16.
Amazon.com rose 4 7/8, to 131 3/4. And Ebay, an online auctioneer
that went public in mid-September at $18 a share, gained 27 7/8 a
share, to 130 7/8, after analysts at Goldman Sachs, the firm that
led its initial public offering, raised their target price to $150
a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of retail interest in the stocks, and some
foreign money is going into them, because we have been active in
them,'' said Ed Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities. ``It's
almost like a feeding frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism about the upcoming Christmas season also helped to push
up Intel shares 1 9/16, to 97 9/16. After the market closed, the
company said that fourth-quarter results would exceed expectations.

AN A-LIST WRITER, MINUS THE ATTITUDE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Ask a studio mogul, top producer or agent for the
names of the superior screenwriters in Hollywood, and Steven
Zaillian will be near the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the two or three best screenwriters in town, and
I'm being liberal when I say that,'' said Joe Roth, chairman of
Walt Disney Studios, which made ``A Civil Action,'' the newest film
written and directed by Zaillian. ``There's an economy and clarity
to his writing that's always entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaillian, who won an Academy Award for his adaptation of
``Schindler's List,'' is a surprisingly diffident, almost modest
and entirely un-Hollywood figure. In contrast to other
screenwriters, who may earn lavish sums but complain all the way to
the bank about their plight at the hands of producers, stars and
executives, Zaillian, 45, shrugs off any problems he has faced over
his 18-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I've been lucky,'' he said one recent morning as he sat
drinking coffee on the patio of a house in Mandeville Canyon where
he and his small staff were editing ``A Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, not every script I've worked on has turned out the way
I've wanted them to turn out,'' added Zaillian. His screenplay for
``Awakenings'' (1990) earned him an Academy Award nomination, and
he also wrote such films as ``The Falcon and the Snowman,''
``Mission Impossible'' and ``Clear and President Danger.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he went on, ``If you're going to write and not control it
then, somehow, you've got to expect that sometimes it's going to
turn out different than you thought. Sometimes worse. And sometimes
better, if the director is, like, really good and brings something
to it,'' Zaillian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action,'' adapted by Zaillian from the Jonathan Harr
nonfiction legal drama that was on The New York Times best-seller
list for two years, opens in New York and Los Angeles on Dec. 25,
in order to qualify for Academy Award nominations, and then will
open nationwide in January.
</P>
<P>
   The movie deals with an eight-year fight by working-class
families in Woburn, Mass., who claimed that two large corporations
had contaminated their town's drinking water with chemicals,
causing the deaths of five children and one adult.
</P>
<P>
   The central figure in the film is Jan Schlichtmann, a
self-possessed personal injury lawyer who becomes consumed with the
case at the cost of virtually everything else in his life. The film
stars John Travolta as the lawyer and Robert Duvall as his highly
skilled adversary. Also in the cast are William H. Macy, Tony
Shalhoub, Zeljko Ivanek, Kathleen Quinlan, John Lithgow, Sydney
Pollack and Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   Zaillian said he had first read the book, in manuscript form,
when one of the producers, Rachel Pfeffer, sent it to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if it would make a movie at all,'' he said. ``I
had to write the script to see if I could make sense of what was
1,200 pages of manuscript. It was a wonderful book, but what was
troubling about it for a movie was the sheer length of it, the
number of characters, and it wasn't a whodunit. It was more about
the process of the law _ and is that dramatic?''
</P>
<P>
   Zaillian smiled. ``Also, there was the fact that everybody
loses, at least on the face of it,'' he said. ``That's not usually
the typical movie fare. It's a tragedy. I mean, that was the thing
that we all had to keep in mind. I mean, it's really kind of
remarkable that the studio let us do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaillian said he had handled the adaptation much the way he had
dealt with ``Schindler's List,'' the Thomas Keneally novel based on
the Holocaust. For both screenplays he rigorously concentrated on
the main character and avoided the pitfalls of trying to tackle the
enormity of the historical circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Schindler's List,'' for example, about a German profiteer
who saves the lives of more than 1,000 Jews during World War II,
Zaillian would have been overwhelmed as a screenwriter if he had
decided to take on the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to focus on Schindler, and Schindler alone, and
imagine events almost entirely through his eyes,'' Zaillian said.
``It's such an imposing subject that you can be overwhelmed by
trying to tell too much of it and having too many angles on it. The
point was to follow him, just follow him, stick with him, and what
he learns about the subject, you learn. The same is true of this
one.''
</P>
<P>
   In shaping the script for ``A Civil Action,'' Zaillian said, the
environmental drama and the legal story, and even the human
tragedies, were secondary to the story of one man's obsession with
the case. ``It's ultimately his story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zaillian is far more ambivalent about directing than
screenwriting. His directorial debut, in August 1993, was a gentle
family drama with an unfortunate title, ``Searching for Bobby
Fischer,'' which was far less about chess than about a family's
relationships.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Few films opened that summer with higher critical praise, but it
proved a box-office disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Zaillian shrugged. ``Sure, it's a bit depressing,'' he said.
``It's sort of like you work really hard on something for a long
time and it lasts two or three weeks and you think, `I'm going to
kill myself.' It's too much work not to have people see it,
although the funny thing about `Bobby Fischer' is, almost everybody
I meet has seen it, and not just people in the industry. Maybe it's
the bargain matinee. Maybe it's the video.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the sheer difficulty of being a director had surprised
him, and that was why it took him so long to take over another
project. ``I wasn't prepared for how hard it was _ I was spoiled by
the life style of a writer,'' he said. ``Being a director you face
the pressure, the hours, the staying focused for six straight
months or much longer on one thing, just so focused with a lot of
money being spent. It took a lot out of me, and I didn't want to do
it again. I just wanted to write a couple of scripts after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaillian does not see screenwriting as something to be taught
with specific rules. ``It's the same as any other kind of writing:
it just has to be good, the ideas have to be clear and the writer
has to convey them in a way that's interesting, and it doesn't
matter whether it's a screenplay or novel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he is loath to analyze what makes a great screenplay. ``You
hear about these books and courses on screenwriting,'' he said.
``On page 20 something has to happen. The character arc and all
that stuff. I have no idea. I don't think about those things. Every
time I do it, it feels like the first time and I'm scared and I
don't know if it's going to turn out. And if I get to page 50 or so
and I'm not enjoying it, then I know it's not working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone of the movie is the magic thing for me,'' he said.
``That's like the big battle. The tone and the voices and how
people sound. The level of realism. That's what matters to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rudin, one of the producers of ``A Civil Action,'' said of
him: ``There's not one wasted moment in the way he tells a story.
And there's a compassionate strain in his writing that most people
don't come close to. The way he directs is exactly the way he
writes. It's about the accumulation of detail; it's very
methodical, very empathetic and very compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaillian, who is married and has two sons, grew up in Los
Angeles. His father, Jim Zaillian, who died in 1980, was a radio
news reporter. After he graduated from San Francisco State
University in 1975, an interest in making documentaries led him to
a series of low-level film editing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Then a script he wrote in 1979 called ``Bad Manners,'' about
high school boys in the late 1960s, caught the attention of Ray
Stark's producing company. Soon, Zaillian was being hired to write
scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time I wouldn't call myself a writer, it was so
hard to say the word,'' he recalled. ``I would say, `I write.' But
I didn't consider myself a writer until I did three or four. I kept
thinking it was going to end and it wouldn't last.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his unfortunate experiences, Zaillian said without
hesitation, ``Jack the Bear.'' This strange 1993 comedy-drama
starring Danny DeVito was about the unraveling of a television
horror show host whose psychopathic neighbor poses a threat to
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``People got hired and it just got taken away from me,'' he
said. ``I don't want to bad-mouth anybody; these things happen. But
it so upset me that I said to Scott Rudin, who I've known for a
long time, `I want to do this again, write another thing about
kids, but do it right.' And that's how `Bobby Fischer' happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being relatively modest, Zaillian is also surprisingly
loyal, at least by Hollywood standards. Although any of the major
talent agencies would welcome the high-priced Zaillian as a client,
he has remained loyal to Harold Greene, his first agent, who is now
in his mid-80s and who runs a one-man agency in Marina del Ray,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm missing something, I don't know what it is,'' Zaillian
said, smiling: ``I always think I'm working on the best things that
are being done out there. I haven't worked on anything because I
needed the money or done something that I didn't believe in.''

CONSERVATIVES BREAK AWAY FROM SOUTHERN BAPTISTS IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a new sign of fracturing within the nation's largest
Protestant denomination, Southern Baptists in Texas split on
Tuesday when a group of strict theological conservatives voted to
break away from the state's established Southern Baptist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The vote by the conservative group, to separate from the Baptist
General Convention of Texas, marked the second time in two years
that a state organization within the 16-million-member Southern
Baptist Convention had ruptured, a result of a two-decade-old
struggle between conservative and moderate Baptists over
differences in how to interpret the Bible and what stands to take
on certain social issues.
</P>
<P>
   The new organization, the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention,
was created by several hundred conservative Baptists who met at a
Houston church on Tuesday and voted for a constitution and
officers, said the Rev. Gerald Smith, the organization's treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, a conservative group pulled out of the
Baptist General Association of Virginia, creating two bodies in
that state that are both affiliated with the Southern Baptist
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the break in Texas is considerably more significant. The
state's established Baptist organization, the 2.7-million-member
Baptist General Convention of Texas, is the largest state
organization within the Southern Baptist Convention. In fact, it
has more members than several major Protestant denominations,
including the Episcopalian.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Leonard, a church historian who is dean of Wake Forest
Divinity School, said the conservatives' decision would register as
``an 8.5 on the ecclesiastical Richter scale'' among Baptists. The
vote, he said, was ``another piece in the redefining and realigning
of the Southern Baptist system.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives' decision does little for now, however, to
weaken the older Texas Baptist organization. Those who voted to
create the new organization represented about 150 congregations,
said people who were present, and adopted a $903,000 budget for
1999. In contrast, the General Convention claims 5,700 affiliated
congregations and, at its own annual meeting in Houston on Tuesday,
adopted a $50-million budget.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, conservatives undertook a successful effort to gain
control of the Southern Baptist Convention, which is based in
Nashville, Tenn. But some of the autonomous Baptist state
organizations, that of Texas in particular, have remained in
moderate hands.
</P>
<P>
   Although many other Protestants might regard the two factions as
broadly similar in theological and social outlook, Baptists have
been acutely aware of what separates conservatives from moderates.
In recent years, moderates have begun founding their own
seminaries, accusing conservatives of purging moderate professors
from the denomination's six established seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   A central disagreement between the two factions turns on whether
Scripture ought to be considered ``inerrant,'' literally true on a
religious, historical and scientific basis, as conservatives
insist, or whether its interpretation is ultimately up to the
believer, as moderates hold. Leaders of the two groups have also
clashed over church-state issues like prayer in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before the conservatives' vote on Tuesday, the
Rev. Ronnie H. Yarber, administrative director of the group, said
they were concerned that some state Baptist organizations were
``distancing themselves from the national Baptist convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarber also said the conservatives' decision to create their own
organization had been prompted by differences over the Bible and a
desire among conservatives to make clear a strong stand against
homosexuality, legalized abortion and the ordination of women as
pastors. He said conservatives believed that the General Convention
of Texas had taken a ``very weak'' stand against an Austin
congregation that ordained a homosexual man as a deacon this year.
</P>
<P>
   The General Convention formally disassociated itself from that
congregation by refusing to receive its financial contributions and
ordering it not to use the convention's logo on the congregation's
literature.
</P>
<P>
   As for abortion, the General Convention adopted a resolution
last year condemning so-called partial-birth abortion. But the
conservatives insist on a position opposing all abortion except to
save the life of a pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   Before the conservatives' move on Tuesday, the General
Convention issued a statement saying it remained loyal to the
Southern Baptist Convention, welcomed leaders of differing views
and contributed more money than any other state organization to the
denomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``History indicates that a separate convention results in
confusion and conflict,'' the General Convention's statement said.
``Attention and energy would be diverted from evangelism, missions
and ministry.''

CONSERVATIVES BREAK AWAY FROM SOUTHERN BAPTISTS IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.)

<P>
   In a new sign of fracturing within the nation's largest
Protestant denomination, Southern Baptists in Texas split Tuesday
when a group of strict theological conservatives voted to break
away from the state's established Southern Baptist organization,
the Baptist General Convention of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The vote marked the second time in two years that a state
organization in the 16-million-member Southern Baptist Convention
had ruptured, a result of a decades-old struggle between
conservative and moderate Baptists over differences in how to
interpret the Bible and what stands to take on certain social
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The new organization, the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention,
was created by several hundred conservatives at a Houston church
Tuesday, said the Rev. Gerald Smith, the organization's treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, a conservative group pulled out of the
Baptist General Association of Virginia, creating two bodies in
that state.
</P>
<P>
   But the break in Texas is more significant. The state's
established Baptist organization, the 2.7-million-member Baptist
General Convention of Texas, is the largest state organization
within the Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives' decision does little for now, however, to
weaken the older Texas Baptist organization. Those who created the
new organization represented about 150 congregations, said people
who were present, and adopted a $903,000 budget for 1999. In
contrast, the General Convention claims 5,700 affiliated
congregations and, at its own annual meeting in Houston Tuesday,
adopted a $50-million budget.

MARKET PLACE: CROWDED FIELD AT BRISTOL-MYERS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., long known for its
well-mannered culture, may soon see a battle royal for its top
office.
</P>
<P>
   In a move intended to give several top managers more
responsibilities, Bristol-Myers announced a series of high-level
executive appointments Tuesday that immediately raised questions on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   There is no clear line of succession at Bristol-Myers, though
Charles Heimbold Jr., chairman and chief executive, plans to retire
in 2001, and Kenneth Weg, the company's executive vice president,
plans to leave a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement not only failed to answer the succession
question, but also appeared to create a race among several
Bristol-Myers executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does look like there is no heir apparent,'' said David
Saks, a managing director at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``What Heimbold is doing
is raising a lot of people's titles, giving them more
responsibility and then letting the field sort itself out for the
chief executive's job.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the Kentucky Derby, this race is a crowded field. The new
responsibilities are effective Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hayden Jr., who was president of the intercontinental,
worldwide pharmaceuticals group, was named president of the
company's worldwide medicines group. Richard Lane, president of
U.S. medicines, will assume new responsibilities for worldwide
franchise management and for the consumer medicines businesses in
this country and Japan. Christine Poon, one of the highest-ranking
women in the pharmaceuticals industry, who was president of the
medical devices group, will become president of international
medicines, reporting to Hayden.
</P>
<P>
   John McGoldrick, the company's general counsel, was also named
president of the medical devices group. And Michael Mee, chief
financial officer, will assume additional responsibilities for
global business services.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were quick to peg Hayden, McGoldrick and Mee as
front-runners, with disclaimers attached to each. At 42, Hayden is
young to run such a large company, but his pharmaceutical position
may be preferred by the board.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say McGoldrick has a bad assignment because Wall Street
has frequently prodded the company to sell the medical devices
group. Adding to the odds against McGoldrick and Mee, analysts say,
are their reputations for being confrontational, unusual for
Bristol-Myers' genteel ranks.
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street will keep a close watch, Heimbold is not
amused by the mention of an executive race for his job. He
contended that he was merely giving his executives an opportunity
to gain more experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``These executive changes are one way for us to increase our
growth rate and shareholder value,'' Heimbold said. ``We do focus
on competitive superiority. But our goal is to beat our
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The naming of Heimbold's successor may become more exciting than
expected. Analysts noted that Bristol-Myers has no mandatory
retirement age for its chairman, which would allow Heimbold to
remain in the post longer than expected. Heimbold said Tuesday that
he would not leave the company until a successor was in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``A race of this kind is good for the company and good for the
shareholders,'' Saks said. ``At least we know everyone who is
involved will be working a little harder.''

THE HOLLYWOOD FORECAST: A SIX-WEEK BLIZZARD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 15) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The holiday season is a scary time in Hollywood.
``Am I nervous? Is the sun going to come out tomorrow?'' said
Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Dreamworks partner who has overseen ``The
Prince of Egypt,'' the animated biblical musical opening Dec. 18.
``I'm not quite panicked yet, but that'll come, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment put it somewhat more
bluntly. ``It's nerve-racking,'' said William Mechanic, whose
studio is releasing ``The Thin Red Line,'' a big-budget World War
II drama directed by Terrence Malick, on Dec. 25. ``Everyone else
is having a good time and you're wondering whether you'll die or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic will, in all probability, survive the holidays. So will
Katzenberg. But setting aside Hollywood hyperbole, the season that
begins just before Thanksgiving and ends with the New Year is not
only the busiest time of moviegoing in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It's also when studios and independent companies roll the dice
and release films whose box office tally can spell the difference
between success or failure for the year. (The nearly 100 films
released over the next six weeks will account for as much as 20
percent of the 1998 box office).
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this mean that some pictures that really deserve an
audience will get hurt in this brief period of time?'' said Sherry
Lansing, the chairman of Paramount. ``Of course it does. It not
only makes me absolutely nervous; it saddens me.''
</P>
<P>
   But ask a top studio executive or producer to define a holiday
film and the responses are blurry. A feel-good movie. A women's
film. A children's comedy. An Academy Award contender released just
before the end of the year so voters can easily recall the film at
nomination time early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as a holiday film because moviegoers
come in all sizes and shapes,'' insisted Joe Roth, the chairman of
Walt Disney Studios, whose slate over the Thanksgiving-Christmas
period underscored his point.
</P>
<P>
   That studio is releasing ``I'll Be Home for Christmas,'' a
Jonathan Taylor Thomas pre-teen-age film whose title alone
guarantees a holiday release; ``Enemy of the State,'' a splashy
Tony Scott-directed drama with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, being
issued because it's one of the few films for action audiences over
the holidays and two movies for families, a remake of ``Mighty Joe
Young,'' with Bill Paxton, and ``A Bug's Life,'' an animated film
by the computer whizzes who created the hit ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's an Academy Award hopeful, ``A Civil Action,''
adapted and directed by Steven Zaillian from the nonfiction best
seller by Jonathan Harr. The drama stars John Travolta as a lawyer
obsessed with proving two corporations responsible for the leukemia
deaths of five children and one adult in Woburn, Mass. The film
will have a limited release on Dec. 25, to qualify it for Oscar
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   What are Roth's concerns about the holidays?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm critical of all of us,'' he said. ``We end up putting too
many movies aimed at women over 30 into this season, year in and
year out, when women in fact are the least available moviegoers.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom in Hollywood is that in the
pre-Christmas rush of shopping and family activities, women have no
time to see movies. That changes on Christmas Day and in the week
that follows.
</P>
<P>
   Among the loosely defined women's films due this year are such
expensive comedies as Nora Ephron's ``You've Got Mail,'' about an
online romance between Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   There are also several comedy-dramas: one is ``Stepmom,''
directed by Chris Columbus, in which Susan Sarandon plays a
divorced mother with cancer who forms a bond with her ex-husband's
girlfriend, played by Julia Roberts. Another is ``Meet Joe Black,''
inspired by the 1934 classic, ``Death Takes a Holiday.'' Directed
by Martin Brest, the three-hour film stars Brad Pitt and Anthony
Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   Even more competitive are the animated films, notably ``The
Prince of Egypt,'' a direct challenge to Disney's hegemony in
animation _ and a sign of the intense competition between
Katzenberg and his former boss, Michael Eisner, the Disney chairman
who ousted him.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg said the idea for ``The Prince of Egypt'' came during
discussions with Steven Spielberg, another Dreamworks partner,
while the company was being formed. ``I said I'd love to do a story
in animation like `Indiana Jones,' a big action story, or a
science-fiction film like `Terminator,' a film with grandeur and
spectacle,'' recalled Katzenberg. ``And Steven said, `Why don't you
do the Ten Commandments?' I looked at him for a half-second,
blinked and said, `Great idea.'''
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``A Bug's Life'' and ``The Prince of Egypt,'' the other
large-scale animated film is ``The Rugrats Movie,'' opening Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Albie Hecht, president of film and television entertainment at
Nickelodeon, said there was no question about when to release the
Rugrats film. ``We are really differentiated from the competition
because we deal with contemporary family issues like sibling
rivalry and loyalty and friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the plethora of animated and women's films _ and
movies in both those genres will succeed only if families and
couples show up too _ the studios also shoot for unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Miramax surprised Hollywood by releasing a
teen-age horror film, ``Scream,'' just before Christmas. Until
then, it had been unthinkable for a company to distribute a scary
movie at a time of good cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ridiculed for putting it out over Christmas,'' said
Mark Gill, who runs the Los Angeles office of Miramax. ``What they
didn't understand is that people under the age of 25 want a little
nihilism and attitude over Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The nihilism and attitude award this year goes to ``Psycho,''
Gus Van Sant's remake of the Alfred Hitchcock classic. Vince Vaughn
is Norman Bates (the Anthony Perkins role) and Anne Heche steps
into the shower in the Janet Leigh part.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Grazer, one of Hollywood's most successful producers, who
decided to remake ``Psycho,'' said the film was opening before
Christmas (on Dec. 4) mostly because there was no comparable film
around. ``It's so much about differentiation. It's neither an Oscar
movie, like some of the others, nor a real soft `I love you
movie.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for those Oscar movies, in addition to ``The Thin Red Line''
and ``A Civil Action,'' the hopefuls include ``Patch Adams,''
directed by Tom Shadyac, in which Robin Williams plays a medical
student who discovers the healing power of humor, and Sam Raimi's
``A Simple Plan,'' a dark drama based on Scott Smith's novel about
two brothers who find a downed plane loaded with $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, ``Elizabeth,'' a lavish costume drama starring Cate
Blanchett as the English Queen who took the throne in 1558, will
expand its release around Thanksgiving to seek Academy Awards
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax has been especially successful opening films late in the
year _ ``The English Patient,'' ``The Piano'' and ``Good Will
Hunting'' _ and turning them into Oscar contenders. This year the
company has hopes for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a comedy-drama with
Gwyneth Paltrow, and ``Little Voice,'' a poignant comedy with Jane
Horrocks and Michael Caine.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, the Miramax executive, said that busy as studios are
preparing for the holiday rush, everyone is looking ahead. Far
ahead. ``Studios are already setting up their Thanksgiving and
Christmas for (italics)next(end italics) year,'' he said. ``We have
`Scream 3' coming out in the holiday season, 1999. And I hear
there's a new James Bond film.''

 &HT;    FSU understudy under pressure
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke

<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Don't start changing the Rooster's nickname
to ``After,'' coach Bobby Bowden pleads, but yes, if you must know,
Marcus Outzen was recruited as an afterthought, a backup, a bit
role player.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, that's the same guy now quarterbacking the fifth-ranked
Florida State Seminoles, whose chance at playing for a national
title shot up last week when Ohio State lost and then faltered with
starter Chris Weinke's season-ending neck injury. They face Wake
Forest on Saturday and Florida next week.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, 26, will have neck surgery Friday to remove a bone chip
and repair a herniated disk sustained Saturday against Virginia.
The sophomore, who probably won't return before August, is
disappointed but confident in his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Marcus is going to be nervous. He's going to be
playing in the two biggest games of his life,'' Weinke said. ``But
just because I'm leaving, this is not a decline for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   FSU's receivers and tailbacks are healthy, strong and talented,
and its defense ranks No. 1 in the nation. But Florida State teams
center around their quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Make that their starting quarterbacks. Outzen, 20, was recruited
in 1995 from Fort Walton Beach, specifically for emergencies and to
finish off games already won.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we needed another quarterback, not a Weinke or a
(Danny) Kanell,'' Bowden said. ``You've got to have a backup
quarterback. You've got to have a third-team quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was promoted from third-team to backup when Dan Kendra
sustained a season-ending knee injury in spring practice, then
moved to fullback.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen wasn't surprised by that. Before his shoulder injury in
the spring, Outzen had been challenging Weinke for the No. 2
position, and he had always believed he would get a chance to
really play and display his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``His dream was always to get to go to Florida State,'' said
Joey Rankin, his high school coach. ``He's just the kind of guy
that's determined enough do it. He wanted to keep at it until he
got it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he still fought frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, he thought briefly about transferring because of the
long list of players ahead of him. At the time, the quarterback
order expected this year was: starter Kendra, codger Weinke and
afterthought Outzen. Then, freshman Jared Jones, the team's third
high school Parade All-America, signed on in February and the only
quarterback definitely behind Outzen was walk-on Rich Maher.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin, who hasn't talked to Outzen yet this week, encouraged
him last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, 'Keep your head up and keep working,' `` Rankin
said. `` `You've got to realize that at Florida State, especially,
quarterbacks sometimes don't get to play their first couple of
years.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Outzen persisted by remembering his relative youth (redshirt
sophomore this year) and why he chose Florida State over Auburn,
South Carolina and the other schools that recruited him.
</P>
<P>
   That was because he had grown up a Seminoles fan. His father, a
real estate agent in Destin, had taken him to his first games when
he was 9. He had his picture taken with Bowden at a boosters dinner
as a child. Bowden says he's known Outzen ``ever since he was a
baby, nearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches knew they needed a backup in 1996, partly because they
had too many star quarterbacks to get another. They pursued Outzen,
Spencer Romine of Alabama (now at Duke) and Ben Leard of Georgia
(now at Auburn).
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt, looking at those three, that Outzen was a Florida boy
and we liked him as much as we did any of the others,'' Bowden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly resounding words of praise, but Outzen took the
scholarship and Bowden has been pleased with him. He compared him
to Weegie Thompson, an NFL receiver who started as an FSU
quarterback. Like Thompson, Outzen primarily ran the ball in high
school, making it hard for coaches to judge his passing ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he throws better than we thought,'' Bowden said. ``I like
him. He's got some confidence about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden encouraged Outzen to stay last year and then saw him
improve during the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that made him realize he could play and no matter how
good Kendra was or Weinke was, he still might could beat them
out,'' Bowden said. ``He stayed with it and I'm glad.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Outzen. Now that he owns the starting job, he needs to
grow in confidence and become one of the team's strongest voices.
``It's something I've always dreamed about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will not step into the exact spot Weinke left. Outzen runs
better than Weinke so coaches will try to take advantage of that.
His range probably isn't quite as far so coaches will try to work
around that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a whole lot of changes (in the offense),''
offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Mark Richt said.
``We'll certainly have to let Marcus play ball a little bit more
than we did (Saturday) and have him pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference will be Outzen's inexperience. Even
Weinke, a former professional baseball player, needed several weeks
and a simplified offense to feel comfortable leading the Seminoles'
high-power passing game. Weinke's favorite target, however, isn't
worried about the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did better than I thought he was going to do,'' receiver
Peter Warrick said. ``He's got to make the big plays now. And maybe
we just have to hit short routes and make something out of
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches also were calm and hopeful, emphasizing that the offense
already relies on the run to some degree (36 percent of offensive
yards) and has successfully adapted to one inexperienced
quarterback. With Florida looming, though, Outzen knows he has a
lot to live up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wake is not the same caliber as Florida and I don't know if
we've ever had a quarterback go in to play UF with just one
start,'' Outzen said. ``The experience factor is a big deal when
you're playing someone like UF.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, on Sunday at least, wasn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel bad about him at all,'' Bowden said. ``To me,
he's already passed the test.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Noteworthy: Sophomore free safety Shawn McCorkel, who was
suspended from Florida State's football team indefinently last
week, will have a hearing on Wednesday in Ala. regarding his DUI
charges, Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkel will not play this weekend, but his future with the
team depends on the outcome of his hearing.

REPORT CALLS ON DOCTORAL PROGRAMS TO FOCUS ON JOBS
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Graduate students working on Ph.D.s know that getting a job
after graduation will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty who teach the graduate students say the Ph.D.s often
wind up underemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Association of American Universities, a group that
represents 62 leading universities, is acknowledging the problem
and calling on its members to look at their graduates' job
prospects more carefully and change their programs if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report, a committee of the Association of American
Universities defends the number of Ph.D.s as useful to society, but
calls on its member institutions to better track employment of
graduates and better prepare students for a range of careers.
</P>
<P>
   The study represents an acknowledgment by elite institutions
that they should take more responsibility for all of their
graduates, not just the relative few who find jobs at research
universities like their own.
</P>
<P>
   The 62 elite research universities that belong to the
association produce more than half of the approximately 40,000
Ph.D.s awarded in the United States each year. The 15-member
committee included presidents or chancellors from Yale, Duke,
Washington University, Rutgers and the University of California at
Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Peter D. Syverson, vice president for research and information
services at the Council of Graduate Schools, applauded the call for
universities to collect better data. ``The problem comes down to a
disconnect between expectations and reality,'' he said. ``Gathering
more information is useful so your current graduates aren't taken
by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark R. Kelley, president-elect of the graduate student
caucus of the Modern Language Association, called the
recommendations ``ludicrous.'' He said the problem is university
reliance on part-time adjuncts, which if reduced would create more
full-time teaching jobs for Ph.D.s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume they're saying that after eight or nine years of
running people's lives, we'd better look at what happens to them,''
Kelley said. ``This is a grand gesture. I wonder why it's taken
them so long to recognize this. They're always putting Band-Aids on
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Hannegan, a graduate student at the University of
California at Irvine and president of the National Association of
Graduate-Professional Students, said: ``There is a relative lack of
jobs in some fields. The traditional mind-set is that people who go
into Ph.D. programs are preparing for jobs in academe, but that is
no longer the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannegan hopes to receive his own Ph.D. in earth system science
this year but does not yet know what kind of job he will get. ``We
need to make sure that universities are devising programs that
recognize that a lot of graduates won't go into academe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although graduates with Ph.D.s earn more than those with
bachelor's or master's degrees, financial support for graduate
students has eroded and for many students, the time it takes to
earn a Ph.D. has grown to eight to 10 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Universities have never hired all of the Ph.D.s they produced
themselves, but for many years, supply and demand were more closely
matched. Production of Ph.D.s mushroomed in the late 1950s and the
1960s as the United States raced to catch up with Russia's space
program and the Cold War intensified. The number of Ph.D.s awarded
annually jumped to 41,610 in 1995 from only 8,773 in 1958, spurred
in part by increased federal financing, which paid for an expansion
in the number of universities offering doctorates and in the number
of doctoral programs.
</P>
<P>
   As that expansion ended, however, there were fewer new teaching
jobs to be had. Between 1975 and 1994, the report said, the number
of recent Ph.D.s hired by academe from the universities that are
association members grew by only about 1,000. Between 1975 and
1978, 31,056 were hired into academe; between 1991 and 1994, 32,317
were hired. The number actually dipped below 30,000 in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But these figures do not even tell the whole story, since
graduates in individual fields sometimes have particular problems,
and some of the academic jobs are in part-time, nonpermanent
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that there is a continuing crisis of
underemployment in the humanities and the humanities-oriented
social sciences,'' said Robert Weisbuch, president of the Woodrow
Wilson National Fellowship Foundation in Princeton, which last
month held a conference on how to link the humanities closer to the
world outside of academia, including finding more job opportunities
for Ph.D.s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a tremendous waste of talent,'' he added, ``and
this has gone on for more than 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The new report by the American Association of Universities'
Committee on Graduate Education acknowledges that many new Ph.D.s
do not have full-time jobs by the time they graduate, but argues
that the Ph.D. is valuable preparation for a variety of jobs, not
just college teaching positions. Furthermore, it says, people with
doctorates have very low unemployment rates throughout their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   But the report does express concern over the increasing
proportion of Ph.D.s who spend one or more years in post-graduate
study after they earn their degrees. This means that students who
have already postponed taking full-time jobs, are postponing such
employment still longer, and often not entering the job market
until their mid to late 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Some universities have begun to track their own graduates in the
job market. One recent study by the English department at the
Graduate Center of the City University of New York, for example,
found that of 89 students who earned Ph.D.s in English between 1992
and 1996, 60 were in academic jobs (39 in tenure track positions,
nine in nontenured but full-time positions and 12 in adjunct
positions.) Except for three graduates not found by the
researchers, the remaining 26 held a variety of jobs, including
writing, editing and administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That there is a real problem in the academy in the placement
of Ph.D.s is beyond question,'' said William Kelly, provost at the
CUNY graduate center. ``But the magnitude is not as severe as it is
made out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he, for one, says that some of the non-academic jobs
are valuable and exciting, there is a growing recognition in
academic circles that those who do not find full-time tenured jobs
are often left feeling that they have fallen short of some mark.
</P>
<P>
   Maresi Nerad, director of graduate research at the University of
California at Berkeley, who is conducting a national study of
Ph.D.s 10 years after graduation, said Berkeley is trying to
address this with programs like a career-management workshop for
English Ph.D. students this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make our doctoral students aware that there is an
array of possibilities,'' she said, ``and not be caught up in the
feeling that either you're a professor or you're nothing.''

RANGERS STILL IN RUNNING FOR RANDY JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The winning bid for the services of free-agent pitcher Randy
Johnson could be a three-year contract worth between $39 million
and $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's the consensus of major-league officials and sources
familiar with the situation, and the Rangers appear to have as good
a chance as any of the teams in hot pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the negotiations are veiled in secrecy. Some things are
known:
</P>
<P>
   Agent Barry Meister will try to get a four-year offer or three
years and an option. But Johnson, 35, only wants to pitch three
more years. Knowing this is his last contract, he'll want to get
the maximum value for it.
</P>
<P>
   So far the offers have been in the $10 million-$12 million per
year range, but that could increase as the bidding gets hotter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wants to stay close to his home in suburban Phoenix.
That puts the Arizona Diamondbacks in the picture, but they're also
in the National League and are still a few years away from being
competitive. Johnson toured the Diamondbacks' Bank One Ballpark
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Colangelo is aggressively pursuing Johnson, but the
Diamondbacks' staff isn't as enthusiastic. There is a strong
feeling within the organization that they should continue to build
from within for a few years before getting involved in big-name
free agents. There is also sentiment to go after center fielder
Bernie Williams instead.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wants to pitch in the American League and wants to pitch
on a contender. Both factors favor the Rangers. They also play in a
ballpark that favors left-handed pitching.
</P>
<P>
   A factor working against the Rangers is that they conduct spring
training in Florida. Johnson would like to sign with a team that
trains in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Meister said the Rangers have not made the highest offer.
Rangers president Tom Schieffer said the offer would not make
Johnson the highest-paid pitcher in baseball, an honor held by
Pedro Martinez at an average of $12.5 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely the Rangers offered less than $36 million, although
Schieffer will emphasize that Texas doesn't have a state income
tax. Both Arizona and California do.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels have many of the factors Johnson wants: an
American League team, in contention, that trains in Arizona. But
they are also pursuing first baseman Mo Vaughn and aren't likely to
spring for both. The Angels have also offered a contract to pitcher
Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres, an hour's flight west of Phoenix, have a
good chance if they can muster a bid close to the others. Their
first priority is Kevin Brown, but he might go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers could step up their pursuit if they can trade Gary
Sheffield's huge contract to San Diego. The two sides have
discussed a deal that would send Sheffield and shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek to San Diego for outfielder Greg Vaughn, shortstop
Chris Gomez and pitcher Randy Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's history of a bad back is troubling. But some teams are
mollified by Johnson's demand for a three-to-four-year deal. Kevin
Brown, the other ace pitcher in the free-agent market, is looking
for a six- or seven-year contract, which is scaring off some teams.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates said he's not concerned about
Johnson's back, pointing out what Rangers slugger Juan Gonzalez has
done despite past back problems. Oates is also not concerned about
Johnson's reputation of being difficult to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many positives,'' Oates said. ``I look at what a
change of scenery \Rin Houston\S did for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees are about as far away from Phoenix as you
can get, but two factors work in their favor. They offer the best
chance to get Johnson into the World Series and owner George
Steinbrenner is not one to get outbid by anybody, including
Colangelo.

CONTINENTAL MECHANICS REJECT DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LAURA GOLDBERG 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ More than 2,900 mechanics for Continental Airlines
overwhelmingly rejected a tentative contract agreement with the
company, according to ballots counted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
announced in mid-October that a tentative agreement had been
reached.
</P>
<P>
   But the rank-and-file didn't like the deal. Of the votes cast,
2,085 were against the contract, 257 were for it and about 80 were
invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-based carrier began negotiating with the Teamsters
in November 1997 for a new contract. At that time, the union said
key issues for the mechanics included job security and pay.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics voted to join the Teamsters in July of that year
after 14 years without union representation.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lacefield, a Washington, D.C., Teamsters spokesman, said
the employees are ``going to fight to get a better contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacefield referred questions about details of the tentative
agreement and the union's next move to another union official, who
did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   A Continental spokesman would say only that the company had been
in touch with the Teamsters and was discussing the next steps.
</P>
<P>
   Continental's mechanics are not alone in their actions. Across
the airline industry, the rank-and-file are rejecting tentative
agreements negotiated at bargaining tables by union and company
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Airline workers, who are keenly aware of the record profits
being churned out by airlines, aren't convinced airline executives
want to pay them fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Some also remember the early '90s when airlines were in
bad-to-desperate financial shape and employees took pay cuts and
other concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics rejection comes after the company and pilots at
Continental Express, Continental's regional carrier, reached a
second tentative agreement late last month.
</P>
<P>
   The first was rejected by the pilots in June. It would have
given the more than 1,100 pilots, about half of whom the union says
make less than $15,000 a year, an average 35 percent raise. The
pilots said that contract still would have meant half of them
making less than $19,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the Independent Association of Continental Pilots
is likely this week to send the second agreement to the pilots for
a vote. Agreement details haven't been released.
</P>
<P>
   At Continental Express, the company is also in negotiations with
the mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   For the main carrier, the mechanics contract is the only one
outstanding. In June, Continental pilots ratified a five-year deal
granting average 47 percent pay raises over the contract's life. It
also included vacation and pension improvements, and stronger job
security language. &QL;

INTEREST GROUPS CALL POPULAR PAYDAY LOANS A CASE OF USURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Check-cashing businesses are charging astronomical
interest rates on so-called payday loans, two consumer groups
reported, in a practice they called quasi-legal loan sharking.
</P>
<P>
   Check-cashing businesses levy as much as a 391 &UR;  &LR; percent annual
interest rate on loans that are backed by future paychecks,
according to a study released Tuesday by the Consumer Federation of
America in Washington and the California Public Interest Research
Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are being ripped off,'' said Janee Pelletier,
consumer program associate for CalPIRG. ``They go into low-income
communities and prey on people who need instant cash.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, standard credit cards from the top 10 issuers have
an average interest rate of 17.51 &UR;  &LR; percent a year, according to
Bankcard Barometer, a bank credit-card publication based in
Frederick, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Check cashers charge $15 for every $100 borrowed by people short
of cash. The customer writes them a postdated check that the check
casher won't deposit until there's money to cover it. The consumer
can pay off the loan in cash, or deposit his or her next paycheck
to cover the borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   But if the loan isn't paid off, it gets rolled over so consumers
end up paying an additional $15 for every pay period until the
account is settled. If the loan is unpaid for a year, consumers
will pay $390 in interest for a $100 loan.
</P>
<P>
   However, consumers usually aren't aware they're paying such high
rates. The survey found that 88 &UR;  &LR; percent of payday lenders in seven
out of eight states did not tell customers the annual percentage
rate, or APR, when asked for a price quote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you call them, they say they charge a 15 &UR;  &LR; percent interest
rate. But they don't tell you that it's every two weeks,''
Pelletier said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the people who use check cashers are folks who
can least afford to do so, the consumer groups said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are low-income consumers,'' Pelletier said.
</P>
<P>
   Popularity of payday loans has exploded: They weren't around 10
years ago but now they're available in 21 states, the groups said.
A major player in check cashing is Ace Cash Express of Irving,
Texas, which doubled its annual payday loan volume last year to
$10.1 &UR;  &LR; million, the consumer groups charged.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Norrington, vice president of marketing at Ace Cash, said
its payday loan service provides emergency money for folks who
otherwise couldn't get money from other sources, such as people
with credit problems.
</P>
<P>
   He said the rate Ace charges reflects the risk the company takes
by accepting a personal, uncollateralized check in exchange for
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Advance America, a payday loan company in Spartanburg, S.C.,
opened its first store a year ago and expects to have 500 outlets
by year-end in more than 16 states, including California. Some
national banks also offer payday loans.
</P>
<P>
   Advance America officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to protect consumers from exorbitant rates are weak,
the groups charged. Nineteen states have laws concerning payday
loans, but half don't stop rollovers, 68 &UR;  &LR; percent don't require
lenders to disclose the APR and 95 &UR;  &LR; percent don't have a minimum
loan term of 30 days to give consumers some breathing room to repay
the borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo Bank is one institution that offers payday loans on
direct deposit accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The bank charges $1 for every $20 borrowed, for a 5 &UR;  &LR; percent
interest rate per pay period. That's a rate of between 60 &UR;  &LR; percent
to 130 &UR;  &LR; percent a year, depending on whether payday is twice or
once a month. The maximum loan is $200 per paycheck or half of the
paycheck. Rollovers aren't allowed.
</P>
<P>
   A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said it is not recommended that
consumers regularly depend on these loans since interest rates are
high.
</P>
<P>
   Pelletier urges consumers to check into other sources of funds
before tapping payday loans _ credit cards, bank loans or money
from friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exhaust all possible avenues before using payday loans,'' she
said. &UR;

 &HT;    Smarter than the average high-tech firm
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Broadcom, an upstart chip maker based in California,
is turning out to be one smart investment by Atlanta-based
Scientific-Atlanta Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta, which at one point owned 3.8 percent of
Broadcom, has profited handsomely from its stake. In the past six
months, the company has booked $112 million in gains from its
Broadcom stake.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcom shares are up more than 123 percent since going public
in April. And that climb has escalated in the past two days,
gaining $4 Tuesday and $8.75 the day before. ``It's been a good
investment,'' said Scientific-Atlanta spokesman Bob Meyers. ``The
company has excellent management and engineering talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers said Scientific-Atlanta seeks well-positioned but small
companies in its industry for investment. ``That way we can share
in their success,'' he said. ``We were an early investor in
Broadcom for these reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta initially bought 1.5 million shares but sold
off all but 500,000 in the second quarter of this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Scientific-Atlanta has reduced its stake, the company
expects to continue working with Broadcom. The two companies have
been working closely since the early 1990s. They met while helping
Time Warner experiment with digital television in Orlando in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a fantastic working relationship and expect that to
continue,'' said Dr. Henry T. Nicholas, Broadcom's president and
chief executive. ``Even if Scientific-Atlanta doesn't buy our new
chip set, we expect to share our technology with them.''
</P>
<P>
   What triggered Broadcom's most recent stock climb was the
company's announcement Monday of a new chip that would enable
televisions to simultaneously display Web pages and TV shows. This
was the latest in a string of product innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Irvine, Calif., Broadcom makes hardware that
accelerates the transmission of TV shows, music and data over cable
and telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta, which supplies the cable TV industry with
networks and equipment, uses Broadcom chips in its products. The
company hasn't yet decided whether to buy Broadcom's latest chip.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta's digital system, called Explorer 2000,
already offers simultaneous display of Web pages and television.
The company is aggressively marketing this system to cable
operators nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Scientific-Atlanta executives welcomed Broadcom's newest
chip _ and not just for the innovation it represents. They believe
the chip will heat up an already hot competition among its chip
suppliers. And that, executives hope, will help keep prices level
to declining.

MARK WHITAKER NAMED NEWSWEEK EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (nk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Whitaker, who began his career at Newsweek as a
college intern in 1977 and went on to expand the magazine's
technology and business coverage and then oversee the pyrotechnics
of the Monica Lewinsky story as managing editor this year, was
named editor of the magazine Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, 41, had been supervising the magazine's day-to-day
editorial operations since the previous editor, Maynard Parker,
fell ill with leukemia a year ago; Parker, who had been editor for
16 years, died last month at the age of 58.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment came as little surprise to Newsweek staff
members, who have expected Whitaker to become editor. His new job
is significant: It not only makes him the first black editor of a
major news weekly, but comes at a time when the three major news
weekly magazines _ Time and U.S. News &AMP; World Report along with
Newsweek _ are undergoing a period of self-scrutiny, competing for
an audience that increasingly is turning to television, the
Internet and other news outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The changing of the guard represents a generational as well as a
managerial shift. Replacing Whitaker as managing editor will be Ann
McDaniel, 42, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief, and Jon Meacham,
who has been national affairs editor since 1995. Meacham is 29, or
in the words of one staff member ``about 5 years old during Nixon's
impeachment proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   The new guard take over a magazine that trails Time magazine in
circulation, 4.1 million to 3.2 million, even though it attracted
enormous attention this year with its initially cautious then
blanketlike coverage of the Monica Lewinsky affair. U.S. News &AMP;
World Report trails the group with a circulation of 2.2 million and
has gone through five editors in 14 years, but its owner, Mortimer
Zuckerman, hired Stephen Smith as editor from National Journal in
late July, and Smith is considered by editors at Time and Newsweek
as a foe who is perhaps more formidable than his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief acceptance speech at the magazine's regularly
scheduled Tuesday morning story meeting, Whitaker said he was very
concerned about his competition and asked the assembled group:
``What can we do to make Newsweek a must-read?''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker answered the question Tuesday afternoon in his
16th-floor office in midtown Manhattan, as staff members began to
pour celebratory Champagne and eat chocolate-chip cookies outside
his door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newsweek starts by having the strongest reporting and writing
in the news magazine field,'' Whitaker said. ``The first priority
is to be out front on every major news story. That's our stock and
trade and that's what our readers look for us to be. We will be as
aggressive as we've ever been in covering the big stories,
political and otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news weekly magazine _ where the job of editor includes
signing off on every story, cover headline, chart, photograph and
``pull quote'' _ the influence of the editor is felt to the core of
the publication. A self-described technophile, Whitaker said he
wanted to devote more space to technology and science, the global
economy, domestic markets, personal investing and family issues,
and added that he was especially interested in making the magazine
relevant to younger readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we do an extremely good job covering the baby boom
generation, and we will continue to do so as we get older,'' he
said. ``But I want this to be a must-read for younger readers as
well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Newsweek has just emerged from its most profitable year in 1997,
said Richard M. Smith, who has held the title of editor-in-chief
since 1984, president since 1991 and chairman since early this
year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Publishers Information Bureau, ad pages
declined in the last year, to 1,959 from January to October 1998,
from 2,043 for the same period in 1997. But Smith added that, for a
news organization hinged on a single publication, Newsweek, which
is owned by The Washington Post Co., fares ``extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that always amazes me about Newsweek is that despite
Time Inc.'s multiple magazine advertising packages, despite
Time-Warner's clout on the newsstand, despite the cross-promotion
from CNN and other sectors of engulf and devour, we're in a good
dogfight with Time and we win more than we lose,'' Smith said.
``Everybody has always said that Newsweek's great handicap is that
it's a single-magazine company in this universe of hydras, but we
do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker said that while he admired Time magazine and its
marketing strategies, he said he was dismayed at recent decisions
that he said blur the line between editorial and advertising
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty well-known that they're doing things now
that seem tailored for specific advertisers,'' Whitaker said. He
was referring to Time magazine's recent agreement with the Ford
Motor Co., in which Ford will be the sole sponsor of new editorial
sections that focus on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Time's Managing Editor, Walter Isaacson, defended Time's
separation of powers. ``We have a great system of church and state,
and we do editorially what we feel passionate about editorially,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker is regarded by his staff as a strong, even-keeled
intellectual presence, less seismic in his deadline fervor than
Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Norton, Mass., Whitaker began his career at Newsweek
as an intern in the San Francisco bureau in 1977; he graduated
summa cum laude from Harvard in 1979. As assistant managing editor
from 1991 to 1996, he expanded the magazine's technology coverage,
and has written on the issue of race for the magazine _ including
an essay titled ``Whites vs. Blacks'' which Newsweek published
after the O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he says his race is irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud and I'm honored to be in this position,'' Whitaker
said, ``but my goal is to the very best editor of Newsweek that I
can be, not just the best black editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker is married to Alexis Gelber, an assistant managing
editor at Newsweek; she reports to Michael Elliott, editor of
Newsweek's international editions. Elliott had been one of the
several names mentioned as a potential successor to Parker, aside
from Whitaker. Ms. McDaniel, the Washington bureau chief, was
another; Evan Thomas, an assistant managing editor, an author and
familiar face on the talk-show circuit, had also been mentioned.
All say that there was no jockeying for the title of editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an extremely healthy franchise, and we have to make
sure we're better at it than everybody else,'' Whitaker said. ``The
key to that is getting really smart, energetic and aggressive young
reporters and writers, and give them a voice at the table. I've
tried to be a real advocate in getting their views and interests
into the magazine.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was the doctor from West Virginia who received
an official-looking letter from the Nigerian government, offering a
business opportunity to export agricultural equipment. After some
hesitation, he wrote several checks over a couple of years totaling
$225,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the three Amish farmers in Pennsylvania who
heard about an offer for a lucrative oil pipeline contract. They,
too, wrote several checks over time, parting eventually with
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   They were among the millions of Americans who have, over the
years, received envelopes with colorful stamps and handwritten
return addresses from Nigeria containing letters claiming to be
from governmental or quasi-governmental bodies offering plans to
strike it rich.
</P>
<P>
   The letters are part of what federal investigators say may be
the oldest mail fraud scheme in the United States. They say it has
existed for four or five decades in various forms, and now cheats
people out of $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   To say that the scheme has been extensive would be an
understatement: it accounts for four out of five letters sent from
Nigeria to the United States, said Lee Heath, inspector in charge
of the New York City division of the U.S. Postal Service. The fraud
operation appears to be a thriving but mobile business based in
Lagos, the commercial center of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Now, U.S. officials, in conjunction Nigerian authorities, say
they have devised a strategy that has significantly cut back on the
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of waiting for victims to come forward, the Postal
Service is training inspectors to spot the letters before they are
delivered, and to discard them immediately. As a result, since
March, postal inspectors at John F. Kennedy International Airport,
where all mail from Africa is sorted, have intercepted 2.3 million
of the letters.
</P>
<P>
   Before the practice was adopted, the Postal Service was
receiving up to 25,000 complaints a month from people who had
either been defrauded or were suspicious of the letters, and now it
receives only 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that we will have a dramatic impact on shutting down
these schemes and preventing American citizens from being
victimized,'' Heath said at a news conference Tuesday in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal investigators were willing to estimate the
amount of money lost through the scheme, they had no figures for
how many people had been defrauded in the United States, or some of
the other countries that have been targeted _ Britain or Belgium or
Canada, Heath said. Thousands, officials thought.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it clear how many people in Nigeria, or other countries
in West Africa, may be responsible for the scheme; again,
presumably thousands, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the scheme relies on phone directories and other
lists to inundate the United States with the letters.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, usually printed on official-looking stationery, may
seek bank account numbers or advance fees. It characteristically
makes a ``strictly confidential'' request that the recipient
transfer millions of dollars siphoned from Nigeria's vast oil
revenues or public construction budgets and offers the prospect of
huge secret profits.
</P>
<P>
   Or it may simply describe an opportunity to do business with
Nigerians who have connections to the government. Those who respond
may later hear that legal fees, personal expenses and bribes may be
involved, which would not be unusual in a country often described
as one of the more corrupt in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, however, U.S. officials could not do much to
prevent the fraud and were restricted to responding after receiving
a complaint of fraud, or occasionally of physical threats. U.S. and
Nigerian officials have made a few arrests over the years, but
waiting for complaints is often frustrating, because the
embarrassment keeps so many victims from reporting the swindle.
</P>
<P>
   In April, though, an agreement with Nigerian officials
authorized United States postal inspectors to sift through mail
from Nigeria and look for the characteristic signs of the fraud
letters, including fake stamps, fake postage meter marks and
bundles arranged in alphabetical order.
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims was Dr. Ian Leggat, an obstetrician in
Fairmont, W. Va.
</P>
<P>
   Leggat received a letter in late 1995. He was intrigued, asked
to see documents testifying to the legitimacy of the agricultural
equipment business and felt satisfied with what was offered as
proof.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he was asked for fees to cover an assortment of
matters, and was pinched out of $225,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense that I was a complete idiot for having been
played like a sucker,'' said Leggat, whose family is still reeling
financially from the lost money. The swindlers ``are very smart,
very sophisticated, and I'm doing this to help stop other people
from getting sucked into this.''

 &HT;    WWI veterans harder to come by

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Al Ross stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   He became the last survivor of Barracks 507, a West Palm Beach
World War I veterans' group, when George Bucknell of Lake Worth
died in February.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, the group's membership stood at more than 200.
Five years ago it was down to 12, with only five strong enough even
to attend gatherings. Now there's only Ross, who at 97 will be
keynote speaker at today's Veterans Day parade and ceremony on
Clematis Street in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years after the guns of the Great War stopped, the ranks
of those who fought it are down to a scattered few. Five years ago,
there were 49 known veterans in Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie,
Indian River and Okeechobee Counties. Now there are four.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the number of World War I veterans nationwide was
750,000. Today, there are perhaps 3,000 now, according to Muriel
Sue Parkhurst of Veterans of World War I of the U.S.A. Inc. in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Their average age is 98; ages range from 95 to a 116-year-old in
Kansas, Parkhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, 97, still does public relations for The Palm Beach Daily
News and still drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm 27,'' said Ross.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 15-1/2, he lied about his age at to get into the
U.S. Navy, but never saw action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the war to end all wars, but it never worked out that
way,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   George Archer remembers being intrigued by the stunts of
barnstorming pilots at county fairs in his native Alabama when he
was 17. So he lied about his age and joined the U.S. Army Air Force
in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my friends said I had to be crazy to fly one of those
things,'' said Archer, 99, of Palm Beach. ``I think it helped.''
</P>
<P>
   He got to Europe, but Armistice Day came before his first
mission. It was Nov. 11, 1918, the 11th hour of the 11th day of the
11th month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not much of a parader,'' he said. ``And there can't be
many of us still around to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Parkhurst, the unpaid executive director and only employee of
her organization, lists about 250 active members who pay $3 a year,
plus another 1,800 life members who paid a one-time $25 fee in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believes many of those have died, but that their
widows haven't told her because they want to keep receiving the
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gone from outhouses to outer space,'' Parkhurst said
of the last veterans. ''They've seen more changes in their lifetime
than any other generation in history.''

PROBLEMS BESET MARINES IN SKI CRASH, TRANSCRIPT SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Something was wrong, Capt. Scott Roys knew, with
the way his Marine Corps squadron kept reference documents for
planning flights in the Italian Alps. In secret testimony this
summer, he said that the binder had been stuffed with information
laughably old or relevant only to fighter planes the squadron did
not fly.
</P>
<P>
   No single error doomed the 20 people on the Cermis ski lift in
the Alps, who fell 264 feet to their death on Feb. 3 when a plane
from Roys' squadron severed the cable holding their gondola. But
the story of that thick binder emerges from a transcript of a
secret hearing at Camp Lejeune, N.C., as an example of broad
management problems in the Marine Corps' operation in Aviano,
Italy. The transcript also shows that the skiers, unlikely though
it seems, became indirect casualties of the war in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation continues in preparation for courts-martial
of the plane's pilot and navigator early next year, it is clear
that problems built up over years leading to the deadly accident in
a period when the Marine squadrons were rotating between Cherry
Point, N.C., and duty in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   When the Air Force wanted to copy data on obstructions like the
ski lift, it asked the Italians for the wrong map. In Washington,
the Defense Mapping Agency kept maps that did not show the ski lift
because it used ineffective guidelines to decide what hazards to
display. And the four Marine squadrons fitted in poorly as a
``tenant'' squadron with their hosts at Aviano, the U.S. Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force kind of treated them as a second-class
citizen,'' Lt. Col. Michael Cross, the chief of staff of the Second
Marine Air Wing, of which the squadron is a part, said in testimony
at the hearing in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not as forthcoming with the flight information,''
Cross said. For example, when the Air Force sent an important
document to one of its own squadrons, it made the squadron sign for
it. For the Marines, he said, ``they just threw it in the mail box;
and if they got it, they got it; and if they didn't, nobody knew
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Air Force supplied information, the Marines found
problems. Members of the squadron had a mix of new and old
publications; there were never enough new ones to go around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to beg, borrow and steal to get more,'' Lt. Col.
Richard Muegge, the squadron commander since November 1996, said at
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing also documented contradictions in flight
restrictions among the various items in the reference binder.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing, convened by Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, the commanding
general of Marine Forces Atlantic, was not to investigate the
communications breakdown that preceded the accident, but to
consider disciplining four officers of the squadron for their roles
in the case. After the hearing, Pace relieved the squadron
commander of his command and inserted a letter of reprimand into
the file of the squadron's safety officer.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript lays out a detailed picture of one of the central
puzzles of the accident: the Air Force listed a minimum altitude of
2,000 feet above the ground in the area of the ski lift, the Marine
squadron had a copy of this Air Force document, but hardly anyone
in the squadron _ including the pilot involved in the accident _
knew about it.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing shed little light on the question of why the pilot
and navigator of the plane that hit the cable, who face
court-martial next February, were flying as low as the cables, less
than 300 feet above ground, when they thought their minimum
altitude was 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force document listing the 2,000-foot restriction was an
August 1997 Flight Crew Information File. Within the Air Force,
someone from each squadron had to initial that the document had
been received. The Air Force put one in an ``out'' box for the
Marine squadron, and later asked if it had been received, according
to testimony at the hearing. But Roys' squadron received neither
the document nor the subsequent query.
</P>
<P>
   In early November 1997, though, about six weeks after the
squadron had rotated in, Roys took it upon himself to go into a
classified room at the headquarters for flights over Bosnia and
photocopy anything that looked relevant to the kind of plane his
squadron flew, the EA-6B. The plane, known as the Prowler, is an
aging but still able electronic warfare jet that can jam enemy
radars or hit them with missiles.
</P>
<P>
   He weeded out old material from the binder, which started out
three inches thick, and took it back to his squadron at a thickness
of about an inch. Roys said he gave the material to Maj. Max
Caramanian, the director of safety standardization for the
squadron. Then he left for two weeks of temporary duty at another
location, and a week of vacation. When he came back, the folder was
still on Caramanian's desk, unread.
</P>
<P>
   But Roys was not easily put off. On Dec. 15, shortly after his
return, the squadron held one of its regular meetings, gathering
pilots and electronics countermeasures officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we conducted our regular business,'' the captain
testified, ``I stood up in front of them and said, `This is a new
read binder' or `This binder has new, current information in it. It
replaces the old binder.'''
</P>
<P>
   And he said he ``basically indicated that this binder was a
third of the size of the old binder, which was stuffed full of
irrelevant'' material, ``and that it needed to be read.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Muegge flew the route in question, at a planned
altitude of 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. John G. Koran, the executive officer of the squadron,
who was released from the hearing without punishment, also flew the
route within days, at a planned altitude of 1,000 feet. And on Feb.
3, with deadly results, so did Capt. Richard Ashby, as pilot, and
Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, as navigator; it is they who now face
courts-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Why, Pace asked, had Roys not called the document to the
attention of his superiors more forcefully?
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, sir, I don't believe I even reread the binder
after I got back,'' he told Pace.
</P>
<P>
   And, the general asked, ``Why would an entire squadron of
officers not react to a fellow officer saying, `There's stuff in
here to be read'?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Muegge, the commanding officer, told Pace, ``Why didn't I stand
up and tell my operations officer, `Take a look at that binder'?
Probably because I thought he had, but why didn't I go and do
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Muegge said that he or his designee attended weekly meetings
with the Air Force, but that the 2,000-foot restriction was never
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   He also identified another reason the crucial document went
unnoticed, a reason perhaps characteristic of military culture.
Referring to Roys, he said, ``We had a situation where the
information came in at a low level instead of a high level, which
is the way we were used to receiving information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, for whatever reason, we didn't do it; and
there's thousands of reasons, but it wasn't because we didn't care
and we weren't trying to do our job the best we can,'' Muegge said.
``Just somehow, no one got the right message.''

 &HT;    Organ transplant recipient ordered to leave country
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A Polish woman fighting deportation
because she underwent two organ transplants exhausted her appeals
to immigration officials and must leave the United States by
Friday, her attorney said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is not evenhanded,'' said Frank Ricci, an attorney for
the woman who came to the United States for her sister's wedding in
Stuart and stayed after a liver and kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she was a superstar athlete, the government would have
found a way to keep her here,'' Ricci said.
</P>
<P>
   Danuta Glazewska, 55, pleaded with immigration officials to
allow her to stay with her sister in Stuart, saying Polish
hospitals have limited resources for double transplant patients and
the medications they require.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are running out of time and grasping for straws,'' said
Stephen Schultz, her brother-in-law. He spent Tuesday calling
federal officials to find a way to halt the deportation of
Glazewska and her son, Robert, 29, a senior at the University of
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Glazewska and her son came to the United States in
1990 for the wedding, Glazewska fell ill with hepatitis C and moved
to Omaha for medical care. She came to Stuart this summer to live
with her sister.
</P>
<P>
   If the pair does not leave voluntarily by Friday, they will be
deported at government expense and barred from returning to the
United States for 10 years, Ricci said.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said he contacted New York attorney Mark Scher, who said
he will file a final appeal to halt the deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci, a Palm Beach Gardens immigration attorney, had filed
motions to transfer Glazewska's case to Miami and delay her
deportation date. Those requests were denied Monday by an
immigration judge in Chicago.

 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At this particular anniversary party, no one was giving
silver or diamonds. The only gifts that the guests cared about were
human organs, and the difference between life and death.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Boston, where organ transplantation got much of its
start, the New England Organ Bank, the oldest of more than 60
around the country, marked its 30th anniversary on Monday with all
the expressions of pride from doctors and thanks from patients that
one might expect in a medical field that did not exist half a
century ago and now saves thousands of lives annually.
</P>
<P>
   The embodiment of those 30 years, Lynda Uperti, a Delaware nurse
who received a kidney transplant in 1968 and is still doing fine at
the age of 52, told the gathering, ``Words really can't adequately
describe the feeling of gratitude for the ability to have that
second chance, that second life.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were feelings other than gratitude and pride at play.
Even at such a celebration, with its emphasis on successes, the
message from transplant experts, who provided a snapshot of the
current state of organ donation and procurement, was that this is a
field in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The splashy announcement last week that scientists had succeeded
in cultivating human embryonic stem cells, which may someday be
used to grow organs outside the body for transplantation, concerns
the realm of the future. So does all the tantalizing talk of
``xeno-transplantation'': the use of animal organs to replace human
ones.
</P>
<P>
   For now, say organ procurement officials like those at the
nonprofit New England Organ Bank, they are facing a problem of
almost Malthusian dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waiting lists are getting longer and longer and longer,''
said Dr. William E. Harmon, the organization's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Harmon said, 41,000 people around the country are
on the kidney transplant waiting list, but only 8,500 transplants
using cadaver kidneys are expected this year. About 58,000 people
are waiting for kidneys, lungs, livers or hearts, and about 10 die
each day.
</P>
<P>
   Organ donation has been gradually increasing, particularly in
recent years as organs from older people have become more
acceptable, but at nowhere near the rate of the growth in demand.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, doctors and organ-bank officials note with
unconcealed pain, a tremendous amount of time and debate has gone
into the question that most transplant experts call ``allocation''
but that those who speak more bluntly would call ``rationing'': Who
gets the available organs? The sickest patients? Those with the
best prognosis? Those geographically closest to the donor?
</P>
<P>
   ``The present tenor of the national allocation debate is not a
constructive one, and it is not likely to result in solution,''
warned Dr. Marc I. Lorber, a Yale Medical School professor who is
the regional representative for the United Network for Organ
Sharing, a private network of transplant centers.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government stepped into the fray this spring. To
help increase the supply of donor organs, it decreed that beginning
in August, hospitals had to report all deaths to organ banks,
increasing the likelihood that the banks' staffs, well trained in
persuasion, can lead relatives to donate the organs of the
deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Already, said Richard S. Luskin, executive director of the New
England Organ Bank, that rule has increased calls to the bank from
about 1,000 in August to 2,000 in October.
</P>
<P>
   Trickier, however, was a push by the government to reorganize
the system of distributing organs so that geography mattered less.
It proposed more of a national plan that would equalize the waiting
time for organs among regions, which now varies dramatically, and
give organs first to those who need them most.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal, held up last month by Congress so the issue could
be studied for another year, is still hotly debated, to the chagrin
of organ procurement officials. Even within the New England Organ
Bank, said Harmon, the chairman, ``the issue of allocation has
almost torn us apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, several speakers at the anniversary celebration said,
the focus should be on maximizing organ donations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite opinion polls showing that nearly 80 percent of the
American population approves of organ donation, only between 45 and
55 percent of possible donation consents are obtained nationwide,
Luskin said.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Organ Bank does somewhat better at 55 to 65
percent, he said, but that is not enough; the target should be the
full 80 percent. There has not been a ``concerted, coordinated
national public education campaign,'' he said, and organ donation
suffers from something of an image problem, its name tarnished by
jokes and conspiracy yarns about schemes in which the donation is
not exactly voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Others at the gathering blamed doctors in part for the lag in
donations, noting that when families are not convinced that a
medical staff has done everything possible for their loved ones,
they are less likely to consent to organ donation. Furthermore,
these speakers said, a misconception remains among many doctors
that asking a family to donate a relative's organs will only
increase its pain.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Sheila McIntyre, a nurse from Quincy, Mass., who
donated her 19-year-old son's kidneys and eyes after he was killed
in a fall 15 years ago, many grieving relatives are happy to have
the opportunity to do some good.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do they have available to them,'' she said, ``except this
consolation?''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Moakley, a Massachusetts congressman who received a liver
transplant in 1995, recommended that when families gather for
Thanksgiving or the winter holidays this year, they discuss their
organ donation wishes. Because, organ bank officials pointed out,
even if someone has an organ donation sticker on his license or
other proof of a desire to donate, a dead person has no rights, and
it is ultimately the next-of-kin who decides.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must make your intentions known at the kitchen table, the
dining room table,'' said Moakley. ``As you celebrate the holidays
with your family, please make your intentions known. You may save
someone's life, just as someone saved mine.''

 &HT;    Commentary: Braves still wrinkled after facelift
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having done some superficial lifting and tucking among
their coaches, the Braves officially have begun making over those
employees who work in fair territory. This step is somewhat more
significant.
</P>
<P>
   The first Braves to be shown the door were those least
responsible for the latest NLCS collapse. Michael Tucker hit .385
against the Padres, winning Game 5 with a home run and five RBIs.
His benching the next game created legitimate groundswells. And the
Braves won Denny Neagle's Game 4 start. They both are dispatched to
Cincinnati bearing only good wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves listened to the cry to use their surplus of starters
as barter for everyday help. It turns out you can have too much
pitching _ when it limits your flexibility in the field. Neagle
departs as one of the more under-appreciated Braves, because no one
could fully emerge from the tall forest of Maddux, Glavine and
Smoltz. He cheerfully bore his place in this society of pitchers,
but deserves to flourish as somebody's alpha wolf.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Reds send this way a left arm capable of some
velocity but unspecific location. The rest of Mike Remlinger was
thrown in at no extra cost. The headliner was Bret Boone, the
second baseman who could make the right side of the infield as
impenetrable as an hour of C-Span. No one will be able to get
through it.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the deal may not seem all that spectacular.
Especially if the pitching prospect the Braves threw into the deal
_ Rob Bell _ becomes real. We are not here today to begin
preparations for a Peachtree parade in the fall of '99.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do we gather, surprise, to rush to judgment. If the money
set free along with Neagle happens to multiply and land on a free
agent _ say Brian Jordan _ then the transaction starts to give off
a much better aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Right away, genealogists will love the deal. This summer, Boone
became the first third-generation All-Star. Preceding him to that
show were father Bob (a catcher) and grandfather Ray (an
infielder). The line of ballplaying Boones goes back even further
than the beginnings of Steve DeBerg's career.
</P>
<P>
   The family claims ol' Daniel Boone as a direct descendant, which
may speak to young Bret's competitive nature. The staid Braves can
use a little frontier spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Boone could have been had for a whole lot less just a year ago,
when during a .223 season he was briefly demoted to the minors. New
Braves hitting coach Don Baylor will have a project here, because
Boone is far from a finished offensive product. This year he
shortened his swing a little and enjoyed career highs in home runs
(24) and RBIs (95). But make no mistake, this is no leadoff type.
</P>
<P>
   Defense will be his signature. He won a Gold Glove this year,
and should have last when he set a record for highest fielding
percentage by a second baseman (.997). Recall that defense is
something the Braves used to be able to play.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, of course, came out of the deal claiming that their
worlds are better off for having made it. This is an interesting
little tweak, perfectly in keeping with the Schuerholz Method of
putting faith in guys who can catch the ball. But Brett Boone is
hardly the final word on the needs of a team not as good as it
thinks it is.

   Texas Capitol may be taller than U.S. Capitol
</P>
<P>
   By Mike Ward
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texans for years have bragged that their pink
granite statehouse is taller than the nation's capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Six feet taller, maybe seven.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hoping to end 110 years of Texas-sized guessing, the state
agency in charge of the Capitol is planning to ``put this to rest
once and for all,'' said Ali Turley, the capitol's education
curator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take two measurements later this year _ one to
the top of the dome, to the Goddess' toes, and the other all the
way to the top of the Goddess,'' Turley said. ``We know exactly how
tall the Goddess (of Liberty statue) is, so we'll have a way of
verifying the exact measurement.''
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for the measurement, which capitol
officials said will likely be conducted by survey teams from the
Texas Department of Transportation or General Land Office. After
all, officials said, you can't just run a measuring tape from the
front steps to the tip of the gilded goddess' outstretched arm.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the official height of the Lone Star State's
most famous and revered dome has grown like Pinocchio's nose.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Capitol was dedicated in May 1888, its
builders pegged it as 7 feet taller than the 288-foot U.S. Capitol
in Washington. By the 1920s, when it was briefly painted white in
an official faux pas that angered Texans, it was reported to be
more than 300 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, the official height had grown to 308 feet 4
inches. A few years later, it was 311 feet. By 1995, it had shrunk
to 309 feet 8 inches based on calculations engineering drawings
used in its just-completed restoration. While there's little chance
the new measurement will debunk Texas' bragging rights over the
U.S. Capitol, it promises to trim down to size another oft-repeated
legend: Texas' statehouse is taller than that of any other state.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana's 450-foot office tower is the tallest, and Illinois'
405-foot statehouse _ including flagpole _ is the tallest with a
traditional dome.

WASHINGTON STATE CLOUT WOULD RISE WITH DUNN AS MAJORITY LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Jennifer Dunn spent her first full day as a
candidate for House majority leader calling everyone she knows and
asking for help.
</P>
<P>
   But should she win next week, suddenly everyone she knows will
be seeking aid from her.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, R-Wash., is seeking is the No. 2 post in the House, which
brings with it considerable power to influence national policy, a
bully pulpit from which to influence national politics, and a
traditional role for steering federal dollars and programs back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great if she got it _ it would mean a lot for the
state _ because it would put her in a position where every
committee chair in the House would be beholden to her, and it would
also give her clout with the (Clinton) administration,'' said Rep.
Norm Dicks, D-Wash., the dean of the state's congressional
delegation. ``There are always issues that come up, things
affecting the Boeing Co. or Microsoft, and when you're in the
leadership, you're going to have additional clout.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Rod Chandler, R-Wash., said Dunn would be in a
position not only to help the state, but to help the Republican
Party keep control of the House in 2000, and thereby, from his
perspective, help the American people with tax cuts and other
policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a visible position _ much more so than anything other
than speaker _ and it is also a position from which the policy of
the (Republican) conference is established and carried out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Washington state, it's a huge bump in influence that
Jennifer would have over what she has now,'' he said. ``That just
goes without saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler is one of a handful of longtime Dunn allies, most from
Washington state, who have rallied to her side in an effort to
boost her campaign to unseat House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas. Reps. George Nethercutt and Doc Hastings, R-Wash., were
making calls on Dunn's behalf; her longtime political consultant,
John Meyers, flew in from Bellevue and joined another longtime
former aide-turned lobbysist, Phil Bond, in helping her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us in the West, it means a lot, because we need to have
someone ... stitting at the negotiating table to make sure our
region is represented well,'' Nethercutt said.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt defeated the last House leader from Washington state
_ Tom Foley, a Democrat who had previously served as majority
leader. Nethercutt said Washingtonians should not expect Dunn to
use her post as a vehicle for sending pork back to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would have a greater opportunity to deliver the right
product to our region, but the right product may be cutting
spending and lowering taxes, allowing us not to have the Bonneville
Power Administration sold and not to have the (Snake River) dams
breached,'' Nethercutt said. ``Just bringing money home _ I don't
think that's her style. We all want good expenditures, but
legitimately so, and not just because they have our name on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dunn would clearly be in a position to help two major
projects in Washington state that depend on federal largesse _ the
cleanup of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and the construction of
the Sound Transit network of rail and bus lines and carpool lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer has always been interested in finding bipartisan
solutions, so that would probably be good news for our state,''
said Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat. Locke's spokesman, Keith Love,
said, ``Losing Tom Foley hurt us a lot. Anytime you have someone
from your state in a leadership position, it's got to be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn would also give a strong voice for Washington's corporate
citizens, including Boeing and Microsoft. Both companies are wary
of saying much for now, since they will have to work with whoever
wins. And Microsoft, in particular, has a very close relationship
with Armey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be inappropriate for Boeing to comment on the
internal decision-making process of either political party,'' said
Boeing spokesman Doug Kennett. ``That being said, Jennifer Dunn has
an excellent record serving the needs of her constituents, a large
number of whom are Boeing employees and their families. She has
also been an active supporter of Boeing objectives and programs,
and we are pleased to be considered one of her constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn claimed Tuesday to have called all 222 of her fellow
Republicans _ although she didn't reach all of them _ to make her
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Armey appeared to be holding support from many of the
long-serving and powerful GOP committee chairmen, while former
Seattle Seahawk Steve Largent, R-Okla., was gathering support from
the most conservative wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Although many committee chairmen are supporting Armey,
Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Penn., is
supporting Dunn, according to two sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is a whole lot different than the races we ran Nov.
3, because you have a defined number of people you need to talk to,
and you know exactly what your universe is,'' said Hastings. ``You
can't sell a sitting majority leader short, but there is probably
some softness that is perceived there, and that's why Largent and
Dunn are in.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration stepped up its threats
against Iraq on Tuesday, ruling out a negotiated end to President
Saddam Hussein's defiance of international arms inspectors while
threatening to significantly reduce his ability to make chemical
and biological weapons if he does not back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is not needed _ and there is no plan for it _ is
negotiations with Saddam Hussein,'' said State Department spokesman
James Rubin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton met with his senior national security advisers
at the White House for the second time in three days. They were
joined by senior commanders from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who are
refining plans to mount air and missile strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also telephoned the leaders of several important allies,
including Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain, Benjamin Netanyahu
of Israel, Jean Chretien of Canada and Massimo d'Alemo of Italy in
the U.S. campaign to isolate Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Tuesday's meeting at the White House, Defense
Secretary William Cohen announced that Clinton had agreed to speed
up by three days the arrival of a second aircraft carrier to the
Persian Gulf. The Enterprise, which recently left Norfolk, Va., and
its escort ships will now arrive by Nov. 23, joining the Dwight D.
Eisenhower and 13 other warships.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the Enterprise was being sent to replace the
Eisenhower, which is due to leave Nov. 19, and not to bolster U.S.
firepower in the region. Other officials said the fact the second
carrier would not be in the Gulf for 13 days did not rule out the
possibility of a strike before then, using the 170 aircraft and the
250 to 350 cruise missiles already poised in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Using some of the blunt language the administration has used in
previous confrontations with Saddam but largely avoided so far this
time, Cohen warned that time was ``running out'' for Saddam to
reverse his decision on Oct. 31 to end cooperation with United
Nations weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomacy always should have every opportunity to dance,''
Cohen said during an appearance with Tony Tan, the deputy prime
minister and defense minister of Singapore. ``But at some point a
dance has a beginning and an end.''
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, in what officials described as a
coordinator effort to intensify warnings to Saddam, Rubin said:
``This can't go on indefinitely. Saddam Hussein is not an abstract
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the latest showdown, the administration has declined
to issue an ultimatum and said there is no timetable for an attack.
But the White House has drawn contingency plans for Clinton's
departure for Asia, which it has already pushed back a day, to
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have said they still hope for a
diplomatic solution to avert the use of force, but they have done
nothing to promote one, insisting that only an unequivocal reversal
by Saddam is acceptable at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Security Council's credibility is on the line,'' Cohen
said. ``The U.N.'s credibility is on the line and, I think, U.S.
credibility as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's planners have drawn up two basic military
options: a swift, sharp strike that could begin at any time and a
larger, more punishing strike that would require the dispatch of
additional forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has significant air, naval and ground forces on
call for a larger strike, but so far has issued no orders to send
them.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's White House meeting, which lasted 90 minutes, the
president's questions focused on the effectiveness of strikes and
the potential for civilian casualties, administration officials
said. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry
Shelton, attended with other senior members of the Joint staff,
including the director of operations, Vice Adm. Vernon Clark, and
the director of intelligence, Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that any strike would be aimed at making sure Saddam
was unable to rebuild chemical and biological weapons, the task
that until Oct. 31 was being done by the United Nations inspection
team known as Unscom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly would consider the possibility of degrading his
capability of manufacturing these weapons of mass destruction or
the means of delivering them and posing a threat to the region,''
Cohen said, echoing warnings the administration delivered during
the last crisis with Iraq over the winter. ``Beyond that, I don't
think it helpful or productive for me to comment in terms of how
much damage could be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also announced that a Marine Corps attack force
aboard the Belleau Wood would also speed up its arrival in the
Persian Gulf. It is expected to replace a similar force now aboard
the Essex.

COMPAQ DIRECT-SELL PLAN LIKELY TO ANGER DEALERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Compaq Computer, the largest manufacturer of personal
computers, will start selling its machines directly by telephone
and over the Internet at prices lower than those now charged by
local dealers, people with knowledge of the company's new strategy
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the plan, scheduled to be announced Wednesday in New York,
is expected to anger the local dealers who sell the vast majority
of Compaq's computers, the company is taking the step to fend off a
potent rival, Dell Computer, which has always marketed its machines
directly and now threatens Compaq's market lead.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual attempt to mollify its dealers, Compaq is offering
to pay them a referral fee of 6 percent to 7 percent of the
purchase price on orders they send to Compaq's direct-sales unit.
</P>
<P>
   A Compaq spokesman declined to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   Antony Ibarguen, president of Tech Data Corp., one of the
largest computer wholesalers, said: ``There are dealers who tend to
be paranoid'' about a company that adopts a direct-marketing
strategy. ``They may not choose to sell that manufacture's
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers saw an opportunity in Compaq's move.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McDonnell, the marketing manager for Hewlett-Packard's
personal computer products, said, ``We hope that what Compaq is
doing will drive some resellers into our camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many analysts praised Compaq's move as essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq has no choice but to do something,'' said Robert
Anastasi, a computer stock analyst with Robinson Humphrey in
Atlanta. ``Dell has been so successful it has conditioned customers
to ask to buy direct. You can only say no for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has been losing market share to Dell, now No. 3, which
has grown faster and been more profitable because of the efficiency
of its direct-sales model.
</P>
<P>
   IBM Corp., the No. 2 personal computer seller, has also been
moving to sell more machines directly, although it has mainly
focused on its traditional base of large companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have the capacity to sell to all our customers
directly,'' said David Thomas, senior vice president of IBM in
charge of its PC group. ``For small businesses, our focus is on the
small resellers' channel. We will focus our direct efforts on the
large enterprise market.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's new effort is aimed mainly at small to medium-sized
businesses, a market that until now has bought fewer computers from
direct sellers than either big businesses or consumers have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small and midsized business market is growing rapidly, but
until now it has been very fragmented,'' said Andy Bose, president
of Access Media International-USA. The majority of small business
owners, he said, buy what the industry calls ``white box''
computers, machines assembled by local dealers. He said there was a
huge opportunity for direct sales to small businesses because many
companies were no longer buying their first computer. Companies are
more secure and need less help when replacing machines.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, small business will account for about 9 million of the
36 million computers that will be sold this year, Bose said.
</P>
<P>
   Long recognizing the threat from Dell, Compaq has spent years
improving its manufacturing efficiency and reducing inventory, a
costly hot potato in a market in which computer prices often fall
by 1 percent to 2 percent a week.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Compaq introduced a direct-to-consumer sales
effort via toll-free telephone calls. But the results have been
tepid, mainly because Compaq kept its prices high to avoid angering
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For nearly five years, we've been hearing that Compaq was
going to get more efficient to compete with the likes of Dell,
Gateway and Micron,'' said Joel Kocher, chief executive of Micron
Computer, a direct sales company that targets small business. ``To
date, their efforts have been less than successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's plan to build a ``hybrid'' model that combines direct
sales with dealer sales is fraught with peril, analysts say. NEC, a
huge Japanese computer manufacturer, shifted two years ago from
dealers to an all-direct-sales model and has seen its market share
plummet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot be all things to all people in all places in all
industries,'' said Tony Amico, an analyst with International Data.
``You need resellers that know about specific industries and who
can reach out to America beyond the big cities.''

 &QL; 
A Burlingame law firm has filed a class-action lawsuit accusing the
old BankAmerica Corp. and North Carolina's NationsBank Corp. of
cheating BofA shareholders by falsely claiming their $43 billion
combination was a ``merger of equals.''
<P>
   In a suit filed last week in San Francisco Superior Court,
Cotchett, Pitre &AMP; Simon characterized the transaction as a
NationsBank takeover of the old BofA, not a merger. As such, the
firm said, stockholders of the old BofA were entitled to a premium
price for their shares.
</P>
<P>
   The suit doesn't specify the amount of damages. But Bruce Simon,
the lead attorney on the case, said shareholders ultimately could
collect more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo resident Gregory Baker is plaintiff in the case,
acting on behalf of all California stockholders of the old BofA at
the end of September, when shareholders voted on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank, which now uses the BankAmerica name, has been
slapped with two dozen or more lawsuits since the transaction
closed September 30. The suits charge it with concealing trading
and investment banking losses. The bank said it made losses public
as it learned of them.
</P>
<P>
   This is apparently the first suit to focus on the issue of the
nature of the transaction itself, Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   In disclosure documents distributed to shareholders before the
vote to approve the transaction, the old BofA said both parties
were committed ``to a true merger of equals in which control is
shared, so no control premium would be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent, the proxy statement told the old BofA
shareholders the transaction was a merger of equals, it was
misleading,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank said both banks properly disclosed the nature of the
transaction to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there's any validity to these claims and we
intend to contest them vigorously,'' spokesman Richard Stilley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deal was announced in April, analysts have
consistently described it as a takeover, not a merger.
</P>
<P>
   After the combination took effect September 30, NationsBank
Chief Executive Officer Hugh McColl moved quickly to force out
David Coulter, his counterpart at the old BofA, extend his own
tenure and consolidate his grip on the combined organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a takeover, shareholders of the acquired company typically
get paid something above the market price of their stock in
exchange for giving up control. The typical takeover premium is 9
percent above the market price, Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   Independent legal experts said the suit raises an important
issue, but that BofA could defend itself by pointing out that
shareholders were told that NationsBank would control the combined
bank's board and chief executive slot, and that the headquarters
would remain in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   James Rockett, a banking lawyer with the San Francisco firm
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &AMP; Enersen, said those disclosures would
allow any reasonable person to realize NationsBank was actually
buying BofA. ``Those terms in and of themselves would show that the
transaction was less than a merger of equals,'' he said.

 It's Already Christmastime for Internet's Biggest Darling _ eBay  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
It's back.
<P>
   After a late summer slumber, Internet mania has returned with a
vengeance _ just in time for the holidays. And once again, there is
little sane justification for some of the ridiculous stock
valuations that many Web darlings are fetching.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the usual suspects took part in yesterday's Net stock
bonanza. Yahoo was up 8 percent, and Amazon.com closed about 4
percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most egregious examples of investor lunacy to hit
the Net is the run-up of eBay, the online auctioneer that has been
public for about a nanosecond. (It actually went public in
September.) Yesterday, eBay's shares vaulted $27.88 a share, or 27
percent, to close at $130.88.
</P>
<P>
   Yup. The stock soared nearly 28 whopping points in a single day.
And that was coming off Monday's 22 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   So, what in Santa's name could have triggered such a phenomenon?
Is eBay being bought by Microsoft? Has the e-tailer made a hostile
bid for Wal-Mart? Is eBay giving away free Beanie Babies?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Nothing like that. The Net stocks' rout was actually
triggered by short-selling and momentum buying, but more on that
later.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst most-credited by the Street for the surge is an
industry research report that boldly predicts that holiday shoppers
are going to buy more gifts over the Internet this year compared to
last. Jupiter Communications estimates that online shoppers are
expected to spend $2.3 billion during this holiday season, up from
$1.1 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stop the presses. More fruitcakes are going to be sold over the
Internet, so let's bid up electronic commerce and portal stocks
beyond comprehension during a downtrodden day for the Dow. Somebody
better e-mail  &LR; st.nick(at sign)betterbegood.com  &LR; and alert the
elves that they'll need to add capacity to their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not news. It's an excuse. Wall Street was beating (the
holiday traffic) tom-tom since last September,'' says David Simons,
managing partner of Digital Video Investments of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that just about any tangible event that might bring
more people to the Web is being used to hype the value of Internet
stocks, Simons says. While there are more sophisticated ways to
measure the growth in customers and revenues, there still is no
rational way to justify the current prices of many top Internet
stocks, Simons says.
</P>
<P>
   Consider CDNow. For most of October, the online seller of music
had been trading around $7 or $8 a share. Investors were so
unenthralled with the company's low-margin business of selling
compact discs over the Internet, not even its planned buyout of
competitor N2K could give its shares a lift.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday, CDNow shares skyrocketed about 50 percent to
close at $12. ``So what changed, did people realize that Christmas
was coming?'' Simons asks.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, hedge fund manager Andy Kessler thinks there is at
least one way to measure a Web stock's value. Kessler, of Velocity
Capital Management in Palo Alto, argues that electronic commerce or
portal companies can justify their lofty stock prices by defining
their growth in terms of gaining new customers.
</P>
<P>
   As long as sales and marketing expenses are used judiciously to
generate new customers, the company is building meaningful market
share that will bring greater profits down the road. This approach
demonstrates ``that there is an underlying business,` Kessler says.
</P>
<P>
   However, what's actually driving Internet mania are market
forces that have little to do with Santa or Web site visits,
Kessler says. Such dramatic stock spikes are likely caused by
short-sellers that need to cover negative bets made during the
recent bear market and by fund managers trying to make up lost
ground during the late innings of a difficult year, Kessler says.
The shorts ``were getting squeezed,'' Kessler says.
</P>
<P>
   Simons agrees. What's more, he contends that sell-side analysts
are fueling the Internet fire by raising the target prices on
stocks they cover. Last summer, before the market meltdown,
brokerage house analysts began to downgrade stocks, such as
Amazon.com, once the stocks hit share prices projected by their
models. But this time around, analysts are raising their price
targets _ which can often give stocks short-term boosts, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just yesterday, a Goldman Sachs analyst published a
research note that raised his price target for eBay to $150 and
increased his estimates for 1999 revenues to $84.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Simons thinks that brokerage analysts are
not-so-subtly trying to give the investment bank sides of their
firms some help. It's no secret that initial offerings are down,
which is hurting the bottom lines at investment banks that perform
a significant amount of technology underwriting. During this latest
wave of Net mania, you are likely to see more cheerleading by
sell-side analysts, Simons says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's different this time around is that the Street has a
greater incentive to keep the market going and give the IPO market
a lift,'' Simons says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reticence of institutions to back Internet IPOs,
and keeping the mania perking is just what the banks need to get
the institutions off the bench,'' Simons says.

 Intel Touts New Strategy At Oracle's Big Trade Show  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost  
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Intel Corp. is pushing into the high end of the computing market,
and yesterday it touted that move at a major trade show sponsored
by database leader Oracle.
<P>
   Intel, which already sells the lion's share of microprocessors
for personal computers, is aggressively seeking to sell the chips
for servers and workstations.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, the Santa Clara chip giant will devote half its
development dollars to its high-end efforts, Intel Executive Vice
President Paul Otellini said in an interview following his speech
at the Oracle Open World, which is packing the Moscone Center in
San Francisco this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge investment, a multibillion-dollar investment, and
we've spent years to get here and we're not done yet,'' Otellini
said. But with increasing demand for speedy chips, Otellini said,
``The wind is with us on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  More than 18,000 people are attending the Oracle show, which
ends tomorrow. Oracle is the world's second-largest software
company and the biggest maker of the massive database software that
runs such applications as airline bookings and credit card
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Such high-volume software needs powerful chips. ``It had been
the realm of the supercomputer,'' Otellini said. ``It used to be
you'd need three guys in white coats to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Databases will move away from the mainframe and toward the
desktop as chips get faster and that will give Intel a leg up, said
analyst Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Intel's manufacturing capability and its ability to
pack so many transistors onto a chip, a move to Intel chips for
high-end machines is ``almost inevitable,'' Hutcheson said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  That's what Otellini hopes. Where once companies needed to
buy $40,000 or $50,000 Sun or Silicon Graphics machines, he said,
now they can spend $4,000 or $5,000 for the same performance.
</P>
<P>
   Chip technology will continue to advance, he said, ultimately
bringing mainframe-level performance out of the ``back end'' of a
company's computer operations and right onto front-line workers'
desktops.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this back end is going to enable a whole different
class of applications for users,'' Otellini said. ``Nobody can deal
with seas and seas of numbers. They have to see it in pictures ...
and that's all done on a desktop. ... It's pretty compelling, but
it takes a lot of processing power.''

 Experts Crucial When Starting Out  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Question: &LR;  Are there some outside experts new entrepreneurs need &LR; 
 &LR; to assist them in starting a business? Normally, start-up funds &LR; 
 &LR; are tight and new owners avoid hiring people they think are &LR; 
 &LR; going to cost a fortune. &LR;
<P>
   Answer: It's no fun spending money before you make it, but
experts suggest that it is important to tap a few professionals
before embarking on a new venture.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Fred Steingold, author of the popular ``Legal Guide for
Starting &AMP; Running a Small Business'' published by Nolo Press
( &LR; www.nolo.com &LR; ) names four: a lawyer to help determine the best
structure (sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation or limited
liability company) and to take care of required filings, a CPA to
answer tax questions and to recommend sound bookkeeping and payroll
practices, an insurance agent to make sure the business has the
right coverage and possibly a real estate broker to find the best
location.
</P>
<P>
   Steingold has written self-help guides, including legal forms,
for small businesses and believes ``self-help types can save a lot
of money _ especially on lawyer and CPA fees.'' But he recommends
that ``even the most intrepid self-helper may want to briefly
double-check with a professional before proceeding. Mistakes can be
costly.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: I want to start an artisan bakery in a small, northern
California coastal community between Humboldt County and San
Francisco. How do I do market research for locations that meet my
criteria for potential, growth, competition, demographics,
community character and so forth. I am currently living in another
state and cannot afford to travel up and down the coast to make a
personal search.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Deciding on where to locate a business without a visit
probably makes about as much sense as buying a house without
checking the foundations and visiting the neighborhood or buying a
car without seeing how it runs.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Levinson, author of the Guerrilla Marketing series,
recommends driving up and down the California coast, checking the
towns that appeal to you and talking with business owners and
others. ``It might take you two weeks, but that will be a very wise
investment of time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can do plenty of homework on the Internet and
through the phone book. Levinson suggests checking out Web sites
for coastal towns and their chambers of commerce and going to the
library to peruse yellow page directories for the 707 and 415 area
codes.
</P>
<P>
   If the town has the right population and no or few little
bakeries, that might be a cue for you to open yours.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Five years ago when I was going into business, I found all
sorts of hints. What I really need now are tips on how to get out
of business. My shipping and mailbox store is less than successful
and after much heartache and disappointment and five years without
a vacation, I want out. It's a sole proprietorship with annual
sales of about $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Knowing how to bail out of a business is as important as
getting in, just as it is in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   New York management consultant Stephen Schiffman, who just wrote
his  &LR; twelfth  &LR; 12th book, ``Make It Your Business,'' suggests
putting out word to lawyers, accountants and consultants whose
clients might be interested in your business. You might also place
an ad in trade industry publications, newspapers or online sites.
Or put out word at an industry trade show where you can also meet
potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, find someone who already operates a business like
yours in your area and may want to expand into your location.
</P>
<P>
   If you are down on your business, Schiffman instructs, ``Don't
let it show.'' Be honest but put the best face on the business;
make sure things are neat and the records tidy.
</P>
<P>
   If the prospective buyer suspects it is a distress sale, he or
she will certainly not pay you a fair price, which Schiffman
suggests might be four to seven times your pretax earnings.

 Beef Up Patient Privacy Rules, Health Groups Say  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Consumer and patient rights groups must move quickly to put privacy
safeguards in place before health providers launch a national
database of medical records.
<P>
   That call to action was issued yesterday in Oakland, where
health advocacy groups spent the day talking about the government's
push to make all doctors, pharmacists and insurers start using the
same record-keeping computer systems within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are worried we'll create a national database of health
information before we have adequate privacy rules to say what can
and can't be done with the data,'' said Janlori Goldman, director
of the Health Privacy Project at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting in Oakland was the fifth in a series of privacy
gatherings in the state sponsored by Consumer's Union and the
California Health Care Foundation. Goldman, the key expert at the
session, is organizing similar consumer lobbying efforts in 10
other states.
</P>
<P>
   This group is trying to influence the federal government's push
for what is called ``administrative simplification.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is in
the final stages of publishing regulations that would require all
health care entities, from doctors to insurance companies, to adopt
a single set of computerized record-keeping systems.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Karp, chief information officer for Oakland's California
Health Care Foundation, said uniform record-keeping would have
benefits that go beyond paying bills or detecting fraud.
Computerized records would be easier to find if patients move or
change providers.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers would also be able to scan millions of patient
records to see which treatments proved most effective, presumably
giving that information back to doctors so that they can make
better diagnoses in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Though they see the benefits of computerization, consumer
advocates are worried about the lack of privacy safeguards.
Although HHS is expected to publish its computerization rules late
this year or early next year, Congress has so far stalled on
passing privacy legislation, Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no federal rules that protect the confidentiality of
medical records,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of clear guidelines, some medical information is
already being used in marketing campaigns, such as pregnant women
getting solicitations from diaper companies. Moreover, Goldman said
people are coming forward to claim they lost their jobs after
employers learned they were taking medications for depression or
had other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   With national medical databases expected to take shape in the
next few years, consumer advocates say there is a pressing need to
set rules for how information can be used.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees at yesterday's meeting spanned the range from
immigrant groups, worried that Immigration and Naturalization would
tap into records to pursue illegals, to women's groups concerned
that abortion-seekers would become targets for violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women who have insurance pay cash for an abortion because
they don't want to have a paper trail,'' said Debra Titmus,
regional director for Planned Parenthood in San Rafael.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's privacy meeting was a prelude to a larger gathering
planned by the California Health Care Foundation for January in
Oakland.

MORTGAGE LENDER SETS SIGHTS ON INSURANCE BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ Countrywide Home Loans Inc. is quietly
beefing up a new, 300-person division that will sell all kinds of
consumer insurance, a potentially lucrative development for the
nation's largest mortgage lender.
</P>
<P>
   The Calabasas, Calif.-based company hasn't publicized its
intentions. In fact, the insurance division results aren't even
mentioned in Countrywide's latest annual report to its
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But the Daily News has learned that Countrywide will soon begin
a high-profile, aggressive campaign to offer a full range of
insurance coverage _ homeowners, life, disability and auto _ to the
public, including consumers who aren't Countrywide customers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company announced a new Web site Tuesday for
selling the insurance online, at www.cwinsurance.com.
</P>
<P>
   The company won't underwrite the policies, but will serve as an
agent for major insurers, including Aetna, Safeco and American
International Group Inc., the nation's largest publicly traded
insurer. AIG is the majority owner of Woodland Hills-based 20th
Century Insurance Co., one of the West's largest auto and home
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the first time we've decided to go to the
consumer directly and really reach out to the non-Countrywide loan
customers,'' said John Ingersoll, senior vice president of business
development for Countrywide Insurance Services Inc., the Simi
Valley-based division.
</P>
<P>
   With a small staff and little marketing, Countrywide already has
some 250,000 to 300,000 insurance customers, Ingersoll said. Of
those, about 33 percent have homeowners policies, 40 percent bought
life insurance, and 5 percent to 10 percent hold auto insurance
policies, he said. Many have multiple policies.
</P>
<P>
   Now the subsidiary is gearing up to bring more policyholders
into its fold by increasing the size of its staff over the next few
months. Countrywide Insurance has scheduled an open house Saturday
at its Simi Valley headquarters to fill dozens of positions for
agents, analysts and managers.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the subsidiary moved out of Countrywide's Simi Valley
loan servicing headquarters to a 45,000-square-foot facility
nearby. The subsidiary now has about 225 employees, including 75
licensed agents, Ingersoll said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of agents should increase 33 percent by year's end,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're growing so quickly that in terms of agents and analysts,
we're just looking to increase our staff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts contacted by the Daily News on Monday said they knew
little or nothing about the budding business.
</P>
<P>
   But Countrywide's move into the insurance business appears to be
evidence of the company's overall effort to move beyond its core
mortgage business, said Michael Hodes, a securities analyst for
Goldman Sachs in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to fit in with that,'' Hodes said, referring to the
relatively new insurance business. ``They've definitely been trying
to diversify their business; they've had some success.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair Sanford, an insurance analyst for Hoefer &AMP; Arnett in San
Francisco, estimated that the homeowners, auto and life insurance
industries collectively generate more than $500 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Auto insurance alone is ``on the order of $130 billion,''
Sanford said, adding, ``What I'm seeing in California is some
intense competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides big insurance brokers like AIG, Countrywide will be up
against hundreds of independent agents as well as online insurance
shopping services like InsWeb, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Countrywide seems to be in a good position to succeed in
the new business, given its daily contact with customers who are
sure to be interested in various types of insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In the insurance game, it's the underwriters, not agents, who
are in the risky end of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Countrywide's relationship with so many consumers ``seems to me
to lend itself nicely to leveraging this sort of product,'' Sanford
said.
</P>
<P>
   For October, Countrywide funded $8.5 billion in mortgage home
loans, an all-time monthly high for the company. Pipeline loans in
process totaled $16.7 billion, the company said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ric Hill, senior vice president of relations for 20th Century
Industries, said Countrywide's venture into the insurance market is
evidence of the healthy state of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having another player in the marketplace is good for customers
as a whole,'' Hill said.

COLLEGE ACCREDITATION SYSTEM OUT OF CONTROL, ADMINISTRATORS SAY
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you draw the line between diploma mills and storefront
``law schools,'' on the one hand, and programs in higher education
that meet at least minimum standards?
</P>
<P>
   The answer has long been an accrediting process that gives a
stamp of approval to worthy programs and institutions and withholds
it from others.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, academic administrators, like those who raised
the issue at the annual meeting of the American Association of
Universities at Berkeley last month, believe that the system is out
of control. They argue that visiting inspection teams tie up
valuable staff time by asking hundreds of questions on issues large
and small, a process that costs Duke University, for example,
$250,000 for each once-a-decade review. Some educational leaders
are concerned that many accrediting agencies wield such power that
they threaten to distort institutional priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a huge problem,'' said Malcolm Gillis, president
of Rice University in Houston. ``The accreditors are not interested
in what or how the students learn, but how many square feet of
classroom space we have per student.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arthur Wise, president of the National Council for
Accreditation of Teacher Education, defends the system. ``We know
we're not popular with college presidents,'' he said, ``but the
fact is the public needs to know. There must be accountability.
That's the mission of my organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The tension arises from the diffuse system of higher education
in the United States. Unlike many nations that have a central
authority dictating, the American system relies on voluntary,
nongovernmental peer review.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the accreditors in higher education come in two types.
First, there are the eight regional accrediting agencies that
certify institutions in their areas every decade. The second type
consists of specialized or occupational agencies that deal with
subjects like sociology and fields like medicine and law.
</P>
<P>
   The first type, the regionals, as they are known, focus on broad
criteria like fiscal stability and administration effectiveness,
and potentially wield great power. A denial of accreditation by a
regional can be a death knell, leading to a denial of federal loans
and grants and frightening away students and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, when it became known that the North Central
Association of Colleges and Schools, one of the eight regionals,
was about to withdraw accreditation from the venerable Phillips
University in Enid, Okla., because it had failed to correct such
deficiencies as proof of fiscal stability and the ability to
attract a sufficient number of students, the university declared
bankruptcy and closed its doors.
</P>
<P>
   Only a very few institutions, like Bob Jones University, a
well-financed evangelical Christian university in Greenville, S.C.,
can survive without accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Ruderman, vice provost for academic services at Duke
University, puts the cost of the process to the university at
$250,000, not including the many hours put in by faculty and
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This last time around,'' Ms. Ruderman said, ``they told us and
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that we were not in
compliance with their requirement to demonstrate that graduates
were competent in the use of computers. It wasn't that the
graduates were not competent, but that they said we had failed to
demonstrate their competence. So we had to start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   A major complaint against the regionals, however, is not that
they are college-killers but that _ intimidated by their own power
_ they shrink from using it, and allow substandard institutions to
persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What good is accrediting if almost nobody ever gets
rejected?'' said James F. Carlin, the tough-talking chairman of the
Massachusetts Board of Higher Education. ``It's just a wet kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Eaton, president of the Council for Higher Education
Accreditation which approves, or disapproves, accrediting agencies,
counters by observing that the peer review process is intended not
merely to separate winners from losers but to help good
institutions achieve greater efficiency and form strategic plans.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The other type of accrediting agency, the specialized or
occupational groups, is of even greater concern to educational
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one denies Wise's point that many of these
organizations, which certify everything from dental schools to
teacher training programs, are necessary. Who would oppose the
accreditation or licensing of schools of pharmacy or engineering?
</P>
<P>
   But academic administrators are troubled by the fact that there
are so many of these agencies _ at least 75, according to an
estimate by the Association of Specialized and Professional
Accreditors, which represents 42 of them. A medical school may be
examined by 40 or 50 separate accrediting agencies. And answering
all the questions posed by visiting teams of accreditors can
swallow large amounts of faculty and administrative attention and
effort.
</P>
<P>
   At least occasionally, the accreditors respond to criticism.
Just last week, leaders of the Accreditation Board for Engineering
and Technology and the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board
approved a merger that, they said, would save colleges money and
time by reducing site visits.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than the red tape, in the view of some educators, is that
many specialized accreditors have lobbied themselves into the
position of gatekeeper of federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They blackmail us,'' said John V. Lombardi, the president of
the University of Florida and like Gillis one of the few top
university leaders willing to discuss the issue openly. ``If they
say your department of astrophysics needs 12 spaceships and you
have only 10, you had better get the other two.''
</P>
<P>
   He added wryly, ``You take the money from the history department
because it doesn't have an accrediting lobby to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't go along with their demands,'' Lombardi said,
``they can deny accreditation in whatever it is that they
represent, and then, even if they don't control federal loans and
grants, they can tell the state Legislature that you lost your
accreditation and the Legislature will fire all of the top people
who run the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want more classroom space, you give it to them,'' he
continued. ``If they want a 500-page report written in green ink,
you give it to them in green ink.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Magrath, president of the National Association of State
Universities and Land-Grant Colleges and a former president of the
University of Missouri, recalled doing battle with a powerful
specialized accreditor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was president of the University of Missouri, the law
school at our Columbia campus was housed in a relatively old but
serviceable building,'' he said. ``The accrediting committee from
the American Bar Association insisted that we should have a new
building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, maybe we didn't look like Harvard or Yale,'' he
continued, ``but we were doing just fine in having our students
pass the bar exam, and by any other reasonable standard, but they
told us that if we didn't get a new building, our accreditation
would be in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went ballistic,'' Magrath recalled. ``But they withdrew our
full-term accreditation, and it took us getting a new building
before they would restore it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was that you had people making decisions about the
use of university resources who didn't have an overall
perspective,'' Magrath said.
</P>
<P>
   College administrators who are loath to cross swords with these
lobbies won a partial victory two years ago when the U.S.
Department of Justice, aroused by complaints that an accrediting
committee of the American Bar Association was dictating such
matters as the salaries of professors of law and the number of
books in law school libraries, took the association to court.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting consent decree directed the bar group to concern
itself with academic quality instead of resources. Since then, some
college administrators have cited the consent decree in bargaining
with accrediting agencies, but they are not always able to persuade
the specialized accreditors to scale back their demands.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the struggle continues. The land-grant college group
recently adopted a strongly worded resolution declaring that the
member universities would insist that accreditors limit themselves
to the consideration of academic quality and leave the allocation
of resources to the college administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our resolution is not binding,'' said David Shulenburger,
provost of the University of Kansas at Lawrence, who drafted it.
``But it spread the word about the consent decree and made it clear
that if the agencies say they want two lamps in every office, we
can say no.''

 &HT;    T-shirt motherboard reads vitals on new level
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By most accounts the flight of the space shuttle
carrying John Glenn and others last week was a fine success. But
Sundaresan Jayaraman, a sharp-eyed Georgia Tech researcher, thought
it could have gone a little bit better.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, which he read about in news accounts, concerned a
troublesome system of electronic leads that had to be attached to
Glenn to get readings on his vital signs during sleep experiments.
News stories reported it took an hour to get the system attached,
and they had to do it four times.
</P>
<P>
   Jayaraman, who leads a team of specialists in the School of
Textile and Fiber Engineering, has come up with just the ticket
that could have saved time _ a huge consideration on a busy and
expensive mission where, he calculates, astronauts' time comes to
about $593,000 an hour each.
</P>
<P>
   What Jayaraman and his team have fashioned is a wearable
motherboard, a kind of light T-shirt that contains a web of wiring
capable of monitoring many life signs at once. And the shirt, which
has been featured in Life magazine, could sell for about $25,
Jayaraman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light, practical and inexpensive, it could be available for
monitoring continuously,'' said Jayaraman.
</P>
<P>
   The garment could be configured in many ways, he said, but it
could certainly keep continuous readings on heart rate,
temperature, breathing and other functions, which could be fed into
a box and communicated to remote centers such as the space
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The primary purpose of the wearable motherboard, as it happens,
is to be worn by soldiers and sailors in the field, where it could
record injuries and wounds, and transmit the information to medical
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Signals would indicate exactly where a bullet pierced a
soldier's body, and readings of vital signs would indicate the
severity of the injury. Also, the system could be programmed to
indicate the exact whereabouts of the injured trooper in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In multiple injuries, the system could give information for
grading the injuries so that assistance could be given according to
priority,'' Jayaraman said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest generation of the electronic T-shirt even has a means
to transmit voice to the monitoring center.
</P>
<P>
   Jayaraman, who might be a serious marketing man if he weren't so
busy being a scientist, said the system could have a great variety
of applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system could be used by safety forces, particularly
firefighters, where you could measure oxygen content of the person
as well as other vital signs,'' Jayaraman said.
</P>
<P>
   This automatic monitoring of vital signs could be very important
for firefighters, where the excitement and adrenaline rush could
sometimes mask the real health dangers to the actual firefighter
but could be very apparent to medical technicians monitoring them
at work.
</P>
<P>
   In the area of health care, the wearable motherboard could help
monitor the condition of post-operation patients, even in their
homes after they leave the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as the home security business grows,'' said Jayaraman,
``this wearable technology just might spawn a new industry for the
effective and reliable monitoring of patients at home and maybe
transform health care delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Research on the wearable motherboard has been born mostly by the
Navy Department, Tech officials say. Working with Jayaraman are
several others, including Rangaswamy Rajamanickam, a research
engineer; research associates Sungmee Park and Chandramohan
Gopalsamy; and Joohyun Hong, a research assistant.

REP. BRIAN BILBRAY: COMPLAINTS FROM A MAINSTREAM DISTRICT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shortly before Congress adjourned last month,
Speaker Newt Gingrich approached Rep. Brian Bilbray, one of the two
dozen Republicans whom Democrats were concentrating on ousting in
this year's elections, and asked what Republican leaders could do
to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I snapped at him,'' Bilbray recalled last week. ``I told him,
`It's a little late to be asking now, Newt.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bilbray survived in last week's election _ barely. In his 49th
District of California, which includes about half of San Diego and
runs to the Mexican border, he defeated a San Diego Councilwoman,
Christine Kehoe, by 4,000 votes, less than 3 percent of the votes
cast.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign, he said, his party's leaders were an
albatross around his neck. ``All this talk about impeachment, all
this right-wing jargon,'' Bilbray complained. ``It's extremely
frustrating for those of us who represent mainstream districts. It
puts off people in mainstream America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilbray is not a typical Republican congressman. He is one of
the few who do not have safe seats. Of the 212 Republicans who ran
for re-election last week, only five were defeated and only 14 won
re-election by margins of less than 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But these few swing seats determine the balance of power in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Bilbray was interviewed at length after the
election to see what he thought his party needed to do to make sure
these seats remained Republican so the party could maintain control
of the House in the next election. He was interviewed again over
the weekend, after Gingrich announced he would step down as
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Bilbray's answer, not surprisingly, was that the party's policy
makers needed to pay less attention to the firebrands whose seats
are not in jeopardy and more to Republicans like him who are
hanging on by a thread.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders, he said, should concentrate less on attacking President
Clinton and ``throwing raw meat to the base,'' and more on matters
like taxes and Social Security that ``mainstream voters care
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old Bilbray was first elected in the Republican
sweep in 1994, defeating a Democrat, Lynn Schenck. He endorsed
Gingrich's Contract With America. And for the most part, he has
voted with the leadership, although he broke ranks occasionally, on
issues like gun control, campaign finance and state financing for
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   This year he was one of only nine Republicans who voted against
his party's plan to cut taxes by $100 billion over the next five
years. He argued that making the Social Security system solvent was
a higher priority than cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bilbray said he was in debt to Gingrich for giving him a plum
assignment to the Commerce Committee, which has broader
jurisdiction than any other committee in the House except two, Ways
and Means, and Appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   But Bilbray added, ``What the leadership does on policy, that
makes much more of a difference to us than all the money and all
the assignments and all the influence in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilbray said that he had received several calls at home from
candidates running for leadership positions who wanted his support.
``I give them all a 15-minute dissertation on the systemic problem
with the structure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as he sees it, is that the current leaders and
those who hope to replace them come from safe districts and they
reflect the views of those districts. But those are not the more
moderate views of the swing districts like his or of the country as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dick Armey talks to his constituents,'' Bilbray said,
referring to the majority leader, a Texan, ``they love what he's
saying, but his district doesn't represent the broad consensus of
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilbray said he was especially upset by how Rep. Bob Barr of
Georgia, a staunch conservative on the House Judiciary Committee,
had been allowed to become a GOP spokesman on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Bob Barr,'' Bilbray said. ``I'm sure he's very popular
in his district, but he's the worst spokesman imaginable in the
49th.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does he expect from those who emerge as the new leaders
of the party in the House?
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect them to take counsel from us, to integrate those of
us from marginal districts into their policy-making,'' Bilbray
replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them,'' he concluded, ``that if they don't, their
leadership will be only two years long.''

BIG TOBACCO AND 8 STATES ARE NEAR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., N.C., N.Y., N.D., Okla., Pa. Wash)  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiators for eight states and representatives of the tobacco
industry have largely finished work on a deal to settle state
lawsuits against cigarette companies and could announce it as soon
as Friday, two lawyers involved in the talks said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the settlement could reach $200 billion, depending
on the number of states that participate, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general of the eight states involved in the talks
_ California, Colorado, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Washington _ expect to brief 38 other
states on the plan in the hope of their joining the settlement. The
38 states will have about a week to decide whether to take part in
the deal or to continue pursuing independent legal action, the
lawyers said. The remaining four states, Florida, Minnesota,
Mississippi and Texas, have reached individual settlements that,
combined, exceed $40 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement is the result of more than five months of
talks, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Christine Gregoire of Washington, the lead
negotiator for the states, was traveling to New York and could not
be reached for comment. Other state attorneys general declined to
comment. Tobacco executives and industry lawyers also declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of RJR
Nabisco Holdings Corp.; Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of the
Loews Corp., and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of BAT
Industries, have agreed to pay as much as $200 billion over 25
years to settle lawsuits seeking to recover Medicaid costs for
treating smokers, the lawyers involved in the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have also apparently agreed to remove cigarette
billboard advertisements, pay more than $1 billion for anti-tobacco
advertisements, halt distribution of merchandise with tobacco logos
and finance a national foundation that would try to reducing
smoking by teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement could lead to the largest civil settlement in U.S.
history and would free tobacco companies of their most serious
legal challenge.  &QL;

 Being Your Own Boss  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Tara Phelps realized it was time to go into business for herself
after she received a relocation request from Hewlett-Packard last
year.
<P>
   For the previous two years, Phelps had been a project manager
for the Palo Alto company's medical products group, where she
successfully handled proposals for such major clients as 3M and
Columbia HCA and helped solve data management problems.
</P>
<P>
   When her division went through a major downsizing, Phelps was
offered what she calls ``a wonderful position'' in Bethesda, Md.
But after putting in 80-hour weeks for HP, much of it on the road
and in the air, Phelps decided she was ready for a change.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Rather than create a business, Phelps elected to find an
existing one where she could apply her experience in process
development and design.
</P>
<P>
   She wound up buying a business from a friend who owned Novazonic
Semiconductor Products, a little Santa Clara maker of wet process
tanks that are used for various etching and cleaning applications
in the manufacturing of semiconductors and flat-panel displays.
</P>
<P>
   For Phelps and others who have spent years working for others,
the experience of launching a small business is both liberating and
sobering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question is whether you're prepared to give up the
security of a paycheck and the structure of a corporation. The
trade-off is independence, freedom of action and the opportunity to
earn a lot more money,'' said Fred Steingold, attorney and author
of a ``Legal Guide for Starting and Running a Small Business''
published by Nolo Press.
</P>
<P>
   Owners who take on something they are interested in and know
something about are likeliest to succeed, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Steingold also suggests you consider these things before you
make the leap:
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you know how to accomplish the principal tasks of the
business?
</P>
<P>
   _ If the business involves working with others, do you handle
this well? If not, consider a one-person business.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do you understand basic business tasks, such as bookkeeping
and how to prepare a profit-and-loss forecast and cash-flow
analysis? If not, learn before, not after, you begin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Does the business fit your personality? If you are a shy
introvert, avoid businesses that require lots of personal selling.
If you are easily bored, find a business that lets you regularly
deal with new material.
</P>
<P>
   In Phelp's case, she was ready to leave. ``I had enough
experience with corporate America,'' said the divorced mother of
two, who got a business degree at Woodbury University in Los
Angeles while working full time in computer departments of several
companies. ``I wanted to have my own company with a solid product
and the opportunity to grow if managed properly.''
</P>
<P>
   She  &LR; said  &LR; told her friend who owned Novazonic Semiconductor
Products that she wanted to do something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `like what?' and I said run a business like yours.''
She ended up buying Novazonic a little over a year ago using her
savings from HP and some financial assistance from the previous
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps declined to reveal the purchase price except to say it
was ``six figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the semiconductor equipment industry peaked just as
Phelps took over the company and has been in the doldrums ever
since, Novazonic has flourished with annual sales having jumped by
nearly 50 percent _ to $650,000 this year from $450,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps, whose staff has grown from two to five, attributes her
success to focusing ``not on selling products but on solving
problems and creating relationships.'' For example, by adopting
computer-aided design, she was able to get drawings of product
modifications to clients much more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that she ignored some advice and went after
competitors' customers.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps has several tips to would-be entrepreneurs:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have faith and be persistent. Watch out for naysayers and
gloom and doom talk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be resilient. Like Indiana Jones, you have to be able to
address any type of challenge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have vision. You must have a mission statement and business
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps' goal is to create a $5 million company within five
years.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Going the Consulting Route
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Rochwarger Vared, 43, took another route to make the
transition from being a cog in a big corporation to economic self
control.
</P>
<P>
   Rochwarger Vared bailed out of her job as corporate training
officer at Wells Fargo Bank in 1984 to broaden her experience at a
consulting firm before starting her own business, Strategic
Resources, three years later.
</P>
<P>
   She got her inspiration from books by John Naisbitt and Alvin
Toffler on the coming information age and growth of cottage
industries. What would be useful in the future, Rochwarger Vered
decided, was an outsourcing firm that could provide companies with
professional talent whenever and wherever they were needed.
</P>
<P>
   She turned out to be right. The Irvine company has an office in
Alameda headed by another Wells Fargo graduate and places more than
200 consultants in jobs each year. Work ranges from interim project
management to handling marketing assignments and Year 2000 computer
problems. Strategic Resources consultants generate about $5 million
in annual revenue and the company takes 20 percent of the project
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are cutting full-time jobs and hiring consultants
for the same work.
</P>
<P>
   But before you join the ranks of outsourced professionals,
Rochwarger Vered suggests that you have enough money to live on for
at least six months. Also be ready for nonstop networking among
colleagues, friends and acquaintances to win business and be ready
to take orders rather than give them.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Schiffman, author of ``Make It Your Business'' and a New
York management consultant, advises that starting a business
``requires a certain amount of obsession.'' In the first year or
two, you probably shouldn't plan on a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; The Drawbacks
</P>
<P>
   Although owning your own business is often portrayed as the
American dream, Schiffman says many of the assumptions are myths.
Chief among them is the idea ``I'm free! I no longer have a boss!''
Entrepreneurs not only have to account to themselves, Schiffman
notes, ``but hundreds or thousands of people called customers,''
who are more demanding and more nitpicky than most any supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   There are countless success stories of entrepreneurs striking it
rich. But many who heed the small business siren song end up in the
financial ditch.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of new businesses don't last a year, according
to Cognetics Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., economic research firm.
Another 15 percent drop out the second year and 8 percent disappear
in the third. After five years only half of new businesses are
still around.
</P>
<P>
   But statistics on business closings can be misleading. Although
many dropouts failed to meet their financial goals, Cognetics
President David Birch notes that only 5 to 10 percent of them were
actually insolvent, owing more money than they had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most are not failures,'' he said. ``They played the game for a
while and had more at the end than at the beginning.'' But often,
they didn't have enough to stick with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know how hard it is to start and grow a
business,'' said Birch. ``Often they start with a product or
service, something they are good at, but underestimate the need to
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Neophyte entrepreneurs also frequently underestimate the time it
will take to break even &UR; . &LR;  Another common problem is failure to
assess the likely stress and toll it may take on their families.

   BOEING-TOOL (Seattle) _ Another tool has been found in the
rudder of a Boeing airplane, this time on a new 777 operated by
EgyptAir. The plane had been flying with a hammer in a ``critical''
part of the rudder since the place was delivered last year. The
16-ounce hammer, left in the rudder during assembly of the 777, was
found by airline mechanics during a recent inspection. By the time
it was discovered, it had already caused two small cracks inside
the rudder, apparently from bouncing around during flight.

NEELY TO PRACTICE WITH BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There was no stall designated for him at the practice
rink in suburban Wilmington Tuesday, no equipment with the familiar
No. 8 on it, no outward sign that he was about to join his former
team on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   However, when the Bruins assemble Wednesday at 11:45 a.m. at the
Ristuccia Center, retired (and perhaps future?) right wing Cam
Neely will be with them.
</P>
<P>
   Neely, who hung up his skates before the 1996-97 season because
of a chronic hip injury, has been working out hard with an eye
toward a comeback and is now ready to step up his regimen. In the
next 10 days, he will practice with the Bruins, determining whether
the goal is possible or whether his NHL playing career really, and
finally, is over.
</P>
<P>
   After a cautious start in September, Neely, 33, has felt well
enough to take it this far. Sources said that in recent days, he
has skated several times with Bruins head coach Pat Burns and
assistant Jacques Laperriere, both of whom endorsed Neely's
participation in a full-team workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been encouraged in my workouts so far in that my hip
has been sore after skating but the pain has not lingered,'' said
Neely in a statement. ``In talking with (therapist Dan Dyrek), we
decided that although I have been skating on a high tempo on my
own, the only way to determine if I have a realistic chance of
playing again is to increase my workouts in a normal hockey
practice. Dan believes that we will not be able to make an accurate
assessment until after 10 days to two weeks at a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said before that if I make a return to the game, it
will be this season and now is the time to take this next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely added in the statement that he doesn't want his
participation to become a distraction for the team, though it is
bound to have an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be happy to give a brief update when I get off the ice
each day,'' he said, ``but we will not have any substantive
announcement until after the entire trial period is over and we
have reevaluated my hip.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely, who became a father for the first time less than a week
ago when his wife, Paulina, gave birth to son Jack Cameron, last
played for the Bruins on Feb. 21, 1996, in Anaheim, Calif. But his
hip was too sore to allow him to continue his career. When he made
his tearful retirement announcement before training camp that fall,
Neely thought he would need an eventual hip replacement. Now it
seems that this therapy could make it possible for him to do more.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely to be a strange dressing room for Neely. Only Ray
Bourque, Steve Heinze, and Don Sweeney remain from the team with
which he last suited up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be really weird for me,'' said Bourque. ``I know
it's going to be great. It's going to be a situation where nobody
knows where it's going to go from when he starts skating. We'll all
just have to wait and see how it goes. If it only lasted for a
month or it lasts to the point where he's able to play, it would be
great being out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, it will be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque said he and Neely have kept in touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen him much but I've talked to him on the phone
quite a bit,'' said Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   The long layoff will be a factor. It has been 2 years 9 months
since Neely played.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why nobody knows what to expect or how this is all
going to go,'' said Bourque. ``Cam, I'm sure, doesn't know himself.
I don't know. I don't know how it's going to unfold or how it's
going to end up, but he's going to give it a chance, give it a
shot, and see how he feels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all keep our fingers crossed and hope they go well for
him. If they go well for him, it could mean something special for
everybody, but it's so far off. All we're going to do is welcome
him here, and I know for me, it's going to be fun to see him out
there and try to get to somewhere which for him would really be
great. He'd be happy and I'd be happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipe dream or reality? We'll know soon.

</P>
<P>
   FEATURE Stories
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-MUSIC (Undated) _ A specter is haunting the music
business: the prospect of listeners getting the music they want
directly from the Internet, free of charge. Right now, all it takes
to make a recording executive nervous is the mention of MP3, a
powerful piece of software that allows users to zap music all over
the Internet, unchecked and untithed. For utopians, MP3 is a way to
liberate music from the clutches of gatekeepers and profiteers, and
perhaps to return music to its intangible essence. But the
recording business sees MP3 as a Pandora's box of copyright
destruction, unleashing anarchy and piracy while robbing musicians
of royalties and record labels of capital. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   JOSEPH-FIENNES-FILMS (London) _ Ralph Fiennes devotees will
recall that the 1992 television film, ``A Dangerous Man: Lawrence
After Arabia,'' more or less introduced the actor to the United
States. It's unlikely, however, that viewers also caught the
fleeting presence of a younger Fiennes, Joseph, playing Ralph's
onscreen brother. Six years, and many more substantial parts later,
Joseph Fiennes 28, is emerging as a name to reckon with on his own.
His role next month as Gwyneth Paltrow's Bardic suitor in
``Shakespeare in Love'' is expected to clinch him as a separate but
equal talent to that of his Tony-winning, Oscar-nominated brother.

</P>
<P>
   ZAILLIAN-SCREENWRITER (Hollywood) _ Ask a studio mogul, top
producer or agent for the names of the superior screenwriters in
Hollywood, and Steven Zaillian will be near the top of the list.
``He's one of the two or three best screenwriters in town, and I'm
being liberal when I say that,'' said Joe Roth, chairman of Walt
Disney Studios, which made ``A Civil Action,'' the newest film
written and directed by Zaillian. ``There's an economy and clarity
to his writing that's always entertaining.'' Zaillian, who won an
Academy Award for his adaptation of ``Schindler's List,'' is a
surprisingly diffident, almost modest and entirely un-Hollywood
figure. In contrast to other screenwriters, who may earn lavish
sums but complain all the way to the bank about their plight at the
hands of producers, stars and executives, Zaillian, 45, shrugs off
any problems he has faced over his 18-year career. By Bernard
Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   STUDIOS-HOLLYWOOD-FILMS (Hollywood) _ The holiday season is a
scary time in Hollywood. The season that begins just before
Thanksgiving and ends with the New Year is the busiest time of
moviegoing in the nation. It's also when studios and independent
companies roll the dice and release films whose box office tally
can spell the difference between success or failure for the year.
(The nearly 100 films released over the next six weeks will account
for as much as 20 percent of the 1998 box office). By Bernard
Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   SPIRITUAL-DANCES (Undated) _ This week, in theaters a few blocks
apart in Brooklyn, N.Y., two programs will address and seek to
incorporate and represent the spirit. The dance in those programs
is worlds apart in time, history and geography. The Madras-based
Chandralekha, whose new full-evening ``Raga: In Search of
Femininity'' is to open on Wednesday for four performances at the
Majestic Theater, presented by the Next Wave Festival of the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, comes from the East and a culture that
at least by Western standards is permeated with the spiritual. The
three choreographers whose work will be shown in ``Dance and
Spiritual Life,'' the second event, are a part of a long, though
largely unacknowledged, tradition in American modern dance.
Unusually, attention will be paid to the potential of dance to
connect the spirit and the body in the one-performance program on
Saturday, which features choreography by Dianne McIntyre, Bebe
Miller and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, three black choreographers who
have been prominent on the American modern-dance landscape during
the last several decades. By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel''; ``Power Plays'' and ``The Way of All Fish.'' (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DEROSA-THEATER (New York) _ Six weeks after the revival of
``Irma Vep'' opened to gushing reviews and packed houses, Stephen
DeRosa is still adjusting ``to life in the theah-tah,'' he said,
with an Olivia De Havilland flourish. He already has a budding fan
club _ well, mostly retired teachers from his days at P.S. 193 in
Whitestone, Queens. And even though his performance thrusts him
into four disguises, strangers do occasionally recognize him on the
street. ``It must be the nose,'' said DeRosa, a slight, shamelessly
self-deprecating 30-year-old with thinning hair and basset-brown
eyes who seems to take great pleasure in talking about
psychotherapy, his mollycoddling mother and ``the dark years'' he
spent as an underemployed actor. By Andrew Jacobs. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-ARIAS (Undated) _ Arias from American operas, however,
have not found much of a home on record. Until recently, in fact,
American operas themselves have largely been ignored. Now the
release of two CDs by the sopranos Dawn Upshaw and Renee Fleming
suggests that the tide may be turning. The two albums, Ms. Upshaw's
``World So Wide'' (Nonesuch 79458-2) and Ms. Fleming's ``I Want
Magic'' (London 289 460 567-2), concentrate on repertory that most
listeners will find unfamiliar, though several of the composers _
Gershwin, Copland, Barber and Bernstein among them _ are household
names. By David Mermelstein. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-VERSIONS (Undated) _ The profound and the worthy can be
tiring, and there is nothing like a little smallness to ease our
passage from one Bach B minor Mass to the next Elliott Carter
Double Concerto. Weakness of this sort applies also to the
performances we like: ones that we know are ``wrong'' but that are
irresistible nonetheless. Stokowski's Bach, jacked up for 100
musicians, makes the musicologist's hair curl but makes mine stand
on end. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   LENNON-IMAGE (Undated) _ At a glance, the just released four-CD
``John Lennon Anthology'' looks very much like an ambitious
collectors' trawl. Lavishly packaged and copiously annotated, this
``Anthology'' (Capitol) brims with studio outtakes, concert
performances, private composing tapes and assorted spoken bits _ 94
selections in all. But satisfying the quasi-musicological
obsessions of collectors is not the primary purpose of this set.
``Anthology,'' compiled by Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, is less a
freestanding record release than an installment in a continuing
multimedia biography. It joins a mountain of CDs, videotapes,
material for film documentaries and radio series, picture books,
collections of Lennon's writings and art works _ that Ms. Ono has
released, overseen or sanctioned since Lennon was murdered on Dec.
8, 1980. By Allan Kozinn. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH-TV (London) _ Some of the most memoable characters to
emerge from Britain's latest television fad, fly-on-the-wall
documentaries that profess to show the unvarnished truth about
various institutions, from health spas to veterinarians' offices to
supermarkets. Their quality varies widely, but the shows seem to
have so captured a public mood that at times they can draw as many
as 10 million viewers, or about half the national viewing audience
on a given night. By Sarah Lyall. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   ALICE-WONDERLAND-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ For years, Justin G.
Schiller, a New York dealer in children's books, was certain that
he knew most everything about the publishing history of ``Alice in
Wonderland.'' The story had intrigued him since childhood, and so
in 1960 when he became a bookseller while still in high school, he
began buying and selling early printings of the book. In 1980, he
bought a rare copy of the first edition of ``Alice,'' printed in
1865 by Clarendon Press at Oxford University, an edition that had
been suppressed when Carroll, the pseudonym used by Charles
Lutwidge Dodgson, and John Tenniel, the illustrator, found
imperfections in the printing. He had been willing to pay $200,000
_ his entire savings _ for the book, but he was luckily able to buy
it at an auction in Paris for $56,000. Of the original 48 copies of
the first edition, 23 survive, 16 of them in libraries. But none of
the other copies is as distinctive as the one Schiller bought: it
includes 10 of the work's original pencil drawings by Tenniel, each
of which is signed with his monogram. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

SPORTS COLUMN: THE FATHER GAVE HOPE TO HIS SON
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amos Zereoue was furious when his father sent him to a group
home where the lights went out at 11 p.m. He was used to running
the streets at that hour, drinking and fighting, dangerous pursuits
for anybody, particularly a boy of 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out of control,'' Zereoue recalls.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that group home, he is now in control. Eight
years later, Amos Zereoue is the leading runner ever to play
football for West Virginia University, which meets Rutgers this
Saturday in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially a first-round draft choice for professional ball,
this year or next, Zereoue gained 189 yards last week as West
Virginia stunned Syracuse for its fifth victory in eight games,
below the team's ambitions for this season.
</P>
<P>
   Zereoue might not have had high expectations for his life when
his father checked him into the home, aptly named Hope for Youth.
Bonde Jean Claude Zereoue (pronounced ZER-oh-way) had emigrated
from the Ivory Coast, was raising a boy and a girl by himself, and
saw the son slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in Hempstead, where people get shot all the time,''
the father said four years ago. ``I would tell him that I didn't
want him on Terrace Avenue because that's where they deal drugs.
But he wouldn't listen to me and I couldn't control him. And that's
what I told the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The son was picked up by the police for picking a fight with
strangers, and the family court recommended Hope for Youth in
Bellmore, a few towns away on Long Island. Founded in 1969 by
Nassau County Family Court Judge Elizabeth Golding, the home
accommodated seven boys who needed a place to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a high-risk population,'' said David Hegarty, the
executive director of six Hope for Youth sites. ``We're starting to
get crack babies in now, kids who have bounced around, who have
many needs, but Amos was unusual. He was a highly motivated young
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Angry at his father, unhappy with the rules at Hope for Youth,
the young man entered Mepham High School in Bellmore, going from a
mostly black neighborhood to being one of the few nonwhites. In his
first days at the school, he tried to join the football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience is, they don't last,'' said Kevin McElroy, the
coach, referring to boys from the group home. ``They are in the
home because they are undisciplined, they have problems with
authority, and if they break the rules at the house, they can't get
to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Amos Zereoue accepted the leftover scraps of equipment and went
off to practice with the junior varsity. ``He looked like a
ragamuffin,'' McElroy recalled. ``We don't supply cleats for the
kids, so he was running in his sneakers. My junior varsity coach at
the time, Brad McLam, came over and said, `He's running all over
our kids _ in sneakers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cleats were found. The freshman moved over to the varsity. The
coaches began teaching him the game. Amos Zereoue handled it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once asked him why he was able to do so well at Mepham,''
McElroy said. ``He told me we treated him with respect; that was
all he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man spent some weekends with his coaches, and would
visit his father and sister, but they knew it was best for him to
stay at Hope for Youth right through high school. He groused about
the nightly meetings, the rules, the chores, but he stuck it out.
</P>
<P>
   Zereoue became the first double winner of the Thorp Award, as
the best player in Nassau County, an honor that even Jim Brown from
Manhasset and Matt Snell from Carle Place had won only once apiece.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a course for the Scholastic Assessment Test and, on
his last try, rocketed past the minimum of 700 to 1020. West
Virginia had a scholarship waiting.
</P>
<P>
   McElroy still tapes every game and calls Zereoue and offers
advice that does not conflict with the coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a few games and he told me to keep my chin up, don't
let other people mess with my head,'' Zereoue said.
</P>
<P>
   The player does not go back to Hope for Youth, but he praises
what it did for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have kids on college scholarships, a lawyer, a police
officer,'' said Hegarty, the executive director. ``We have kids who
are homeless or institutionalized. Success is relative. Not
everybody is going to be the chairman of IBM. Amos was looking for
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   The father still lives on Long Island and attends most West
Virginia games. Asked where he would be if his father had not
checked him into Hope for Youth, Zereoue paused and said softly,
``I probably wouldn't be sitting here talking to you.''

 &HT;    Braves land Boone; Neagle, Tucker sent to Reds
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The policy shift became official at 5:30 p.m. EST
Tuesday. The Atlanta Braves finally cracked open the pitching
treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Striking the majors' first big deal of the offseason, the Braves
acquired Gold Glove second baseman Bret Boone and left-hander Mike
Remlinger from the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Fab Four
left-hander Denny Neagle, outfielder Michael Tucker and minor
league pitching prospect Rob Bell, whom the Reds insisted upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a neat experience,'' Boone said from a Las
Vegas golf junket. ``Very, very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   He hardly comes cheaply. Neagle, 38-19 in just over two seasons
with the club, leaves a hole for Bruce Chen in the rotation. Tucker
started 212 games in right field since 1997, while Bell, the
organization's pitcher of the year at Class A Danville, led the
Carolina League in strikeouts. But Reds general manager Jim Bowden,
who received inquiries from six teams about Boone, stipulated that
only an overwhelming offer would pry Boone away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave up good talent. It was a rich deal,'' Atlanta GM John
Schuerholz said from Naples, Fla., where the trade was announced as
the general managers meeting. ``But we have the riches. And some
may say it was overly rich. But we got the best second baseman in
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Braves also have a vacancy in the outfield. Gerald
Williams currently claims sole rights to right field, though
veteran Schuerholz watchers know a second deal for another
outfielder must be in the offing. Tuesday's trade frees up nearly
$3 million in payroll the next two years, but when asked how soon
the next move might come, Schuerholz replied, ``There's no shoe
poised for falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but Jim Turner, agent for free agent outfielder Brian
Jordan, said he has been in contact with the front office Atlanta
weekly since the filing period began. Jordan, who still lives in
Stone Mountain, has also drawn interest from the New York Mets and
Yankees and Baltimore Orioles but while maintaining nothing was
imminent, Turner viewed Tucker's departure with heightened
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly things became more clear today,'' Turner said.
''With the moves (the Braves) made and things that might follow . .
. that obviously enchances a lot of possibilities. The Braves have
admired Brian and the way he plays for some time now.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone, 29, is entering the third season of a four-year
$11.4-million contract that will pay him $2.9 million in 1999 and
$3.7 million in 2000. The Braves own a $4 million option for 2001
with a $250,000 buyout clause but since he was traded in
mid-contract, Boone is eligible to renegotiate his contract after
next season. His 24 home runs and 95 RBI were second only to San
Francisco's Jeff Kent (31-128) in production among National League
second basemen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Atlanta is a great team,'' Boone said. ''I want to do my part
and maybe I can even help them be a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Having commited just 11 errors in the last two seasons combined,
Boone becomes the first Gold Glover to play second for the Braves
since Felix Millan (1972). His 1998 numbers (.267 average, 63
extra-base hits) reflect a breakout season, though he reached the
100-strikeout mark for the third straight year. Just one season
ago, he was shipped to Class AAA when a prolonged slump dropped his
average to .205.
</P>
<P>
   His arrival certainly signals Tony Graffanino's release, after
he hit .211 in 68 starts at second while left-handed hitting Keith
Lockhart is expected to be retained, if just for his pinch-hit
ability. The Braves had been set on acquiring Milwaukee second
baseman Fernando Vina, who would have also filled a need for
leadoff hitter, but talks turned to the Reds over the weekend
before the deal was settled in a late-night Monday session.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Vina deal was on the front burner for a long time,''
Schuerholz said. ''This only came up in the last couple days. I was
able to expand the deal to include Remlinger, which for a variety
of reasons was more beneficial to us than just making a straight-up
deal for Vina. Vina is a fine player. We like Boone more, purely
and simply.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, the league's only 20-game winner a year ago, was traded
for the third time in six years after having his name mentioned so
often trade rumors that he had made a comedy routine of announcing
his departure. Remlinger (8-15, 4.82) heads for the bullpen after
starting 28 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker literally swung his way off the team, his strikeout ratio
(112 in 414 at-bats) the worst on the Braves. After hitting .302 in
his first three months after being acquired March 27, 1997, he hit
just .248 afteer that, including a miserable .190 in the second
half of 1998.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A massacre in September in which 19 men, women and
children were fatally shot in a driveway in Baja California was a
result of a drunken argument between the chieftains of two rival
marijuana-smuggling gangs that turned violent, the authorities said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the murders on Sept. 17 in a seaside suburb of Ensenada, the
authorities had previously identified a victim, Fermin Castro, as
head of a gang that specialized in guiding drug planes to desert
airstrips. The officials added that he was the main target.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in their most ambitious effort to clarify the killings,
the authorities said witnesses had told them that a rival of Castro
who headed another smuggling group, Lino Quintana, visited Castro's
house Sept. 17, intending to collect a drug debt and steal a load
of marijuana stored there.
</P>
<P>
   Quintana and his armed colleagues were drunk and high on
cocaine, their talk with Castro turned violent and the gunmen
dragged Castro's family and two neighboring families from their
beds, said the federal attorney for Baja California, Gen. Jose Luis
Chavez, said at a news conference. The victims were piled in a heap
in the driveway and shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond asserting that the killers were intoxicated, the
authorities did not try to explain what had provoked the attack,
one of the bloodiest drug-related killings in Mexico. But Jose Luis
Ramos, a senior aide to Attorney General Jorge Madrazo, said the
government's account ``completely clarified the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Three people have been arrested, Chavez said, but Quintana is at
large.

CIA DIRECTOR THREATENED TO QUIT OVER POLLARD, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By JAMES RISEN and STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the Middle East peace talks last month in
Maryland, the director of the CIA told President Clinton he would
resign if Clinton agreed to release the spy Jonathan Jay Pollard,
according to several Administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   The agency director, George Tenet, who was directly involved in
the peace negotiations, gave his warning to President Clinton after
learning that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel had made
Pollard's case a key bargaining point, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Clinton turned down Netanyahu's request, and the
negotiations ended with a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet refused to comment on the matter Tuesday, as did a CIA
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet's threat to resign was a direct reflection of the depth of
anger against Pollard that lingers among U.S. intelligence and law
enforcement officials 13 years after the former naval intelligence
analyst was arrested for passing top-secret documents to Israel. He
is now serving a life term.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence and law enforcement circles insist that the
American spy should never be freed and dismiss the fact that he
acted on behalf of a friendly nation. But the far right in Israel
has made Pollard's release a celebrated cause _ and Netanyahu has
raised it with the president virtually every time they have met.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent talks, Netanyahu told Clinton that he needed
Pollard's release in order to win over the right wing of his
coalition to the peace agreement, according to senior American
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was open to what Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader,
Yasir Arafat, said they needed to help sell the peace agreement to
their constituencies, these officials said. The president was
seriously considering Pollard's release, they officials said, when
Tenet spoke up. ``It was clearly on the table,'' said one U.S.
official.
</P>
<P>
   While a White House spokesman refused to comment on whether
Tenet threatened to resign over Pollard, he did say that during the
conference, at Wye Mills, Md., Clinton had been ``impressed by the
force of Netanyahu's arguments'' on the Pollard matter.
</P>
<P>
   The President then went back to consult with his advisers,
including Tenet and national security adviser Sandy Berger, and
eventually decided that he could not agree to Netanyahu's demand,
the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the opposition to releasing Pollard was persuasive,
Administration officials said. Clinton, who twice before denied
Netanyahu's calls for releasing the spy, agreed only to review the
case again, for the third time in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that Tenet believed that he would lose his
credibility with his rank-and-file in the intelligence services if
he were to agree to Pollard's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew that he was closely associated with these peace talks
-- it wasn't like he was back at headquarters _ and he couldn't
distance himself from this decision,'' one U.S. official said of
Tenet.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet's resignation would have forced Clinton to find his fourth
CIA director in less than six years _ making the post one of the
most difficult and intractable personnel problems to plague his
administration. Twice Clinton has had to stand by and watch as his
nominees have been forced to withdraw before being confirmed by the
Senate, and twice the President has had to find backup candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet, 45, who was named director of Central Intelligence in
1997, pledged to remain in the job for at least four years in an
effort to provide the agency with some stability.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving at the CIA's Langley, Va., headquarters in 1995,
first as the CIA's deputy director, Tenet has worked to revive the
morale of agency employees and to provide a new focus after the
cold war while winning increased funding from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Pollard case was one issue on which it was impossible for
Tenet to straddle both his political and intelligence
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as word leaked out that Pollard's freedom had become a
bargaining chip in the Middle East talks, U.S. law enforcement and
intelligence officials went into nearly open rebellion, complaining
that the President should not release someone who had so flagrantly
betrayed national security. Accepting a Pollard deal with Netanyahu
would have forced Tenet to side with the White House against his
own lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pollard had been released, George would have had no choice
but to resign,'' said one senior congressional official involved in
intelligence matters.
</P>
<P>
   The anger within the intelligence agencies was fueled by the
fact that, during the 18 months he spied for Israel in 1984 and
1985, Pollard stole more top-secret documents than almost any other
spy in American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stole huge amounts of intelligence, measured in cubic
yards,'' said R. James Woolsey, former director of Central
Intelligence, who recommended that Pollard be denied clemency when
his case was first reviewed by President Clinton in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He took thousands of pages of the government's most sensitive
intelligence, including many concerning Soviet weapons system
designs that came from Russian spies recruited by the CIA, as well
as codes and large caches of information from American spy
satellites and listening posts. The information of great interest
to Israel because its Arab opponents used Russian weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He betrayed some of America's most sophisticated espionage
technology, and handed over so many documents that his Israeli
handlers had to equip a secure Washington apartment with a
high-speed photocopier and photographic equipment to absorb it all.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has refused to return those documents ever since, and
U.S. intelligence officials say that the lack of Israeli
cooperation has made it impossible for U.S. investigators to
resolve one of the most sensitive questions raised by the Pollard
case _ whether any of the thousands of pages of top secret
documents he passed on might somehow have ended up in the hands of
America's enemies, including the Soviet Union. Such an outcome
would have given the enemies knowledge of what American
intelligence had learned, and perhaps how.

 Pac Bell Wireless Faces Lawsuit Over Ads  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A lawsuit filed  &LR; Tuesday  &LR; charges that Pacific Bell Wireless has
been misleading customers in California with false and deceptive
advertising and should be forced to stop.
<P>
   The company, which has been heavily marketing wireless phone
service for less than 5 cents per minute, is actually charging
consumers much more, except in very specific cases, the suit
alleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you can get 5 cents a minute is if you use up all
your free minutes, which are designated for certain times and
certain days. That's not clear in the ads,'' said Michael Linfield,
a Pasadena attorney who filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior
Court. ``In some cases, you're actually paying 49 cents a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell officials said they had not seen the suit and could
not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the company's 5-cent plan, wireless customers who sign up
for the 5-cent package pay $19.95 a month for 500 free weekend
minutes and 20 free weekday minutes. If a customer uses all those
minutes on the designated days, the cost per minute is less than 5
cents. However, if a customer uses only 100 of the free minutes on
the weekends, the cost comes out to about 20 cents per minute,
Linfield said.
</P>
<P>
   And once customers use up their 20 free weekday minutes, they
are charged significantly more for weekday calls, sometimes 49
cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Linfield said Pac Bell can charge whatever it wants, but the ads
fool people into thinking they are getting a 5-cent rate all the
time. He filed the suit on behalf of a Pac Bell Wireless customer
who ``is not getting what she thought she was paying for,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Linfield, who specializes in consumer rights, said he plans to
file a similar suit against Sprint PCS  &LR; on Thursday &LR; . That suit
focuses on an ad campaign that offers Sprint PCS service for 10
cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS officials had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads are deceptive and they're something you'd expect
from small-time operators,'' Linfield said. ``We want a court to
force them to stop the misleading advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit comes on the heels of another filing against wireless
carriers in California. In August, a San Diego attorney sued Pac
Bell, AirTouch, Sprint PCS and GTE Wireless for charging customers
by the minute, instead of by the second. That suit is still
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say the explosion of wireless service has
made it easy for companies to confuse customers. They warn people
to read the fine print before signing up for any service and to
make sure they get everything in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as the wireless companies like to tout the simplicity
of their rates, some rates are designed to confuse,'' said Charles
Carbone of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a state consumer
group. ``They don't want customers to go out and sufficiently shop
the market. So when you actually subscribe to a service, you find
out the rate structures are quite confusing and not clear-cut like
the advertisements suggest.''

   AIMSDELAY (PHOENIX) _ The class of 2001 may get a reprieve from
Arizona's new high school graduation test requirement because the
state superintendent of public instruction fears many kids aren't

WASHINGTON SKIRMISHES OVER TREATY ON WARMING
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As negotiators from around the world worked on
details of an international agreement to fight global warming, the
Clinton administration faced an intense debate among lawmakers
Tuesday over whether to sign the pact during talks this week in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the administration will sign the
agreement eventually, even though it faces an uphill struggle for
approval by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional adversaries argued Tuesday whether signing it
now, a step the White House favors as a sign of its commitment to
the controversial accord, would strengthen or weaken the bargaining
hand of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials said Tuesday that no decision had
been reached on signing the agreement, but others said that the
administration's envoy to the talks, Stuart E. Eizenstat, would
announce in Buenos Aires that it would be signed.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would commit the United States to reducing its
emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse
gases, which scientists say threaten to warm the planet and disrupt
its climate, by 7 percent below the 1990 levels over the next 10 to
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have said that this would require cuts in the use of
fossil fuel that would devastate the economy. The administration
insists that new technologies would insure a painless transition to
a cleaner economy.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, administration officials have declined to say when
the United States would sign the protocol, which was agreed to by
more than 150 nations last year in Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The current round of talks is aimed at establishing a system of
international emissions trading and at defining what role
developing countries should play in cutting emissions of the
pollution that scientists say may cause major changes in the
planet's climate.
</P>
<P>
   As reports spread that the administration would sign the
agreement this week, congressional opponents warned that this would
be a political mistake, while those who favor the treaty said
signing it now would increase the administration's influence in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., where cuts on emissions of carbon
dioxide from burning coal would damage the state's mining industry,
warned President Clinton to ``resist making empty gestures that
will only make the potential future approval of the protocol by the
Senate more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd is a leader of congressional opponents of the treaty who
contend that it must not be approved until developing nations,
whose emissions of greenhouse gases are projected to surpass those
of the United States in the next few decades, agree to join
industrial nations in cutting emissions.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., urged the White House to
sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are not at the table, we cannot cajole or convince the
developing nations to become part of the solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., a treaty opponent in the House
and a leader of the congressional observers' delegation to the
talks in Buenos Aires, called on the administration not to sign the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any global warming treaty devoid of developing country
participation and credible evidence that America will maintain its
economic health and vitality will be dead on arrival,'' said
Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman, as he left Washington to join the observers from
Capitol Hill, called Sensenbrenner's plea ``a mistake, and a
serious abdication of American responsibility to lead in this
effort, and also an obstacle to our being able to shape the global
response to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Krupp, the head of the Environmental Defense Fund, an
advocacy organization that favors the treaty, said that ``the
people who oppose signing are the same people who have opposed the
treaty from the beginning, and in fact they are really opposing
protecting the planet. We feel very strongly that the time to sign
has come.''
</P>
<P>
   But other environmentalists were not so enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, this administration has made expectations so low,
that when they finally sign this weak agreement that they
negotiated, people will mistake it for leadership,'' said John
Passacantando, executive director of Ozone Action, an environmental
group that follows climate issues.

DRUG TO PREVENT BLINDNESS TO BE PROVIDED TO VULNERABLE COUNTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds new 7th graf; subs 11th graf to correct 2nd reference to
Zithromax.)  (htv) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide can be
effectively treated by a single dose of an antibiotic once a year,
health workers said Tuesday, and they announced a major push to
distribute the drug in five countries.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, trachoma, is caused by strains of the chlamydia
bacterium. An estimated 6 million people worldwide have been
blinded by trachoma, which is outranked only by cataracts as a
cause of blindness.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization set up a new strategy earlier this
year in an effort to eliminate trachoma as a major cause of
blindness by the year 2020. Tuesday, officials of Pfizer Inc.,
which sells a long-acting antibiotic against the disease, and the
Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, a leading charity organization in
New York, announced that they were starting a $66 million program
to help carry out WHO's strategy in Ghana, Mali, Morocco, Tanzania
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Women are two to three times more likely to be blinded by the
disease than men, presumably because women have more contact with
children. As with many other diseases, children are the prime
source of spreading the trachoma bacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis.
</P>
<P>
   The infection produces a sticky discharge from the eyes and a
runny nose. One attack provides little protection against another
one. Repeated infections over a number of years can scar the inner
eyelids, which turn inward, causing eyelashes to rub against the
cornea. The damage leads to blindness.
</P>
<P>
   The discharge provides an easy route of bacterial spread from
person to person, particularly in families with young children. In
areas of poverty and poor sanitation, flies are attracted to the
sticky discharge, and epidemiologic studies strongly suggest that
flies can also spread the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Trachoma is caused by different strains of the same bacteria
that causes infections of the genital tract. For unknown reasons,
the bacteria strains affect different parts of the body in
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the World Health Organization developed a
broad new strategy to eliminate blinding trachoma. The strategy
calls for developing clean water supplies to encourage improved
personal hygiene. It also calls for minor eye surgery which, when
needed, can be carried out in villages with rudimentary health
facilities. Another feature is once-a-year administration of the
long-acting antibiotic, azithromycin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Dr. Robin L. Bailey and colleagues at the London School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine noticed a report in the journal
Lancet of a study indicating that a single dose of azithromycin
cured 78 percent of trachoma infections. Since then, the findings
have been verified elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Azithromycin administered in communities under supervision
proved as effective as application of an eye ointment containing
another antibiotic, tetracycline. There is poor compliance with the
recommended course because the ointment is uncomfortable,
particularly for children, and must be applied twice a day for six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer officials said that azithromycin, called Zithromax, is
its leading antibiotic, accounting for $1 billion in sales a year.
Pfizer said it would would donate enough Zithromax to treat 3
million people over the next two years at a cost of about $60
million. The Clark foundation will pay an additional $6.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Cook, an official of the Clark Foundation and an
expert in tropical diseases, said one measure of success would be
if the program reduced the prevalence of trachoma infections by 50
percent to 75 percent in children 5 years and younger within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, trachoma infects more than 150 million people. The
disease is most common in Africa, the Middle East and parts of
Asia. In some areas, more than 50 percent of children are infected.
An additional 540 million, or 10 percent of the world's population,
live in areas where they are at risk for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Trachoma was once a scourge in the United States and Europe. A
century ago, immigrants arriving at Ellis Island were examined by
doctors who would routinely snap back the eyelids over a button
hook to screen for trachoma. Detection of the disease meant certain
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, trachoma has been eliminated as a major public
health problem in most Western countries through good sanitation,
largely without antibiotics. However, antibiotics have been useful
in speeding elimination of blinding trachoma in areas where it is
highly prevalent. Cases still occur sporadically on some Indian
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization, a U.N. subagency, has said that
``recent community trials using azithromycin as a single dose
against trachoma have demonstrated a very good therapeutic effect
for 6 to 12 months in reducing inflammatory disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva-based health organization recommended community-based
distribution of the antibiotic in villages where more than 20
percent of children aged 1 to 10 years are infected. For
communities with less than a 20 percent childhood infection rates,
WHO called for treatment on a house-by-house basis.
</P>
<P>
   WHO said that further research is needed to determine if
azithromycin needs to be repeated after one year and how often.
</P>
<P>
   Eradication of trachoma infection is not thought possible
because the bacterium is ubiquitous, Cook said.

WASHINGTON STATE CLOUT WOULD RISE WITH DUNN AS MAJORITY LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (FIXES TYPO IN SLUG -- NO OTHER CHANGES)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Jennifer Dunn spent her first full day as a
candidate for House majority leader calling everyone she knows and
asking for help.
</P>
<P>
   But should she win next week, suddenly everyone she knows will
be seeking aid from her.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, R-Wash., is seeking is the No. 2 post in the House, which
brings with it considerable power to influence national policy, a
bully pulpit from which to influence national politics, and a
traditional role for steering federal dollars and programs back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great if she got it _ it would mean a lot for the
state _ because it would put her in a position where every
committee chair in the House would be beholden to her, and it would
also give her clout with the (Clinton) administration,'' said Rep.
Norm Dicks, D-Wash., the dean of the state's congressional
delegation. ``There are always issues that come up, things
affecting the Boeing Co. or Microsoft, and when you're in the
leadership, you're going to have additional clout.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Rod Chandler, R-Wash., said Dunn would be in a
position not only to help the state, but to help the Republican
Party keep control of the House in 2000, and thereby, from his
perspective, help the American people with tax cuts and other
policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a visible position _ much more so than anything other
than speaker _ and it is also a position from which the policy of
the (Republican) conference is established and carried out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Washington state, it's a huge bump in influence that
Jennifer would have over what she has now,'' he said. ``That just
goes without saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler is one of a handful of longtime Dunn allies, most from
Washington state, who have rallied to her side in an effort to
boost her campaign to unseat House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas. Reps. George Nethercutt and Doc Hastings, R-Wash., were
making calls on Dunn's behalf; her longtime political consultant,
John Meyers, flew in from Bellevue and joined another longtime
former aide-turned lobbysist, Phil Bond, in helping her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us in the West, it means a lot, because we need to have
someone ... stitting at the negotiating table to make sure our
region is represented well,'' Nethercutt said.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt defeated the last House leader from Washington state
_ Tom Foley, a Democrat who had previously served as majority
leader. Nethercutt said Washingtonians should not expect Dunn to
use her post as a vehicle for sending pork back to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would have a greater opportunity to deliver the right
product to our region, but the right product may be cutting
spending and lowering taxes, allowing us not to have the Bonneville
Power Administration sold and not to have the (Snake River) dams
breached,'' Nethercutt said. ``Just bringing money home _ I don't
think that's her style. We all want good expenditures, but
legitimately so, and not just because they have our name on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dunn would clearly be in a position to help two major
projects in Washington state that depend on federal largesse _ the
cleanup of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and the construction of
the Sound Transit network of rail and bus lines and carpool lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer has always been interested in finding bipartisan
solutions, so that would probably be good news for our state,''
said Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat. Locke's spokesman, Keith Love,
said, ``Losing Tom Foley hurt us a lot. Anytime you have someone
from your state in a leadership position, it's got to be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn would also give a strong voice for Washington's corporate
citizens, including Boeing and Microsoft. Both companies are wary
of saying much for now, since they will have to work with whoever
wins. And Microsoft, in particular, has a very close relationship
with Armey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be inappropriate for Boeing to comment on the
internal decision-making process of either political party,'' said
Boeing spokesman Doug Kennett. ``That being said, Jennifer Dunn has
an excellent record serving the needs of her constituents, a large
number of whom are Boeing employees and their families. She has
also been an active supporter of Boeing objectives and programs,
and we are pleased to be considered one of her constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn claimed Tuesday to have called all 222 of her fellow
Republicans _ although she didn't reach all of them _ to make her
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Armey appeared to be holding support from many of the
long-serving and powerful GOP committee chairmen, while former
Seattle Seahawk Steve Largent, R-Okla., was gathering support from
the most conservative wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Although many committee chairmen are supporting Armey,
Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Penn., is
supporting Dunn, according to two sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is a whole lot different than the races we ran Nov.
3, because you have a defined number of people you need to talk to,
and you know exactly what your universe is,'' said Hastings. ``You
can't sell a sitting majority leader short, but there is probably
some softness that is perceived there, and that's why Largent and
Dunn are in.''

LENDERS SLAMMING LOAN DOORS IN THE FACES OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS,
HISPANICS, GROUP CLAIMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ African-Americans and Hispanics are still having a
hard time getting approved for home loans in Houston, according to
a national survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston between 1995 and 1997, nearly half of all
African-Americans who applied for a home loan were rejected and
more than a third of Hispanic applicants were rejected, according
to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, a
community activist group also known as ACORN.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures are significantly higher than the 30 percent
rejection rate for whites in 1997 for conventional
non-government-backed home loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``With unemployment at a 30-year low and interest rates at their
lowest in decades _ conditions which have historically erased
racial disparity _ these trends are unacceptable,'' Glenda Kizzee,
an ACORN board member in Houston, said Tuesday. ``Instead of being
able to take advantage of these good times to walk into new homes,
African-Americans and Hispanics are having the doors slammed in
their faces by lenders.''
</P>
<P>
   The study surveyed 9,041 lenders in 35 cities to examine the
patterns and prevalence of racial disparity in home mortgage
lending between 1995 and 1997. ACORN officials said they didn't
include statistics on Asians because they tend to have a relatively
easier time of obtaining home loans than other minorities and many
times, even whites.
</P>
<P>
   ACORN and federal housing officials said some Houston lenders
have become complacent and lost the sense of commitment to
increasing homeownership among blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a definite feeling that because the economy is so
good, banks are taking the easy road and making the easy loans,''
said George Rodriguez, senior community builder at the Houston
office of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
``Why should they care about the little guys when they can make the
big bucks?''
</P>
<P>
   It's particularly hard to get mortgage companies involved
because unlike banks, they don't have to comply with the federal
Community Reinvestment Act or CRA, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   The CRA is aimed at encouraging banks and thrifts to lend to
residents in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The law
requires public disclosure of an evaluation and rating for each
financial institution that undergoes a CRA examination by
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   While some mortgage companies are supportive, ``other mortgage
companies don't seem to be picking up a finger,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders, however, said they haven't lost their commitment to
lending to low- and moderate-income families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, we've been strong on this front and I'm sure the
commitment will continue,'' said David Byford, spokesman for Chase
Bank of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that we make more money off of a larger loan,
but we're still focused on that $40,000 home buyer, nonetheless,''
said David Wood, vice president and community development officer
at Bank One, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Other community organizations said while they find lenders still
interested in making home loans to minorities, they can do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a more concerted effort on the part of some
lenders to reach out to minorities in such a way that will be
helpful,'' said Christopher Oliver, assistant director of Sunnyside
Up, which represents the Sunnyside neighborhood in southeast
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, lenders can hold more home-buying fairs where
people can learn about the home-buying process and how to get
financial help in buying a home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know how to buy a house,'' Oliver said.
``A lot of people don't know what takes place at closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing Opportunities of Houston, a non-profit group that works
with the city and lenders to raise home ownership among low-income
consumers, has been helping lots of people, said David Rosales,
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do more loans through that program in one month than most
other cities do in a whole year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His organization last week helped its 1,000th family this year
to buy a home through affordable housing programs, and it helped
about 1,100 families last year, Rosales said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we're going to go over 1,200 this year,'' he said.
``There are no other cities in the country that have those kinds of
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   ACORN and Rosales said Houston is doing better than the rest of
the nation in helping low-income families buy homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national picture is pathetic,'' Rosales said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the increase in lending conventional mortgages to
white borrowers was almost five times as large as it was for
blacks, ACORN said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, lending to Hispanics fell by more than 1
percent, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made some strides in Houston recently, and now (Texas
Sen.) Phil Gramm's attempts to wipe out the Community Reinvestment
Act will threaten all gains we've made,'' Kizzee said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Neal, Gramm's spokesman, said Gramm isn't out to kill the
CRA when he assumes chairmanship of the Senate Banking Committee
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a rather stunning misstatement,'' he said of ACORN's
claim. ``He supports CRA. He wants to focus it where it belongs _
on real people who really need loans to buy real things in the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm wants to rid the CRA process of community activists who
file complaints on banks with regulators, then fall silent when
they're paid by banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the cash appears, the complaints disappear,'' Neal said.
``Sen. Gramm views that as tantamount to extortion.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ David Cone and Darryl Strawberry, longtime fixtures
in New York's baseball panorama, could each work out the details on
one-year contracts with the Yankees on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, acknowledged that
he was in contact with Cone's agent Tuesday. Cone, who went 20-7
this season, can accept a $5.5 million option for the 1999 season
by midnight Wednesday or reject it and become a free agent. Cone
has twice extended the deadline, a strong indication that he is
intent on working out a contract with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's preference is for a high-paying, two-year guaranteed
contract, but the Yankees _ who may be leery of the condition of
Cone's pitching shoulder _ may not be willing to guarantee a second
year. According to an official with knowledge of the negotiations,
the Yankees have offered to increase Cone's 1999 salary, to perhaps
as much as $8 million, and could be open to the idea of giving Cone
an option for the 2000 season. Cone could not be reached for
comment, and Cone's agent, Steve Fehr, indicated late Tuesday that
he had nothing to say about the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees hold a $2.5 million option for the 1999 season on
Strawberry, and under normal circumstances the Yankees probably
would not retain him. Strawberry is recovering from cancer surgery,
however, and the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, has
made it known that he will exercise the option and keep Strawberry,
the left-handed slugger, in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   But in negotiations with Eric Grossman, Strawberry's
representative, Yankee officials are trying to structure a contract
that would help the team financially in case Strawberry's return to
the majors is delayed because of his rehabilitation from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that it's going to get done,'' Grossman said Tuesday.
``Hopefully, it will be done by tomorrow, but we're not going to
place an artificial deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a Yankee next year. George is committed to
him; he's committed to George.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees must either conclude a deal Wednesday or agree to
another extension that would give both sides more time to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman has been in contact with the agent for pitcher Randy
Johnson, but he would not comment Tuesday on whether the Yankees
had formally extended an offer to Johnson, a left-handed free
agent. Either way, conventional wisdom among executives with other
teams is that the Yankees have little chance of landing him.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees formally announced the signing of the third baseman
Scott Brosius on Tuesday, about a week after he and the team agreed
to a three-year, $15.75 million contract. Brosius batted .300 with
98 RBIs during the regular season and was the most valuable player
of the World Series, making him an attractive free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was intent on re-signing with the Yankees, however,
he never really gave his agent, Tony Attanasio, a chance to field
bids from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that if we waited a little bit longer,'' Brosius
said, ``there would have been at least as much and probably more''
money in an offer from another team. ``But New York was my first
choice. They made a fair offer and there was no reason to check out
others.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His post-season heroics prompted endorsement offers, according
to a team official, but Brosius returned almost immediately to his
Oregon home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like the season was over and I wanted to get
back,'' Brosius said. ``I could have stuck around and done some
things and had some fun with it. But I have a wife and three kids
and I wanted to get back to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Brosius will allow the Yankees to dangle Mike
Lowell, the team's most developed infield prospect, in trade talks
for a center fielder. In July, the Yankees declined to make Lowell
available in a possible deal for Johnson. The Yankees have explored
the possibility of making a trade for Rondell White, Montreal's
center fielder, and although the Expos do not seem interested now
in making a deal, Lowell almost certainly would be involved if the
two sides rekindled talks.

ARGENTINA HEARS RUMORS OF ROYAL BRITISH SUITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ President Carlos Saul Menem returned
from London last week without making any progress toward his goal
of retaking the Falkland Islands. But if the gossip columns here
are on to something, he may eventually come away with something
else: a British son-in-law, none other than Prince Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son,
served as a helicopter pilot in the Falkland war. Never mind that
Menem's only child, Zulema Maria Eva, is Muslim and was named in
part for Eva Peron, who hated all things English. And never mind
that the prince and Miss Menem need an interpreter to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   These are, after all, only rumors.
</P>
<P>
   But the reports of a blooming romance, while most likely highly
exaggerated, are being taken here as a sign that the two countries
are finally putting the 1982 war behind them. Perhaps that is why
President Menem appears to be encouraging the gossip. Or maybe he
is just relieved that his daughter recently stopped dating a
motorcycle racer.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors began when the prince, 38, and Miss Menem, 27, were
seated together at a state dinner held in President Menem's honor.
Photographs in the weekly gossip magazine Gente show the two
sharing hearty laughs, toasting and looking deeply into each
other's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed incredible to me that they did not stop talking,''
Menem told the magazine in an interview. ``They almost didn't eat.
They seemed to laugh spontaneously, and that made me very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The president was asked in a radio interview whether Miss Menem
and the prince would marry. ``That makes me laugh,'' he said.
``Maybe they are friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's tepid denial of a romance made the front page of
Pagina 12, a leading Buenos Aires newspaper, under a dry headline,
almost understatedly British: ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The new media attention given Miss Menem, who has escorted the
president on all his trips since her parents separated several
years ago and then divorced, is something of a carryover from the
British press. The Daily Mail of London reported that she was a
``firecracker,'' made much of her short skirts and declared in one
headline, ``All Eyes on the Divine Miss Menem.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Menem became a symbol of reconciliation in London when she
was photographed wiping tears from her eyes in St. Paul's Cathedral
as her father laid a memorial wreath to the 225 British soldiers
and sailors who died in the Falkland war.
</P>
<P>
   On his trip Menem and British Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed
to disagree on the Falklands, but pledged closer cooperation on
economic and trade matters.
</P>
<P>
   The better tone in relations may even eventually carry over to
military affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Charles Guthries, chief of the British Defense Staff,
proposed on a visit to Argentina last week that a joint
Argentine-British force finally remove land mines laid by Argentine
soldiers in 1982 after they landed on the islands. Such an
operation, he suggested, might lead to other joint maneuvers.

NEELY GIVES US SOMETHING TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First John Glenn, now Cam Neely.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Jim Lonborg on the mound Opening Day at Fenway?
John Hannah leading the blocking for Robert Edwards? John Havlicek
running the fast break for Rick Pitino?
</P>
<P>
   Neely, the onetime prototype power forward, plans to practice
with the Bruins Wednesday in an ongoing effort to return to the
NHL. He played his last NHL game Feb. 21, 1996, almost three years
ago, and retired with a degenerative hip condition later that year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the long odds, Neely's comeback attempt can only be a
happy development. The Boston sports landscape in recent days has
been scorched by the prospect of Mo Vaughn's departure, the
flame-out of the vapid (dare we say gutless?) Patriots, and the
hideous NBA strike. So now we have a heroic golden oldie, who
retired before his time, attempting to make a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   There is no downside to the Neely comeback attempt. If Cam
returns to practice and finds he no longer has the strength,
energy, or skating ability to play in the NHL, we are no poorer. In
our minds, we've already lost him. And he owes it to himself to
make sure there is no possibility of a return.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose there's something still there. Suppose there's a
little gas left in the tank. Suppose the Camster could still stand
in the slot and bang home power-play passes from Jason Allison and
Sergei Samsonov. What would black-and-gold sweater-clad fans pay to
see that again? The return of Neely would be the Zamboni equivalent
of Larry Bird coming back to make no-look passes to Travis Knight
and Antoine Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Neely is scheduled to practice with the team Wednesday at the
Ristuccia Center in Wilmington, a Boston suburb. He wants to skate
with the fellas for about 10 days to see how he feels.
</P>
<P>
   Neely's return could put second-year coach Pat Burns in an
awkward position. But the belief here is that Neely won't fool
himself if it's obvious he can no longer play at the highest level
of his sport.
</P>
<P>
   Neely played three years with the Vancouver Canucks and 10 with
the Bruins before hanging up the skates because of a hip ailment
that would not go away. He was 31 when he retired. He's 33
Wednesday. When he retired, the Bruins were coached by Steve
Kasper. It was Kasper who made the dumb decision to bench Neely and
Kevin Stevens in January 1996 when the Bruins were losing a game in
Toronto. Neely and Bruins fans never forgave the snub, and Kasper
never recovered from the negative fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bruins are a mid-level NHL team, starving for attention
in a sports-saturated market. They are having trouble selling
tickets, and Neely no doubt would fill seats and sell hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   But let's hope this is not a public relations stunt. Let's hope
this is something more than Willie Mays playing in the World Series
for the 1973 Mets or Jim Palmer trying to come back with the
Baltimore Orioles when he was better suited to be pitching for the
Money Store. Let's hope this is not another punch-drunk boxer (fill
in the blank) making a comeback for one last payday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cam-Corder wasn't talking last night. In a statement, he
said, ``I have been encouraged in my workouts so far in that my hip
has been sore after skating but the pain has not lingered. I have
said before that if I make a return to the game, it will be this
season and now is the time to take this next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday he'll skate in front of all the cameras and probably
do a dozen standup interviews after the session.
</P>
<P>
   Boston can be a tough town for professional athletes. We've got
maniacal/vigilant fans, nitwit radio voices, competitive TV
anchors, and sportswriters who try to hit as hard as Lawyer Milloy.
But try to find anybody who wishes anything but the best for Cam
Neely in his comeback try. It's the feel-good story of a feel-bad
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Here's wishing Neely all the best. Long may he skate.

HOG FARMERS QUESTION DIVISION OF PORK PIE
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ With hog prices now so low that farmers are being paid
less than it costs to raise the livestock, Illinois agriculture
groups on Tuesday raised questions about why pork prices in stores
are not also plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   While hog prices fell 39 percent for the 12 months ending in
September, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, retail
pork prices declined only 1.5 percent. Since then, prices for hogs
have dropped even more, down 49 percent for the first 10 months of
1998, with farm groups estimating that producers are losing $20 to
$50 on every pig they raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue on which farm and city people come
together,'' said Ron Warfield, the president of the Illinois Farm
Bureau, contending that the gap between hog prices at the farm and
pork prices at supermarkets is wider than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its intention to monitor and publicize the gap
each week, farm groups clearly hope to pressure retailers into
promoting pork and cutting prices, moves that could help hog prices
rebound by stoking consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   But the farm advocates were careful to use wording that would
avoid antagonizing retailers or encourage scapegoating, the old
prairie-style penchant for distrusting markets and powerful
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not accusing supermarkets of gouging consumers,'' said
Warfield. ``We are not calling retailers greedy middlemen. The days
of farmers bashing `the middleman' are long gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups that represent the interests of supermarkets, meanwhile,
say the USDA measurement overstates the gap between farm and retail
prices. Tim Hammonds, the president of the Food Marketing
Institute, a Washington trade group for supermarkets and
wholesalers, said the USDA bases its retail pries on average
weekly prices in stores, which does not accurately measure
purchases, since consumers buy a disporportionate share of pork, or
anything else, during special sales.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that live hogs are only one part of the pork price
equation, noting that costs related to slaughtering, processing and
distribution have not gone down. ``With unemployment levels as low
as they are,'' he said, ``I think it's safe to say that a lot of
labor costs have gone up.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Hammonds said that retail prices rarely see the
valleys, or the peaks, that farmers experience. He said that when
hog prices for farmers jumped 26 percent in 1996, retail prices
climbed only about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Hammonds said supermarkets would gladly join producers in a
campaign to ``highlight the value'' of what the pork industry dubs,
``the other white meat.''
</P>
<P>
   The main cause of the falling hog prices, all sides agree, is an
overproduction of swine. Hog production proved extremely profitable
in 1996 and 1997, and the big gains prompted many swine operations
to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the growing political resistance to large-scale,
confinement hog operations in the Midwest and the South _ the
plants tend to emit strong odors that offend people living in
nearby small towns _ has led some big hog operations to expand
before states declare moratorium on hog facilities, as some have
done.
</P>
<P>
   On the federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency is
preparing to work with the states to impose strict
pollution-discharge permits on all large farms by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 84.6 million hogs had been slaughtered, an
increase of about 11 percent compared to a year earlier.
Consumption grew about 7 percent in the United States, and exports
have continued to rise, although the Asian economic crisis has
taken its toll. The typical American eats about 52.3 pounds of pork
a year, according to the National Pork Producers.
</P>
<P>
   The farm bureau here estimates that hog farmers are losing $20
to $50 a head at current prices, a calamitous situation that will
surely drive many farmers out of business if the prices remain low.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't go to a farmer meeting,'' Warfield said, ``but that
we don't talk to somebody that's going out of production.''
</P>
<P>
   The $6 billion in emergency farm aid passed recently by Congress
does not directly affect livestock producers. Instead, it is aimed
at grain farmers. Iowa is the leading hog producing state, followed
by North Carolina, Minnesota and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Meyer, an economist for the pork producers group, said a
reduction in slaughterhouse capacity in recent years has posed a
problem for hog producers. There was a time when slaughterhouses
were centered in big cities, like Chicago, which the poet Carl
Sandburg described as ``Hog Butcher for the world.'' But the
slaughterhouse industry has long ago moved to rural regions, and in
recent years, the capacity has been shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've lost 35,000 per head per day of capacity in the last two
years,'' said Meyer, who noted that some big hog and packing
companies, such as Smithfield, have bought slaughterhouses and
closed them.
</P>
<P>
   The growing dominance of factory-like hog companies makes it
increasingly difficult for smaller, independent operations to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Steimel, 34, who farms with his father, Roger, 61, near
DeKalb, Ill., was preparing to ship a load of hogs to market for a
sale that will bring about half what it cost them to raise the
livestock.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some good years, and we paid down some debt,'' said
Steimel, an economics graduate from the University of Illinois.
``We knew the prices would go down again. But no one could ever
have predicted they would have gone this low.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``There are going to be some farmers asking themselves
a lot of hard questions this winter.'' &QL;

KEITH JACKSON: MICHIGAN'S VOICE OF AUTUMN TO LEAVE THE BOOTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ Look around the Big House in the early morn,
Keith Jackson said. Feel its emptiness. Then hunker down a while,
watch the crowd fill Michigan Stadium, a sea of maize and blue
washing over 92 rows of backless benches. Watch the players burst
ebulliently from the tunnel. Watch the Michigan Marching Band warm
up. They've got mommas and daddies as proud as if they were Big
Uglies opening holes for scatbacks. Listen to them belt out ``Hail!
to the conq'ring heroes!'' and get chills like those that made
Jackson shiver 40 years ago on his first trip here as the
University of Washington's football announcer, a half-dozen years
before he went big-time at ABC Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no doubt my favorite place, to see four generations
rise up and appreciate it, for the pageantry, the ambience,'' said
Jackson, standing inside the stadium's broadcast booth before last
Saturday's game against Penn State. ``Michigan has such
grandiosity. It has all those all-Americans. You can't go anywhere
without finding a Michigan graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   With retirement from ABC looming after the season, this was the
70-year-old Jackson's last sojourn to Ann Arbor to call a Michigan
game. Nearly three decades since redefining the sound of televised
college football with an evocative idiom and a storyteller's brio,
he insists that it is time to see whether the young bucks in his
shadow are as talented as they think. ``You want to go when it's
time,'' he said. ``You're better off if you go a little early.''
</P>
<P>
   Impending retirement has not altered his routine: he studied
tape and game notes at home in Sherman Oaks, Calif., wrote in
pencil the teaser for the game's opening sequence, arrived here
late Thursday and met the coaches Friday. At one point during
Michigan coach Lloyd Carr's low-key meeting with Jackson, his
boothmate Bob Griese and the sideline reporter Lynn Swann, Carr
said, ``I don't see any merit in losing.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark provided Jackson with a chance to quote Fritz
Crisler, the former Michigan coach who mentored the young
sportscaster. His bourbon-smooth voice mimicking Crisler's
baritone, Jackson said, ``Old Fritz, his neck swelling and eyes
flashing, would say, `What do you propose to do _ teach them to
LOSE?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Jackson drove from his Ypsilanti hotel in a
white rental car more than three hours before the noon game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa, it's a cool day and I've never seen this,'' he said,
seeing traffic back up a quarter-mile from the Interstate 94 exit
ramp leading to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your moment of stress comes when you're trying to get to the
game,'' he said. ``Last week in Bloomington, we had a blue parking
pass to go to the ABC trucks, but this highway patrolman wouldn't
... let ... us ... go ... that ... way. I said, `I think we're
going _ even if we have to run over you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the parking lot closest to Michigan Stadium, he prepared
to make a left turn. ``I'm going in here, so hold your damned
taters!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the car, he clamped a black cap over his silver
hair, hoping not to be recognized. He strode along Main Street
toward the stadium, wearing a black overcoat, bulling into the
breeze like a Big Ugly trampling a nose tackle. His leave-taking
was widely noted by fans walking with him or tailgating in the
parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ARE college football to me!'' shouted one fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're what the game is all about!'' called out a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a picture with me!'' pleaded a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I are both retiring,'' a policeman told him as he
stood at a red light at East Stadium Boulevard. ``I've got two more
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've got six,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson mumbled his gratitude, looking a bit abashed. If he had
planned his retirement more meticulously _ and not confirmed it
publicly before the season _ he would have said, ``Folks, I'll see
you,'' and vanished from public view as soon as he signed off at
the conclusion of the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in the broadcast booth, Jackson and Griese prepared for
the broadcast. Griese, the stolid, quiet partner, was paired with
Jackson 12 years ago. ``At our first game, he said to me, `All
right, what do you want to do?' I said: `You're the guy who's been
here. You're Mr. College Football.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson taped the teaser _ ``the Penn State front seven will
wreck your parlor, and the cornerbacks are the wrecking ball . . .
with those guys up front there are times you think your grandpa
could play the secondary'' _ then rehearsed the commercial
announcements that he must recite at nearly every break. He accepts
the clutter, but hates it. Off the air, he tweaked them with glee.
</P>
<P>
   About ``Sports Night,'' a new ABC ``dramedy,'' he said, ``The
show The New York Times _ God forbid _ called the best new show on
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   A coming NFL game: ``This is the first time Green Bay has played
Pittsburgh on `Monday Night Football.' Big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow down, Hoss,'' Griese said. ``You're doing all your good
stuff too early.''
</P>
<P>
   With the noon kickoff minutes away, Jackson paused before
sitting for the first half. He took a swig from a bottle of water.
He looked around the stadium, nearly full with a crowd that would
be announced as 111,019.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' he said. ``I'm getting goose bumps.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To comprehend Jackson's decision to retire as college football's
bard, one must sense the love he feels for his wife, Turi Ann.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lady and I have never had a September, October, November
of our own, not in 46 years,'' Jackson said during lunch last
Friday. ``Next year we're going to. We always planned it this way.
This didn't just fall out of the sky. We're thrifty. We can live
off our interest, save the principal and let the kids go off and
have a hoot.'' The Jacksons have three children.
</P>
<P>
   At age 70, his game-calling skills are still better than anyone
else's in college football. ``He's the predominant persona, and
I've just wanted to fit with him and play off him,'' Griese said.
</P>
<P>
   The voice, a sound of the South like Mel Allen's and Red
Barber's, retains its pop, its lyricism, its wit. ``You always know
it's a big game when Keith's there,'' said Penn State Coach Joe
Paterno.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson will leave TV without remorse. As evidence that he
can drop a sport and not look back, he said he has not attended a
baseball game since calling the 16-inning, epic Game 6 of the
Mets-Houston National League Championship Series in 1986. And when
his career ends at the Fiesta Bowl, that will be that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lived the golden years,'' he said. ``You can't stop the
march to `Que Sera.'''
</P>
<P>
   He loves college towns _ Ann Arbor the most _ the camaraderie of
friends and the echoes inside Michigan Stadium. He will miss
arriving on Thursdays, reading the local newspaper classified ads
to check the pulse of the town and discovering that the figure atop
the state Capitol in Lincoln, Neb., is a sower.
</P>
<P>
   But when he travels to Columbus or Madison or Happy Valley
without Turi Ann, he misses the ``long, tall, blonde'' sweetheart
he met when they were students at Washington State, in Pullman,
after his four-year stint as Marine mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my Christmas card to him, I wrote that I want my marriage
after 10 years to be as good as theirs after 46,'' said Jay
Rothman, Jackson's game producer.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacksons want to wake up, then decide what to do, in Sherman
Oaks, or at their retreat in Garden Bay, British Columbia. They
want to golf, fish and garden together, and he wants to watch her
cook supper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as close to heaven as I'm going to get,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Jacksons lunched on potato soup, Turi Ann said: ``We've
spent a lot of time together, especially in Canada, so having him
around all year doesn't frighten me. And as much as he's traveled,
he always gave the kids a lot of time. He always came back as soon
as he could. And they all have wonderful memories with him. He's
been a good papa.''
</P>
<P>
   Softly, Jackson said, ``Oooh, we'll get along just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be glorious,'' Turi Ann said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is a big man, the size of a vintage 1950s linebacker.
Yet his commanding voice comes out of a deceptively small mouth. He
can be an ornery cuss, fighting to do things as he wants, or a
generous teammate and a riveting raconteur. ``He's a swashbuckler,
a sweetheart, a curmudgeon, and a father figure,'' Rothman said.
``A cross between John Wayne and Jack Palance.''
</P>
<P>
   The first half Saturday was typically Jacksonian, replete with
his expressive lingo and idiosyncratic cadence. In a low rumble
early in the first quarter, he described a ``fummmmmble'' by
Michigan's Clarence Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And others:
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Wilson, 279 pounds of anger, was waiting for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eberly keeps on trucking until Jones takes his wheels away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is not a contact sport, it is said, it is a collision
sport. Dancing is a contact sport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That play was made by the Big Uglies in the trenches.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jackson: ``I talk to the guy who busted his butt all week
to buy a color TV, and the woman who's raising her kids, the people
I owe a debt to. I'm talking to people in hotel rooms, lonesome
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing anyone can do to Jackson in the booth is
surprise him. That is what Rothman did Saturday. As the first half
ended, Rothman told the hungry Jackson to stick around to fill time
during the halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you paying those guys in the studio for?'' Jackson
said, taking off his headset and leaving for the men's room. ``We
spend a zillion dollars on a studio operation in New York and they
can't fill 10 minutes?''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was back, Bo Schembechler had arrived outside the
booth, where it looked like Jackson would interview the former
Michigan coach. But it was a ruse. Schembechler presented Jackson
with an autographed helmet and Michigan jersey, while the marching
band assembled to spell out ``THANKS KEITH.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's anger dissipated, and he thanked the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you sandbagged me,'' he told Rothman through his
headset, when he returned to the booth. ``I cry at the national
anthem. You really got me.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the second half began, Griese, who had mocked Jackson's
season of farewells, said: ``I'm sick of this. Everywhere we go,
they're high-fiving you and making the rest of us feel like we're
carrying your bags. Which we do.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, after paying scant attention to televisions that
showed Michigan State's stunning comeback victory over Ohio State,
Jackson offered a glimpse into what he may be doing next year, in
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I might do?'' he told friends at dinner. ``I
might go up to Napa and learn to cook at Jack and Dolores
Cakebread's.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson does not long to be a sous-chef, but shifting to the
culinary arts at a vineyard will be mighty different from calling
the action on a Manhattan, Kan., gridiron. The sight of Jackson in
a cooking class on an autumnal Saturday might cause his fellow
students to exclaim, ``Whoa, Nellie.''

BAPTIST CONSERVATIVES SEVER TIES TO SOUTHERN BAPTIST GENERAL
CONVENTION OF TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD VARA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ With loud ``Amens!'' and jubiliant applause, Texas
Baptist conservatives Tuesday formed a new state convention
dedicated to missions, evangelism and robust support of the
Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 messengers, as delegates are called, from 200
Texas churches formed the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention at
Woodforest Baptist Church in northeast Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, they severed ties to the Baptist General Convention
of Texas, which was celebrating its sesquicentennial annual meeting
at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day annual meeting, which attracted more than 5,300
messengers, concluded its business Tuesday, including a prayer
session for leaders of the conservative convention.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of the new convention brings to a head nearly two
decades of bitter feuding over biblical and theological issues
between the state's conservatives and moderates. Conservatives
control the 16 million-member national convention but moderates
dominate the state convention, which has 2.7 million members and
more than 5,600 churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here because we have chosen to remain Southern
Baptists,'' said the Rev. Ronnie Yarber, the new convention's
administrative director. ``I am a Southern Baptist first and a
Texas Baptist second.''
</P>
<P>
   But across town, an influential Texas moderate leader proposed
yet another Texas-based convention unaffiliated with the SBC.
Herbert Reynolds, retired president of Baylor University and now
the school's chancellor, proposed that Texas Baptists form an
international ``Baptist Convention of the Americas'' that would
avoid ``the destructive influences of the leadership of the
Southern Baptist Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, a scathing critic of conservatives, proposed that
Texas be the center of a convention extending from Alaska to South
America connecting like-minded state conventions and churches
through modern telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives said Reynolds' proposal supports their charges
that Texas Baptist leaders are moving away from the national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two years, they will entirely withdraw from the SBC,'' said
the Rev. Rick Scarborough, pastor of First Baptist Church in
Pearland, Texas. ``I hope I am wrong, but that is my prediction.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough said he could no longer support the policies of the
state general convention, citing its approval of a new annual
meeting representation policy requiring churches to contribute
funds to state causes if they wanted more than the minimum of two
messengers. Scarborough said that was ``blackmail'' because it
forces conservatives to fund causes they oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives elected the Rev. Stan Coffey of Amarillo,
Texas, as president and approved an annual budget of more than
$900,000. They pledged that 50 percent of contributions would go to
the national convention. In contrast the state general convention
passed a record $49.7 million budget for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has been the epicenter of much of the bitter
conservative-moderate battle that has embroiled the state and
national denominations. Texas conservative leaders, including Paul
Pressler of Houston, have helped lead the ``conservative
resurgence'' that took control of the national convention beginning
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Reynolds infuriated state conservatives by leading
Baylor University in Waco, Texas, to declare autonomy from the
state convention. Reynolds feared that conservatives would
eventually take over the state organization and appoint like-minded
trustees for the school, the largest Baptist university in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Dilday, current president of the general convention, was
fired as president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in
1994 by the school's conservative board. The firing angered some
Texas leaders and started the strained relationship that still
exists with the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' proposal for an international convention was
accompanied with sharp criticism for the national convention.
Reynolds said Texas Baptists contribute about $98 million for state
and worldwide causes annually. That figure includes special annual
collections for home and foreign missions and other contributions
that are not tabulated in the state budget. About $43 million is
funneled to the national convention, a contribution he described as
an ``annual tribute'' to ``SBC fundamentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentalists have said and done about everything they
wanted to say or do for 20 years, (so) why should we in Texas give
any credence whatsoever to movements of this sort?'' Reynolds told
a receptive breakfast meeting of Texas Baptists Committed, a
moderate organization.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds blasted a recent conservative amendment to the Baptist
Faith and Message asking wives to ``submit graciously to the
servant leadership of her husband.'' The Baptist Faith and Message
is the denomination statement of beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds said the amendment is ``asinine and ludicrous'' because
it demeans women. Approved last June, the amendment has caused some
churches to leave the national convention. Some professors at
Southwestern Seminary are retiring or resigning rather than sign
the amended statement.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds said he has no time frame for the creation of the
international convention but wants Texas Baptists to curtail or end
the annual contribution to the annual convention within a few
years.
</P>
<P>
   In concluding actions, BGCT messengers approved a resolution
supporting the ``biblical equality'' of men and women. The
resolution, seen as a response to the Baptist Faith and Message
amendment, affirmed ``the freedom and responsibility of women and
men to respond to the call of Christ to serve as they are gifted by
God.'' &QL;

INTEL SEES HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED PROFITS
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Intel Corp. said Tuesday that its
fourth-quarter results will be above expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said stronger-than-anticipated demand for personal
computers across all market segments and global regions will
increase revenues and profit margins for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's announcement came after the close of the market, but its
shares had already risen in anticipation of strong PC sales,
together with those of the Dell Computer Corp. Shares of Intel
closed at $97.5625, up $1.5625, while Dell rose $1.3125, to
$70.3125, both in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   In after hours trading, Intel rose to $100.25. Intel reported
stronger-than-expected earnings last month, but said then that it
expected fourth-quarter revenue to be up only slightly relative to
the third quarter's $6.7 billion. On Tuesday Intel said it expects
revenue to be up about 8 percent to 10 percent from the third
quarter, and that profit margins would be up a couple of points
from 53 percent in the third quarter. Higher margins reflect both
higher sales, and the mix of products sold during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Intel did not specifically say that earnings would
exceed the consensus estimate, Wall Street analysts said they would
be raising their numbers. Analysts had expected Intel to earn 95
cents a share in the quarter. Intel earned 98 cents a share in the
fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``PC demand is solid; it's seasonally strong, and Intel has been
in an extremely strong position to benefit both from the uptick in
demand and the end of a pretty severe inventory correction,'' said
Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. Noting that Intel
had reduced inventories at the end of the last quarter to their
lowest level in a dozen years, he said, ``You have to believe their
factories are running flat out, and that is always good for
margins.'' Intel said it expects expenses in the fourth quarter to
be about 8 percent to 10 percent higher than third-quarter expenses
of $1.4 billion, up from its earlier guidance of 3 to 5 percent
higher. Expenses are dependent in part on the level of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said that it expects to be within a few hundred people of
its previously announced staff reduction goal of approximately
3,000 employees by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For the third quarter, ended Sept. 26, Intel reported earnings
of $1.56 billion, or 89 cents a diluted share, down slightly from
$1.57 billion, or 88 cents a share. Per share figures reflect an
increase in the number of shares outstanding. Revenues grew 9
percent, to $6.73 billion.

CARGILL SET TO BUY MAIN UNIT OF CONTINENTAL GRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk) 
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Floyd Schultz, Tuesday's news that Cargill Inc. had agreed
to buy the grain operations of its chief rival, Continental Grain
Co., was about as welcome as another drop in his already low corn
and soybean prices.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, when he transports his grain by truck just four miles
to Lockport, Ill., he can choose between Cargill and Continental
grain terminals, sitting side by side along a canal leading to the
Illinois River.
</P>
<P>
   Once they combine, he said, the nearest competitor will be an
Archer Daniels Midland terminal 30 miles and another 10 cents a
bushel in shipping costs away. While Cargill could lower its prices
and improve its margins, he said, ``We as farmers would be the ones
who pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Cargill and Continental Grain executives answer that, for
farmers, the advantages of their combination in storage,
processing, distribution and export far outweigh the minimal risks.
``What's important for farmers is to have the most efficiency,''
said Paul Fribourg, chief executive of Continental Grains, who
added that consumers could see some lower costs, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill, the nation's largest private company, and Continental
Grain, one of the largest, did not disclose their terms, though
analysts estimated the price exceeded $300 million. Cargill, based
in Minneapolis, handles about 20 percent of the nation's grain
exports, and Continental Grain handles about 15 percent. But
Cargill's crucial advantage is having mills and plants to process
grains into meals, flours and oils, expanding its sales
opportunities and improving its overall profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Grain has been left as a middleman, buying, storing
and selling grain on increasingly narrow spreads. Besides the
payment from the sale, Continental Grain would also be able to free
the huge amounts of capital tied up in its grain inventories. The
company could then better support its other businesses, among them
financial services and livestock, where it is the nation's leading
cattle feeder, bringing 1.1 million head to market this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Contifinancial arm, publicly traded but about 75
percent owned by the parent company, has been besieged by its own
falling profits in businesses like providing commercial and
residential mortgages and home equity loans. Shares of
Contifinancial rose $1.50 Tuesday, to $8.6875, as analysts
anticipated that the sale of the grain operations would improve
Contifinancial's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Fribourg described the decision to sell the grain operations,
the foundation of a family business founded in Arlon, Belgium, in
1813, as wrenching. Having moved to Paris and then, during World
War II, to New York, where it is based, Continental Grains in
recent decades opened huge markets for American grain in the former
Soviet Union and in China.
</P>
<P>
   But two years of searching for a partner in the more profitable
ends of the grain business, genetic crop engineering or processing,
resulted in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The talks with Cargill instead got down to an outright purchase.
Combining Continental Grains' six export terminals, 27 river
terminals and 32 buying stations with its own terminals and mills
will improve Cargill's flexibility and productivity, executives
said. ``It will allow us to better serve producers in terms of how
we buy grain, how we load and transport grain and how we sell
grain,'' Frank Sims, president of Cargill's North American Grain
Division, said in an interview. Farmers will still have their
cooperatives and many other corporate grain buyers, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed about the deal's advantages, strengthening
Continental Grain's remaining businesses and enhancing Cargill's
leadership in the grain industry. ``They were always a large
trader,'' said Jeffrey Kanter of Prudential Securities. ``Now
they're a monster trader.''
</P>
<P>
   While a Federal Trade Commission spokesman did not have any
comment Tuesday, some farmers like Schultz, who is also chairman of
business development for the National Corn Growers Association,
did. Large crops and falling Asian demand have pushed corn prices
down from about $5 a bushel two years ago to less than half that
now.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Yost, a Minnesota corn and soybean farmer and president of
the American Soybean Association, predicted the deal would cost
farmers another penny or two a bushel, or perhaps a dollar or two
an acre.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least $2,700 a year for him. ``We see constant
consolidation of both our input suppliers _ seed, fertilizer,
pesticides _ and the people who purchase our production,'' he said.
``Obviously, the trend's not healthy for the American farmer.''

FOUNDATION HEALTH REPORTS 52 PERCENT DROP IN PROFITS, KEY
RESIGNATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the same day it reported a 52 &UR;  &LR; percent drop in
third-quarter profit, managed care specialist Foundation Health
Systems Inc. said the president and chief executive of its largest
health plan has resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Southam, who headed Foundation's main California HMO,
Health Net, will be replaced by an as-yet-unnamed outside successor
who was tapped for the top spot earlier this month, a company
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Southam, who was widely regarded in Southern California's
managed care community as one of the industry's brightest stars,
was pushed out by Foundation Chief Executive Jay Gellert, sources
familiar with the situation say.
</P>
<P>
   Gellert was also reportedly behind the resignation last month of
Robert Natt, who headed Foundation's Northeast Division. The
California and Northeast markets are Foundation's most lucrative
and are considered key to Foundation's successful recovery from a
yearlong earnings slump.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo sent to Health Net employees, Southam hinted he will
remain involved in the local health-care business. ``I'm sure that
many of us will have the opportunity to work with each other in the
future,'' he told employees.
</P>
<P>
   Southam's ouster is seen as the result of lower-than-anticipated
profit within the Health Net plan. Unlike many Foundation
divisions, the 2.3 &UR;  &LR; million-member HMO is profitable, but not
enough so, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ain't good enough,'' Michael LeConey at Security Capital
Trading in New York said of the plan's bottom line. ``You can be
founder of the company or its largest shareholder and still (be
fired).''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gellert himself replaced Foundation's former CEO and
Health Net founder Malik Hasan in August after the company stumbled
synchronizing the half-dozen or so managed care firms that merged
or were acquired to create Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   With that departure, Southam _ Hasan's successor at Health Net _
saw his political base within Foundation diminish, LeConey said.
</P>
<P>
   Southam's resignation was announced Tuesday along with
Foundation's third-quarter results, which saw profit from
continuing operations drop 52 &UR;  &LR; percent. The company had warned
analysts last week to expect the dismal results.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-charge, Foundation earned $28.7 &UR;  &LR; million, or 24 cents a
share, down from $59.8 &UR;  &LR; million (49 cents) in 1997. Revenue rose
22 &UR;  &LR; percent to $2.2 &UR;  &LR; billion from $1.8 &UR;  &LR; billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Foundation took charges of $117 &UR;  &LR; million this quarter
related to its cost-cutting measures, including $21 &UR;  &LR; million in
severance payments for workers fired at its Pueblo, Colo., service
center; $22 &UR;  &LR; million lost on a real estate deal with the
now-bankrupt FPA Medical Management Inc.; and $37 &UR;  &LR; million in money
lost on Medicare patients or set aside to serve as reserves on some
remaining health plans. The charges gave Foundation a real
third-quarter loss of $88.6 &UR;  &LR; million, or 73 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results were awful, as advertised,'' said Mary O'Connell,
an analyst at Josephthal &AMP; Co. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gellert's three-month tutelage, Foundation has sought to
shed unprofitable businesses and to wring more earnings out of
performers like Health Net. The company's shares got a boost last
week after a firm slated to buy Foundation's money-losing workers'
compensation insurance business announced it received financing to
complete the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation shares rose 31.25 cents Tuesday to close at $14.875. &QL;

 &HT;    Boone learns of trade on golf course
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Bret Boone was on a golf course in Las Vegas when
his cell phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is this bothering me?'' he said. ``I'm in the middle of a
career round.''
</P>
<P>
   Career round? An interesting choice of words.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone call was from Cincinnati Reds general manager Jim
Bowden, informing Boone that he was about to make a career move.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden told Boone he was taking his just-won Gold Glove, his 24
home runs and his 95 RBIs to the Atlanta Braves _ traded along with
pitcher Mike Remlinger for left-handed starter Denny Neagle,
outfielder Michael Tucker and right-handed minor-league pitcher Rob
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Boone was surprised, but not shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I might not win the Gold Glove this year, but I
didn't think I'd be traded after the season I had,'' Boone said.
``Frankly, good luck to them (the Reds). They're going to need it.
And I know (shortstop) Barry Larkin is going to be mad about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin is on a promotional tour for Nike and couldn't be
reached, but he was on record as saying he didn't want Boone
traded.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds tried to trade Boone during the off-season the past two
years, including last spring training, but could find no takers.
After his career-best 1998, teams lined up trying to acquire him _
Atanta, Toronto, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, the New York Mets., Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to lose Boone, he is a terrific player, a hard worker
and a good person,'' manager Jack McKeon said. ``But it's like
Branch Rickey used to say. . .better to trade them a year too early
than a year too late. Heck, a year ago we couldn't give him away.''
</P>
<P>
   Second base becomes the property of 25-year-old Pokey Reese, a
natural shortstop who played outstandingly at third base last year
before tearing a ligament in his right thumb on July 30, causing
him to miss the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate to have a good young player like Pokey Reese
to play second base,'' McKeon said. ``We were looking to upgrade
our pitching and with Neagle that gives us a better chance to win.
And Tucker gives us depth in the outfield. The name of the game for
us right now is getting better and that's what this trade does for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese is home in Columbia, S.C, continuing rehabilitation on his
thumb, but said he'll be full-go for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows I like shortstop best, but that belongs to
Barry,'' Reese said. ``I liked playing third-base last year, too.
But you know what position I like best? The one that gets me in the
lineup every day and that, right now, is second base. I'm ready for
it.

SOME SEE `HOMETOWN DISCOUNT' IN SOX' OFFER TO VAUGHN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ On the one hand, the Red Sox have offered Mo
Vaughn more money ($60 million) for more years (five) than they
ever have, a deal eclipsed in club history only by the six-year,
$75 million contract they gave pitcher Pedro Martinez last
December.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, the proposal is one year and $12 million less than
the guaranteed six-year, $72 million deal offered by the Anaheim
Angels, who remain the only other club at this time to have an
offer on the table for the free agent first baseman. And a party
familiar with the Anaheim strategy said Tuesday that the Angels may
increase their offer, if they feel it will expedite Vaughn's
signing.
</P>
<P>
   This is the risk the Red Sox ran by inviting Vaughn's agents to
shop around for other offers before Boston weighed in. Had they
made their bid at the All-Star break, for example, or before their
exclusive bargaining window with Vaughn expired last Thursday
night, the Sox' offer might have been better received.
</P>
<P>
   But now, there is sentiment in Vaughn's camp that the Sox'
proposal was obsolete before it was proffered. To those subscribing
to that view, it smacks of another attempt at inducing Vaughn to
accept a ``hometown discount'' _ especially one of that size _ when
the Red Sox forfeited their right to ask for one by allowing him to
become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Those taking a dim view of the Sox' offer say that they offered
just enough to convince their fans that they made a sincere
attempt, and that in the end, the Sox will say Vaughn's decision
came down to dollars _ in essence, making him the heavy, just as
they did with Roger Clemens two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In support of that position, they say, the Red Sox can be
expected to roll out Vaughn's own words that he would be willing to
take less money if the Sox gave him a five-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   That dismissive attitude is not being disseminated by Vaughn's
agents, at least not yet. They have been very circumspect about the
Sox' proposal, going so far as to describe talks with the team as
``business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, meanwhile, did not answer calls to his home, but it is
believed that his initial reaction to the Sox' proposal was shock
and disappointment. Beyond the financial terms, the Sox apparently
did not include the type of no-trade provisions Vaughn was seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette said Tuesday that he had
one conversation with Vaughn's agent, Tom Reich. ``We still hope
our offer leads to a deal,'' said Duquette, who would not say
whether he has set a deadline for Vaughn to accept or reject the
team's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Duquette said he expected to know by Thursday, when
the GM returns to Boston, whether Vaughn would stay with the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have not said how long their offer will remain on the
table, though club sources said the team will not wait
indefinitely. Vaughn was impressed by a letter from the Angels that
expressed how much they wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette has said the Sox are ``well-positioned'' to pursue
other players in the event Vaughn rejects their proposal. He said
he had conversations Tuesday with agents for several free agents,
as well as with a few clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Boras, the agent for free agent center fielder Bernie
Williams, has said the Red Sox requested to meet with Williams, an
indication that he could become Boston's prime focus if Vaughn goes
elsewhere. Arn Tellem, agent for free agent Albert Belle, also has
spoken with the Red Sox, as has Johnny Boggs, agent for Gold Glove
third baseman Robin Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Why would the Red Sox, who already have John Valentin at third
base, be interested in Ventura? Because Ventura is a lefthanded bat
with power who might be open to moving to first base. It's also
possible, though unlikely, that the Red Sox could ask Valentin to
move back to second if Jeff Frye is not fully recovered from knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want John Valentin to suddenly have a coronary _ `I'm
being moved to another position,''' said Boggs, saying that Sox
assistant GM Mike Port did not discuss possible lineup
permutations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to call this a preliminary discussion. I think the
Sox are just covering their bases if Vaughn leaves. We may be one
of 10 players they're looking at. But Robin is the type of player
who if he sees his club has a chance to win, he'll do whatever it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The names of sluggers such as San Diego left fielder Greg Vaughn
and Los Angeles right fielder Gary Sheffield have surfaced as
players who could be available in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, among other teams, met Tuesday with the Pittsburgh
Pirates and are believed to have inquired about lefthanded reliever
Ricardo Rincon and righthanded starter Francisco Cordova. Another
pitching possibility is free agent righthander Armando Reynoso, who
has had major arm trouble but was 7-3 with a 3.82 ERA for the Mets
last season. Reynoso's agent, Oscar Suarez, said he has been in
contact with the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have said they are seeking a No. 2 starter. They are not
in the bidding for top-echelon free agents Randy Johnson and Kevin
Brown, nor have they inquired about righthander Todd Stottlemyre,
according to that pitcher's agent, Tony Attanasio.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Employees at Amazon.com, the popular on-line bookseller,
recently received a directive from senior management that struck
some as out of character in a company that had sprouted from the
Internet's free-for-all culture.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an event that the Seattle-based company designated
``Sweep and Keep,'' employees were instructed to purge, among other
things, e-mail messages that were no longer required for business
or not subject to legal records requirements. Free lattes would be
dispensed in the cafeteria to those who complied immediately, the
directive said.
</P>
<P>
   This Amazon ``document retention'' policy, which requires
employees to expunge electronic files regularly, was followed a few
weeks later with guidelines for ``document creation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply put, there are some communications that should
not be expressed in written form,'' the Oct. 20 memo stated.
``Sorry, no lattes this time!''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind monopoly power in the marketplace; the real lesson
corporate America is taking away from the Microsoft antitrust trial
is that old e-mail can be a mine field of legal liability, not to
mention a source of public embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-profile court battle between the Justice Department
and the Microsoft Corp., e-mail has emerged as the star witness _ a
fact that appears to be giving pause to corporate executives
accustomed to clicking ``send'' without a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love e-mail,'' said Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief
executive. ``I think it is changing the world. The problem is
somebody can take it out of context and use it against you, and we
have to guard against that.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, like many companies, had embraced e-mail as the
preferred way to communicate about business matters. Instant,
convenient and at least putatively private, it allows the lowliest
employee to discourse with the most exalted. And it provokes
spontaneous, if not always eloquent, brainstorming among colleagues
who might otherwise keep their thoughts to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Amazon, which to many people symbolizes a progressive
Internet culture, is among the growing ranks of companies that are
imposing new restrictions on e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier policies prohibiting abusive or harassing
electronic messages, the new rules tend to curb types of expression
that have long been deemed acceptable business discourse. And when
such exchanges must take place in writing, the prevailing
philosophy would have them expunged as quickly and ruthlessly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   This backlash underscores a paradox of the information age:
while instantaneous electronic communication often helps increase
productivity and innovation, the privacy of workplace
correspondence and accountability for what is written are growing
concerns for many employers.
</P>
<P>
   Often, e-mail is more a conversation that happens to be written
down than an actual letter, and it is often more revealing than
either. It has thrived largely because of the assumption _ some
would call it the illusion _ that the rapid-fire confessional
exchanges that e-mail seems to encourage will never be divorced
from their context.
</P>
<P>
   But that is often not the case in legal disputes, where e-mail
is increasingly being treated as the ultimate window into the true
thoughts of executives and the inner workings of an enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Microsoft trial's electronic highlights: the company
chairman, Bill Gates, in a sworn deposition, flatly contradicts his
e-mail statements, and an e-mail from James Barksdale, chief
executive of Netscape Communications Corp., to America Online's
chairman, Steve Case, in which he refers to Case as ``Franklin D.''
and himself as ``Joseph Stalin.'' The reference implies a
comparison between the two executives in their war against
Microsoft and the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union
fighting Nazi Germany in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in the Sun Microsystem lawsuit against Microsoft over
the Java programming language, a federal court in San Jose, Calif.,
has seen a great deal of embarrassing e-mail from both companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the very attributes that have made e-mail so
popular _ chief among them its tendency to induce off-the-cuff
candor _ are driving managers to conclude that its use must be
reined in, its tracks dusted over.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, message-retention policies have been primarily
designed for disk space management,'' said Jim Browning, a senior
research analyst at the Gartner Group, a consulting firm. ``The new
question is how quickly should e-mail be deleted to prevent it from
becoming a danger to the organization?''
</P>
<P>
   Browning said that anxious calls from clients had been rising in
tandem with headlines about the Microsoft trial. Earlier this
month, a client called looking for what he characterized as an
``e-mail shredder.'' Another wanted a ``Mission Impossible'' e-mail
product that would self-destruct the message after it was read.
``That option doesn't exist today,'' Browning said.
</P>
<P>
   But such anxiety is not unreasonable. E-mail that someone thinks
has been erased often still exists somewhere, perhaps on the hard
drive of one or more recipients or of someone to whom it was
forwarded. People often do not realize they have set their software
to leave e-mail on the server, the computer that acts as an
electronic post office. And erased files can sometimes be
reconstructed with special software that reassembles discarded data
from the digital ghosts left behind on hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group recommends policies that help employees
understand what a company considers appropriate business language.
</P>
<P>
   For example, said Joyce Graff, Gartner's research director for
the electronic workplace: ``You talk about `fair competition'; you
don't talk about `slaughtering' them. No warfare language. That way
you have fewer messages you have to worry about in the files.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 83 million Americans who now use e-mail in the workplace
know, it is easily and often forwarded, copied and stored in
perpetuity on everything from company backup tapes to personal Palm
Pilots. The fact that people are disinclined to erase old e-mail
has not been lost on lawyers, who routinely request e-mail as part
of the discovery process in civil and criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lipstein, a Washington-based antitrust lawyer, said a
company's e-mail was a treasure trove of evidence ``because that's
when you catch people in their unguarded moments.'' Lipstein, who
specializes in subpoenaing computer records from multinational
corporations, added, ``I've seen e-mail that makes me cringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several executives said they regretted the new
atmosphere of deliberation and delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It slows down communication if everybody is stopping and
thinking about what they write,'' said Tom Jermoluk, chief
executive of At Home, a company that provides Internet access over
cable television lines. ``It's chilling. I don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Jermoluk, whose company was dragged into the
Microsoft antitrust dispute because of an e-mail message a senior
manager had written titled ``Gates on the Warpath,'' said he had
instructed the company's lawyer to write a more restrictive policy
to regulate e-mail and record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting desires to engage in frank, private
communication and to escape public accountability for it are by no
means new. Corporations have for decades trashed acres of files _
albeit with the added incentive that paper takes up a lot of space.
</P>
<P>
   And well before the first subpoena for a document, Socrates
warned that writing ideas down was a bad idea because, among other
things, one could never know who might read them. Plato countered
that a culture that had to commit everything to memory was limited
in its intellectual possibilities.

<P>
   The quandary of archived records, said Neil Postman, a professor
of media studies at New York University, has been around ``ever
since phonetic writing became a critical part of Western culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every important new technology is a Faustian bargain,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, employers are choosing censorship. More than 20
percent of the respondents in the American Management Association's
annual survey this year said that they monitored employee e-mail,
compared with 15 percent who said they did so in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Classes with titles like ``E-Mail 101'' are getting healthy
enrollments. Bloomberg, the financial news service, installed a
system last month that searches e-mail for offending words. If it
finds one, a warning pops up before the e-mail is sent: ``This is
inappropriate language to use in correspondence with any customer,
and a copy of this message will be immediately sent to your
superior.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers at Polk Co., a data resource firm in Southfield, Mich.,
recently discovered that 10 percent of employees had from 5,000 to
10,000 e-mail messages saved on hard drives. A delete-fest is being
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Microsoft trial has done is to say that if people are
using this as an electronic filing system, it could be a dangerous
medium,'' said David Zaccagnini, Polk's vice president for
information technology. ``That's what the Microsoft trial really
means to corporate America.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without formal policies, executives said they were
sanitizing their own e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I self-consciously tone my language down,'' said John Gage,
chief scientist at Sun.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Prusak, executive director of IBM's Institute for
Knowledge Management, is wary of inhibiting the use of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``With e-mail, you get an optimization of a firm's knowledge,''
Prusak said. ``You know Queen Elizabeth I said, `I don't wish to
build windows into men's souls.' That's in a sense what we're
beginning to do, and I find it very threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Iran-Contra investigations in which Col.
Oliver North's e-mail detailed illegal aid to the Nicaraguan
rebels, courts ruled that most government e-mail must be saved as a
public record. That has changed attitudes toward e-mail among
federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an enormous increase in information requests
from Congress, which has a very legitimate oversight function,''
said Sally Katzen, who formerly headed the Clinton administration's
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. ``But the call for
e-mails _ which in many instances are very susceptible to being
incomplete, cryptic and misunderstood _ has led a lot of people to
shun the use of e-mail, and I think that's most unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some critics say that unless e-mail comes to be viewed
through a more appropriate legal lens, companies, governments and
individuals will lose the full benefits of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail is perhaps the most contextually sensitive piece of
writing that we have, and culturally we're going through this stage
where we don't understand how to read it,'' said Lawrence Lessig, a
Harvard University law professor. ``The clumsiness that the legal
system has in dealing with this will lead to losing some of its
value unless we learn how to put it into context and properly weigh
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's own personal e-mail became a source of controversy last
year when he was named special master by the judge hearing the
Microsoft antitrust case. Microsoft contended that he was biased,
citing an e-mail message he had sent to a Netscape executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people now who will not send me things in e-mail,''
Lessig said.

CUSTOMS OFFICIALS SEIZE COLOMBIAN AIR FORCE PLANE CARRYING
COCAINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ U.S. customs officials seized about 1,600 pounds of
cocaine from a Colombian air force cargo plane that landed on
Monday at Fort Lauderdale International Airport, prompting
Colombia's air force chief to resign on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Kelly, commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, called
the case ``disturbing'' and said investigators were trying to sort
out who loaded the plane in Colombia and who had access to it
before it arrived at 2:30 p.m. with a crew of six and five
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that foreign military airplanes regularly flew into
the United States with supplies and personnel for embassies and
consulates, or for specific missions, and that his agency routinely
asked permission for random searches. Monday was the first time
that the searches had discovered drugs on a Colombian government
plane, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, the air force chief, Gen. Manuel Sandoval, offered
his resignation to President Andres Pastrana, who accepted it, said
Otto Gutierrez, a presidential aide.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Tuesday, Sandoval said that the plane, a
C-130, had gone to Florida to pick up ``logistical'' material and
that it had been searched by drug-sniffing dogs before it left a
military air base in Bogota, the Reuters news agency reported.
Sandoval, who said that as commander of the air force he had to
take responsibility for the incident, denied any widespread
involvement of the military in the drug trade. However, he
acknowledged the possibility that ``a small number of people are
committing crimes inside the air force.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's discovery comes just weeks after the first state visit
by a Colombian president to the White House in more than 20 years.
Pastrana, 43, has pledged full commitment to trying to rid his
country of cocaine and heroin production and has received $280
million in new aid from the United States for anti-drug efforts and
economic development. In August, he succeeded President Ernesto
Samper, who Washington said had financed his election with $6
million from drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said on Tuesday
that the Colombian government was fully cooperating with the
investigation and that ``this incident need have no effect
whatsoever on our views of President Pastrana's determination to
work with us to fight the export of drugs from Colombia.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Customs officials said inspectors found the cocaine after
noticing that several pallets of cargo on the plane had unusual
rivets and smelled of fresh glue. A drug-sniffing dog confirmed the
inspectors' suspicions. After drilling the pallets and extracting
white powder that tested positive for cocaine, the inspectors
dismantled the pallets and found 1,639 pounds of the drug, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Service officials questioned the crew and the
passengers, a family of five they said included an unidentified
retired Colombian air force officer, but no arrests have been made
while the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, the customs chief, said it was possible that the cocaine
had been placed on the plane without the involvement of anyone in
the military. But he said the case was still troubling, adding:
``It's disturbing a military aircraft was used. We're talking
something close to a ton of cocaine on an official aircraft.''

PLAYOFF-MINDED BRAVES TRADE NEAGLE FOR BOONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ In baseball's first major post-season trade, the
Atlanta Braves on Tuesday took their first step in trying to
reverse their post-season fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win six more games next year,'' said Braves general
manager John Schuerholz, alluding to the reason the Braves fell
short of the World Series championship for the sixth time in the
seven seasons they have been in the playoffs in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves sent Denny Neagle, a member of their vaunted starting
pitching rotation, to the Cincinnati Reds in a five-player trade
that brought them Bret Boone, the second baseman they coveted.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves also received a pitcher, Mike Remlinger, while the
Reds acquired Atlanta's primary right fielder, Michael Tucker, and
a minor league pitcher, Robby Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The trade could have implications negative and positive for the
New York Mets. The trade put the Braves in position to seek a right
fielder, and they will very likely pursue Brian Jordan, in whom the
Mets have interest. But the deal left the Mets in the running for
Fernando Vina, the Milwaukee Brewers' second baseman, whom the
Braves has also discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an understanding,'' Brewers general manager Sal Bando
said of Schuerholz. ``He had to make a decision which way he wanted
to go, left-handed or right-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz chose the right-handed-hitting Boone over the
left-handed-hitting Vina, who is 10 days younger than Boone.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers want pitching and/or right-handed power for Vina.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is somebody we have certainly talked about,'' said Mets
interim general manager Frank Cashen.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz said the Braves felt Neagle was expendable because of
the development of Kevin Millwood, who won 17 games for them this
season, and Bruce Chen, who pitched impressively in the latter
stages of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a second baseman and we wanted to get an excellent
second baseman,'' Schuerholz said. ``Bret provides us with more
offense and stellar defense at second base.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Gerald Williams would replace Tucker in right field but
added that he would seek another player for the position, either as
a regular or to platoon with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bowden said the Reds were reluctant to trade their Gold
Glove second baseman but explained: ``We wanted to upgrade our
starting pitching. With Neagle, Pete Harnisch and Brett Tomko, we
want to see how competitive we can be in the Central Division.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, who was a 20-game winner in 1997, had a 16-11 record
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker batted .244 in 130 games. Boone, son of the former major
leaguer Bob Boone, reached career highs with a team-leading 24 home
runs and 95 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger had an 8-15 record in 28 starts and 7 relief
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said Pokey Reese will replace Boone at second. Aaron
Boone, Bret's brother, will very likely be the Reds' third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bret probably was the most popular player in Cincinnati,''
Bowden said. ``We really didn't want to trade him.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Neagle's departure would prompt the Braves to go after
Kevin Brown, a high-priced free agent, Schuerholz said any such
signing would have to be offset with the shedding of salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a finite payroll,'' he said. ``It doesn't have a
bottomless pit.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: N.Y. AIRPORTS EMBRACE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication notice: also sent with `t' code) 
 (bl)  
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Access to the World Wide Web is increasing at New
York area airports, as the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey installs Internet kiosks at La Guardia and Newark
International Airports, and Host Marriott Services experiments with
similar computing equipment at several of its airport food outlets.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carl Selinger, manager of business development for
the aviation department of the Port Authority, there are currently
14 Internet kiosks at Newark, in Terminal C and in the gate areas
of United Airlines and American Airlines in Terminal A; 20 more
will be installed throughout the airport by Jan. 1. At La Guardia,
there are now 17 Internet units, at American's and United's gates
and near the food court in the central terminal, and also in the
Delta Air Lines shuttle terminal. The Internet equipment is being
provided by Atcominfo; Get2Net, a subsidiary of Great Universal,
and Internet Free for All, a unit of Facilities Communications
International Ltd.; Quick ATM also operates some equipment in
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Internet kiosks are operating on a trial basis,
temporarily offering users free access to the Web. Selinger said
the providers were determining rates for the service, which he
expects to be about $3.50 for 10 minutes' use.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority's long-term goal is to have 100 Internet
kiosks functioning at Newark and La Guardia, as well as Kennedy
International Airport, by next April.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for the last month Host Marriott Services has been
conducting its own trial of Get2Net's Cyberflyer Internet equipment
at its cocktail lounges at Newark and La Guardia, and at CK's
Restaurant in the Delta terminal at La Guardia. Use of these
computers is now free, though Stan Novack, Host Marriott's vice
president for concept development, said Get2Net would soon start
charging. So far, travelers have used the machines mostly to read
their e-mail, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1999, Host Marriott plans to open a Cyberflyer Club, an
Internet-themed restaurant containing approximately 10 Cyberflyer
units, at Lambert International Airport in St. Louis. Novack said
it was possible Host Marriott would later open similar restaurants
at Kennedy and San Jose International Airport in California.

METS TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO SURHOFF
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Day 2 of Frank Cashen's temporary return as general manger,
the Mets didn't make any moves, but they apparently have been
focusing on free agent B.J. Surhoff, the Baltimore Orioles' left
fielder last season.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Greg Clifton, Surhoff's agent, said that he had
held in-depth discussions with Steve Phillips before Phillips'
leave of absence went into effect on Sunday; since then, Clifton
said he had not heard from the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton said he did not see that as a negative, however, and was
anticipating that the Mets would be in contact with him soon.
</P>
<P>
   Cashen, speaking from the National League general managers
meeting in Naples, Fla., said Tuesday that he had not talked to
Clifton yet. ``But he called here today and one of our guys talked
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashen said that Surhoff ``seems to be interested in playing in
New York. And we're interested in talking to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets vice president David Howard said that he, Cashen and
the rest of the Mets' personnel team went through a hectic day of
meetings as Cashen attempted to pull together a front office shaken
by Phillips' sudden departure following an allegation of sexual
harassment from a former Mets employee.
</P>
<P>
   The agent for Mike Piazza said he hoped that Phillips would get
his job back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see him back as general manager,'' the agent, Dan
Lozano, said Tuesday. ``Steve sold us on a vision. And we want to
be part of that vision.''
</P>
<P>
   That vision apparently included an effort to sign the
34-year-old Surhoff, a left-handed hitter who in all probability
would bat behind Piazza if he is signed by the Mets. Surhoff batted
.279 last season with 22 homers and 92 RBIs. And Surhoff plays a
position _ left field _ that the Mets sorely lacked production from
last season.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cashen said Tuesday that he was well versed in the particulars
of Surhoff's career, beginning with his high school playing days in
Rye, N.Y., through his college career at the University of North
Carolina and his 12-year major league career _ the last three of
which have been spent with the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff began his career as a catcher, just like one of the
players the Mets attempted to make a left fielder of this past
season: Todd Hundley. Hundley's 34-game experiment in the outfield
was deemed a failure, and now the Mets are are trying to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley spoke to Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon on Tuesday night, and
Wilpon assured Hundley that the Mets would abide by Phillips'
promise that the Mets would trade him to a contending team.
</P>
<P>
   There are other free agents the Mets are apparently interested
in, among them right fielder Brian Jordan and third baseman Robin
Ventura. The Mets also have contacted representatives of their
free-agent reliever Dennis Cook in the hopes of re-signing him.
Cook said Tuesday that he wants to see what his value is on the
open market.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are also hoping they can resuscitate a proposed deal
with the Dodgers that would send Mel Rojas to Los Angeles in
exchange for former Met Bobby Bonilla. And Cashen Tuesday
acknowledged that the Mets have talked about trying to acquire
another former member of their organization, second baseman
Fernando Vina, from the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there is Surhoff, who played for what many
regarded as the most overpaid, underachieving team in baseball last
season. Surhoff, however, was not viewed as being that type of
player. And that may be one more reason why the Mets are interested
in signing him.

MICROSOFT NEW-MEDIA CHIEF TAKES LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The executive who has led Microsoft Corp.'s difficult foray into
the world of interactive media and Internet content is taking a
leave, and the company said Tuesday that he would return to a
different job next year.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Higgins, 40, vice president of the Interactive Media Group
at Microsoft since late 1996, has been one of the closest
lieutenants of William Gates, the chairman. But his most recent
assignment, to try to make the company a dominant player in the
world of new media, has had disappointing financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives stressed that Higgins' decision to take a
leave was a personal one. In a statement, Higgins said he had
decided to take time off to spend more time with his family. ``I
look forward to coming back and immersing myself in the next
challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said, however, that the company had continued
to struggle in its effort to gain financial momentum in several
content areas. The Interactive Media Group has also gone through
shake-ups and has had some layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the company reorganized its Internet business
under a single brand strategy based on its MSN label. Despite heavy
investment, however, the company has stopped giving out numbers on
its subscriber base for the MSN service.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins was originally the product manager for the company's
popular Excel spreadsheet program and later oversaw the growth of
the company's integrated Office suite of applications.

   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Cincinnati Reds publicity department needs to

<P>
   They planned to put second baseman Bret Boone on the cover, but
it wouldn't look good if the Reds had Atlanta's second baseman

   Boone, the subject of several trade discussions since the season
ended, was part of a five-player trade Tuesday the Reds made with
the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Boone and left-handed pitcher Mike Remlinger were sent to the
Braves for left-handed pitcher Denny Neagle, outfielder Michael
Tucker and minor-league right-handed pitcher Rob Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The trade fills one need for the Reds . . . starting pitcher
Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small-market teams can't survive without good starting
pitchers,'' general manager Jim Bowden said after making the trade
in Naples, Fla., during the general managers meetings. ``We can't
afford a big bat and we can't afford free-agent pitchers, so a
trade is the only way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said a few days ago he didn't want to trade Boone and
break up one of baseball's best double-play combinations _ Boone
and shortstop Barry Larkin. But he also said he would do it to get
a pitcher who can win 15 to 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, 30, has won 16 or more games the past three seasons,
including a 20-6 year in 1997 for the Braves. He was 16-11 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   He is 81-55 with a 3.78 earned run average for his career and
had five complete games last season, one less than the entire Reds'
staff, and three shutouts last season, the same as the entire Reds'
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the trade was Neagle,'' Bowden said. ``With him,
Pete Harnisch and Brett Tomko, we now have three pitchers who can
win between 15 to 20 games and that gives us a starting rotation
comparable to any team in our division _ including if the Astros
re-sign Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, Neagle has great make-up and a solid clubhouse
presence so that he can help our younger pitchers,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   While he was reluctant to trade Boone, Bowden said his staff,
including manager Jack McKeon and Boone's father, Reds special
adviser Bob Boone, agreed it was a solid baseball trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know for whom this trade was more painful, me or Bob
Boone,'' Bowden said. ``But I told Bret he is going to one of the
finest organizations in baseball and has a chance to be in the
playoffs right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bret Boone is one of my favorite players and one of my
favorite people,'' Bowden said. ``But my staff is right . . . this
is a good baseball trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds also are seeking a center fielder, but Tucker is not
that man, even though Bob Boone believes he can play center field.
Bowden said Tucker, 27, was acquired to add a left-handed bat.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has tried to trade for Tucker several times in the past
few years and publicity director Rob Butcher said, ``It seems like
I've typed up press releases about eight times when we came close
to trading for him, but the others always fell through.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds had an offer on the table to the Kansas City Royals in
the spring of 1997, but the Royals accepted an offer from the
Braves for Tucker, ruining Bowden's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no speed in our lineup last year and not enough
left-handed bats,'' Bowden said. ``Tucker gives us both. During the
playoffs this year it looked as if Tucker was finally making the
adjustments he needs to make that he hasn't made in the past that
kept him from reaching his potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker hit .244 with three homers and 46 RBI last season, a drop
from his 1997 season when he hit .283 with 14 homers and 56 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get Tucker to play center field,'' Bowden said. ``He
goes into the outfield mix with Jeffrey Hammonds, Reggie Sanders
and Dmitri Young, unless we can make another trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is trying diligently to trade Sanders and is working hard
trying to make a deal for Anaheim center fielder Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   The third player coming to the Reds, 21-year-old right-hander
Bell, was 14-7 with a 3.68 earned run average at Class A Macon, but
slipped to 7-9 in 28 starts at Class A Danville last year. But he
was rated the best right-hander in the Carolina League last year
after striking out 197 in 178.1 innings and walking only 46.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider him a John Smoltz/Darryl Kile type pitcher,''
Bowden said. ``He is 6-4, about 220 with a Kile-type curve and an
average change-up. He's another guy who down the road can win 15 to
20 games for us.

   SHARES OF INTEL HIT NEW HIGH ON STRONG PROFIT ESTIMATES
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel rose $1.5625, to $97.5625, andclimbed to $100.25
in after-hours trading after the semiconductor maker said that
fourth-quarter results would be above analysts' expectations. Intel
said stronger-than-expected demand for personal computers across
all market segments and geographies would increase revenue and
profit for the quarter.

   PRESIDENT WARNS AGAINST DUMPING
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the United States would not tolerate the
``flooding of our markets'' with low-cost goods from Asia and
Russia, particularly steel, that are threatening the jobs of
American workers. The President's statement came days after a White
House meeting of top executives of steel companies and the United
Steelworkers of America, which helped get out the vote for
Democrats last week.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS DECLINE FOR A SECOND DAY
</P>
<P>
   Stocks slipped as sellers emerged late in the day to push prices
down for a second consecutive session. Traders and analysts cited a
variety of reasons for the selloff, including concern about a
slowdown in the growth of corporate earnings and doubts that the
Federal Reserve's policy-making committee will cut interest rates
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint Capital sold $5 billion of bonds in the second-biggest
corporate sale ever.

   News Corp. raised $2.8 billion with the sale of 124.8 million
shares of Fox Entertainment Group. It was the third-largest initial

   OLD E-MAIL HAS BECOME A LIABILITY
</P>
<P>
   Companies are learning from the antitrust lawsuit against
Microsoft that old e-mail can be a mine field of legal liability,
not to mention a source of public embarrassment. So now companies
are imposing new restrictions on e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Higgins, vice president of the Interactive Media Group at
Microsoft since late 1996, is taking a leave from the company and
is expected to return to a different job next year. He had recently
headed Microsoft's effort to make the company a dominant player in
new media, but that move has had disappointing financial results.
</P>
<P>
   NEWSWEEK NAMES WHITAKER EDITOR
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Mark Whitaker was named editor of Newsweek. He
succeeds Maynard Parker, who died last month. Whitaker joined the
news magazine in 1977 as an intern and oversaw its technology and
business coverage before becoming managing editor. Newsweek
attracted attention this year for its coverage of the Monica
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   LONG-TERM CAPITAL EARNED A PROFIT
</P>
<P>
   Helped by a sharp rebound in bond markets worldwide, Long-Term
Capital earned a small paper profit for the banks and brokerage
firms that saved it from bankruptcy in six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTIVITY OF WORKERS RISES
</P>
<P>
   The productivity of American workers rose at a 2.3 percent
annual rate in the third quarter, offsetting higher labor costs and
giving Federal Reserve policy makers room to cut interest rates if
necessary.

   BANANAS AT ISSUE IN TRADE RIFT

NEWS CORP. OFFER RAISES $2.8 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The News Corp. on Tuesday completed the third-largest
initial public offering in American history, raising about $2.8
billion with the sale of 124.8 million shares of Fox Entertainment
Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The shares, representing an 18.6 percent stake in the new
company, were priced at $22.50 each, midway in the range of
anticipated prices.
</P>
<P>
   The News Corp. said earlier this year that it planned to sell
about 18 percent of its entertainment businesses to the public.
Those include the 20th Century Fox Film Corp., the Fox Network, and
Fox's various cable-programming operations, including Fox News, the
Fox Family Channel and a group of cable services called the
Fox-Liberty Sports Network.
</P>
<P>
   By selling a portion of its assets to the public, the company
hopes to highlight the value of those assets. That, in turn, can
improve the price of the News Corp.'s own stock.
</P>
<P>
   The new entity represents businesses that in the most recent
fiscal year, which ended June 30, generated $7 billion in sales and
$600 million in operating earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Entertainment offering ranked third behind the recent
initial public offering of Conoco Inc., which raised $4.4 billion,
and last year's offering of Lucent Technologies, which raised $3.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The News Corp. had planned to sell 85 million shares, but a
person close to the deal said demand was so great that the company
decided to expand the offering, raising more money and creating a
more liquid market for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal put an equity value of $15.1 billion on all of the new
company. The person involved in the deal said the News Corp.
expected to transfer $1.8 billion of its $9.3 billion in debt to
the new company. The company is expected to use some of the
proceeds to pay down debt.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch was the sole underwriter of the deal.

 &HT;    Customers rate local HMOs as 'good' in state survey
 &HT;    By John Murawski and Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ A state consumer survey of 22 health
maintenance organizations released Tuesday showed that most were
rated good overall, but none were rated excellent or poor.
</P>
<P>
   The Agency for Health Care Administration's ``Florida Health
Plan Checkup'' showed that 13 HMOs serving Palm Beach County and
the Treasure Coast were all rated ``good'' by their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have built a healthy managed care industry. It is not
perfect, but it is good,'' said Doug Cook, secretary of the Agency
for Health Care Administration, at a press conference in
Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 HMOs serving Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast
received scores ranging from 63 to 71 on a scale where 61 to 80 is
good. Customers were asked to rate their HMO as poor, fair, good or
excellent. The composite scores represent an average of customer
responses. The scores represent customers' answers to about two
dozen questions concerning access to doctors, ease of referrals to
specialists and paperwork hassles.
</P>
<P>
   The agency asked HMOs to submit names of their customers in each
of 11 state regulatory districts where they do business. The
customers had to be in the HMO at least six months. State
regulators didn't include HMOs that produced fewer than 85 complete
survey responses.
</P>
<P>
   The health-care agency said that 12 HMOs serving the regulatory
district of Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River and
Okeechobee counties were not included in the survey because they
were either too small, too new to the district or unwilling to
submit names of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said some of those who would not participate declined to do
so for fear of a low rating.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, which offers the Health
Options HMO in Palm Beach and Martin counties, was one of the HMOs
that didn't participate. The company said it was a waste of
taxpayers' money to rate HMOs that have been accredited and
licensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this project is duplicative and places an
unnecessary burden on taxpayers,'' said Blue Cross spokesman James
Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   But two HMOs listed as nonparticipating said they were surprised
to learn they were not included in Tuesday's announcement.
Neighborhood Health Partnership, in Miami, and Well Care HMO, in
Tampa, both said they had submitted their customers' names for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to look as though we didn't want to participate,''
said Nancy Gareu, vice president for operations at Well Care HMO.
``It's disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   An agency spokesman said Well Care had submitted incomplete
information and did not know Tuesday why Neighborhood Health
Partnership was excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Of the state's 37 commercial HMOs, 22 were included in the
study.
</P>
<P>
   The highest overall score in the state was 77 for Florida 1st
Health Plan, which serves the Fort Myers region, and the lowest
overall score was 56 for Foundation Health in the Tampa region.
More6 than 20,000 Floridians were surveyed by phone from January
through March.

 &HT;    Pass inference catching flak
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ The most scrutinized 338 words in the NFL rule
book this season can be found under the heading PASS INTERFERENCE,
section 4, sub-paragraphs (a)-(f).
</P>
<P>
   And many coaches and players, Miami's Jimmy Johnson among them,
must be wondering if the officials have bothered to read the fine
print.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see the flag down I have no idea which way they are
going to call it,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Pass interference and defensive holding in the secondary have
become one of the hottest topics in the NFL. Although the league is
down playing the controversy, they did their best to thrust it into
the spotlight three weeks ago by making public their views on two
calls that effected the outcome of the 49ers-Colts game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the toughest judgment call you have and it's a call
that's right up front,'' said Jerry Seeman, the NFL's director of
officiating.
</P>
<P>
   The league made the unprecedented decision to publicize its
findings that officials blew two calls that aided San Francisco's
34-31 victory over the Colts last month. Never before has the
league publicly apologized to a team for taking away a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a one-time thing,'' said Seeman, who would not
elaborate on the reason why findings were announced.
</P>
<P>
   Both calls were defensive holding and negated interceptions by
the Colts. Both times the 49ers scored while rallying from a 21-3
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The league also decided not to fine Colts coach Jim Mora for his
post game outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're giving everything they can to the offense and I think
they're really making it tough to play pass defense in this
league,'' Mora said.
</P>
<P>
   Mora will get no argument from Dolphins cornerback Terrell
Buckley, who is a victim of at least one pass interference almost
every week.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley is shorter (5-foot-9) than most receivers and relies on
a gambling, aggressive style. He was flagged three times in the
Rams and Patriots games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very tough to cover these guys,'' he said. ``When I
first came into the league, they let certain guys get way with
things. Today you have to be intelligent, really study tape, study
formations, know the other guy, know your defense, know when you
can do something and when you can't do something and know the
situation of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Seeman insists neither the rule nor the interpretation
has changed, he said the league emphasized the passing game during
their meetings with the competition committee last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure everyone fully understands what pass
interference is, that is must restrict, it is visually evident, it
must impede. And there must be an effect,'' Seeman said. ``Because
of the difficulty of the call we wanted to make sure (the
officials) continue to work to be in position to make the call.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, although defensive pass interference calls declined
the first six weeks of the season as compared to a year ago
according to Seeman, illegal contact, defensive holding and
offensive pass interference calls increased. An indication that
officials are looking closer at the call whether that was the
intention or not.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is upset by the inconsistency of the call. During
Sunday's victory against the Colts, the Dolphins benefited by a
penalty against Jason Belser, who was called for defensive
interference on a pass to Oronde Gadsden, but were the victims
three plays later when Gadsden was flagged for offensive pass
interference, negating a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Gadsden said neither was a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had half dozen close calls that could have gone either way
or could have been non calls,'' said Johnson, who spoke with Seeman
before Sunday's game about his concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Mora believes the officials are reacting to a league preference
for more scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis is to score points,'' Mora said. ``That's what
people like to see, and I think they're going to do things to
encourage that and hurt the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeman said his staff, which includes six assistants, spends 5
1/2 hours reviewing each game and every call. Officials are graded
and notified if an abundance of mistakes are spotted. Seeman has
not seen an increase in bad calls related to passing plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they are saying, ``We're going to emphasize it more
this year,''' Buckley said. ``And if your boss tells you to
concentrate on one area over another you do it. As players we
always have to adjust, not worry about it and play the way we know
how to play.''

GATES QUOTED AS SEEING CASE `BLOW OVER' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp.,
confidently told a group of industry executives in 1995 that the
government's antitrust investigation of his company would ``blow
over'' with scant effect, an executive who attended the private
meeting testified in court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And although Microsoft had signed a consent decree with the
government a year earlier agreeing to alter its software licensing
deals with personal computer makers, Gates was also quoted as
saying that the company had not really changed its business
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This antitrust thing will blow over,'' Gates said, according
to the handwritten notes of an executive of Intel Corp. that were
introduced Tuesday in the trial of the Microsoft antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't changed our business practices at all,'' Gates was
quoted as telling a group of Intel executives at the meeting on
July 11, 1995, at Intel's headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The notes were taken by Steven McGeady, a vice president of
Intel, who is a witness for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' comments about not having altered Microsoft's business
practices could be significant because they might suggest that the
company was not complying with the legally binding consent decree.
If the government wins the antitrust case, legal experts say,
Gates' comments could help the Justice Department argue that
sweeping remedies _ perhaps even breaking up the company _are
required to restore competition in the computer software business.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, these experts say, could point to the
Gates remarks as evidence that Microsoft had shown no restraint
even when operating under an agreement with the government. A
federal court approved the consent decree in 1995, but Microsoft
had agreed to its strictures when it signed the agreement in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft viewed the government's pointed focus on the Gates
comments as a ``further personal attack on Bill Gates'' and
``another example of the Justice Department's tactic of trial by
excerpt,'' said Mark Murray, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Murray pointed to other comments quoted by the Intel executive _
that the computer business was ``unbelievably competitive'' and
``healthy'' _ as evidence Gates was speaking in the broader context
of an industry leader who was optimistic the Justice Department
would eventually agree that Microsoft's business did not require
government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Murray added, Gates' remarks probably focused mainly on
the Justice Department's inquiries in 1995 about whether to allow
Microsoft to bundle a new online service, Microsoft Network, with
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   The notes of Gates' comments were introduced during the second
day of testimony by McGeady, the government's fourth witness in the
trial. Late Tuesday morning, Microsoft began cross-examining him.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Holley, a lawyer for Microsoft, used internal Intel
e-mail and the videotaped deposition of another Intel executive to
try to raise doubts about McGeady's assertion that Microsoft had
forced Intel to shelve some multimedia and Internet software
development work and to curb its support for such Microsoft
software rivals as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Netscape
Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Microsoft was so concerned about
any challenge to its dominance of desktop software that it
threatened even its close partner, Intel, by saying it would
withhold software support for Intel's new microprocessor products
unless Intel sided with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the cross-examination focused on an Intel software
initiative called ``native signal processing,'' or NSP, which was
intended to improve the ability of personal computers to play
high-quality audio and video. McGeady was deeply involved in the
development of NSP, a program that was sharply pared back after
Microsoft protested in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Microsoft argued that Intel began marketing NSP to
personal computer makers and did so when Microsoft was focused on
bringing out Windows 95, even though NSP was tailored for an
earlier version of the operating system, Windows 3.1.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Intel had not given Microsoft more advance notice
of its work on NSP, McGeady replied that Intel's software engineers
had feared that Microsoft would try to ``stomp it out of
existence.'' And, he added, ``It was the fear that was eventually
realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet under cross-examination, McGeady admitted that in retrospect
``it was a mistake'' to target its multimedia software for Windows
3.1 instead of Windows 95. The reason, he explained, was that Intel
thought that the release date for the next-generation operating
system might well slip into 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also showed parts of a taped deposition from Ron
Whittier, an Intel executive who was McGeady's boss. Whittier said
that pressure from Gates to table NSP was ``a factor'' in Intel's
decision not to ship the software. But, he said, Intel was mainly
``looking out for our own best interests'' because if NSP slowed
the adoption of personal computers using Windows 95, that could
damage Intel's main business _ microprocessor sales to PC makers
for use in new machines.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing the tape, McGeady said, ``I'd say Microsoft helped
enlighten us about about what our best interests were.''
</P>
<P>
   He then characterized Whittier's emphasis on Intel's
self-interest instead of any threat from Microsoft as ``PR spin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At his deposition?'' asked Holley, the Microsoft lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' McGeady replied.

 Pac Bell Wireless Faces Lawsuit Over Ads  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A lawsuit filed  &LR; Tuesday  &LR; charges that Pacific Bell Wireless has
been misleading customers in California with false and deceptive
advertising and should be forced to stop.
<P>
   The company, which has been heavily marketing wireless phone
service for less than 5 cents per minute, is actually charging
consumers much more, except in very specific cases, the suit
alleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you can get 5 cents a minute is if you use up all
your free minutes, which are designated for certain times and
certain days. That's not clear in the ads,'' said Michael Linfield,
a Pasadena attorney who filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior
Court. ``In some cases, you're actually paying 49 cents a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell officials said they had not seen the suit and could
not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the company's 5-cent plan, wireless customers who sign up
for the 5-cent package pay $19.95 a month for 500 free weekend
minutes and 20 free weekday minutes. If a customer uses all those
minutes on the designated days, the cost per minute is less than 5
cents. However, if a customer uses only 100 of the free minutes on
the weekends, the cost comes out to about 20 cents per minute,
Linfield said.
</P>
<P>
   And once customers use up their 20 free weekday minutes, they
are charged significantly more for weekday calls, sometimes 49
cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Linfield said Pac Bell can charge whatever it wants, but the ads
fool people into thinking they are getting a 5-cent rate all the
time. He filed the suit on behalf of a Pac Bell Wireless customer
who ``is not getting what she thought she was paying for,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Linfield, who specializes in consumer rights, said he plans to
file a similar suit against Sprint PCS  &LR; on Thursday &LR; . That suit
focuses on an ad campaign that offers Sprint PCS service for 10
cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS officials had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads are deceptive and they're something you'd expect
from small-time operators,'' Linfield said. ``We want a court to
force them to stop the misleading advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit comes on the heels of another filing against wireless
carriers in California. In August, a San Diego attorney sued Pac
Bell, AirTouch, Sprint PCS and GTE Wireless for charging customers
by the minute, instead of by the second. That suit is still
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say the explosion of wireless service has
made it easy for companies to confuse customers. They warn people
to read the fine print before signing up for any service and to
make sure they get everything in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as the wireless companies like to tout the simplicity
of their rates, some rates are designed to confuse,'' said Charles
Carbone of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a state consumer
group. ``They don't want customers to go out and sufficiently shop
the market. So when you actually subscribe to a service, you find
out the rate structures are quite confusing and not clear-cut like
the advertisements suggest.''

GIULIANI DEFENDS WELFARE CURBS AS U.S. PROBE CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Tuesday defended his policy
of delaying the distribution of food stamp and Medicaid
applications to the poor and denied that his welfare commissioner
had ever said the policy would change.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's remarks came as federal officials from the
Agriculture Department and the Health Care Financing Administration
continued their inquiry into the city's welfare policies. The
federal officials have said the city appeared to be violating the
law by delaying applications in an effort to discourage the needy
from applying for welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare Commissioner Jason Turner told The New York Times on
Sunday that he planned to speed up the distribution of applications
as an ``extra precaution'' to mollify federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our new policy is just to hand them a food stamp
application,'' Turner said in the telephone interview, calling the
change ``an improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Giuliani denied that Turner had ever made that
statement. The mayor did not explain why he did not dispute those
comments Monday, the day when Turner's comments appeared. Colleen
Roche, a spokeswoman for Giuliani, declined to elaborate Tuesday.
Turner was not available for comment Tuesday, according to his
press secretary, Debra Sproles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner didn't say that,'' Giuliani said during a
news conference Tuesday, referring to the comments published in The
Times. ``Sometimes, things aren't reported exactly the way somebody
says something because there is an emotional or ideological bias
that drives the way something is reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Purnick, the metropolitan editor of The New York Times,
dismissed Giuliani's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reporter had two extensive conversations with Mr. Turner
on Sunday, took detailed notes, and never got a subsequent
complaint from him saying he was quoted incorrectly,'' Ms. Purnick
said. ``We do not make things up, nor are our reporters politically
motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's remarks were the city's latest response to questions
about the federal inquiry into his welfare policies. The topic is
highly sensitive for the Giuliani administration because the mayor
has repeatedly described his tough welfare policy as one of his
administration's primary accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is particularly proud of his decision to convert
welfare offices into ``job centers,'' where the needy are
encouraged to rely on jobs, relatives and food pantries instead of
government checks.
</P>
<P>
   In the job centers, the vast majority of people receive
applications only on their second visit, the practice that touched
off the federal inquiry. Federal law requires city officials to
distribute food stamp and Medicaid applications on the first day
that anyone walks into a welfare office.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said Sunday that the city would expedite the distribution
of applications. Monday, city officials appeared to reverse
themselves, saying they would not speed the process after all.
Anthony Coles, a senior adviser to Giuliani, said the Agriculture
Department had decided to judge the city's programs based on the
1996 federal welfare law, which allows states and cities to delay
welfare applications.
</P>
<P>
   The current law governing food stamps and Medicaid, however,
requires city officials to distribute applications without delay.
And officials from the Agriculture Department and Health Care
Financing Administration said those existing laws still applied.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Medicaid officials will meet with state health
officials, who are responsible for monitoring the city's Medicaid
program. The federal officials, who have requested copies of the
city's application and referral procedures, hope to determine
whether the city's program complies with federal law.

LONG-TERM CAPITAL SAID TO EARN A SMALL PROFIT FOR ITS RESCUERS
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Helped by a sharp rebound in bond markets worldwide,
Long-Term Capital Management has earned a small paper profit for
the banks and brokerage firms that saved it from bankruptcy in
September, people close to the hedge fund said.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout in the fund's fortunes is modest, the people said.
The portfolio's value has risen no more than 1 percent since the 14
banks and brokerage firms invested $3.6 billion six weeks ago. ``We
are ahead by a nose,'' one person, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation has greatly improved from the days just after
the rescue, when many of Long-Term Capital's bets looked like long
shots. The value of the fund's portfolio fell sharply in late
September and early October, just after the rescue, but began to
improve late last month. The recovery picked up pace this month,
with the fund earning back all it had lost since late September, as
markets rallied globally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not out of the woods yet, and the operative word is
caution,'' one person close to the hedge fund said. ``But there is
a sense of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The improved results are good news for Wall Street firms,
including Merrill Lynch, Goldman, Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P.
Morgan and Citigroup, that saved Long-Term Capital in an unusual
effort brokered by the New York Federal Reserve. Many of those
firms were reluctant to risk their own shareholder funds _ $100
million to $300 million apiece _ to prop up a speculative
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   But if the good news continues, it would seem to support the
view that it was better to rescue the fund and manage its trading
positions over months or years than to plunge it into bankruptcy
and sell its holdings all at once, which Fed officials feared could
worsen global market turmoil. ``We believed for some time that
there was value in the positions if we could get past the market
crisis,'' said an executive from a firm that participated in the
bailout.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilization of the fund has not greatly benefited its
original investors, whose money was committed well before it nearly
collapsed. Long-Term Capital was down more than 90 percent for the
year before the rescue, and the recent rebound makes up only a
small fraction of that earlier loss.
</P>
<P>
   The fund tries to profit by exploiting temporary price
differences between related types of bonds, like Treasury bonds and
corporate bonds. The price gap between such bonds widened to
unusual levels in the summer. Since the Federal Reserve twice cut
interest rates in October, that price gap has narrowed.

   NEW YORK _ Leonard de Paur, a conductor of choruses and
orchestras, an arranger and an administrator who for 17 years was
the director of community relations for Lincoln Center, died on
Saturday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   De Paur created the popular Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival
and the Community Holiday Festival, which both present
international artists from a wide variety of disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   His work as director of community relations was enriched by his
gregarious nature, broad engagement with the fine and popular arts
and, as a black man, his ties to minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   De Paur had an extensive career as a conductor and arranger
before his work at Lincoln Center. From 1947 to 1968 he conducted
more than 2,300 performances with a succession of groups: the de
Paur Infantry Chorus, the de Paur Opera Gala, the de Paur Gala and
the de Paur Chorus.
</P>
<P>
   During this period he also appeared as a guest conductor with
the Cincinnati Symphony, the Orchestra of America and the Minnesota
Symphony, among others, and was a regular conductor of the Symphony
of the New World and Opera South.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the choral director for several recordings that have
become classics, including the 1947 RCA Victor recording of the
opera ``Four Saints in Three Acts,'' with music by Virgil Thomson
and text by Gertrude Stein, in which many singers were from the
original all-black 1934 cast, and the 1963 RCA Victor recording of
excerpts from Gershwin's ``Porgy and Bess,'' with Leontyne Price
and William Warfield.
</P>
<P>
   De Paur used to say there was never a time when he could not
remember wanting to be a musician. He was born in Summit, N.J., on
Nov. 18, 1914. And though his father, a lawyer active in local
politics, was at first dismayed by his son's choice of career, both
of de Paur's parents were music lovers. In a 1989 interview, de
Paur recalled of his father: ``Like all people with big, deep bass
voices, my father adored tenors. So we had in the house lots of
records by Caruso, and every record that John McCormack must have
made.''
</P>
<P>
   De Paur attended the Juilliard School and Columbia University.
His teachers included the composer Henry Cowell and the conductor
Pierre Monteux.
</P>
<P>
   For a while he toured as a baritone on the Loew's Theater
circuit. In 1932, he began a four-year stint as assistant conductor
of the noted Hall Johnson Choir.
</P>
<P>
   From 1936 to 1939, de Paur was a music director with the Federal
Negro Theater, a Works Progress Administration project, notably
working on the all-black production of ``Macbeth,'' directed by a
young actor named Orson Welles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942 he enlisted in the U.S. Army and was assigned to the
Army Air Corps. He soon became the choral director for the official
Army Air Force show, ``Winged Victory.''
</P>
<P>
   It was from this show, after the war ended, that the ranks of
his first ensemble, the de Paur Infantry Chorus, were drawn. This
and his subsequent choirs brought a wide repertory, including the
music of African-Americans, to countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the musical director for the 1952 revival on
Broadway of ``Four Saints in Three Acts,'' which featured Ms.
Price, just out of Juilliard, in her first professional
performance. He also worked on the enormously successful revival of
``Carmen Jones,'' an all-black retelling of the ``Carmen'' story.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years de Paur served as a consultant on cultural
development for Tunisia, as a repertory consultant and editor for
the music publisher G. Schirmer Inc. and as an arranger and
conductor on the ``Bell Telephone Hour,'' the ``Hallmark Hall of
Fame'' and other television programs.
</P>
<P>
   His teaching career included posts at the University of Colorado
and Lewis and Clarke College in Portland, Ore. He received honorary
doctorates from Lewis and Clark as well as Morehouse College.
</P>
<P>
   De Paur's first marriage ended in divorce in 1955. He is
survived by his wife, Norma Childs de Paur; a daughter, Norma Lynn
de Paur; a son, Leonard Childs de Paur, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   At his retirement in 1988, a plaque was mounted in de Paur's
honor in Lincoln Center Plaza, which remains a testimony to his
many contributions.

CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN   WAITS TO CAPITALIZE ON GOP SHAKEUP

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ U.S. Rep. Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon decided not to
enter the race for House majority leader, but the California
congressman remains on the ascent as Republicans hold on to a slim
majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon has helped push Rep. Bob Livingston's rise in the
Republican ranks, and when the Louisiana lawmaker became the
front-runner for House speaker last week, McKeon considered running
for the No. &UR;  &LR; 2 post.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon had been expected to join a short list of Republicans
competing against Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma in his bid to
unseat Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, McKeon threw his support back to Armey, saying he
polled fellow party members and concluded that Armey could hold off
the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is I have very good access to the speaker
for things that I might need or being able to help when he needs
help,'' McKeon said of his rapport with Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are expected to pick Livingston to replace
Newt Gingrich as their new speaker Nov. 18. Gingrich said last week
he is stepping down as speaker and will leave Congress.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said Livingston asked him Tuesday to organize a
celebration to commemorate the event, reprising a prayer service
and reception he led when the Republicans became the majority in
congress under Gingrich in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got plenty to do,'' McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon joined in helping lead Livingston's campaign for speaker,
which began nearly 10 months ago. That effort originally was aimed
at replacing Gingrich next year, when the Georgian was expected to
step down and begin a run for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came out to California in July and went to about 10
(congressional) districts and I was a strong supporter of that
effort,'' McKeon recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that Newt would step down sometime next year and
run for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this election and then Newt subsequently resigning, it
just sped everything up. But we had already done all of the
groundwork and we had most of the votes lined up.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon was re-elected Nov. 3 to a fourth term representing the
25th Congressional District, which includes parts of Southern
California's the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said he felt he would be a better majority leader for the
party than either Largent, the conservative former football star,
or Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., who is more moderate.
</P>
<P>
   One of McKeon's strengths is bringing different factions within
the party together, as well as working with Democrats. He decided
to support the experienced Armey rather than launch a potentially
divisive campaign for majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the interest of bringing more harmony than disruption, I
decided to stick with Dick,'' McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon, 60, rose from school board trustee and mayor of Santa
Clarita to president of his freshman Republican congressional class
in 1992. Gingrich handpicked him to serve on the House transition
team for the GOP's takeover of Congress two years later.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years McKeon has chaired the House
subcommittee on postsecondary education. He also is a member of the
National Security Committee and is angling for a seat on the
powerful Appropriations Committee.

 (Editors: makes changes in 2nd and 3rd graphs.)   Lawsuit Says BofA Sold Too Cheaply 
 &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A Burlingame law firm has filed a class-action lawsuit accusing the
old BankAmerica Corp. and North Carolina's NationsBank Corp. of
cheating BofA shareholders by falsely claiming their $43 billion
combination was a ``merger of equals.''
<P>
   In a suit filed last week in San Francisco Superior Court,
Cotchett, Pitre &AMP; Simon characterized the transaction as a
NationsBank takeover of the old BofA, not a merger of equals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  If the deal was indeed a takeover, stockholders of the old
BofA should have received a premium price for their shares, the
lawyers contend. Instead, BofA shareholders received no premium for
their shares.
</P>
<P>
   The suit doesn't specify the amount of damages. But Bruce Simon,
the lead attorney on the case, said shareholders ultimately could
collect more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   San Mateo resident Gregory Baker is plaintiff in the case,
acting on behalf of all California stockholders of the old BofA at
the end of September, when shareholders voted on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank, which now uses the BankAmerica name, has been
slapped with two dozen or more lawsuits since the transaction
closed September 30. The suits charge it with concealing trading
and investment banking losses. The bank said it made losses public
as it learned of them.
</P>
<P>
   This is apparently the first suit to focus on the issue of the
nature of the transaction itself, Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   In disclosure documents distributed to shareholders before the
vote to approve the transaction, the old BofA said both parties
were committed ``to a true merger of equals in which control is
shared, so no control premium would be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent, the proxy statement told the old BofA
shareholders the transaction was a merger of equals, it was
misleading,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank said both banks properly disclosed the nature of the
transaction to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there's any validity to these claims and we
intend to contest them vigorously,'' spokesman Richard Stilley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deal was announced in April, analysts have
consistently described it as a takeover, not a merger.
</P>
<P>
   After the combination took effect September 30, NationsBank
Chief Executive Officer Hugh McColl moved quickly to force out
David Coulter, his counterpart at the old BofA, extend his own
tenure and consolidate his grip on the combined organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a takeover, shareholders of the acquired company typically
get paid something above the market price of their stock in
exchange for giving up control. The typical takeover premium is 9
percent above the market price, Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   Independent legal experts said the suit raises an important
issue, but that BofA could defend itself by pointing out that
shareholders were told that NationsBank would control the combined
bank's board and chief executive slot, and that the headquarters
would remain in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   James Rockett, a banking lawyer with the San Francisco firm
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &AMP; Enersen, said those disclosures would
allow any reasonable person to realize NationsBank was actually
buying BofA. ``Those terms in and of themselves would show that the
transaction was less than a merger of equals,'' he said.

THE SCOOP ON COLLEGE HOOP
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Say what you will about the sleazy street agents
and summer coaches who control recruiting. Complain all you want
about the NBA exodus, mediocre talent, megalomaniacal coaches and
exorbitant shoe deals.
</P>
<P>
   At least the NCAA season started on time.
</P>
<P>
   This year's defining characteristics _ both from area and
national perspectives _ are the return of parity and the quality
depth in the Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant teams of recent years (North Carolina, Kentucky and
Arizona) have rejoined the pack, leaving a slew of pretenders in
their exhaust. Duke, Temple, Stanford, Maryland, Connecticut and
Michigan State are supposedly the new wrecking crew. Combined,
they've played in one Final Four in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Around here, Lorenzo Romar's building a West Coast Conference
power at Pepperdine while Bobby Braswell welcomes the enigmatic
Rico Harris to Cal State Northridge. USC coach Henry Bibby and
UCLA's Steve Lavin are preparing 20 freshmen and sophomores for the
most talented Pac-10 ever.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking ACC-caliber competition, with elite teams and a
sturdy mid-section _ a mid-section that includes UCLA and Arizona.
When the big guns are fighting for fourth place, you've arrived.
</P>
<P>
   So here we go _ five months, hundreds of teams and thousands of
games in 800 words:
</P>
<P>
   Final Four: Duke, Connecticut, Maryland and Temple.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils have the best combination of athletes, size and
depth, including powerful, gifted sophomore Elton Brand, who's more
polished than Karl Malone was at Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has the nation's best scorer, wing guard Richard
``Rip'' Hamilton, himself a reincarnation of Ray Allen, although
bigger. Maryland has the nation's best junior college transfer,
guard Steve Francis. And Temple finally has the offense (Rasheed
Brokenborough and fabulous freshman Mark Karcher) to match coach
John Chaney's confounding zone defense.
</P>
<P>
   Five to thrive: Brand, Hamilton, Utah guard Andre Miller,
Michigan State guard Mateen Cleaves and Duke guard Trajan Langdon.
Next best: New Mexico forward Kenny Thomas, South Carolina guard
B.J. McKie, Kentucky forward Scott Padgett, Texas Christian forward
Lee Nailon and Miami (Ohio) forward Wally Szczerbiak.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuous by their absence: Seven-footers. Brand is 6-8 and an
NBA power forward. Thomas, Nailon and Padgett are more adept from
12 feet than five feet. It's a wing man's game.
</P>
<P>
   Rising stars: Indiana forward Luke Recker, Tennessee guard Tony
Harris, Georgia forward Jumaine Jones, Wake Forest guard Robert
O'Kelley and Ohio State guard Michael Redd.
</P>
<P>
   Recker is Indiana's best player since Calbert Cheaney and will
lead a Hoosier revival. Bobby Knight finally has talented players
who actually like him.
</P>
<P>
   Top freshmen: North Carolina's Jason Capel and Ron Curry, who
doubles as the Tar Heels' quarterback, DePaul's Quentin Richardson
and UNLV's Chris Richardson (no relation), Indiana's Dane Fife and
Florida's Mike Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Best transfers: Francis and Fresno State's Courtney Alexander
(formerly of Virginia) are the best of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, a 6-foot-3 junior, teams with wing man LaRon Profit,
point guard Terrell Stokes and center Obinna Ekezie to give
Maryland its most talent lineup since the Buck Williams-Albert King
teams of the early 80s. The Terps are scheduled to play UCLA in the
second round of the San Juan Shootout, and that means big trouble
for the boys in blue.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10 order of finish: 1.Stanford, 2.Cal, 3.Washington,
4.Arizona, 5.UCLA, 6.Arizona State, 7.USC, 8.Oregon, 9.Washington
State, 10.Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford has the most experience, the most size, the most depth,
the best system and the best coach. Other than that, there's not
much to like.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA and Arizona will rely heavily on freshmen, each team
starting as many as three. But the Wildcats have two starting
seniors (point guard Jason Terry and center A.J. Bramlett) for
leadership while the Bruins have sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   And don't expect much from Baron Davis. Once he's cleared to
play _ perhaps early December _ it'll take him weeks to regain
timing and months to learn to play without his pre-injury
explosion. He should be near 100 percent for the 1999-2000 season,
if he stays in school.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10's best 10: Arizona State forward Bobby Lazor, Cal guard
Geno Carlisle and forward Sean Lampley, Stanford guard Arthur Lee
and forward Mark Madsen, Washington center Todd MacCulloch and
guard Donald Watts, Oregon State guard Deaundra Tanner, Arizona
center Bramlett and UCLA freshman forward JaRon Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Madsen, Tanner and Lampley are the league's rising stars _ Rush
won't be around long enough _ but the most valuable player may be
Watts. If he's good, consistently good, the Huskies will have a
breakthrough season. If not, Washington will wallow in the middle
of the Pac.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10's best freshmen: Rush is the best of them all, more
athletic than Kris Johnson, more skilled than Toby Bailey. Also,
watch for Arizona's Michael Wright, Oregon's Freddie Jones, USC's
Sam Clancy, Washington's Senque Carey and Cal's Shahar Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   The early word: Arizona freshman Ruben Douglas, a Bell-Jeff High
grad, is more polished than UCLA's Ray Young.

 By JAMES RISEN and STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the Middle East peace talks last month in
Maryland, the director of the CIA told President Clinton he would
resign if Clinton agreed to release the spy Jonathan Jay Pollard,
according to several administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   The director, George Tenet, who was directly involved in the
peace negotiations, gave his warning to President Clinton after
learning that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had made
Pollard's case a key bargaining point, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Clinton turned down Netanyahu's request, and the
matter did not prevent the negotiators from reaching a peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet refused to comment on the matter Tuesday, as did a
spokesman for the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet's threat to resign was a direct reflection of the depth of
anger against Pollard that lingers among U.S. intelligence and law
enforcement officials 13 years after the former naval intelligence
analyst was arrested for passing top-secret documents to Israel. He
is now serving a life term.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence and law enforcement circles insist that the
American spy should never be freed and dismiss the fact that he
acted on behalf of a friendly nation. But the far right in Israel
has made Pollard's release a celebrated cause _ and Netanyahu has
raised it with the president virtually every time they have met.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent talks, Netanyahu told Clinton that he needed
Pollard's release in order to win over the right wing of his
coalition to the peace agreement, according to senior American
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was open to what Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, said they needed to help sell the peace agreement to their
constituencies, these officials said. The president was considering
Pollard's release, they officials said, when Tenet spoke up. ``It
was clearly on the table,'' said one U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   While a White House spokesman, David C. Leavy, refused to
comment on whether Tenet threatened to resign over Pollard, he did
say, ``At no time did the president make a decision to release Mr.
Pollard.''
</P>
<P>
   During the conference, at Wye Mills, Md., Clinton had been
``impressed by the force of Netanyahu's arguments'' on the Pollard
matter, Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   The president then went back to consult with his advisers,
including Tenet and national security adviser Sandy Berger, and
eventually decided that he could not agree to Netanyahu's demand,
Leavy added.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the opposition to releasing Pollard was persuasive,
administration officials said. Clinton, who twice before denied
Netanyahu's calls for releasing the spy, agreed only to review the
case again, for the third time in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that Tenet believed that he would lose his
credibility with his rank and file in the intelligence services if
he were to agree to Pollard's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew that he was closely associated with these peace talks
_ it wasn't like he was back at headquarters _ and he couldn't
distance himself from this decision,'' one U.S. official said of
Tenet.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet's resignation would have forced Clinton to find his fourth
CIA director in less than six years _ making the post one of the
most difficult and intractable personnel problems to plague his
administration. Twice Clinton has had to stand by and watch as his
nominees have been forced to withdraw before being confirmed by the
Senate, and twice the president has had to find backup candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet, 45, who was named director of Central Intelligence in
1997, pledged to remain in the job for at least four years in an
effort to provide the agency with some stability.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving at the CIA's Langley, Va., headquarters in 1995,
first as the CIA's deputy director, Tenet has worked to revive the
morale and provide a new focus after the cold war while winning
increased funding from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Pollard case was one issue on which it was impossible for
Tenet to straddle both his political and intelligence
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as word leaked out that Pollard's freedom had become a
bargaining chip in the Middle East talks, U.S. law enforcement and
intelligence officials went into nearly open rebellion, complaining
that the president should not release someone who had so flagrantly
betrayed national security. Accepting a Pollard deal with Netanyahu
would have forced Tenet to side with the White House against his
own lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pollard had been released, George would have had no choice
but to resign,'' said one senior congressional official involved in
intelligence matters.
</P>
<P>
   The anger within the intelligence agencies was fueled by the
fact that, during the 18 months he spied for Israel in 1984 and
1985, Pollard stole more top-secret documents than almost any other
spy in American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stole huge amounts of intelligence, measured in cubic
yards,'' said R. James Woolsey, former director of Central
Intelligence, who recommended that Pollard be denied clemency when
his case was first reviewed by President Clinton in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He took thousands of pages of the government's most sensitive
intelligence, including many concerning Soviet weapons system
designs that came from Russian spies recruited by the CIA, as well
as codes and large caches of information from American spy
satellites and listening posts. The information of great interest
to Israel because its Arab opponents used Russian weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He betrayed some of America's most sophisticated espionage
technology, and handed over so many documents that his Israeli
handlers had to equip a secure Washington apartment with a
high-speed photocopier and photographic equipment to absorb it all.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has refused to return those documents ever since, and
U.S. intelligence officials say that the lack of Israeli
cooperation has made it impossible for U.S. investigators to
resolve one of the most sensitive questions raised by the Pollard
case _ whether any of the thousands of pages of top secret
documents he passed on might somehow have ended up in the hands of
America's enemies, including the Soviet Union. Such an outcome
would have given the enemies knowledge of what American
intelligence had learned, and perhaps how.

HUARD'S SEASON A PAINFUL ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Brock Huard's grade-point average was 3.6, it was far
below his standards. So he changed his major.
</P>
<P>
   Huard _ quarterback and pre-med student at Washington, and not
necessarily in that order _ was concerned the GPA in his major
wasn't showing what was necessary to take it to the next level.
Besides, balancing organic chemistry with the two-minute drill
suggested one of his endeavors would not get optimal commitment.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, it's needless to ask Huard if he regrets not
jumping to the NFL after his sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   This fall hasn't been at all what he expected. The Huskies have
slumped into mediocrity, mainly because they led the nation in
players selected in the NFL draft last April. Ten players,
including seven on offense, were taken.
</P>
<P>
   As the 5-4 Huskies prepare to host No.3 UCLA on Saturday, their
left-handed quarterback might as well be wearing a purple
bull's-eye on his chest rather than the number 7. Opponents know
this is the only guy on the field who can hurt you, and they
structure their defenses accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hate to see him taking those hits,'' said Damon Huard,
Brock's older brother and a reserve quarterback for the Miami
Dolphins. ``I feel every single one he takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Brock Huard contemplated a loss to USC on Halloween
and said grimly: ``I split my chin open. I got to bleed a little
bit, so at least I try to look tough. The quarterback is supposed
to be a little prima donna. At least I got some blood on my jersey
and look like a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   He might as well make light of the situation. What else to do?
</P>
<P>
   Among the Washington players drafted last April were tailback
Rashaan Shehee, go-to wide receiver Jerome Pathon, offensive
linemen Olin Krentz and Benji Olson, !ital!two!off! tight ends
(Cameron Cleeland, Jeremy Brigham) and another wide receiver, Fred
Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Huskies coach Jim Lambright had little recourse than to gather a
lot of fresh faces around Huard, especially since the Huskies'
program is still stinging from the scholarship restrictions that
accompanied its probation scandal of the early '90s. The on-the-job
training hasn't gone particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   Washington uses a tailback rotation of two freshmen, Braxton
Cleman and Willie Hurst. No back has yet to top 100 yards rushing
this season. Its leading rusher is its backup quarterback, Marques
Tuiasosopo.
</P>
<P>
   So there's a heavy reliance on you-know-who. Huard threw the
ball 62 times against the Trojans, tying a Pacific-10 record for a
conference game. He has a Pac-10-leading 11 interceptions. And he
missed two games with a partial separation of his left shoulder
after Arizona stuck him into the Huskies' artificial turf like a
garden stake.
</P>
<P>
   There are lessons to learn, though, experiences to gain even in
the face of tribulation and a weakside blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season could definitely be a blessing in disguise,''
brother Damon said, ``because in the NFL you've got to be able to
deal with adversity.... He has had to deal with criticism and
taking a beating. He's a lot more well-rounded, I think, from his
experiences this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing I've learned,'' Brock said, ``is you've got to
keep going as hard as you can go, you have to keep firing passes
and keep getting after it. It only makes you better, truly....
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I left, I would have gone into that (NFL) situation not
knowing what it's like to get slapped in the face or knocked down,
or have to deal with some losses and real adversity. The things
that have gone on this year can only strengthen you, they can only
enrich your competitive spirit even more.''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to stay in school, Huard considered the examples of
other underclassmen who initially floundered in the NFL, including
a kid from his high school in Puyallup, Wash., former Huskies
quarterback Billy Joe Hobert.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Tommy Maddox, Todd Marinovich, Billy Joe and
different guys,'' Huard said. ``Some of the guys I talked to said
that no matter when you come out, you're not going to be ready for
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   John Dorsey, director of college scouting for the Green Bay
Packers, nods in assent. Getting extra seasoning in college, Dorsey
said, ``is valuable not only from a physical standpoint, but an
intellectual standpoint. It's a critical position, and it takes `x'
amount of years to perfect that position. I personally feel that a
quarterback takes three to four years to mature and become
comfortable in the NFL _ with the reads, the complexity of
defenses, gaining confidence and respect of older players.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if Huard's rough-edged junior season has
caused his NFL stock to plunge. It's not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Huard, 22, is 6-feet-5 and 220 pounds with tremendous arm
strength. Scouts may notice he throws off his back foot a bit too
often, but they might also conclude this is done in the interests
of self-preservation. And they might notice that the ball is still
traveling 40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Had he come out last spring, Huard likely would have been the
third quarterback selected, far behind the guys taken 1-2, Peyton
Manning and Ryan Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   This coming spring, the entire Washington athletic program
expects him to forgo his final season of eligibility _ he'll have
earned a degree, in psychology, in 3{ years _ and he figures to be
in a cluster of top NFL prospects that includes Tim Couch of
Kentucky, Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida and Donovan McNabb of
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The depletion of Huard's supporting cast will mitigate his rocky
performance in '98, the Packers' Dorsey said. Also, NFL scouts are
known to develop extremely short memories. Produce one dazzling
combine workout, for example, and they'll quickly forget the three
interceptions in the fourth quarter against USC.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, a scout looking over any of those videotapes might
detect, amid all the chaos, newfound grit in this quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will see,'' Damon says of brother Brock, ``that he
doesn't quit. He stays a fighter.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

DEMOCRATIC MONEY MAN HAS IMMUNITY FROM STARR
</HEADLINE>
  (dal)  
By DAVID JOHNSTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Huang, a Democratic fund-raiser at the center
of the 1996 campaign finance controversy, was granted immunity
earlier this year in exchange for his cooperation in another
criminal case, Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton's
longtime Arkansas friend, Webster Hubbell, law-enforcement
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has long investigated Hubbell, formerly the No. 3 official
in the Justice Department, for accepting fees of more than $700,000
in 1994 from friends and supporters of Clinton. At issue was
whether Hubbell was paid for his silence about Clinton's actions in
the Arkansas land deal that touched off Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, Starr shifted his attention to what some saw as
parallel circumstances. In January, he began investigating
Clinton's relationship with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky
and accusations that he and associates helped find Ms. Lewinsky a
job in New York in order to insure that she would deny their affair
in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   It was revealed Tuesday that Huang, who funneled a $100,000
payment to Hubbell from an Indonesian banking family, received
immunity from Starr this spring. The prosecutor agreed not to
charge Huang with wrongdoing in exchange for information about
Hubbell. A spokesman for Starr would not comment on the matter
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said the deal Starr struck with
Huang would not protect him from prosecution in the government's
unrelated investigation of Huang's role in raising contributions
for the Democrats during the 1996 election campaign. Huang raised
more than $1 million, much of which was returned by the Democrats
because the money originated from possibly suspect sources.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that because the department's campaign finance
investigators were kept separate from investigators with the
independent counsel's office, there was little danger that Huang's
immunized testimony would seep into the campaign finance inquiry
and undercut a Justice Department case against him.
</P>
<P>
   Huang was among the Clinton allies who hired Hubbell after he
left the Justice Department in 1994, when Hubbell was being
investigated for cheating his former law firm of hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Huang paid $100,000 to Hubbell in June 1994 from the Riady
family of Indonesia, which had employed Huang through its
international business and banking operation, the Lippo group. The
Riadys are longtime supporters of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell has acknowledged that he received the money, but he
refused to tell the Senate Whitewater Committee what he did in
return for the payment. ``There wasn't anything improper about and
nobody promised me a damned thing,'' he said in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office questioned Huang extensively shortly before
Hubbell was indicted April 30 on charges of evading taxes on
hundreds of thousands of dollars in income. The indictment accused
Hubbell of failing to pay taxes on money he received from Clinton's
associates.
</P>
<P>
   But a Federal judge, James Robertson, dismissed the tax charges
against Hubbell. Starr is appealing the ruling.

IT'S SPEND BIG, WIN BIG, EXCEPT FOR THE ORIOLES
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ The Baltimore Orioles increased their payroll by
14 percent to a baseball record $71.86 million this year but
staggered to a losing record. The New York Yankees raised their
payroll by 1 percent and won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   These and other economic and on-field developments were
reflected in a payroll report the owners' Player Relations
Committee presented Tuesday to the general managers at their annual
meetings. The report did not paint a pretty picture for most of the
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' position at the head of the salary standing was not
enough to catapult them into the playoffs. What it did, however,
was make them the biggest underachievers in major league history.
No one has ever spent so much and received so little in return.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, on the other hand, had the best year any team could
hope to have with their 125 total victories, and they did it by
increasing their payroll from $65 million to $65.6 million. They
also paid $8.2 million for other players whom they traded, acquired
or released, but that money is not included in the traditional
method of payroll tabulation used by the owners and the players,
who will release their report next month.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Orioles, the Florida Marlins and the Montreal Expos
showed the most remarkable figures. The Marlins slashed their
payroll from $53,515,000 last year, when they won the World Series,
to $15,141,000 this year, a drop of 72 percent. The Expos plummeted
55 percent to a major league-low $8,317,500, a payroll unheard of
in this day of escalating salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The overall escalation was not steep. With some post-season
award bonuses still to be added, the average major league salary
was $1,377,196, a 4.78 percent increase from last year, when the
$1,314,420 average represented a 19.33 percent increase. The clubs
spent more than $1.23 billion on their payrolls this year.
</P>
<P>
   The salary standing did not differ greatly from the won-lost
standing. Teams that spent the most generally had winning records;
those that spent the least generally had losing records.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, of the 13 teams that had payrolls over $48
million, the Orioles were the only one with a losing record. Of the
17 teams with payrolls under $48 million, only St. Louis and
Toronto had winning records.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig has acknowledged that this payroll
disparity is the biggest problem facing baseball. It is a topic the
general managers have been discussing at their meetings this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were one of the high-spending teams with a winning
record. Their payroll soared by 49.6 percent, to $58.66 million.
They have already committed $47.56 million for next year. The
Yankees have committed $42.95 million for 1999. The Indians'
payroll for next season already stands at $62.67 million, more than
this year's $59.54 million.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to salary arbitration, which always sends salaries
soaring higher, the Player Relations Committee and the Players
Association determined the players with two to three years of major
league service who will be eligible for arbitration, which
otherwise requires three years of service.
</P>
<P>
   The player among the 13 fortunate players who will benefit the
most is Rick Helling, the Texas pitcher, who was a 20-game winner
this year. He earned $216,500 while winning those 20 games but can
expect at least a $3 million salary next year.

JUDGE TO REVIEW COMPLAINTS OF EMBASSY BOMBING DEFENDANTS
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal district judge agreed Tuesday to review
complaints by lawyers for three men arrested after the bombings of
two U.S. embassies in Africa that their jail conditions in
Manhattan are unconstitutional and inhumane.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Leonard Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan said he
had received an eight-page letter from lawyers for two of three
defendants in custody in Manhattan. The lawyers complained that
their clients were being held in total isolation for almost 24
hours a day in a unit called 10 South, the most restrictive holding
area in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are allowed only brief periods of exercise in a
barren room, called the rat cage, a defense lawyer, Michael Young,
wrote in the letter. A second lawyer, Leonard Joy, concurred with
the views in the letter, which was made public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to review the conditions, Sand said, ``Certainly it
has to be addressed, that is, the condition of confinement for all
of the defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge made his comments in the first hearing in the bombing
case since last week's indictment by a federal grand jury of Osama
bin Laden, who the authorities believe was the mastermind of the
embassy attacks. Bin Laden remains at large and is believed to be
living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban, the
Islamic fundamentalist movement that rules that country.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing conditions at the Manhattan jail, the lawyers said
that two of the defendants have not been able to call their
families, while the third has been allowed to make only one phone
call. The lawyers added that the defendants cannot have visitors,
write letters, or receive mail or books.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmishing continued in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot give my client a dictionary,'' a third lawyer, Bruce
McIntyre, who represents Wadih el Hage, told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage has been charged with conspiring to kill Americans
abroad and has been described by the government as a former
personal secretary to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The two other defendants in court Tuesday _ Mohammed Saddiq Odeh
and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali _ have each been charged with
separate counts of murder in the deaths of more than 200 people in
the embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7.
</P>
<P>
   All three men have pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Fitzgerald, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the judge
that the government would have a response by Friday, and his
comments suggested that the government will be prepared to make
some modifications in the restrictions.

FLORENCE L. WALSH, 37, LUCENT FINANCE EXECUTIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florence L. Walsh, a fast-rising executive at Lucent
Technologies Inc. who helped engineer that company's split from the
AT&AMP;T Corp. in 1996, died on Saturday at Morristown Memorial
Hospital in New Jersey. Ms. Walsh, who lived in Bernardsville,
N.J., was 37.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was toxic shock syndrome resulting from an infection
during pregnancy, a Lucent spokeswoman said. The infection also
caused the death of Ms. Walsh's unborn son on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walsh, who was known as Meg, was vice president and
treasurer of Lucent, one of the world's biggest makers of advanced
communications equipment. While reporting to the company's chief
financial officer, Ms. Walsh managed Lucent's $35 billion pension
fund and the company's lending and borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   She demonstrated acumen in her relationship with financial
markets. Earlier this year, she raised about $300 million for
Lucent by issuing 30-year bonds that paid the lowest effective
interest rate on such bonds issued by a company with Lucent's
credit rating in almost 30 years, according to Securities Data,
which tracks bond offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walsh graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1984 and
from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1988.
After leaving Wharton, Ms. Walsh joined the General Motors Corp. in
New York City, rising to director for corporate finance and capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
   She joined AT&AMP;T in 1994 as assistant treasurer. In that job, she
helped establish the financial framework for Lucent's split from
AT&AMP;T. She joined Lucent as treasurer a few months before the
companies formally separated.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walsh is survived by her husband, Mark; a son, Carter; her
parents, Mollie Bucy of Baltimore and David Long of Crownsville,
Md.; a brother, David Long Jr. of St. Petersburg, Fla., and her
maternal grandparents, Robert and Florence Roy of Ruxton, Md. &QL;

 &HT;    Gingrich favors Isakson as successor
 &HT;    By Clint Williams and Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Johnny Isakson made plans to formally announce for
the congressional seat vacated by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, he
got more than a nudge Tuesday from the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Johnny Isakson will run,'' Gingrich said in a statement
released by his district office. ``He is a very close personal
friend and I believe he would do a great job of representing
Georgia's 6th District.''
</P>
<P>
   Isakson is expected to announce his candidacy today.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's statement likely was intended to send a message to
other Republicans contemplating the race, said Cobb County GOP
Chairman Don Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Newt wants a clean election,'' Hill said. ``The more
Republican names that are in the race, the more of a chance there
is for a Democrat to emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Georgia faced a special election to fill a
congressional seat was in 1983, after U.S. Rep. Larry McDonald died
in the crash of a Korean airliner shot down by a Soviet fighter.
The contest drew 20 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he and other party leaders spent Tuesday on the phone,
trying to figure out who else is interested in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Currently chairman of the state Board of Education, Isakson has
run two statewide campaigns. He lost a 1990 race to Zell Miller for
governor and a 1996 GOP primary for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for some candidates who lost their races last week but
whose campaigns are relatively intact, the opportunity is tempting.
The name of Democrat Michael Coles, who lost the U.S. Senate race
to Paul Coverdell, has been mentioned, but a spokesman for Coles
said he hasn't reached any decision.
</P>
<P>
   At least two Republicans, state Rep. Mitchell Kaye of Marietta
and Bruce Hatfield of Kennesaw, have said they will run regardless
of Isakson's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt's endorsement doesn't influence my decision,'' said
Hatfield, who finished fourth in the Republican gubernatorial
primary in July with 2 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye is a conservative first elected to the General Assembly in
1992. Kaye conceded Isakson would be the front-runner in the race,
but added, ``I'll surprise people. I'll be the Jesse `the Body'
Ventura of Georgia politics.''

   State Sen. Chuck Clay said he continues to consider the race and
that Isakson's candidacy won't affect his decision.

   Even though many Republicans in the 6th District are pressing

   After getting Gingrich's formal resignation, the governor has 10
days to call for a special election, which has to be at least 30

DEVILS' HOLIK SUSPENDED TWO GAMES FOR TRIPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobby Holik of the New Jersey Devils was suspended for two games
without pay and fined $1,000, the maximum allowed under the
players' contract with the league, as a result of a tripping
incident against Paul Laus of the Florida Panthers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Holik had already served one game of his suspension when he was
ordered to sit out Sunday's game at Tampa Bay and will complete his
suspension by sitting out Wednesday night's game against the
visiting Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension and fine were announced Tuesday afternoon by
Colin Campbell, the league's senior vice president and director of
hockey operations, after a conference call with Holik, Devils
president and general manager Lou Lamoriello and Holik's agent,
Mike Gillis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was completely honest with them,'' Holik said. ``The tape
didn't lie. I think it justified the fact that I didn't try to hurt
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his suspension was fair, Holik said, ``To tell you
the truth, I'd rather not be in this situation than say whether it
was fair or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello said, ``We felt good that they recognized the fact
that Bobby did not intend to injure, hurt or slew-foot the
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Slew-footing, or bringing someone down by taking his legs out
from underneath him, is the latest rule the league is trying to
enforce and Holik is one of the first victims to pay for the
infraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, it was the stick above the shoulder; now they
have this slew-footing,'' Bob Carpenter, a veteran center, said.
``It's something they want to call and bring to everyone's
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Holik, it appears that the Devils will also be
without Dave Andreychuk's services for the game against Montreal.
Andreychuk missed Tuesday's practice to nurse a bruised sternum he
sustained in the late stages of the 3-1 loss to Tampa Bay on
Sunday.

ABOUT  
 ABOUT NEW YORK: AN ARTIST GETS HIS HOOKS ON SOME MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  (dal)  
By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Mock has so much money scattered about his
studio in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn that it looks as if an
armored car exploded inside the cluttered space. Bags of the green
stuff are tossed on the floor next to piles of magazines and
videotapes. More is scattered in clumps atop tables. It dangles
from three slender cables between the cages where his parakeets
jump and chirp.
</P>
<P>
   And every last greenback is torn to bits.
</P>
<P>
   If Mock had the patience of the revolutionary Iranian students
who overran the American Embassy in 1979 and pieced together reams
of shredded top secret documents, he could fill his battered truck
with a fortune and dump it at the bank. Instead, he has wrapped the
mangled money around wires and fishhooks, decorated them with
bug-eyed fish heads and turned them into amulets he calls ``money
lures.'' His friends swear the lucre is lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Their testimonials are enough to get Mock to the bank after all.
In January, he will hang the lures at the Red Hook branch of the
Independence Savings Bank, where they will be on exhibit in its
community gallery. The bank is new to the neighborhood, and Mock
figured it could use a lift. If he's really lucky, maybe he'll make
a few deposits himself. He has already sold four lures for $1,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the ritual of making them I attempted to attract money,''
said Mock, 54, who is an editorial cartoonist and a teacher. ``The
absurdity of this thing is the money is worth as much this way as
if it was not cut up. I think that's a statement, too, about
looking at art and thinking how much it's worth than just having
art and experiencing it for what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   In case federal types get curious, Mock explained that he
doesn't actually destroy the money (though an artist pal of his
once sliced up some dollar bills and pasted them over a Statue of
Liberty model). He buys it already shredded from a scientific
supply house. He was using it in an art class that he teaches in
Manhattan when he was impressed by the creative abandon his young
students showed in making money trucks, money dogs and money
people. Back in Brooklyn, he combined the deconstructed dough with
some fishhooks.
</P>
<P>
   He gave one of his first lures to Pat Toomay, a friend and
collector who soon came into a $20,000 windfall. Unfortunately,
Toomay had to return the cash, since it resulted from a mistake in
a financial transaction. ``The money lure being a pagan instrument,
it doesn't pay attention to morality,'' Toomay said. ``It works
with what's at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Hook bank could use a hand, not to mention a hook.
Charles Hamm, Independence's chief executive, wouldn't mind if the
money mojo spurred new business or, better yet, led to regulatory
changes that now bar his thrift from receiving deposits from city
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better lucky than smart,'' he said. ``We don't like giving
money back. But we sure like getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Money isn't a big thing for Mock. But he knew that for some
people, it is an object of affection that alienates them from what
they really need in life. People follow the market as if they were
monitoring their pulse, with the Dow as a measure of self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lures are an expression of this phenomenon of acquiring
money as a cultural obsession,'' he said. ``When money becomes too
big a focus of life, it takes over other areas that could have been
emotionally rewarding. Money itself has no emotion connected to it.
To value it as you would a life companion is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   His unkempt garret is proof of his beliefs. He moved to Red Hook
in the late 1970s, after having lived on the Lower East Side and in
SoHo. Those Manhattan neighborhoods were once home to struggling
artists. Now they are home to people who are starving only for
attention or boutiques with price tags like Lotto numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hook, a waterfront neighborhood that was left alone after a
highway severed it from the rest of Brooklyn, is affordable and
boasts of bonds among artists and neighbors who share materials and
encouragement. Away from the rest of the city, artists follow their
muses without a muss. Straight to the bank, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's damn near an anarchist community, in a positive sense,''
Mock said. ``I used to hassle galleries to let me do something like
this. How often do you get the opportunity to put something so
meaningful together with an environment that's perfect?''
</P>
<P>
   For the man putting the hook in Red Hook, that's the best lure.

CITY AND STATE TO PAY $49 MILLION TO SETTLE FOSTER-CARE FRAUD
LAWSUIT
</HEADLINE>
  (dal)  
By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City and New York State agreed Tuesday to
pay $49 million to settle a civil lawsuit brought by a
whistle-blower who charged that New York fraudulently collected
hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds between 1990 and
1994 for required foster care services that were not provided.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, approved on Tuesday by Judge Denny Chin of U.S.
District Court for the Southern District, includes no admission of
wrongdoing, but requires the city and the state to give federal
officials access to foster care computer records over the next
three years so they can determine whether the city is providing
mandated services to children in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Scoppetta, the city's commissioner of the
Administration for Children's Services, criticized the terms of the
settlement. ``By taking back $49 million, the United States is
penalizing the city and state for what is essentially a
record-keeping failure by overburdened foster care workers,'' he
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District
of New York, issued a sharp retort. ``It is unfortunate that the
city seeks to minimize and blame others for the serious conduct and
failure'' that led one of its own child welfare officials to file
the lawsuit, Ms. White said.
</P>
<P>
   The city will pay $14 million and the state, which oversees the
city's system and collected most of the federal money, will pay $35
million.
</P>
<P>
   The services at issue include caseworker visits to foster homes,
interviews with foster children, the monitoring of birth parents
and foster families, and long-term planning reviews every six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope that the city would expend its efforts in
establishing a system, as mandated by Congress, that insures that
children promptly receive the critical social services necessary
for their welfare,'' Ms. White said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides requiring the city and state to provide these services
to receive foster care reimbursement, the federal government offers
``incentive funds'' to child welfare systems that can demonstrate
that more than 90 percent of their foster care cases are in
compliance with these legal requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors contended that New York misled federal
officials to collect these incentive funds during the
administration of Mayor David Dinkins and the first year of the
Giuliani administration. If prosecutors had prevailed in a trial,
New York risked having to return $100 million in foster care money,
Lorna Goodman, an assistant corporation counsel for the city, said
Tuesday. Ms. Goodman said the charges of fraud were baseless.
</P>
<P>
   Bracha Graber, the whistle-blower, will receive $4.9 million
under the settlement. Ms. Graber, a former midlevel employee of the
city's child welfare agency, said she would use a substantial
portion of the award to establish a foundation to provide
scholarships for foster children.
</P>
<P>
   Carl H. Loewenson Jr., Ms. Graber's lawyer, said Ms. Graber had
repeatedly refused to participate in the falsification of computer
records and brought the activity to the attention of her superiors
to no avail. She finally turned to federal prosecutors, suing the
city and state under the whistle-blower law known as the False
Claims Act for triple the amount of actual damages, estimated in
the complaint to be at least $37.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, Judge Chin ruled that neither a state nor a
municipality could be named as a defendant under the False Claims
Act. That issue is pending in an unrelated case before the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

ARIZONA MAY POSTPONE HIGH-SCHOOL GRADUATION TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHRYN CRENO,  
 LORI BAKER AND MELISSA JONES  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Class of 2001 may get a reprieve from Arizona's new
high-school graduation test requirement because the state schools
chief fears many kids aren't taking enough math to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Graham Keegan, the state superintendent of public
instruction, announced Tuesday that she intends to ask the Arizona
Board of Education to give the Class of 2001 a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy about it,'' Keegan said. ``I wonder what is
going on with the leadership in our schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps half our our kids are not receiving the basic
algebra-geometry series that used to be high school math. What we
are teaching is pre-alegbra and commercial math. To know that maybe
half of our kids aren't taking that basic core is a distressing
place to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think we should make our students pay the penalty
for what their schools didn't offer.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she recently reviewed raw scores from an AIMS pilot
test _ a test taken by 11th- and 12th-graders to weed out bad
questions _ and said the results were poor.
</P>
<P>
   The state school board adopted new academic standards and began
plans for the AIMS test _ Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards _
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this spring, 10th-graders will have five chances to
pass two language and five math portions of the test. If Keegan has
her way, sophomores will still take the AIMS test up to five times,
but won't have to pass it to get a diploma. That requirement would
start with the Class of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The state school board is expected to discuss the matter at a
Nov. 18 study session and, possibly, to vote on the change at its
regular Nov. 23 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   K.R. Scott, a Mountain Pointe High School teacher who ran as a
write-in candidate for Keegan's seat in the general election, said,
``We are happy to see that there's some reality creeping into the
Department of Education.''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan said she made the decision to ask for the reprieve after
numerous discussions with Gov. Jane Hull, Arizona Education
Association President Penny Kotterman, school district officials
and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Molera, Hull's education adviser, said the governor
supports delaying the graduation requirement, even until 2003 if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan said Tuesday that, although her staff sent copies of the
new academic standards to all districts two years ago and has spent
the past year traveling the state to discuss the AIMS, many
teachers are still unfamiliar with the stand ards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our methods of communication from the state to the
classroom level are not as efficient as they could be,'' Kotterman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you send a notice to a district, sometimes that means it
goes to the superintendent and sometimes to the director of
curriculum, but it definitely does not go to teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   District officials, meanwhile, breathed a collective sigh of
relief Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wanted extra time,'' said Ralph Cadwallader,
associate superintendent for the Tempe Union High School District.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, districts including Mesa, Flagstaff and Safford wrote
letters to the state warning that many of their sophomores would
not be ready for the AIMS by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Superintendent Jim Zaharis sent a five-page letter to the
state school board last month asking that the state reconsider the
timing of the test _ or forgo the graduation requirement altogether
and honor kids who pass the AIMS with special diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't trying to be stubborn,'' he said. ``We have a
professional responsibility to say what we think will be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Delaying the test will allow students more time to enroll in
courses they'll need to pass the test, said Zaharis, who would like
the graduation requirement to be held off even longer, to this
year's seventh-graders, the Class of 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But even one year is helpful, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear Tuesday whether the entire state school
board would go for Keegan's idea.
</P>
<P>
   Board President Ken Bennett said Keegan had not discussed it
with him, although he added he would not oppose delaying the
graduation requirement if that proves necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lisa is feeling like maybe we are ahead of where we need to
be or districts aren't as prepared as they were telling us early
on, we need to address that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Bruce Kelp and Janet Martin, however, maintained
that they think the Class of 2001 should take the test _ and take
it seriously. Perhaps, they said, the cutoff point for passing
should be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implementation of the test needs to get started,'' Martin
said. ``But what a proficient score will look like still needs to
be determined.'' &QL;

SCORE 1 FOR CUOMO 
RELIVING TRIUMPH 
BEHIND THE BUBBLES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES BARRON with C.J. SATTERWHITE, JOE BRESCIA and KIMBERLY
STEVENS 
 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Next week it will reopen with clouds freshly painted
on the ceiling, windows that had been blacked out during World War
II uncovered, and computers installed for all to use.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, the Main Reading Room at the New York Public
Library on Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street was a dining room. Several
hundred patrons had paid a minimum of $1,500 each to attend the
Library Lions dinner, which raised $1.7 million for the library.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single most profitable evening in the library's history,''
the president, Paul LeClerc, said.
</P>
<P>
   The before-dinner drinks were served on one side of the reading
room. Then the guests _ who included Vernon Jordan, Andrew S.
Heiskell, Bianca Jagger and George Plimpton _ moved to the north
side, where the reading tables had been set up by Robert Isabell,
the designer, to look like dining tables from Elizabethan England.
</P>
<P>
   Which may explain why the talk at Table No. 45 turned to
Shakespeare. And before long, former Gov. Mario Cuomo had made a
bet about the origin of the line, ``Music has charms to soothe a
savage breast.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellie Cullman, whose husband is Edgar M. Cullman, the cigar
titan, said it was from ``Twelfth Night.'' Richard K. Descherer, a
senior partner at Willkie, Farr &AMP; Gallagher, said it was ``
`Twelfth Night' or some other Shakespeare.'' Cipa Dichter, the
pianist, and Thomas Morgan, the former head of WNYC-TV, also said
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuomo bet ``two glasses of really good wine'' that it was
not.
</P>
<P>
   Then he said, ``As long as we're in the library, let's look it
up.'' He asked Andrew Kimball, the library's director of
governmental affairs, to find a copy of ``Bartlett's Familiar
Quotations.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimball said that he could find the answer faster on the new
computers. He logged on, hit the Bartlett's link and found that the
answer was not Shakespeare, but William Congreve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just won,'' Cuomo declared, adding that he had learned
everything he knew _ well, a lot, anyway _ at Public School 50, and
that the ``cumulative academic credentials of the people who said
it was Shakespeare is worth 30 Ph.D.'s.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliving Triumph
</P>
<P>
   How fortunate that the Yankees were the invited guests at a
party for the official 1998 World Series home video: Joe Torre
arrived saying that he was looking forward to actually seeing what
he missed during Games 1, 2, 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between talking to Zimmer and Stottlemyre,'' he said,
referring to Don and Mel, the coaches on the bench, ``you really
don't get to see much.'' Then Torre put his arm around his wife,
Alice, and watched the Yankees win the World Series again, this
time on big-screen monitors.
</P>
<P>
   When the lights came up, Torre looked to the back of the room
and said, ``I love you, Arthur Richman.'' It was Richman, an
adviser to Steinbrenner, who recommended Torre as Buck Showalter's
replacement after the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Bubbles
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely the veteran of the party,'' said Claude
Taittinger, the 71-year-old owner of the centuries-old Champagne
maker that bears his family's name. ``But wearing a mask allowed me
to talk and flirt freely with all the young people. I looked like
an old Casanova, but no one could tell it was me.''
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder. Hoping to remake the company's image, he gave a
masquerade ball with Visionaire, the fashion magazine. Nearly 1,000
regulars from the downtown party circuit crowded into 88 Ninth
Avenue (the old Covenant House, now a nightclub).
</P>
<P>
   Among them were comedian Sandra Bernhardt, actress Marissa
Tomei, designer Calvin Klein and at least 15 guests in body paint
and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, the obligatory masks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the Visionaire crowd would appreciate the fact that
Champagne has always been a drink that stimulates the creative
spirit,'' said Taittinger, sighing happily.

NBA PLAYERS TO GATHER FOR STRATEGY SESSION
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirty-five players are scheduled to attend a
strategy meeting Wednesday in New York to decide whether to present
a new proposal to the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Among several economic issues, the league and union are deciding
how to divide the $2 billion in annual revenues. The players, who
received 57 percent last season in salaries, want 60 percent. The
league is offering a 50-50 split. Both figures are said to be
negotiable, though neither the players nor the owners have moved
off those figures in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If a labor agreement were signed this week (highly unlikely),
the earliest the season could start would be Dec. 15. If the more
than 4-month-old lockout has taken its toll on teams and fans, it
has also cost the players.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 of the league's players under contract are
scheduled to lose their first paychecks on Sunday. For the union
president, Patrick Ewing, whose $18.5 million annual salary is the
highest in the National Basketball Association, the first two weeks
will cost him nearly $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The union issued some relief last Friday, releasing $20,000
group-licensing checks to many of its members.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proudest possessions,
temporarily displayed on the mantel in his City Hall office, is the
baseball bat given to him by Sammy Sosa after his parade on lower
Broadway last month.
</P>
<P>
   The trophy bat was the one that Sosa used to hit his 66th, and
last, home run of the season _ or at least that's what Giuliani
said Sosa told him. And since then, that is what the
baseball-idolizing mayor has been telling anyone else who would
listen.
</P>
<P>
   But now the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is
disputing that claim, saying that it not only owns the actual bat
that hit homer No. 66 but has had it on display for the last six
weeks in its museum in Cooperstown, N.Y., far from City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that we have that bat here,'' said the Hall of
Fame's communications director, John J. Ralph. He said that he had
traveled with Sosa and collected the bat after Sosa signed, dated
and numbered it as the one used for homers 64 through 66. Ralph
said he took two other Sosa bats for display. ``We're confident our
bats are legitimate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, a right fielder for the Chicago Cubs, had a record-setting
year, along with Mark McGwire, breaking Roger Maris' single-season
record of 61 home runs. McGwire, of the St. Louis Cardinals, set
the new mark, at 70. Sosa was in Japan on Tuesday as part of a team
of major leaguers touring the country, and could not be reached
immediately to shed any light on the bats.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph called Sosa ``a super guy'' who would never intentionally
deceive anyone. ``I can only speculate that he was
misinterpreted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor seemed puzzled by the dispute as he showed off the bat
_ a black Louisville Slugger with a silver-toned inscription _ when
asked about it at a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy presented it to me, and I thought he was giving me a
bat, and I asked him is this actually the bat that you hit the home
run with, and he told me yes,'' the Mayor said. ``It says `To
Giuliani, Best Wishes, God Bless, No. 21 Sammy Sosa, Home Run No.
66, 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor plans to put the bat on public display, along with the
Yankees' World Series trophy and some other memorabilia, in the
Tweed courthouse behind City Hall starting on Tuesday. Eventually,
he said, the city will send the bat _ whatever its provenance _ to
the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that if this is the bat, it has tremendous value,
and the best thing is for the public to be able to enjoy it,'' the
mayor said. Musing about the bat's authenticity in a lighter vein,
he said, ``Well, I haven't sold it yet, so I can't go to jail for
fraud.''

PICTURE SENT TO NEWSPAPER SEEN AS POSSIBLE TIE TO SNIPER KILLING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   On the eve of a holiday that has been linked to antiabortion
violence, the authorities on Tuesday were investigating whether a
picture of an aborted fetus sent to a Canadian newspaper was
connected to last month's fatal shooting of a Buffalo, N.Y. doctor
who provided abortions or four similar attacks in western New York
and Canada since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, the Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator, has received
five similar packages in the last year, some containing veiled
threats and several delivered by a man who employees said resembled
James Charles Kopp, who is wanted for questioning as a witness
about the Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after the shooting, the Spectator received a package
containing an antiabortion flier with biographical information
about Slepian, including a photograph of him that had been crossed
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly causes us to be more interested than ever in
speaking to Kopp,'' said Inspector Keith McKaskill of the Winnipeg
Police Department, a spokesman for the Canada-United States task
force investigating the five shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they searched for Kopp, federal officials were also
looking into three letters that were received Monday by Catholic
and antiabortion organizations in Buffalo, Indianapolis and
Chicago. Those letters, saying they contained the deadly anthrax
bacteria, came 10 days after eight similar threats to clinics that
provide abortions. All the letters appear to be hoaxes, and it
remains unclear whether they were connected to any of the five
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp is not a suspect in the shootings. An itinerant
antiabortion activist whose last known address is in Vermont, he is
the subject of warrants on both sides of the border. In Canada, he
is suspected of administrative violations of immigration law; in
the United States, he is wanted as a material witness in the
Slepian case.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Building on their success organizing relief efforts
for victims of Hurricane Georges on the island of Hispaniola, a
group of Dominican taxi drivers are now working to aid people in
Central America whose lives were uprooted by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday and Thursday, about 3,000 livery-cab drivers will
begin collecting clothes, food and water from houses and apartments
across the city to send to people in Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala
and El Salvador. The hurricane devastated entire villages and
cities and caused more than 10,000 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a poor country, so I know what these people are
going through,'' said Carlos Morban, a driver from the Dominican
Republic. ``I understand that as poor as we are here, we have it
better than many other people, so we have to give to them in time
of need.``
</P>
<P>
   This push will supplement efforts already under way from various
community groups around the region. Last week, dozens of churches,
schools, community centers and travel agencies were serving as
makeshift warehouses for goods awaiting distribution in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts were slowed by concerns about whether the aid would
actually reach the truly needy. This week, however, community
leaders have been able to speak to church groups in Central America
to insure that the goods will reach those in need.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of
Taxi Drivers, most of whose members are Dominican, is leading this
drive, and said the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in
Central America was considerably worse than what Georges caused in
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, New Yorkers have not given any sign of being
unwilling to donate as much as they did last month.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 12 tons of goods _ including canned food, used
clothing, medicine and first aid kits _ have been collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fortunate that everyone we're working with has gotten a
second wind,'' said Mateo, who joined other veterans of the
Hurricane Georges relief effort at a news conference Tuesday on the
Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum to announce the new drive. ``They
understand that what happened in Central America is much greater
than in the Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to collect about 200 tons of goods by this weekend
and haul it by trucks to Dover Air Force base in Delaware where
military C-5 planes are to fly the aid down to Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Once the U.S. planes turn the cargo over, it is to be flown to
villages and cities with the most need.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to distribute by roads when the roads have been
washed down,'' said Gen. Charles Wilhelm, of the Marine Corps.
``This aid is really dispersed based on the guidance we've received
from various countries.''

SCHUMER TRIES TO WIN OVER WARY UPSTATERS
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OGDENSBURG, N.Y. _ Charles E. Schumer ventured into a part of
upstate New York Tuesday that both he and his hosts acknowledged
was hostile political territory for him, areas that voted
decisively for Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who criticized Schumer for
voting against winter storm aid for the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you don't know me,'' Schumer, a Democrat, told a small
gathering at a stop here, as he continued his statewide victory
tour following his defeat of D'Amato last week. ``I know there's a
lot of questions: `Is this guy from New York City going to care
about me?' All I can say is, give me a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Flying in a Piper Navajo under gray, rainy skies, Schumer,
rushed like a whirlwind through Watertown, Ogdensburg, Utica and
Elmira, carrying on more like a candidate than a senator-elect and
acting as though the campaign against D'Amato had never ended.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyant and confident, Schumer got warm receptions at every
stop. A couple of dozen people cheered as he got off the plane in
Utica. Almost 100 people gathered at a carpenters union hall in
Elmira.
</P>
<P>
   But the tone turned briefly serious when Schumer acknowledged
reports that he has received death threats since the election and
is now traveling with a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   The threats were first reported Tuesday in The Daily News.
Schumer said that he did not know who was responsible, but that the
New York City police were investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have taken on the terrorists, I've taken on the
militias, and so you have people who are on the extreme right or
the extreme left who are not happy,'' he said in Utica. ``I'm not
really afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the day, Schumer concentrated on trying to win over
his new upstate constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let people divide us,'' he said in Ogdensburg. ``We only
lose when we fight one another.''
</P>
<P>
   After one of the most hard-fought races in the country this
year, Schumer defeated D'Amato in large part by outpolling the
Republican incumbent nearly 3 to 1 in New York City. But in
suburban areas, Schumer trailed 51 to 48 percent, and upstate,
voters preferred D'Amato, 54 to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop on his tour, people remarked that he was treading
on usually hostile territory. In Watertown, one man said there
might be enough Democrats in town to field a baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also signs that some people were warming up to
Schumer. Mayor Jeffrey Graham of Watertown _ once a Democrat, once
a Republican and now an independent _ handed Schumer a plaque
proclaiming him an honorary upstater. In Ogdensburg, Mayor Richard
Lockwood, a Democrat who had close ties to D'Amato, had been quoted
in The Ogdensburg Journal as saying that he was concerned about
losing D'Amato. But on Tuesday, after meeting Schumer, he said: ``I
think he'll be good for upstate. I called him yesterday. He's here
today. That's a pretty good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip was the last such for Schumer before he leaves on
Thursday for a Florida vacation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a union hall, at newspaper offices and in airports, Schumer
promised to bring jobs back to upstate New York. He said high power
costs and property taxes had priced companies out of the region,
and promised to support legislation to regulate power companies'
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer also said he would support measures so that any federal
money from a tobacco settlement for the state _ an estimated $4
billion to $12 billion _ would be sent directly to county
governments to be used for tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   And touching on a local issue of great interest, Schumer said he
would urge discount airlines to open new routes to upstate
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest question came from a reporter in Watertown who
asked why Schumer had not visited the town during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer replied: ``Would you rather have someone who comes
before the election, makes promises and never comes again? Or would
you rather have the guy who comes after winning, who promises to
work? I'm going to be that second guy.''

EDITORIAL: REMEMBER GLOBAL WARMING? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 11:
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats from more than 150 nations gathered in Buenos Aires
this week to assess what they had done since the Kyoto agreement on
global warming last December. The answer is, not much. They can be
happy about one thing. Nobody has successfully challenged the
urgency of their mission. Despite well-financed efforts by some
industry groups to minimize the warming threat, the scientific
consensus _ that the unchecked burning of fossil fuels could
someday cause great damage to the environment _ remains intact.
What is not intact is the spirit of common purpose that produced
the Kyoto agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto Protocol committed the industrialized world to an
average 5 percent reduction in greenhouse emissions below 1990
levels between 2008 and 2012 _ a remarkably ambitious target, given
the world's rising dependence on fossil fuels. The American target
is 7 percent. But many important details were left unsettled. Even
worse, the giant developing countries like India and China have yet
to be brought on board. Until that happens, Senate ratification is
out of the question. Meanwhile, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
continue to rise. Buenos Aires is a good place to re-energize the
process. Two issues are of central importance.
</P>
<P>
   Early Action. Although Kyoto's targets would not become legally
binding until 2008, a quick start on the problem is essential _
especially in the United States, which emits one-fourth of the
world's greenhouse gases. Because America's emissions are projected
to rise by 30 percent between now and 2008 under ``business as
usual'' scenarios, it would be foolish to dawdle. Last-minute
efforts to reverse the energy trajectory would be ruinously
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising number of American companies like the idea of early
action. For the last year, two public-interest groups _ the Pew
Center on Global Climate Change and the Environmental Defense Fund
_ have been signing up companies like Boeing, United Technologies
and British Petroleum that are prepared to reduce their own
emissions even before a treaty is ratified. But the list would
surely be longer if some way could be found to reward companies for
taking action now, perhaps by giving them credits they could use to
meet whatever obligations they incur when the agreement finally
kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Joseph Lieberman, a Democrat, and John Chafee and
Connie Mack, both Republicans, have introduced legislation
establishing a mechanism to do just that. But they will have to
persuade their colleagues in Congress, which grudgingly provided
more money for clean-energy research in the new budget year but has
otherwise been indifferent to the global warming issue.
</P>
<P>
   Emissions Trading. The United States would have rejected the
Kyoto Protocol if it had not included a provision that allows the
sale or trade of emissions allowances among nations. In theory,
industrialized nations that cannot quickly meet their targets
without crippling energy taxes or costly investments would be able
to ``buy'' pollution permits from poorer countries whose economies
are so inefficient that even small adjustments can achieve big
reductions in emissions. That transfer of capital, in turn, could
help developing countries invest in cleaner technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The British, among others, fear that the United States will
exploit the trading plan to avoid making any real cuts in
emissions, buying reductions from others instead. These fears are
exaggerated. But the best way to put them to rest is to invite
American companies to start cutting their emissions now. That would
not only pacify the British but send a positive signal to the
less-developed countries, which are unlikely to cut their energy
use and prejudice their chances for further growth unless they are
sure that America is serious.
</P>
<P>
   The United States obviously cannot go it alone. Global warming
demands a global response. But the rest of the world is not going
to move without the leadership and example of the world's biggest
producer of greenhouse gases.

HAL NEWHOUSER, 77, A HALL OF FAME PITCHER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hal Newhouser, the Detroit Tigers' Hall of Fame left-hander and
the only pitcher to win two consecutive Most Valuable Player
awards, died Tuesday at Providence Hospital in Southfield, Mich. He
was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouser, who lived in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., had been
suffering from emphysema and heart problems, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring a high fastball, Newhouser was the American League's
top left-hander of the 1940s. He posted records of 29-9 in 1944 and
25-9 in 1945, winning the MVP award each season; he had a 26-9 mark
in 1946. Pitching for the Tigers from 1939 to 1953, then for
Cleveland in his final two seasons, he had a lifetime record of
207-150.
</P>
<P>
   He threw a complete game, striking out 10, in pitching the
Tigers to a Game 7 victory over the Chicago Cubs in the 1945 World
Series. As a reliever, he played a key role for the Indians' 1954
pennant winners.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Detroit, Newhouser was thrilled to sign with his
hometown team as a teen-ager when a scout offered a $500 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was during the Depression, and I was trying to earn money
to go to a trade school by selling newspapers, setting pins in a
bowling alley and collecting pop bottles to get the deposit on
them,'' Newhouser recalled. ``I thought it was unbelievable to get
that much money for playing baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But he might have been better off waiting, since a
representative of the Indians arrived at the Newhouser home 10
minutes later and ``told me they were going to give my parents
$15,000 and a new car worth $4,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhouser was often matched against the Indians' Bob Feller, the
league's top right-hander of the 1940s. On the final day of the
1948 regular season, Newhouser bested Feller, 7-1, before more than
74,000 at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium to drop the Indians into a
tie for first place with the Red Sox. Newhouser was pitching on
short rest and had experienced arm problems, but ``I ended up
throwing one of the best games of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhouser had planned to be sworn into the Army Air Forces on
the Briggs Stadium pitching mound during World War II, but was
deferred because of a heart problem. Because his two MVP years came
when baseball manpower was depleted by the war, he was labeled by
some as a ``wartime player'' and was not selected for the Hall of
Fame until 1992, when he was voted in by the veterans' committee.
But he remained a dominant pitcher after the war, averaging more
than 19 victories a season from 1946 to 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Following his retirement, Newhouser was a scout and a bank
executive. In July 1997, he became the only pitcher whose uniform
number (16) was retired by the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Beryl; a brother, Richard; two
daughters, Charlene Newhouser and Sherrill Robinson, and a
grandson.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Newhouser's determination complemented his talent: he completed
212 of his 374 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't get the ball away from him _ he hated to be
pulled from a game,'' former Tiger catcher Joe Ginsberg recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one game when I pitched in Yankee Stadium and gave
up five runs in the first inning,'' Newhouser once said. ``It would
have been easy to quit, but I shut 'em out the rest of the way and
we came back and won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   His philosophy: ``Never give up and never give in.''

   NAPLES, Fla. _ As Bernie Williams prepares for what is perhaps
the most critical decision of his career, the prevailing feeling is
that the path will not lead back to New York. The question is, why
not?
</P>
<P>
   Williams, one theory holds, has never forgiven the Yankees for
renewing his contract in 1994 and 1995 rather than negotiating his
salary. Now comes another possible explanation: His wife, Waleska,
no longer wants to be in New York and wants him to play elsewhere,
an official in the Yankees' organization said.

   The official declined to discuss publicly why she might not want
to remain in New York, but Scott Boras, Williams' agent, Tuesday
denied that animosity over previous contracts or the wishes of
Williams' wife were factors in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waleska informed everyone that she wanted Bernie to play where
Bernie was most happy, and if Bernie was most happy in New York
City that was something she was agreeable to and supportive of,''
Boras said.
</P>
<P>
   When Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, was asked
about that, he said, ``I don't know that to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was in southern California on Tuesday with Boras. In
the center fielder's first job-hunting trip as a free agent, he
will visit the Arizona Diamondbacks on Wednesday. Because Buck
Showalter, Williams' former manager with the Yankees, is the
Diamondbacks' manager, the team has great interest in Williams and
is expected to make an attractive offer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boras seeks a seven-year contract for perhaps $100
million, it is unclear how widespread the market is for Williams,
who this year won the American League batting championship and a
Gold Glove. The Los Angeles Dodgers and the Colorado Rockies, two
teams that had expressed early interest in Williams, have signed
center fielders in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   So have the Red Sox, but Darren Lewis can also play right field,
and Boston is expected to pursue Williams if they lose Mo Vaughn,
their run-producing first baseman, who also is a free agent. The
Baltimore Orioles plan to consider Williams, but they do not want
to pay Boras' price.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have not indicated what they will offer their
home-grown star. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner,
is apparently waiting to see where the market goes for him. But the
club has seemed reluctant to offer the kind of deal Boras seeks.
The club's view of him, or at least the view of some club
officials, has fueled Williams' ill feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The contract renewals started it. For two seasons, when Williams
had no negotiating leverage, the Yankees renewed his contract with
a minimal increase. When Williams was finally eligible for salary
arbitration in 1996, the Yankees were prepared to settle close to
Williams' figure of $3 million a year without a hearing before an
arbitrator. But Williams told Boras he could not settle. Always a
fiery competitor, Williams was determined to go to arbitration and
beat the Yankees. He did just that.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides settled their salary differences the next two
seasons, but that didn't mean they avoided rancorous developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem wasn't in business decisions,'' Boras said. ``They
went public and said Bernie wasn't a star player. This was Bob
Watson.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras contended that Watson, Cashman's predecessor as general
manager who left last off season, said he had taken a poll of
Yankee people and they had said ``Bernie was a good player but not
a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, Boras said, offered $24 million for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `This is probably the best offer you're going to
get,''' Boras recounted. A year ago, he went on, Watson offered
$37.5 million for five years, saying, ``This is star money for a
nonstar player.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras also recalled flying to Tampa, Fla., to meet with
Steinbrenner in May 1996. ``He said he'd get back to us, and he
never did,'' the agent said.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that was in the past, Boras said with emphasis. The
business relationship turned around last winter when he and
Williams offered to compromise with the Yankees on their
arbitration numbers if the club agreed not to try to negotiate a
new contract during the season. Williams, Boras said, wanted to
concentrate on playing and did not want contract talk to interfere.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise worked for both player and team. Williams had an
outstanding season, and the Yankees won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the past conduct opened the door for competition to
filter into this negotiation,'' Boras said, ``but as I've told the
Yankees numerous times, the Yankees are certainly one of the strong
considerations with Bernie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, Boras added, have told them that Williams is their
No. 1 priority. ``I have no reason not to believe that,'' he added.

EDITORIAL: CONSTITUTIONAL ROOM FOR CENSURE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 11:
</P>
<P>
   Even allowing for partisanship among some of the witnesses, the
historians and constitutional scholars who testified before the
House on Monday provided an elevated and enlightening discussion of
the central issues now facing Congress in the impeachment debate.
We disagree strongly, however, with those who argued that Congress,
as it seeks to resolve President Clinton's case, has but one choice
_ impeachment, or no punishment at all. This narrow reading of the
Constitution fails to address both the political realities of the
moment and the requirements of justice.
</P>
<P>
   This page has recommended censure as a reasoned compromise that
respects the political consensus against removing the president
unless the evidence changes, and the high civic importance of
rebuking him for his failure in his constitutional duty to uphold
the law. We believe further, along with Prof. Laurence Tribe of
Harvard Law School and others, that the Constitution is
sufficiently flexible to allow Congress to take that course.
</P>
<P>
   The experts who are aligned against censure express concern that
it would set a precedent that could somehow damage the presidency
in the future. That is a legitimate worry. But there is a greater
danger to the nation's constitutional system if Congress gives the
president a pass for his lying under oath and knowingly allowing
others to testify falsely to protect him. The fact that there may
be insufficient votes in the House to support sending articles of
impeachment to the Senate does not absolve Congress of its duty to
express its anger and disapproval. Failure to do so would send a
dreadful signal that future presidents could freely ignore the rule
of law.
</P>
<P>
   This point was underscored by one of the Republican witnesses,
Prof. William Van Alstyne of Duke University Law School. It is
``the prerogative of this Congress,'' he observed, ``to express
dismay, despair and condemnation'' by means short of impeachment.
Mindful of the likelihood that impeachment will fail, he urged
lawmakers to ``struggle to find a suitable means to express your
sense of disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   That neatly defines the challenge now confronting the members of
Congress. There is nothing in the Constitution to keep them from
rising to that task.

MARK WHITAKER NAMED NEWSWEEK EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (Eds: SUBS quote in 8th graf to CORRECT to `stock-in-trade,' sted

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Whitaker, who began his career at Newsweek as a
college intern in 1977 and went on to expand the magazine's
technology and business coverage and then overse the pyrotechnics
of the Monica Lewinsky story as managing editor this year, was
named editor of the magazine Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker, 41, had been supervising the magazine's day-to-day
editorial operations since the previous editor, Maynard Parker,
fell ill with leukemia a year ago; Parker, who had been editor for
16 years, died last month at the age of 58.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment came as little surprise to Newsweek staff
members, who have expected Whitaker to become editor. His new job
is significant: It not only makes him the first black editor of a
major news weekly, but comes at a time when the three major news
weekly magazines _ Time and U.S. News &AMP; World Report along with
Newsweek _ are undergoing a period of self-scrutiny, competing for
an audience that increasingly is turning to television, the
Internet and other news outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The changing of the guard represents a generational as well as a
managerial shift. Replacing Whitaker as managing editor will be Ann
McDaniel, 42, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief, and Jon Meacham,
who has been national affairs editor since 1995. Meacham is 29, or
in the words of one staff member ``about 5 years old during Nixon's
impeachment proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   The new guard takes over a magazine that trails Time magazine in
circulation, 4.1 million to 3.2 million, even though it attracted
enormous attention this year with its initially cautious then
blanketlike coverage of the Lewinsky affair. U.S. News &AMP; World
Report trails the group with a circulation of 2.2 million and has
gone through five editors in 14 years, but its owner, Mortimer
Zuckerman, hired Stephen Smith as editor from National Journal in
late July, and Smith is considered by editors at Time and Newsweek
as an adversary who is perhaps more formidable than his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief acceptance speech at the magazine's regularly
scheduled Tuesday morning story meeting, Whitaker said he was very
concerned about his competition and asked the assembled group:
``What can we do to make Newsweek a must-read?''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker answered the question Tuesday afternoon in his
16th-floor office in midtown Manhattan, as staff members began to
pour celebratory Champagne and eat chocolate-chip cookies outside
his door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newsweek starts by having the strongest reporting and writing
in the news magazine field,'' Whitaker said. ``The first priority
is to be out front on every major news story. That's our stock and
trade and that's what our readers look for us to be. We will be as
aggressive as we've ever been in covering the big stories,
political and otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news weekly magazine _ where the job of editor includes
signing off on every article, cover headline, chart, photograph and
``pull quote'' _ the influence of the editor is felt to the core of
the publication. A self-described technophile, Whitaker said he
wanted to devote more space to technology and science, the global
economy, domestic markets, personal investing and family issues,
and added that he was especially interested in making the magazine
relevant to younger readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we do an extremely good job covering the baby boom
generation, and we will continue to do so as we get older,'' he
said. ``But I want this to be a must-read for younger readers as
well.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Newsweek has just emerged from its most profitable year in 1997,
said Richard M. Smith, who has held the title of editor in chief
since 1984, president since 1991 and chairman since early this
year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Publishers Information Bureau, ad pages
declined in the last year, to 1,959 from January to October this
year, from 2,043 for the same period in 1997. But Smith added that,
for a news organization hinged on a single publication, Newsweek,
which is owned by The Washington Post Co., fares ``extremely
well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that always amazes me about Newsweek is that despite
Time Inc.'s multiple magazine advertising packages, despite
Time-Warner's clout on the newsstand, despite the cross-promotion
from CNN and other sectors of engulf and devour, we're in a good
dogfight with Time and we win more than we lose,'' Smith said.
``Everybody has always said that Newsweek's great handicap is that
it's a single-magazine company in this universe of hydras, but we
do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker said that while he admired Time magazine and its
marketing strategies, he said he was dismayed at recent decisions
that he said blur the line between editorial and advertising
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty well-known that they're doing things now
that seem tailored for specific advertisers,'' Whitaker said. He
was referring to Time magazine's recent agreement with the Ford
Motor Co., in which Ford will be the sole sponsor of new editorial
sections that focus on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Time's managing editor, Walter Isaacson, defended Time's
separation of powers. ``We have a great system of church and state,
and we do editorially what we feel passionate about editorially,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker is regarded by his staff as a strong, even-keeled
intellectual presence, less seismic in his deadline fervor than
Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in Norton, Mass., Whitaker began his career at Newsweek
as an intern in the San Francisco bureau in 1977; he graduated
summa cum laude from Harvard in 1979. As assistant managing editor
from 1991 to 1996, he expanded the magazine's technology coverage,
and has written on the issue of race for the magazine _ including
an essay titled ``Whites vs. Blacks,'' which Newsweek published
after the O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he says his race is irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud and I'm honored to be in this position,'' Whitaker
said, ``but my goal is to be the very best editor of Newsweek that
I can be, not just the best black editor.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker is married to Alexis Gelber, an assistant managing
editor at Newsweek; she reports to Michael Elliott, editor of
Newsweek's international editions. Elliott had been one of several
names mentioned as a potential successor to Parker, aside from
Whitaker. Ms. McDaniel was another; Evan Thomas, an assistant
managing editor, an author and familiar face on the talk-show
circuit, had also been mentioned. All say that there was no
jockeying for the title of editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an extremely healthy franchise, and we have to make
sure we're better at it than everybody else,'' Whitaker said. ``The
key to that is getting really smart, energetic and aggressive young
reporters and writers, and give them a voice at the table. I've
tried to be a real advocate in getting their views and interests
into the magazine.''

 JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Given that Big Bird is about to celebrate his 30th
birthday, one perhaps should not ask about disappointment and
frustration. But as the scorpion said after attacking the frog, ``I
can't help it _ I'm a scorpion,'' so let's get to it:
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't Caroll Spinney, the 64-year-old puppeteer who has played
Big Bird since its creation, feel frustrated in his work?
</P>
<P>
   Can ``Here we go, feathers, please'' be the cue of which an
actor has dreamed? What about range? Don't tell us lines like
``It's big! Really big!'' provide an actor with a satisfying range.
</P>
<P>
   A dissent from the affable Spinney, taking a break in his
dressing room at the Kaufman Astoria Studios, in his Big Bird leg
pants and a ``Sesame Street'' T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge dramatic range,'' says Spinney, whose offstage
voice, while not a baritone, is not nearly as high-pitched as Big
Bird's. ``I've gone from blubbering tears to wild happiness. It's
very satisfying. A mother on the Saskatchewan plains wrote me after
I did a show where Big Bird is too young to go to school with the
other children and feels very lonesome. Her son, who had no one to
play with, said, `Big Bird is just like me.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sesame Street,'' the award-winning children's show, begins its
30th season on Monday. Spinney has played both Big Bird _ a
6-year-old in the body of an 8-foot 2-inch canary _ and Oscar the
Grouch.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Big Bird, in his fluffy yellow feathers (turkey for
the body, ostrich for the tail, both dyed), who is the most loved,
perhaps because the bird asks the sort of questions the viewers
ask. Big Bird is also a very kind bird. He has performed in the
White House for every president since Nixon. (Don't get Spinney
started on Nancy Reagan; he found her very rude.) He has conducted
the Boston Pops and starred in his own movie.
</P>
<P>
   Spinney himself stands 5 feet 10 inches.
</P>
<P>
   (``What does puny mean?'' a classmate of the young Spinney asked
a teacher long ago. ``Caroll,'' the teacher said. ``Caroll is
puny.'')
</P>
<P>
   The man who plays the Bird has gone through some rough patches.
There was the time his first wife left him and he found himself
sobbing, on set, inside his yellow bird suit.
</P>
<P>
   But he is remarried now and happy. His gabled house in rural
Connecticut looks as if it were modeled after a house in a nicer
Grimm Brothers fairy tale: a place where Goldilocks, after a little
therapy, might learn about boundaries and coexist with the bears.
</P>
<P>
   Spinney fought his demons without a shrink.
</P>
<P>
   His theory about puppeteers is that they all once felt
themselves to be misfits. This was his experience, growing up
outside Boston, awkward and shy and unhappy in his physical self.
Spinney's father worked in a watch factory; his mother, a clothing
designer, gave up her career to raise her three sons.
</P>
<P>
   In school, Spinney was teased for being the shortest and
smallest boy in class. At home, he was in terror of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a terrible temper, terrible temper,'' Spinney says.
``Once, when I was a kid, I fell out of a tree and got this huge
gash in my head and had to go to the emergency room. It cost all of
$2. My father said I was trying to put him in the poorhouse. He was
yelling instead of worried about his son, standing there in
bandages. Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Spinney saw his first puppet show when he was in kindergarten
and was smitten. He bought hand puppets, his mother made him
others, and at 12 he had 70 puppets and was doing shows at birthday
parties. His attraction to puppets, he says, is easy to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a puppeteer you can hide whatever you are at the moment and
be only what they can see,'' Spinney says. ``And you could get the
adults to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Spinney had his first puppet show at 21, in Las Vegas. He
married, had three children and worked as a clown and puppeteer on
``The Bozo Show,'' in Boston. In 1968, at a puppet festival in Salt
Lake City, Spinney met Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets, who
invited him to join his new show.
</P>
<P>
   Was Spinney familiar with Henson's work?
</P>
<P>
   ``God, yes!'' Spinney says.``He was so devastatingly clever.
Most of puppetry was generally'' _ here, a word unsuitable for
newspapers and 5-year-olds. ``Like what I was doing. Jim Henson was
the Beatles of the puppet world.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Spinney, with his delight in play, would have seemed
the perfect family man; in his home in Connecticut, he built a
child's room with a secret passageway, from which a child could spy
down on the grown-ups in the dining room. But he was too busy too
often with the Muppets in New York. When he was 38, he and his wife
broke up. A year and a half later, Spinney met Debra Gilroy, a
secretary in the Muppets office. They have been married for 25
years: ``the happiest 25 years of my life,'' Spinney says.
</P>
<P>
   Life is good. The Bird earns more than $100,000 a year. The
Connecticut property includes a roller-skating rink and six picnic
areas. And, of course, Christmas is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deb and I live for Christmas,'' Spinney says. ``A lot of
people complain they decorate the stores too early. It doesn't
bother me. We stay at home, watch the Dickens `Christmas Carol'
movies. I never get tired of Scrooge becoming nice.''

WHEN WORKING OUT IS ACTING OUT: GYMS CREATE FANTASY 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication notice: also sent with `L' code) 
(bl) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By day Chad Klopotek, an investment consultant, lives
a mild-mannered existence. But at least one night a week, he gets
to play Firefighter Rookie No. 1, scaling a burning skyscraper,
saving a life and keeping off that little roll around his waist
that once came between him and his favorite pair of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Swiezy, a marketing associate, escapes the monotony of
conducting telephone surveys (and hopes to whittle down to her old
size 8 figure) by pretending she is a principal dancer of the New
York City Ballet. Dr. Louis Wolf, an oral surgeon, has enlisted in
``boot camp,'' doing pushups and situps on barked orders from a
former marine.
</P>
<P>
   In a craze that health experts describe as the fusion between
fitness and fantasy, these kinds of elaborate workouts are being
staged every day in gyms throughout New York and in big cities
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissed as passe and utterly mind-numbing are standard
routines like aerobics, step aerobics and body sculpting. The new
trend in workouts is hourlong sessions of sweaty, high-energy
theater _ complete with props, live music and instructors who
actually live what they teach _ that club owners hope will drive up
the growth of health club membership, which began a surge 10 years
ago that has leveled off in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular new workouts in Minneapolis is Funjah, a
class that teaches Afro-Cuban dance moves. Music for some Los
Angeles workouts is performed by live gospel choirs.
</P>
<P>
   But no place matches the number of the gimmicky workouts
available in New York. New York Sports Clubs hold workouts led by
former NFL football players in which people learn to pass and dodge
tackles. At the World Gym in the Village, there are swing dance
workouts modeled after the latest Gap commercials. Several New York
gyms offer ``Abs, Thighs and Gossip,'' a muscle-toning workout led
by a man in drag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting to get bored with running and lifting
weights,'' said Klopotek, 24, after a recent firefighter workout at
Crunch on the East Side of Manhattan. ``This workout gives me
something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys by the International Health, Racquet &AMP; Sportsclub
Association, a trade organization, indicate that over the last few
years health club memberships have grown by only the slimmest of
margins. Less than 10 percent of Americans are gym members,
according to the association. New York has a slightly higher
percent, 11.2, but that figure represents an increase of only 2
percentage points over the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   Health club managers have come to realize that they can't keep
members just with the latest exercise equipment because people
often buy their own machines these days. What people cannot buy for
their homes, however, are experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Crunch is the only gym in New York to offer the firefighter
workout. It is led by Eric Torres, a beefy New York City
firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is set with the sound of a radio dispatcher's call for
help. There's a 10-75, the voice pleads through static, firefighter
code for a burning building. Then come the sirens, and the red and
white flashes of light. Torres, often decked out in full gear,
pretends the fire has grown to three alarms.
</P>
<P>
   He orders his battalion of rookies _ the participants in his
class _ to pick up their hoses, bundles of the real thing that
weigh 15 to 25 pounds. Then he shouts: ``The elevator's broken.
We'll have to climb the stairs! Let's go rookies, 80 flights.''
</P>
<P>
   The class groans. But they step as fast as they can _ up and
down and up and down _ on a step bench. After they have climbed and
climbed, their leader shouts for them to pick up weighted bars and
act as though they are battering down a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on rookies, pull down that wall _ one, two, three,'' he
shouts. ``We've added air to the fire! Backdraft! Get down! Crawl.
One, two, three . . .''
</P>
<P>
   A collective groan comes from the class. They fall and drag
themselves on their knees and elbows across the floor. Dozens of
backdrafts and flights of stairs later, they find a victim _ a
125-pound crash-test dummy _ lying on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The rookies grimace as they take turns dragging the dummy to
safety. When Klopotek steps up, Torres decides to increase the
load. The firefighter, a solid 200 pounds, falls to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need help, rookie!'' he shouts at Klopotek, a class veteran.
``Come and get me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the one-hour workout, Klopotek is drenched with
sweat and gasping so hard for air that it is hard to tell that he
feels good until he catches his breath and heaves out a few words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another workout at Crunch, ``Abs, Thighs and Gossip,'' gets more
mixed reviews. Offered several times a week, it is a lot like a
body-sculpting routine with weight training and low-impact
aerobics. But the antics of its instructor, Anthony Truly, have
made the class one of the most talked-about gym stories in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Truly, who describes his class as a mix of weight training, pop
culture, diva worship and a little male bashing, teaches in drag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a new outfit I've been dying to premiere,'' he gushed
on a recent Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation took only a few minutes. He pulled off his
baggy blue jeans, revealing tight spandex shorts and black fishnet
stockings. Then he slipped into a pair of white platform Converse
sneakers and a black tulle jacket with tails. He finished off the
outfit with his signature auburn wig, glittery peach lipstick and
eyeliner.
</P>
<P>
   After an unsuccessful flirtation with professional acting, Truly
now performs only in front of sweating students. During the
hourlong classes, he jokes about his relationship with his lover,
rates on a scale of 1 to 10 the physique of the men who walk by the
window, and explores the latest tabloid gossip, all the while
lifting hand weights and leading his disciples in squats and
stomach crunches.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Lennard, who manages a restaurant near the West Village
club, was not amused. ``For me, the humor was a little over the
top,'' Ms. Lennard, 37, said. ``I'd probably like it better with a
little less joking around.''
</P>
<P>
   A little laughter is just what Joy Gazzoli, 45, and Al
DiRaffaele, 52, felt was missing from their workouts. So a few
weeks ago, they started to swing, by taking swing dance classes on
Saturday afternoons at the World Gym on Mercer Street in the
Village. The class is an hour of big band jazz and high-speed
twirls.
</P>
<P>
   The couple does not hit every dance step just right, but they
have a lot of fun and figure that they each burn off about 300
calories each class. And now, they are swing dancing inside the gym
and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were walking down near Battery Park last week and we heard
swing dance music on a loudspeaker,'' DiRaffaele said. ``So we
stopped right there on the sidewalk and started dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us something fun to do together,'' Ms. Gazzoli
said, ``and you find yourself laughing, which you don't do a lot of
times in a gym.''

LAMBRIGHT, HUARD NOT THE ROOT OF HUSKY EVIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Here's some friendly, unsolicited, nevertheless
brilliant advice for Jim Lambright and Brock Huard, the two most
put-upon guys in the University of Washington football program.
</P>
<P>
   It's OK.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly Churchillian in inspiration and cleverness, is it?
Well, sometimes the simple approach is best. We are, after all,
talking college football.
</P>
<P>
   Given the growing dismay over a 5-4 Husky team that could wind
up with its first losing season since before the Kingdome was
built, Lambright and Huard should know that somebody around here
isn't convinced they're vampires or something.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being torqued over losing to Oregon last Saturday, Huard
came home to some further bad news, at least in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   After overthrowing receiver Andre DeSaussure, who had blown his
route, the network TV cameras caught the quarterback, palms up,
mouthing the words, ``'Dre, what the (heck) are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Returning from Eugene, he called his girlfriend, Molly, who
said, ``You really let it slip on national TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard saw her tape of the game, which also showed lesser moments
of pique.
</P>
<P>
   Over-responsible guy that he is, Huard apologized to his team,
his pastor, his family and just about everyone else in Christendom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could openly see my frustration,'' he said. ``I heard from
quite a few people. That's bad. I wasn't too pleased with my vocal
swearing on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Huard apparently is taking calls on the matter, here's a
comment from Art from Seattle: Hallelujah.
</P>
<P>
   About bloody time, Brock. I don't care whether you swear, but a
little more irascibility and a little less effort at perfection
would seem to be a healthy thing.
</P>
<P>
   Huard is such a committed Christian, such a role model, such a
leader and such a bearer of high expectations that I'm amazed the
guy hasn't turned into a diamond from all the pressure on him.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, he has handled the burden superbly. But the
fact is, he's a very good college quarterback and the only proven
skill player on the offense, where nearly everyone else is letting
him down. He's the guy who passed on the NFL to come back, and his
mates are blowing routes, dropping balls, and generally comporting
themselves as the bewildered underclassmen that they are.
</P>
<P>
   Huard can't help a lot of that. But he's certainly not going to
hurt much by occasionally getting in his teammates' faces, and not
worrying about consequences. At least he'll feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Huard seemed to acknowledge a little annoyance with the burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not always,'' he said with a small smile, ``the golden
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his coach, Lambright has come under the expectable
hail of oral gunfire for the 5-4 season. Losing four out of five to
Oregon will do that, and indeed some of the brickbats are well
deserved.
</P>
<P>
   The part that isn't deserved is the suggestion that Don James
would never let such things happen. Or is it forgotten that James,
late in his Husky career, was a .500 coach for a considerable
stretch?
</P>
<P>
   After two wins to start the 1987 season, the Huskies under James
closed out with 4-4-1 record. The '88 season was a 6-5
disappointment that ended the Husky bowl streak. The '89 season
began with easy wins over Texas A&AMP;M and Purdue, then defeats to
Arizona 20-17, Colorado 45-28, and Southern Cal 24-16.
</P>
<P>
   That added up to a 25-game mark of 12-12-1 over parts of three
seasons for the coach Sports Illustrated labeled first, second and
third on its list of best coaches. Of course, James is remembered
mostly for what happened two years later _ the national
co-championship.
</P>
<P>
   But two years after that, the Huskies were busted by the Pac-10
for cheating, James quit, and the program is still picking up the
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lambright was part of the misdeeds, he is also around
for the consequences, which this week for the UCLA game means the
Huskies have four seniors starting on offense and two on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Many Husky fans have grown weary of the sanctions excuse. But
there's no disputing that when the scholarship losses combined with
the early departures of offensive linemen Olin Kreutz and Benji
Olson and defensive back Mel Miller (suspended), the Huskies this
season have a mediocre talent base.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference between James and Lambright is that James had
three Rose Bowls in his pocket before his record slumped. Another
big difference is James never had to argue against the sanctions
smear in recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright gets no slack for the same kind of recruiting and
playcalling shortcomings that James, and every head coach, commits.
Every time he makes baffling play calls, as was done against
Oregon, or fumbles personnel issues such as with Shane Fortney or
Nick Lentz, he burns up political capital he doesn't have.
</P>
<P>
   As with Huard, the margin for error is negligible. He should
feel just as free to say bad words on national TV, although I
suspect Lambright will be nailed for mispronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   Difference is, God will likely forgive Huard before Husky
boosters forgive Lambright.

EDITORIAL: VOUCHERS FOR PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 11:
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court's decision not to review a Milwaukee case
involving taxpayer-paid vouchers for religious schools sidesteps
one of the most contentious political issues of the day. The
court's refusal to take up the case does not signal approval of the
Milwaukee scheme. But the court's silence leaves in place a plan
that will directly harm the vast majority of the city's
schoolchildren, namely those left in Milwaukee's public schools
while others flee to the voucher program. The court's denial of
review will also embolden voucher supporters elsewhere to adopt
similar plans that would funnel public money into religious and
private education.
</P>
<P>
   The question of what kinds of public support for parochial
education violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment
remains a murky area of constitutional law. Some recent Supreme
Court cases have upheld limited types of public aid to students in
church-run schools, but the court has never overturned its 1973
decision that banned publicly financed tuition rebates to
religious-school students. That decision remains a bulwark against
religious-school vouchers. The court could have done the nation an
important service by reaffirming that ruling and striking down the
Milwaukee voucher scheme as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court will not be able to dodge the question for
long. Other voucher cases are pending in several states, including
Ohio, Vermont and Arizona. This summer a federal judge in Maine
rejected the public financing of religious-school vouchers. The
high court will have to reconcile these conflicting rulings
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Even aside from the First Amendment problem, the Milwaukee plan
is deeply flawed. Many city schools are doing a poor job, but the
voucher plan will do little to improve them. Indeed, it transfers
funds out of desperate public schools for the benefit of private
education. This year 5,800 low-income students out of 100,000
students in Milwaukee got vouchers worth $4,900 per student to
attend private and parochial schools. That money came from funds
that would have gone to the public system. Worse, more than a third
of the students getting vouchers were already enrolled in private
or parochial schools. The vouchers merely gave them a subsidy at
the expense of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The vouchers may well help some students, but at the expense of
the majority. The Milwaukee program is capped at roughly 15,000
students, or about 15 percent of the public school enrollment. That
means that even if parochial and private schools could expand to
take the maximum number of voucher-bearing students, 85,000
students would still be left in a troubled and even weaker public
system. The potential loss to Milwaukee public schools in money
siphoned off by vouchers could be more than $70 million a year. It
would be far better to increase public school funding to improve
education for all the students.
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers are passionately defended by many who do not support or
have given up on the ideals of public education. But the fact
remains that public schools will continue to educate most Americans
well into the next generation and probably beyond. It is absurd to
argue that public education can be improved by diverting huge
amounts of tax revenue into parochial and private schools. A
voucher plan, such as Milwaukee's, does not reform anything. It is
a funding mechanism that forces taxpayers to underwrite religious
and private education. Improving education for all students, not
just the few who manage to get vouchers, requires sustained
community commitment and leadership. Vouchers are a convenient
political diversion from that task.

WWII VETERAN'S FAMILY GETS HIM THE MEDAL HE'S LONG DESERVED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
(Dennis McCarthy is a Daily News columnist) 
BY DENNIS McCARTHY 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He's a quiet, proud man, L.G. Benson. Doesn't brag
or talk much about the past, his family says.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they knew he was in World War II, a sergeant or something
attached to Gen. Omar Bradley's intelligence unit in France. They
knew he had some medals and citations stuck away in the family
safety deposit box at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But that was about it. Loren _ L.G. to his family and friends _
was way too busy thinking about the future, not the past, when he
got his honorable discharge from the Army in late 1946 and enrolled
in chiropractic college not far from his parents' home in
Roosevelt, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   He had a career to start. A family, too, if and when he found
the right woman.
</P>
<P>
   World War II was finally over. It was time to put the past in
the past, put his uniform in mothballs and get on with the future,
L.G. knew.
</P>
<P>
   If the Belgian government never got around to sending him the
Croix de Guerre _ Cross of War _ medal it awarded him back in 1945
when he helped chase the Nazis out of that country, well, life
would go on.
</P>
<P>
   And it did.
</P>
<P>
   L.G. found the right woman, Donna, at chiropractic college. They
went on to have successful careers that spanned almost five decades
before they retired and moved to California to be near their two
children, Valerie Miremadi and John Benson.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian government never did get around to sending L.G. the
medal he earned.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal. He knew what he and the other guys from his unit
who were awarded that coveted medal did. That's all that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he still had the certificate the Belgian government had
given him in lieu of the medal, which was to follow when things
settled down a little after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The certificate was in the safety deposit box with the other
medals and campaign ribbons Sgt. L.G. Benson had received for being
the soldier Gen. Bradley relied on to keep track of the strategic
positions of all U.S. artillery units fighting the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a long time ago, and L.G. Benson didn't spend much
time talking about the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this?'' John Benson asked his mother a few months ago,
as they turned the pages of a scrapbook his grandmother had
assembled on her son's involvement in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A little newspaper clipping from a 1945 edition of the local
Roosevelt paper had caught his eye. It detailed how one of
Roosevelt's native sons had just been awarded a very prestigious
medal by the Belgian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never actually got it,'' Donna Benson said, turning the
page.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean, he never got it?'' John asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were busy trying to reorganize their government after the
Nazis were driven out, so they gave out certificates and said the
medal would follow,'' she said. ``It didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, John called his sister, Valerie, and
told her about the war medal their father had been awarded, but
never received.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Day was coming up, John said. What did she think?
</P>
<P>
   Valerie thought her brother should go for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I contacted the Belgian Embassy, and they got me in contact
with the military attache, who said they didn't make that medal any
longer,'' John said. ``But they knew where one could be made for
Dad, if I could provide them proof that he had been awarded it.''
</P>
<P>
   So under the pretense of checking some important papers in their
safety deposit box, Donna slipped the medal certificate out of the
box, had a copy made and gave it to John to send to the Belgian
Embassy as proof.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came back a few days later. L.G. Benson had indeed
been awarded the Croix de Guerre, as one of only 30 men to be so
honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me where I could get one made in Belgium, and that's
what I did,'' John said this past weekend, waiting for his dad and
mom to arrive at Valerie's home.
</P>
<P>
   They had a Veterans Day surprise for their father, one he
wouldn't forget for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   L.G. knew something was up when Donna brought out his old Army
uniform jacket and suggested he try it on for the family to see
whether it still fit.
</P>
<P>
   When L.G. did, his kids stepped forward and presented their
father the Croix de Guerre, pinning it on his old uniform jacket.
</P>
<P>
   L.G. just stood there smiling, too choked up to talk. After a
few minutes, this quiet, proud man did something he hasn't done for
a long time.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about the past.
</P>
<P>
   He sat with his kids and grandkids and told them about his early
intelligence training at Gen. Dwight Eisenhower's headquarters in
England, and how he arrived in Normandy with Gen. Bradley's unit a
few days after D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   How they camped out those first few weeks in apple orchards
covered with camouflage netting.
</P>
<P>
   How they proceeded to chase the Nazis out of Europe.

DOLE AIMS TO ENLIST HOLLYWOOD IN CAMPAIGN FOR WWII MEMORIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY JIM SKEEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood uses World War II as a backdrop for
scores of films _ most recently Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private
Ryan'' _ but former presidential candidate Bob Dole says the movie
industry is missing in action when it comes to honoring the
veterans of that war.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the national chairman of the campaign to raise $100
million for a World War II memorial, said the movie industry could
provide a big boost for fund-raising efforts, but thus far hasn't
shown any interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had no luck with the movie industry. I've been turned
down twice by (Disney chief) Michael Eisner,'' Dole said in a
recent telephone interview from his Washington, D.C. law office.
``If there is an industry that should be contributing it is the
movie industry with all those great World War II movies, like
`Saving Private Ryan.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dole said he will continue to push movie executives for
donations and that filmmaker Steven Spielberg will be among those
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get this thing done,'' Dole said. ``We need the
movie industry to come in with $10 million.''
</P>
<P>
   A Disney representative said the corporation gives heavily to
charity, but has not signed up for the war memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already made substantial commitments to the Disney
Concert Hall in Los Angeles and other charitable causes,'' said
Claudia Peters, a spokeswoman for Disney, which reported 1997
profits of $296 million. ``We are deferring any decision on the
memorial for the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Spielberg said the DreamWorks SKG founder is
awaiting a call from the former lawmaker, but didn't know whether a
donation would be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has been supportive in a number of ways to veterans
groups,'' said Spielberg spokesman Marvin Levy. ``I'm sure this is
a conversation he is looking forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole and co-Chairman Frederick Smith, chief executive officer of
FDX Corp., are leading the fund-raising charge on behalf of the
American Battle Monuments Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is overseeing efforts to build a World War II
memorial on 5.5 acres on the National Mall between the Lincoln
Memorial and the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   While there are memorials dedicated to those who fought in World
War II, notably the USS Arizona memorial at Pearl Harbor and the
Iwo Jima memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, there is no
national monument. The Vietnam and Korean wars, smaller conflicts
with fewer American casualties than World War II, have national
memorials.
</P>
<P>
   That means there is no national recognition for the more than
140,000 World War II veterans in Los Angeles County, monument
proponents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an oversight. No one really thought about it,'' Dole
said.
</P>
<P>
   The design for the World War II memorial is an oval plaza, about
seven feet below street level, around an area known as the Rainbow
Pool. The memorial will have two granite arches with bronze laurel
wreaths, symbolizing valor and victory, suspended beneath them.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters had hoped to dedicate the memorial on Veterans Day in
2000, but Dole said he doesn't expect they will be able to meet
that goal. Dole hopes they will at least have broken ground on the
memorial by that date.
</P>
<P>
   Dole was an army lieutenant in World War II, earning a Bronze
Star and two Purple Hearts. Dole was wounded during a battle in
Italy, and lost the use of his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17, 1997, the day he was awarded the Medal of Freedom by
President Clinton, Dole was approached by the memorial supporters
about the possibility of leading the campaign. Dole estimates he
and Smith conduct anywhere from 10 to 30 conference calls a week
seeking donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of a day that goes by when I'm not talking about
it,'' Dole said. ``It's going to be hard to raise this money. We
have $35 million to $40 million, but it's hard to raise $100
million from the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal legislation authorizing the memorial's
construction, the American Battle Monuments Commission has until
May 2000 to obtain the construction permit. All money must be in
hand and the final design must be approved before that permit can
be issued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want something 20, 30 years from now when there are no
veterans around so there will be something there for the
children,'' Dole said. ``We want to get this thing done.''

BASEBALL'S CRAZY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You might hear the Dodgers are about to unload
Gary Sheffield's crushing salary on the San Diego Padres and get a
stronger bullpen in return. But then, you might hear a lot of funny
things these days.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, like golf, has a silly season, and it's upon us again,
with the winter meeting under way in Naples, Fla. Major-league
general managers and a bunch of sportswriters are locked in a hotel
together with nothing to do except invent deals that might or might
not have a prayer of happening.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, the sports wire carried 46 baseball stories,
which was more than college football, more than college basketball,
more than pro hockey and more than pro basketball. More than any
sport except pro football, which has the advantage of actually
having results to report.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great time of year to be a baseball fan, as long as
you're not the sort who demands a game to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than the optimistic days of spring training, it's the
time of year when all things are possible, from purposeful spending
by the Angels to a pennant for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   A Giants fan learns his team is raising its salary budget. A
Tigers fan learns his team made an offer to Padres third baseman
Ken Caminiti. A Diamondbacks fan learns his team's owner is getting
cozy with free-agent pitcher Randy Johnson. A Red Sox fan learns
his team has raised its offer to first baseman Mo Vaughn from four
years and $37 million to five years and $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox fan also sees where general manager Dan Duquette
claims the Angels' recent six-year, $72 million offer to Vaughn
``doesn't matter to me'' and had nothing to do with the upgrade,
which is either a false statement or a foolish one.
</P>
<P>
   Onto the scene of such loose and fanciful talk steps Kevin
Malone, the new Dodgers general manager who likes to talk ball as
much as the next guy.
</P>
<P>
   Malone didn't much like it when some of us wrote last month that
the extraordinary openness of the Dodgers manager search raised
expectations and caused him embarrassment when Felipe Alou said no.
Malone thought, I go out of my way to return reporters' phone calls
and this is the thanks I get?
</P>
<P>
   No offense was intended. His personality will result in more
good than bad.
</P>
<P>
   He's perfect for the winter meetings, a garrulous guy who'll
chat up everybody in Naples and keep the news wire burbling with
optimistic speculation about this trade and that free agent. He's
perfect for Dodgers fans, who could use some holiday cheer.
</P>
<P>
   But the question for Malone this week is, should he go so far as
to encourage dreams of the trade that was the talk of L.A. sports
Tuesday, the one that would send outfielder Gary Sheffield and
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek to San Diego in exchange for outfielder
Greg Vaughn, relief pitcher Randy Myers and shortstop Chris Gomez?
</P>
<P>
   It's a fantasy deal that would do all this for the Dodgers: Dump
Sheffield's $50 million in salary during the next five years,
freeing Australian dollars with which Malone could pay David Cone,
Kevin Brown or Randy Johnson to be the team's much-needed pitching
ace; bring in a 50-home-run left fielder to replace Sheffield; and
give them, in the prickly person of Myers, a set-up man for closer
Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds great. Sounds impossible, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting the Dodgers' $139 million in future payroll commitments
is job one for Malone, but getting out from under Sheffield won't
be easy. And it won't involve the Padres, who lost $11 million
while winning the pennant and are bent on cutting last season's $53
million payroll while re-signing Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield will have to go to a large-market team with a large
vault.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Malone is in no position to pull off the kind
of blockbuster free-agent signings that would transform the team.
We'll have to be content with building-block moves like the signing
of 35-year-old center fielder Devon White and the re-signing of
Shaw last week.
</P>
<P>
   So don't judge Malone's accomplishments this winter based on the
sort of best-case scenarios you'll hear about this week. We'll have
to be content with smaller steps, many of which will sound familiar
to wishful Dodgers fans _ adding some left-handed power, and adding
a set-up man or deciding Scott Radinsky is good enough in that
role.
</P>
<P>
   Until the ledger books are balanced, idle chatter about bigger
moves will be just that.
</P>
<P>
   A friend from the Denver area told me it's an L.A. thing and
kidded, ``You don't get that in cities that have pro football.''
</P>
<P>
   But you do get that, anywhere they're talking baseball. It's the
time of year. &QL;
