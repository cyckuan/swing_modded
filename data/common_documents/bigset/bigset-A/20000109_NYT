It's no longer lonely at top of Mercedes
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KAPALUA, Hawaii _ Everybody who is spellbound by Tiger Woods'
amazing run of success is convinced that he absolutely must win the
Mercedes Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Or Els.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, the laid-back South African who said earlier in this
tournament that he's not in Woods' league, certainly isn't playing
like he's content to stay in Triple-A. He charged into the big
leagues on Saturday and is in position to knock Woods out of the
cleanup spot, at least in terms of cleaning up on the biggest
paycheck of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Els shot 6-under-par 67 to tie Woods for the lead at the PGA
Tour's season-opening event. For the second day in a row, Els did
not have a bogey. And unlike Friday, he didn't have a double-bogey
either. He started the day four strokes behind Woods, but they both
ended at 11-under-par 208 going into the final round after Woods
managed only a 2-under 71 that was capped by an eagle. David Duval
matched Els' 67 and trails the leaders by four shots.
</P>
<P>
   That threesome represents three of the top five players in golf,
according to the official world rankings, which should set up a
gripping finale today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it more competitive,'' said Woods. ``That's what you
have to enjoy _ getting out there and battling against the best
players. Win or lose, it's going to be a lot of fun to try to come
out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, trying to be the first player since 1953 to win five
consecutive starts on the PGA Tour, won't do so without a fight
from Els. And maybe Duval, too.
</P>
<P>
   As the Plantation Course at Kapalua played three shots easier
than it had Friday, and more than four strokes more forgiving than
in the first round, Woods was one of the few players in the 30-man
field who couldn't take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Els, who made four birdies in a row on the front nine, had said
Friday that he wasn't sure anybody could stay with Woods unless the
world's top-ranked player started making some mistakes. On
Saturday, Woods made three bogeys in a nine-hole stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did make a couple of mistakes,'' Els said. ``As it turned
out, I played more consistently than he did on this day. It's nice
to know that I actually got him for one round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I beat him was at the Nissan (Los Angeles Open)
last year. I've played 25 tournaments since then and I've never
beaten him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anybody else has, either.
</P>
<P>
   But even though he had problems, Woods salvaged what could have
been a much worse round when he eagled the 18th, hitting a 3-iron
from 290 yards down the hill and 30 feet past the pin, then making
the putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really got anything going,'' Woods said. ``I wasn't
really playing all that well and Ernie hit a lot of good shots.
That's the way it is sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I was 2-under par, it wasn't a solid 2-under par.
I was kind of scraping it around.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then to end on three good, solid shots leaves a better
taste in your mouth going into the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason for Woods not to be confident when today's
final round commences. The last 11 times he has been in the lead or
tied for the lead after 54 holes, he has won the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will that have any effect on it? No,'' he said. ``It never
does, because you have to go out there and execute the golf shots
and play the correct way.''
</P>
<P>
   Els clearly did that Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Woods, who looked downright pedestrian after making
birdie on two of the first five holes. He had a five-stroke
advantage at one point, but then watched the still-strong breezes
of Maui wreak havoc with his game.
</P>
<P>
   He lost the lead for the first time since early Friday when he
stubbed a chip shot on the par-5 15th and then could not get up and
down.
</P>
<P>
   Els, meanwhile, rode hot ball-striking to four consecutive
birdies starting at the fourth. None of his birdie putts was longer
than 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   He also rolled in an 8-footer at the par-3 11th to get to
10-under par for the tournament. A string of pars was all it took
to get in front of Woods when he bogeyed the 15th.
</P>
<P>
   Els missed several mid-range birdie attempts on the back nine,
but still was in position to take a lead into today until the 18th.
The 663-yard hole plays directly downhill and the 25-mph wind was
whistling from the players' backs.
</P>
<P>
   Els hit a driver and 3-wood pin high and two-putted from 50 feet
on the right fringe for a birdie. But Woods one-upped him when he
drained his eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, he had an off day and still shot 2 under,'' Els
said. ``I mean, the talent and ability is there by abundance.''
</P>
<P>
   Els said he wasn't overly worried about Woods running away from
the field after he had birdied the first hole to go five strokes
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do?'' he said. ``When he starts off like that, if
he's going to blitz the golf course, what can you do? You can only
control your own game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing pretty well this week. I'm just going to try to
give myself chances and try to stay up with the guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think you'll see a different Tiger Woods (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Or Els.

QUIET VIBE HAS WELL-OFF HEADING FOR THE HILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Harrison Sheppard  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Tiny Hidden Hills is the most exclusive, priciest
community in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, home to celebrities and
CEOs, a place where a house that sells for $1 million is considered
a fixer-upper.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to armed patrols, gated fences and security cameras,
Hidden Hills, about 27 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, is
highly protected, and isolated, from the outside world -- qualities
that make it attractive to such celebrities as Sinbad, Alex Van
Halen, Lisa Marie Presley, Bob Eubanks and Beau Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the gates, those who live there compare it to an idyllic
suburb of yesteryear, a true community where kids feel safe playing
in the streets and everybody knows each other, except for some of
the celebrities who crave privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this sounds crazy, but it's probably one of the most
amazing communities you'll see in your life,'' said Lisa Gutman,
who moved to Hidden Hills eight years ago and sells real estate
there for Re/Max in Calabasas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of these communities you move in and you instantly
know you'll never leave it. People don't leave, they move around,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden Hills was built in the 1950s and incorporated as a city
in 1961. There are 628 homes and now only 20 vacant lots, all on
about two square miles of land. Just under 2,000 people live there.
Minimum lot sizes start at an acre.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the median price of a home sold in Hidden Hills was
$1.2 million, up from $909,000 in 1998, according to
Acxiom/DataQuick, a real estate research firm. But most homes that
go for $1 million are bought for the land, so builders can tear
down the houses and put up much larger estates.
</P>
<P>
   The security has given Hidden Hills one of the lowest crime
rates anywhere -- typically less than a dozen incidents a year,
almost none major or violent. But it also creates a forbidding, and
almost too-perfect facade to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kid around -- we call it the Stepford Wives or Peyton
Place,'' Gutman said. ``You live here, you're part of Hidden Hills.
Our things are not open to outsiders.''
</P>
<P>
   The community has a strong back-to-nature vibe to it, with horse
trails throughout the neighborhoods, not to mention the occasional
coyote and snake in the back yard. Houses are large, but most
aren't overwhelming. On weekends, children set up lemonade stands
on the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Patte Gilbert, a Realtor with Fred Sands Realtors in nearby
Calabasas, said those looking for the tightest security don't move
into Hidden Hills -- instead they just fence and seal up their own
homes. Those who do move there do so because they are looking for
the sense of community and safety not usually found in urban areas,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   They are also looking to send their children to good public
schools in the Las Virgenes Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that some clients have found Hidden Hills too
pretentious and exclusionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's meant to be that way,'' Gilbert said. ``I
don't think people are saying, I want to block the world out.'
They're saying, I want to experience a sense of community for me
and my family.''

IT'S TIME TO EMBRACE `MALCOLM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get it right this time, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   Tonight Fox gives view ers a second chance to embrace an
offbeat, irreverent, even subversive comedy. The late, lamented
``Action'' sank like a Nielsen stone when viewers fled from its
bleeped-out cursing and ``adult situations,'' also known as kinky
sex scenes.
</P>
<P>
   If there's any justice _ and I'm aware there's not _ ``Malcolm
in the Middle'' won't suffer a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm is the third of four children in a harried household. A
good kid, if a bit high-strung. Then it's discovered he has an IQ
of 165. Good news, you might think, but not to a gritty kid who
suddenly finds himself in a gifted class, surrounded by brainiacs
whose intelligence outweighs their social skills by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
   That sets the premise: Genius kid tries to balance
sometimes-geeky gift with status as target of brothers and parents.
The first three episodes are often rude, occasionally crude and
sometimes a little cruel.
</P>
<P>
   They're also funny.
</P>
<P>
   The first scene of the series serves as a litmus test. If a wife
shaving her naked husband's back at the kitchen table while the
kids eat breakfast sounds funny, you've found your show.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds disgusting _ well, I'm sure there's a ``Touched By
an Angel'' rerun on somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Linwood Boomer created the show, based partly on his own
experience of being labeled ``gifted'' as a child. (He played Adam
Kendall on ``Little House on the Prairi''e).
</P>
<P>
   The key word being ``partly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the same way like when you get together with the family at
Thanksgiving dinner or something,'' Boomer says, ``and you trot out
those old war stories, and every time you tell them they get more
and more exaggerated and more self-serving, and the memory gets a
little more selective.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Muniz is the engine that drives ``Malcolm.'' The
13-year-old nails the title role, capturing perfectly the anxiety
of a gifted kid struggling mightily to fit in with his ``normal''
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ``so'' cool,'' Muniz says of the role. ``It's sort of
like me and sort of not. . . . I'm not really (a genius), but
Malcolm doesn't really act like a genius. Only when he has to be
smart, he is. But when he's home, he's normal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm'' is a welcome jab in the ribs of the traditional
family comedy, and Fox's best chance at a successful live-action
comedy. It's not afraid to take shots at uncomfortable targets _
socially awkward kids, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it's out-and-out funny. It's a throwaway line from a later
episode, but when an off-screen kid shrieks, ``Leave the squirrel
alone and get the fire extinguisher!'' I was hooked for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we'll find an audience or not,'' Boomer says.
``I certainly hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Me, too. ``Malcolm'' deserves one. &QL; Reach Goodykoontz at

LIVING OUR LIVES ON THE HIT-AND-RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
Friday, Jan. 7, was the second anniversary, so I drove out to 35th
Avenue and Deer Valley, where it happened.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day is some kind of anniver sary. According to The Arizona
Republic, this Jan. 7 marked one year since the start of Bill
Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The paper said Jan. 7, 1953, was the day President Harry Truman
an nounced we had the H-bomb.
</P>
<P>
   A book from the public library says the Civil War battle of
Manassas Junction began on Jan. 7, 1862; and that the Flash Gordon
comic strip debuted Jan. 7, 1934; and that, on Jan. 7, 1955, singer
Marian Anderson became the first African-American to star in a New
York Metropolitan Opera production.
</P>
<P>
   Millard Fillmore, the 13th president of the United States, was
born on Jan. 7. So was Today Show host Katie Couric and pop star
Kenny Loggins.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese Emperor Hirohito died on Jan. 7, as did Trevor
Howard, the actor, John Berryman, the poet, and Mark Pase Miller, a
12-year-old from northwest Phoenix, about whom I had forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Mark's father, Paul, sent me an e-mail last week thanking me for
having written about his son two years ago, shortly after the
accident. As the anniversary of Mark's death approached, Miller was
thinking even more about a boy he already spends much of his day
thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't thought of him for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   So, on Friday I drove to 35th Avenue and Deer Valley. Just south
of the intersection, near a side street called Abraham Lane,
there's a white wooden cross with the name ``Mark'' on it planted
near the sidewalk on the east side of the street.
</P>
<P>
   Early on the morning of Jan. 7, 1997, Mark Miller left home for
middle school. He was an honor student, a happy, independent kid,
as are his brother and sister, Ben and Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think about him going out that morning,'' Paul said.
``You always worry when your kids have to cross a busy street. But
Mark wasn't reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   In the neighborhoods north of the new Loop 101 freeway, 35th
Avenue becomes the two-lane road it had been before developers
seeded fallow cotton fields with money and up sprouted houses with
red tile roofs.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a while to reach the heart of the city from this part
of town. No one drives slowly. On that dark and overcast morning,
commuters didn't see the 12-year-old crossing the street.
</P>
<P>
   Mark was clipped by a passing car, knocked down but not killed.
The driver stopped. A gray car behind behind her didn't bother.
Mark was pulled under the automobile and dragged to the spot where
the cross now stands.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial roses wrapped around his homemade memorial have
faded over time, as has any hope of finding the hit-and-run driver,
as have our recollections of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family is getting along as well as can be expected,'' Paul
said. ``The kids help a lot. They're our strength. As for the
driver of that car, I guess he or she will just have to live with
it. Although how you can drive off and not stop, I can't imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither can I. Neither can you, I'd guess. Though we do it just
about every time we read the paper. The news of the day appears
suddenly in our headlights, like a child on a darkened street. We
don't often stop, or even look back.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, on Friday morning, a newspaper writer put aside his
``im portant'' work and drove to a windy, traffic-heavy spot where
there was no one to meet, nothing to do and little to see besides a
small white cross wrapped in artificial roses. And a boy's name.

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR AIMS TO PROTECT ELDERLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Terri Hardy  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Dismayed by the state's dismal record of
monitoring its 1,400 nursing homes, Gov. Gray Davis will propose a
series of measures in his budget Monday to crack down on repeat
offenders and improve the quality of care, administration sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis will propose adding 133 inspectors, streamlining the
process to revoke licenses and making sure nursing homes in
California are financially solvent and patients are protected if a
facility suddenly closes.
</P>
<P>
   This beefed-up enforcement proposal is a component of Davis'
centerpiece health care plan focusing on the elderly -- a $271.5
million ``Aging with Dignity'' Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Of that total, $140.4 million would come from the state's
general fund and the rest from federal coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Although some lawmakers have criticized Davis' decision to focus
narrowly on the elderly when there are large issues of HMO reform
and uninsured Californians to consider, an administration official
defended the governor's choice.
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Aging with Dignity' affects every Californian. There is
someone in the family, someone they know and love,'' the source
said. ``It's important to show respect for those that came before
us.''
</P>
<P>
   But across the state, serious deficiencies have gone unchecked
through a system of low fines that are frequently waived or not
collected, once-a- year inspections that can be predicted by
nursing homes, and a troublesome process for revoking the licenses
of the most egregious offenders.
</P>
<P>
   An administration source said no licenses were taken away in
California last year, and only two in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles County, residents in nearly one in five nursing
homes that receive federal funding suffer from bed sores, broken
bones, waste-tainted bed baths, malnutrition or other serious
violations, according to a congressional investigation released in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' proposals would increase the number of unannounced
inspections of nursing homes by spending $7.4 million for new
inspectors. Also, the governor wants to spend $4.1 million to
expand a pilot program of intensive review of nursing homes that
fail to provide quality care.
</P>
<P>
   The governor pledges that facilities ``repeatedly failing to
comply with nursing home standards'' will be placed in receivership
or have their licenses revoked, administration sources said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the governor wants to ensure more rapid response to
nursing home complaints by spending $3.9 million for more
inspectors to investigate non-emergency problems within 48 hours.
And nursing homes will be required to prominently post a toll-free
telephone number for an ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   Under the governor's plan, fines for violations that result in
death would increase from the current range of $5,000 to $25,000,
to a new high of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also proposes legislation to increase fines
for violations that can cause serious harm or death. The current
range is $1,000 to $10,000, and the proposed range is $2,000 to
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry plagued with insolvency -- currently 11 percent
of nursing homes are facing bankruptcy, according to the state --
the governor wants to tighten fiscal standards. In 1997, the owner
of a Reseda nursing home filed for bankruptcy and the residents
were forcibly relocated late at night -- a violation of state law
that requires 30 days' notice.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, who authored a bill
requiring patients to be notified if a nursing home is facing
financial difficulty after the Reseda facility closed, said tougher
enforcement proposed by Davis is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big problem out there,'' Hertzberg said. ``You've
got a fast-growing elderly population but a situation where it's
hard to get qualified people to provide care. You have a pattern of
nursing homes violating the law and a law that has little teeth or
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg called Davis' plan ``good ideas'' that could provide
more protection as well as boosting caregivers' low wages.
</P>
<P>
   Davis proposes establishing a state advisory board that would
review and establish new standards and reporting requirements for
nursing facility licensees.
</P>
<P>
   For nursing homes with severe fiscal mismanagement, there are no
intermediate sanctions short of receivership, so Davis will ask for
statutory changes to allow the appointment of a temporary state
manger -- to be paid by the licensee -- in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also wants to help boost the quality of care in
nursing homes, proposing to use $15 million in federal funds to
train caregivers as well as $35 million in welfare-to-work dollars
for recruitment, retention and training of those employees.
</P>
<P>
   Often notoriously underpaid, workers at nursing homes would have
their pay increased by 5 percent, to $6.25 per hour. The hourly pay
would rise to $8 per hour over a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is also asking for the state's Department of Health
Services to review minimum staff-to-patient ratios and make
recommendations by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the State Address last week, Davis said he wants
to provide a system where older people could remain at home or be
cared for by their families.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Californians over age 85 are the fastest-growing
segment of the population. The number over age 60 will increase
from 4.9 million this year to 9 million by 2020, government figures
show.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the elderly out of nursing homes, Davis is proposing a
$500 tax credit for families caring for seniors at home. And, he
would change Medi-Cal provisions to put an additional 13,000 aged
and disabled people on the rolls of ``no cost'' health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Other Davis health initiatives include spending $26.2 million to
fight Medi-Cal abuses, and increasing outreach efforts to provide
the working poor and their children with low-cost health insurance
by spending an additional $10 million in advertising -- for a total
of $31.8 million.

NOW STREAK SHOULD MATTER TO LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ten in a row, 11, 12, 13, 14 ...? The Los Angeles
Lakers pretend not to be able to count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about the streak,'' Shaquille O'Neal said to
reporters late Friday night at the Staples Center, where the Lakers
had just made it 13 straight, on their way to 14 with Saturday
night's victory over the Supersonics in Seattle. ``You guys are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking, `Oh, no, we have to win the game to keep
the streak going,' '' Derek Fisher said of the Lakers' desperate
rally after they trailed the Charlotte Hornets by double figures
with seven minutes to play. ``I was thinking, `We have to win the
game.' '' Period.
</P>
<P>
   If the new, improved Lakers seem more willing than before to do
the little things that win games, they also want to seem not to
care that they're winning games in bunches.
</P>
<P>
   But they should care about the streak.
</P>
<P>
   They should care about the streak that reached one with that
ugly, though thrilling, 87-83 victory over Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   That game began a string of 16 Lakers games that include 14
against teams with winning records, among them road games against
Central Division leader Indiana on Jan. 14, Midwest Division leader
Utah on Jan. 24 and defending champion San Antonio on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The teams the Lakers have played so far, running up a
league-best 29-5 record, are a combined 100 games under .500. The
teams they'll face in this month-long stretch are 73 above.
</P>
<P>
   Think anybody's told them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches get paid to tell us that stuff,'' Fisher said a bit
wearily.
</P>
<P>
   If the Staples Center fans seemed uncharacteristically revved up
when Glen Rice's 3-pointer gave the Lakers their first lead late in
the Charlotte game, it's because they realize this was a pivotal
game.
</P>
<P>
   A Lakers loss, and the streak of victories against the NBA's
weaklings would have proven exactly nothing.
</P>
<P>
   A Lakers win, and maybe they've got something here.
</P>
<P>
   That figures to be the theme of the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends say, `Y'all are rolling,' '' Robert Horry said. ``I
say, `Heck, we aren't playing anybody that good.' We have a tough
stretch of road games coming up. That's going to be the real test
right there.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of Horry's friends who think Phil Jackson's first L.A.
team is rolling straight to the NBA Finals, remember that only two
months ago the cynics were competing to see who could list the most
Lakers weaknesses. And those weaknesses are lurking, preparing to
bite the Lakers right in their prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Power forward. The next few weeks may determine whether you can
be the best team in the NBA with 36-year-old A.C. Green and the
injury-prone Horry at power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard: Or with creaky-kneed Ron Harper, 35, running the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Depth. Or without a serious backup center or fire-lighting
shooter coming off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq dependence. So much of the Lakers' success so far has
depended on O'Neal's inspired all-around play his improved
rebounding and defense have made the hole at power forward all but
irrelevant that it's scary to think what happens if he wears down.
Which isn't unthinkable, considering that in many games, he's on
the floor for every minute until it's won.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's contract. His performance against Charlotte, which
included six rebounds and two steals in the fourth-quarter rally,
suggested he's a happy, committed Laker. But what if his
pay-me-or-trade-me demand becomes a distraction again?
</P>
<P>
   Portland: The Lakers might be on pace for a 70-wins season, but
the Trail Blazers were only 3 games behind them going into Saturday
night. And the Blazers, with Scottie Pippen and Steve Smith new to
the lineup, were expected to be slow to hit their stride.
</P>
<P>
   As were the Lakers, of course, having to adjust to Jackson's
triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the Lakers have room for improvement?
</P>
<P>
   Or has their fast start left them with a long way to fall?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson may have covered up some of the weaknesses with clever
substitutions, confidence-building psychology and a more efficient
offense, but how long can he do that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're sitting on top and everybody will be gunning for
us,'' Fisher said. ``That's when life starts to get a lot harder.
We will lose a game. And then we'll see what we're made of.'' &QL;

INS IS RIGHT, LET ELIAN GO HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICARDO PIMENTEL  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
Communists can't be good fathers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, that's not it.
</P>
<P>
   As a country, we shouldn't send children back to countries where
they might face hardships.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, that can't be it either.
</P>
<P>
   Darn it, I'm having a tough time summoning any outrage over the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's decision this week that
6-year-old refugee Elian Gonzalez should be returned to his father
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   So, I'll applaud.
</P>
<P>
   It was the right thing to do even if getting him there might be
tougher than simply saying he should go. Cuban expatriates in
Florida have vowed to do anything to block his return.
</P>
<P>
   Elian is the boy found clinging to an inner tube at sea after
his mother, stepfather and eight others died while trying to reach
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   His situation immediately became embroiled in international and
domestic politics. Cuban- &QL; 
Americans have been clamoring that he should not be returned. They
have legitimate problems with Castro, communism and totalitarian
regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Various presidential aspirants _ our own John McCain among them
_ weighed in. The fact that Cuban-Americans vote in high numbers
might have something to do with this.
</P>
<P>
   But, it all left many of us wondering what happened to the
Republican issue of family values.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple enough.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy has befallen this child. There can hardly be a bigger
one in a child's life than the loss of a mother.
</P>
<P>
   At such times, trips to Disney World, toys and the showering
attention of well-wishers will not help as much as a simple hug
from a father, especially one, as is apparently the case here, who
loves his son and has been involved in his life. A lifetime of
relative privilege will not take the place of a lifetime of
guidance from a caring father, even one who's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Are we to believe that Mickey Mouse and the well-intentioned
attentions of more distant relatives _ all strangers to this boy _
will take its place?
</P>
<P>
   We can't have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   With plenty of good cause, we wring our hands here at home about
how uncaring, deadbeat, absentee fathers _ those who think
fathering is simply a matter of helping with the conception _ are
to blame for many of our societal ills.
</P>
<P>
   But, enter a father who wants to do the right thing and all of a
sudden we lose sight of the mantra we've all been chanting for a
number of years now: Fathers matter.
</P>
<P>
   The argument that the wishes of the mother should be considered
do tug at the heart. She clearly wanted her son in the United
States, as evidenced by the fact that she was bringing him here.
But does this mean she wanted him here parentless? It doesn't seem
likely, having met a lot of moms.
</P>
<P>
   So, enter the privation argument: By sending Elian back, we
sentence him to a lifetime of hardship.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that argument is that much of the hardship
visited upon Cuba is the result of a wrongheaded U.S. embargo of
that island nation. We're virtually alone in the world on this
score. Everyone else is doing business with Cuba, but not the
trading partner liable to make the biggest dent in the Cuban misery
index.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is a policy held hostage to Cuban-American votes,
though there are some indications that Congress might be amenable
to a partial lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   But, if poverty is the reason Elian should not be returned to
Cuba, we need to take another look at the kids we've sent back to
Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe we're worried about the loss of rights Elian will
suffer in a return to Cuba. We shouldn't. It's fairly certain that,
though Castro has outlasted nine U.S. presidents and some
assassination attempts, the dictator, now in his mid-70s, will not
outlast 6-year-old Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom for Cuba is inevitable and Elian will live to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunification, the INS' stated rationale for the boy's
return, is sometimes better as an ideal than it is in practice.
Let's face it, there should be a law against some parents.
</P>
<P>
   But Elian and his father don't fit this profile.
</P>
<P>
   The INS was right and the expatriates continue to be wrong in
prolonging the boy's stay here. Let Elian go home to his father. &QL;

PUNDITS WANT CANDIDATES TO TELL ALL, EXCEPT ABOUT FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB ROBB 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
As a generally religious people, it is surprising that Americans
have not evolved broadly accepted protocols for discussing the role
of faith in public life.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But we haven't, and the propriety of religious views in the
public square took center stage in both the Democratic and
Republican presidential debates last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic debate, Al Gore protested that he had never
volunteered his religious beliefs. But when asked directly about
them, he thought he had an obligation to respond truthfully and
fully. Nevertheless, he respected his opponent, Bill Bradley, for
declining to do precisely what Gore had just described as an
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, for his part, said that religious beliefs are deeply
personal and private, and should not be discussed in a political
campaign. He had never done so, and wasn't going to in this
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's position is the one approved by what one wag has
termed the ``chattering class,'' of which I am now a dissident
member: the largely liberal reporters and commentators who purport
to analyze and explain politics and public policy to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are inconsistencies in the chattering class' point of
view. For the most part, they also say we need to know what kind of
people candidates are, not just their policy positions.
</P>
<P>
   In all major religions, faith is not just something you bring to
occasional ceremonial exercises. It's a force that animates your
daily life. If you want to know what makes a religious person tick,
you begin with his faith.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the chattering class' immersion in the
self-confessional ethic of this era. We want candidates to tell us
all about themselves, except, apparently, for their religious
beliefs and experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Hence we get the strange paradox of the chattering class
applauding when John McCain reveals that he once dated a stripper
who cleaned her fingernails with a switchblade, yet cringing when
George W. Bush tells us that faith in Jesus Christ changed his
heart, enabling him to quit drinking and find focus in a political
career.
</P>
<P>
   For my part, I would prefer that we lived in a less
self-revelatory age and judged candidates more on how they would
govern the country than on what kind of people they are.
</P>
<P>
   While religious beliefs do provide a revealing glimpse into
character, they aren't a particularly useful guide to performance
in public office. And while both the religious left and the
religious right have a tendency sometimes to regard the Bible as
containing a political platform, in reality people of genuine faith
can begin with identical religious precepts and reason themselves
into widely different public-policy conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't live in an age in which we judge candidates on
their policies and political capabilities and are circumspect about
judging the character of people we don't really know very well. And
if we are in the business of judging the kind of people candidates
are, it's hard to understand why their faith life is not relevant,
while their past sex life, drug use, business activities and, in
this campaign, even college grades are relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the chattering class goes beyond somewhat
amusing inconsistencies and devolves into something darker and more
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   In a generally execrable performance as moderator of Thursday's
Republican debate, Tim Russert of NBC asked George W. Bush the
following question: ``Fifteen million atheists in this country, 5
million Jews, 5 million Muslims, millions more Buddhists and
Hindus: Should they feel excluded from George W. Bush because of
his allegiance to Jesus?''
</P>
<P>
   You can bet your last ounce of political correctness that
Russert would never have asked a Jew, a Muslim, a Buddhist or a
Hindu whether other Americans should be concerned about them
holding public office because of their faith. Post-JFK, he
certainly wouldn't ask it of a Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he felt free to ask it of George W. Bush, a born-again
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   There are no other words to describe it: Russert's question was
an act of brutal and ugly religious bigotry. &QL;

LIVING OUR LIVES ON THE HIT-AND-RUN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
Friday, Jan. 7, was the second anniversary, so I drove out to 35th
Avenue and Deer Valley, where it happened.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day is some kind of anniver sary. According to The Arizona
Republic, this Jan. 7 marked one year since the start of Bill
Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The paper said Jan. 7, 1953, was the day President Harry Truman
an nounced we had the H-bomb.
</P>
<P>
   A book from the public library says the Civil War battle of
Manassas Junction began on Jan. 7, 1862; and that the Flash Gordon
comic strip debuted Jan. 7, 1934; and that, on Jan. 7, 1955, singer
Marian Anderson became the first African-American to star in a New
York Metropolitan Opera production.
</P>
<P>
   Millard Fillmore, the 13th president of the United States, was
born on Jan. 7. So was Today Show host Katie Couric and pop star
Kenny Loggins.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese Emperor Hirohito died on Jan. 7, as did Trevor
Howard, the actor, John Berryman, the poet, and Mark Pase Miller, a
12-year-old from northwest Phoenix, about whom I had forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Mark's father, Paul, sent me an e-mail last week thanking me for
having written about his son two years ago, shortly after the
accident. As the anniversary of Mark's death approached, Miller was
thinking even more about a boy he already spends much of his day
thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't thought of him for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   So, on Friday I drove to 35th Avenue and Deer Valley. Just south
of the intersection, near a side street called Abraham Lane,
there's a white wooden cross with the name ``Mark'' on it planted
near the sidewalk on the east side of the street.
</P>
<P>
   Early on the morning of Jan. 7, 1997, Mark Miller left home for
middle school. He was an honor student, a happy, independent kid,
as are his brother and sister, Ben and Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think about him going out that morning,'' Paul said.
``You always worry when your kids have to cross a busy street. But
Mark wasn't reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   In the neighborhoods north of the new Loop 101 freeway, 35th
Avenue becomes the two-lane road it had been before developers
seeded fallow cotton fields with money and up sprouted houses with
red tile roofs.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a while to reach the heart of the city from this part
of town. No one drives slowly. On that dark and overcast morning,
commuters didn't see the 12-year-old crossing the street.
</P>
<P>
   Mark was clipped by a passing car, knocked down but not killed.
The driver stopped. A gray car behind behind her didn't bother.
Mark was pulled under the automobile and dragged to the spot where
the cross now stands.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial roses wrapped around his homemade memorial have
faded over time, as has any hope of finding the hit-and-run driver,
as have our recollections of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family is getting along as well as can be expected,'' Paul
said. ``The kids help a lot. They're our strength. As for the
driver of that car, I guess he or she will just have to live with
it. Although how you can drive off and not stop, I can't imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither can I. Neither can you, I'd guess. Though we do it just
about every time we read the paper. The news of the day appears
suddenly in our headlights, like a child on a darkened street. We
don't often stop, or even look back.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, on Friday morning, a newspaper writer put aside his
``im portant'' work and drove to a windy, traffic-heavy spot where
there was no one to meet, nothing to do and little to see besides a
small white cross wrapped in artificial roses. And a boy's name.

SEN. MCCAIN OPENS FILES IN DONOR FLAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER AND KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
WASHINGTON _ John McCain, hoping to defuse a potential political
bomb, opened his files Saturday and released letters he wrote to
U.S. regulatory agencies in behalf of large campaign donors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the letters was written for a satellite firm McCain aided
extensively before and after it raised $18,000 for him in campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Other major campaign donors helped by McCain included telephone
companies and broadcasters, many of whom have an interest in
legislation that falls under the auspices of the Senate Commerce
Committee, which the Arizona senator heads. Among them are rural
and Hispanic broadcasters in Arizona who say the legislation has
hurt their interests.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual gambit by the GOP presidential contender, more
than 500 letters in all were carried to a suburban hotel conference
room and arranged in stacks on a wooden table. Commerce Committee
aides were made available for hours to answer reporters' questions
about the McCain letters.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen letters were placed apart from the rest because they
benefited businesses or individuals who have contributed at least
$2,000 to McCain's campaign. It was those letters that pointed most
directly to the issue now dogging McCain: whether he has gone too
far in intervening with agencies in behalf of some of his largest
campaign benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   The questions have grown persistent enough that his handlers
believed a dramatic and thorough response was needed to prevent the
risk of serious harm to his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, while McCain campaigned in South Carolina, his
aides sought to use the letters themselves to demonstrate he has
not been influenced by campaign cash. The 500 letters, most of them
expressing concerns in behalf of Arizona constituents who did not
contribute at all, were intended to show that he fights just as
hard for non-contributors as for those with deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't differentiate between people who give or not,''
said Mark Buse, staff director of the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Among the contributors were executives of EchoStar, a
Colorado-based satellite TV company that McCain has assisted both
through legislation and in an August 1998 letter he wrote to the
Federal Communications Commission that was released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar is, in many ways, a case study for the questions facing
McCain. He aided the firm on a key legislative matter, and it's
clear he benefited from its employees' campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   The letter contained no evidence that it was written in
anticipation of fund-raisers. McCain aides said his main concern
was simply to provide competition to the cable industry.
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar and its employees have given $18,000 for McCain's
candidacy, the campaign said. The company's chairman, Charles
Ergen, sponsored a March 1999 fund-raiser in which the firm's vice
president, its senior vice president, and its chief operating
officer all donated $1,000, according to Federal Election
Commission records. Ergen also gave $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain was boosting EchoStar on several fronts. As
the Commerce Committee chairman, he helped EchoStar and firms like
it win permission in Congress last year to offer local programming,
including local affiliates of the four major broadcast networks.
For years, the satellite firms had complained they were handicapped
in competing with cable because they could not deliver local
stations. Now they can, thanks partly to McCain, who made their
cause one of his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in 1998, McCain had written to the FCC to elicit
statistical information to help the satellite firms respond to a
related issue: a Miami court decision threatening their
subscribers' network feeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We acted on this letter at this time because of a court case.
It has nothing to do with anything else,'' Buse said.
</P>
<P>
   But some broadcasters still are not happy. Under the new law,
satellite firms, at least for the next two years, may
``cherry-pick'' which local stations they want to carry, often
excluding rural populations served by small independent stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's not very fair for the smaller-market
stations,'' said Rich Howe, general manager of KUSK-TV in Prescott,
one of the rural Arizona stations that have so far been kept off
the satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that's not going to be the definitive end of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although rural stations are hardest hit by the new legislation,
Howe noted that other broadcasters, including many small religious
stations, the local WB Channel, and the state's two local Hispanic
affiliates, Telemundo and Univision, are also left off satellite
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``That leaves out a lot of people,'' Howe said. He added
hopefully, ``We're still on the launching pad right now.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's staff on Saturday said he wants to see Hispanic
stations carried by satellite companies, which have become more
popular in recent years. And they point out that the companies,
under a provision called ``must carry,'' will be required to
include all local stations by 2002, just as cable operators do.
</P>
<P>
   ``(McCain) would like to see Telemundo on these services,'' Buse
said. ``And there is certainly a better chance of them getting up
now than if there was no law at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a number of industry officials remember the day McCain
was feted at Ergen's fund-raiser, attended by dozens of
satellite-industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of stations in New England and Arizona said
privately that McCain's attendance at the fund-raiser showed
favoritism toward the satellite companies at a time when the fates
of both cable broadcasters and satellite companies were in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's aides defended the decision to hold the fund-raiser
despite its proximity to the crafting of sensitive, multiparty
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that if McCain were to stop writing legislation
whenever he needed to raise money, he would either have no money or
little legislation to show for his time on Capitol Hill. &QL;

ARIZONA'S UPSET WIN HAS A LOCAL FLAVOR
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Stanford and Arizona met at Maples Pavilion on
Saturday in what was billed as a preliminary bout between
Pacific-10 heavyweights, but looked suspiciously to us like a
grade-school blacktop at recess.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford student section taunted the fifth-ranked Wildcats
until Loren Woods silenced it with his sparkling play at both ends
of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona freshman Gilbert Arenas razzed the Stanford students by
doing a little jig in full view of them to celebrate, albeit a tad
prematurely, the Wildcats' 68-65 upset of the top-ranked Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh, let's not forget those poor UCLA basketball fans who
tuned into the cable telecast of the wonderfully played game
because their boys weren't on television. They were the truly
tormented, with the affronts coming at them from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Arenas, a 17-year-old freshman, played the point for the
Wildcats with such poise and presence it had to make Bruins fans
cry. He matriculated from Grant High in North Hollywood, an errant
Earl Watson throw from the UCLA campus.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in the Bruins' backyard so why shouldn't he grace
their backcourt? Because UCLA coach Steve Lavin didn't recruit him,
that's why.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin didn't go after Stanford freshman guard Casey Jacobsen,
either. Jacobsen, a Glendora High product, had trouble finding his
shot against the Wildcats but his passing was spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did we mention ex-UCLA star Bill Walton's son, Luke? He
played so well for the Wildcats, they hardly missed injured
swingman Richard Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Bruins ought to lock up their backyard a little
better, to keep coaches like Arizona's Lute Olson and Stanford's
Mike Montgomery from stealing valuable recruits.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't too late to recover the goods, Lavin could file a
police report, charging Olson and Montgomery with grand larceny.
</P>
<P>
   It figures Montgomery and Olson would have Southern California
cased pretty well. Montgomery, who is in his 14th year at Stanford,
was reared in Long Beach and educated at Long Beach State. Olson,
who picked up the 600th win of his career Saturday, coached the
49ers before putting down deep roots in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA may have the fabled history but, tellingly, Arizona has
been the yardstick with which Stanford has measured its rise.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first high points of Montgomery's tenure came at
Maples Pavilion in 1988, against an Arizona that was ranked No.1 in
the country. The Cardinal's 82-74 upset of the Wildcats was the
basketball team's first win over a top-ranked squad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Cardinal beat Arizona at home again and finished
13th in the final rankings. Todd Lichti starred as a guard on those
two teams. The school's all-time leading scorer, he helped lay down
the asphalt for the yellow brick road that the likes of Adam Keefe,
Tim Young, Arthur Lee and Mark Madsen went on to pave.
</P>
<P>
   Lichti can remember when the Stanford sixth man described the
first player off the bench and not a group of 800 standing,
stomping students (with 400 more students on a waiting list).
</P>
<P>
   The practice of camping out in front of Maples Pavilion the
night before a game, as students did before Saturday's Pacific-10
showcase event, postdated his collegiate career.
</P>
<P>
   When Lichti played at Stanford, he was surrounded by future
entrepreneurs, not future pros. The typical recruit then was a kid
with a good head on his shoulders, not one with a great crossover
dribble.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to this past fall and the arrival of Jacobsen, who
trailed the Collins twins, who tailed Lee who shadowed Keefe.
Southern Californians and impact players all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas before it was smart kids who were pretty good
basketball players, now Stanford is getting great basketball
players who are very good students,'' Lichti said the other day
from Denver, where he does broadcasting work for the Nuggets.
``It's the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's loss will topple Stanford from its No. 1 perch. But
as UCLA fans now know, there are a lot more painful falls.

CLIPPERS BEAT PACERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Clippers, behaving like the
fearless rookie pool player who sacrifices touch for velocity,
finally put an opponent behind the eight ball.
</P>
<P>
   Then they chalked up their first victory in five games.
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Olowokandi rumored to be a bigger disappointment
than the Y2K bug _ going relatively cuckoo, the Clips defeated the
Indiana Pacers 107-94 on Saturday in front of 17,004 at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi rallied for a career-high 24 points and a game-high
17 rebounds in a hustle that lifted his cronies to their first
victory over the Pacers in 2,571 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really? I was back in London kicking around a soccer ball,''
said Olowokandi when informed the Pacers (22-10) had an 11-game
winning streak over the Clippers (10-22) that dated back to Dec.
13, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi, who had been punted around Staples by Shaquille
O'Neal during last week's two-game Lakers series, found the defense
of 7-foot-4 Rik Smits a bit less hurtful.
</P>
<P>
   And the Clippers defense, which lately had been as tough as the
questions in a `Donny and Marie' interview, finally rose about the
level of embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up an average of 122 points over their last four
games, the Clippers didn't surrender a field goal to the Pacers
until the 5:56 mark of the opening quarter. The bucket was a fluke,
too, created when Clipper Lamar Odom deflected a Mark Jackson pass
through the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi had 10 points and eight rebounds in the opening half.
His jump hook at 7:23 of the first period gave the Clippers a 16-4
lead. They finished the quarter up 27-20.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Nesby (23 points), whose price for missing the morning
shoot-around was his starting gig, provided a dozen points in the
second quarter. Taylor (23 points) had 16 points and no fouls at
intermission, which arrived with the Clippers leading 58-44.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi added eight points and six rebounds during the third
period, as the Clips entered the final quarter with a 79-67 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: When it was the Pacers' turn to make a selection in the
first round of the 1997 NBA Draft, they used the 12th pick to
choose 6-9 forward Austin Croshere, who played at Santa Monica's
Crossroads High before starring at Providence College. The Clippers
selected Maurice Taylor with the next pick. Last summer, the Clips
had a chance to acquire Croshere and point guard Travis Best in a
sign-and-trade offer for free agent Lorenzen Wright. They passed,
eventually dealing Wright to Atlanta for two first-round picks.
Best, who has a career average of seven points per game, is giving
the Pacers about the same off the bench. But Croshere, who averaged
3.4 points in just 27 appearances last season, is providing nine
points per game this season. Of course, until the Clippers'
additional first-round picks are made and developed (or packaged
and traded), it's impossible to judge their yield in dealing
Wright....
</P>
<P>
   While the hot air of trade winds involving Olowokandi swirled
around Chicago, Bulls GM Jerry Krause phoned Elgin Baylor Thursday
afternoon to assure him that he didn't start the rumor.

SHAW HAPPY TO BE STAYING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If Brian Shaw was at all unclear of his status with
the Los Angeles Lakers, he got all the reassurance he needed
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in today and I still had a number and a jersey in the
locker room, so I guess that means I'm here to stay,'' Shaw said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Shaw was just a short-term fill-in for an
injured Kobe Bryant. But when 3 p.m. passed Saturday, his contract
with the Lakers became guaranteed for the rest of the season,
effectively assuring he's here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was confident in my ability, if I had an opportunity to go
out and play, that I might be able to show at some point during the
season that I may be useful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than useful, Shaw was the first guard off the bench for the
first month of the season and has since provided occasional scoring
bursts as the Lakers' fourth guard, behind Bryant, Ron Harper and
Derek Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   He's averaging 4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 15
minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw nearly started the season unemployed after being traded
from Portland to the Houston Rockets, who waived him. Then the
Seattle Sonics brass took a pass on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just joking with a couple guys on the Seattle team,
because the week before I worked out for the Lakers, I worked out
for Seattle. So some of the guys were saying, `Now you can laugh
and rub it in their faces, because you came and worked out for
them, and they didn't sign you. Now you signed with the Lakers, and
you guys are rolling and have the best record in the league.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to be in this situation and ready to contribute
whenever I'm called on.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking out: Derek Fisher appeared to put a 2-for-30 slump
behind him Friday when he hit 4 of 10 shots for 13 points in the
Lakers' victory over the Charlotte Hornets. But he was cautious
about drawing any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a couple shots that I hadn't been making,'' he said,
``but that doesn't guarantee anything for (Saturday night) or
Monday. So I just have to take it one game at a time.''

NORTHRIDGE BEATS IDAHO STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POCATELLO, Idaho _ It's a multi-use arena in every sense, with
basketball, football and track and field going on every year for
the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But cavernous Holt Arena was built on an idea from Dubby Holt,
Idaho State's legendary athletic director who built a collegiate
boxing power in the 1950s. Fighters Ed Sanders and Spider Webb both
trained under Holt and are in the school's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, Sanders, Webb. They all would have been proud, or maybe
cringed, if they saw the pummeling the Cal State Northridge men's
basketball team laid on Idaho State on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN crushed the host Bengals 101-86 in front of a crowd of
3,562. It wasn't a close game. With few exceptions, the Matadors
dominated from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Mills Lane would have stopped this one in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning to the end, we did a good job of
controlling the basketball game,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said.
``We told our guys before the game to move the basketball, be
patient. Our guys played hard and they played smart, Northridge
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (10-3) improved to 2-0 in the Big Sky Conference and went
over the 100-point mark for the first time since March 5, 1998,
when Northridge beat Eastern Washington 104-98 in the conference
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Want statistics? Here are a few:
</P>
<P>
   __Northridge shot 67 percent from the field and missed only 16
of 48 shots. At one point in the first half, the Matadors were over
81 percent (17 of 21). Brian Heinle was the only CSUN player to
miss more than two shots, and he was still 7 of 11 and scored 17
points.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN was 11 of 17 on 3-point attempts. Andre Larry, a 6-foot-9
forward, and Heinle, a 6-10 center, were a combined 6 of 10 from
beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had defensive problems matching up with (the Matadors) to
start the ballgame,'' ISU coach Doug Oliver said. ``They just got
the feel and chucked it in.''
</P>
<P>
   __Every player who made the trip scored except for reserve guard
Denny Ogden. Six had more than 10 points. Guard Marco McCain came
off the bench to score a team-high 19 in just 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight you guys saw the real Marco McCain,'' Braswell said of
the junior who had played sparingly in the first 12 games despite
being a top-notch JC recruit out of Cerritos College.
</P>
<P>
   __Eight CSUN players had assists, led by point guard Markus
Carr's six. Carr also had two blocks and three steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Division I players get open looks,'' Carr said, ``and there's
a good chance (the ball) is going to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   It was ridiculous, the way the Matadors made the first 20
minutes look like a shoot-around _ and they didn't even practice on
this court on Friday. CSUN was shoved into Reed Gym, a cramped
on-campus court, for its practice Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was there the seeds of this rout were planted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all focused in practice,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we practice well, we tend to play well,'' Braswell said.
``... The guys just felt comfortable. Everybody gave something.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Lionel Benjamin, a freshman reserve forward, gave the
Matadors a pick-up in the first half when he had a tip-in off a
rare missed shot that pushed the lead to 54-33.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals never cut the lead below double-digits beyond the
10-minute mark _ of the first half. The closest they came was 12,
the last coming on Ammer Johnson's 3-pointer with 6{ minutes left
that made it 86-74.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had 19 for ISU, which dropped to 0-2 in the Big Sky and
5-8 overall. Kevin Sweetwyne, a senior guard who averaged 24 points
in the Bengals' two games against CSUN last year, had a game-high
23. But he missed 12 of 18 shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played four games at home,'' Heinle said, referring to
CSUN's recent 4-0 stint at Matador Gym, ``and that was our comfort
zone. It's really easy to come out lackadaisical on the road. We
didn't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's next game is Thursday at Portland State. The Pilots are
0-1, 8-5.

LAKERS' STREAK CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ From the unpredictable to the impossible, The Streak
that refused to die made it to its 14th anniversary Saturday night,
and the Seattle SuperSonics graciously played host for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Last one out, turn out the lights on the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers ran their winning streak to 14 games with
a 110-100 victory over the Sonics at KeyArena _ and as if that
weren't impressive enough, they reached the new plateau with their
greatest comeback of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Down 19 points early in the second half, up 20 by late in the
fourth. Only NASDAQ has had greater momentum swings this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say about that game,'' said coach Phil
Jackson. ``It's just two halves in a ballgame.... We came in the
locker room (at halftime) and said, thank god there are two halves
to a game and we can make some adjustments and come back out and
play some defense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some defense'' turned into a stifling attack that held the
Sonics who scored 66 in the first half _ to 12 points in the third
and just 34 in the second half. Just as impressive was the offense,
as Glen Rice, playing hero for the second straight night, scored 15
points in the third and finished with 24 points, two steals and
three rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant added a shooting touch to his acrobatics, making his
first five 3-point tries of the night to lead the Lakers with 31
points, six rebounds and three steals. Shaquille O'Neal battled
through foul trouble but finished with 23 points, nine rebounds and
a team-high six assists.
</P>
<P>
   It all made for an amazing comeback-to-back weekend. The Lakers
overcame a 13-point deficit Friday to beat the Charlotte Hornets in
what was,at the time, their biggest come-from-behind win of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers, an NBA-best 29-5, aren't just piling up wins
anymore. They're picking up style points for winning every way
imaginable, adopting the second-half surge as their latest fashion
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot,'' Rice said. ``It shows that this team has the
will, has the character, to be able to come out of a difficult
situation and come out on top and win a ballgame. It also shows we
have a panic button,but yet we still we go out there and we keep it
under control.''
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yeah, did we mention the Lakers are on pace for 70 wins?
</P>
<P>
   The way they played the second half, that figure is getting
harder to scoff at.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers down 70-51 early in the third, Bryant settled
down and got the offense into a rhythm, helping Rice start the
comeback with an eight-point burst. Minutes later, the Lakers had
completed a 21-2 run that tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then O'Neal, who had difficulty exploiting his size advantage
against the center-less Sonics, picked up his fifth foul with 3:09
left in the quarter. No matter. The Lakers' unsung bench picked it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry hit a jumper, Derek Fisher followed with another,
A.C. Green pitched in a bucket and then Fisher _ who recently
suffered a 2-for-30 stretch _ hit a 3-pointer to close out the
quarter and give the Lakers an 83-78 lead heading into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good for the guys to play without me sometimes,''
O'Neal said. ``They responded well.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who also opened the fourth with a 3-pointer, led the
bench effort with eight points, all in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   A stunned Sonics squad, led by Vin Baker's 31 points, never
responded. And by the time Bryant hit an 18-footer over Ruben
Patterson (the self-proclaimed ``Kobe stopper'') for a 13-point
lead, then jogged off the floor tapping his heart, it was clear the
Lakers would not let up.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, who scored 19 in the first half, managed just two in
the second. Gary Payton, guarded mostly by Bryant, got just six
points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big for us,'' Bryant said. ``It's a confidence-booster.
You get in situations like this again, you have confidence that you
can come back and win. The game (Friday) night, even though it was
a tough game for us, that gave us a lot of confidence coming into
this evening, because we were playing bad, but we weren't playing
worse than we were last night.''

AUTOS SHOWCASED AT CONVENTION CENTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Harrison Sheppard  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- They gawked and pointed, kicked tires and popped
hoods. The first day of the Los Angeles Auto Show drew fans from
all over Southern California to get a first look at the cars,
trucks and sports vehicles of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The annual extravaganza at the Los Angeles Convention Center,
which typically draws 100,000, presented the debut of nearly three
dozen new concept and mass production cars, some of which defy
categorization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a truck or a car?'' asked Benny Blanco, a 31-year-old
Bronx, N.Y., man in Los Angeles visiting some friends. ``It looks
like a truck. I think it's awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   He was one of many crowded around Honda's concept sports
car/pickup truck hybrid, the Spocket. Some were overheard
mispronouncing it `'Sprockets'' and making jokes about the
``Saturday Night Live'' skit of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   From the front, the glistening red-and-silver vehicle seemed
like a futuristic sports car. From the rear, it looked almost like
an El Camino.
</P>
<P>
   Auto Show general manager Andy Fuzesi said he was happy with the
show's opening, especially with the number of auto makers choosing
to debut new cars in Los Angeles, and said there didn't seem to be
any logistical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep looking around, like it's going too good, something's
going to happen here,'' Fuzesi joked.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles were a popular draw, although people were
divided on the latest bigger-is-better trend evidenced by Ford's
enormous new Excursion, which seems more like a semi than a
personal vehicle.

   ``I think it's huge,'' said Chris Meuschke, 28, of Castaic. ``I
don't like them this big. How are you gonna park this thing? You
can't even get it in the garage.''

<P>
   But Isiah Conrad Jr. of Palmdale and his son, Isiah, were
admiring the Excursion. He was thinking of trading in his Suburban
for one, he said.

MCCAIN WROTE LETTERS ON BEHALF OF DONORS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John McCain raised about $80,000 from
broadcast and telecommunications companies in four instances
shortly before or soon after he interceded on their behalf with
federal regulators in 1998 and 1999, according to campaign records
reviewed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides released about 500 letters that McCain has written as
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee since 1997, with little
evidence that many of them had involved major contributors to his
campaign. And McCain, who was campaigning in South Carolina
Saturday, said his only interest was to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But in several cases, according to federal campaign finance
records that were matched against the letters, the correspondence
to the Federal Communications Commission, which his committee
oversees, coincided with substantial fund-raising efforts by the
companies that stood to benefit from his letters.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, officials of BellSouth Corp. donated $16,750 to the
Arizona senator at a fund-raiser on May 6, 1998. Four months later,
McCain asked the FCC in a letter to give ``serious consideration''
to allowing BellSouth to enter the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain has long favored the so-called Baby Bells, he
also wrote to the FCC on behalf of AT&AMP;T, Sprint, and MCI Worldcom
in June 1998. Two weeks later, Sprint officers donated $2,000. In
October, 1998, McCain raised another $25,800 from AT&AMP;T officials at
a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has built his campaign around denunciations of
special interest money and power in Washington, was put on the
defensive last week, when The Boston Globe reported that he
interceded last month with the FCC on behalf of Paxson
Communications, which owns or operates 73 television stations.
McCain's letter-writing began soon after the company helped him
raise $20,000, and in a period when he was using Paxson's corporate
jet.
</P>
<P>
   After the report last week, McCain canceled a fund-raiser that
Paxson's chairman, Lowell Paxson, was to have held for him Saturday
in Florida, an event that had been expected to raise $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe also reported last week that McCain last May rebuked
the FCC for bias against two Baby Bells, SBC Communications and
Ameritech, which were seeking FCC permission to merge. Just before
that May 12 letter, officials of the two companies contributed or
solicited donations of about $120,000 to McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The letters made public Saturday also include an April 1999
letter McCain wrote to the FCC on Ameritech. That was just after
the company's chairman at the time, Richard Notebaert, a friend of
McCain's, cohosted a Chicago fund-raiser for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, the McCain campaign's communications director,
acknowledged Saturday that McCain's contributors get access to him,
but not preferential treatment. ``Big- money contributors to both
parties get access that other people don't,'' Schnur said. But, he
said, McCain ``and the people who work for him do their level best
to make sure those contributors are not given different
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, McCain has criticized the campaign finance
system, saying that it leaves influential lawmakers like himself
beholden to business interests that provide the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain has said he too is a victim of the system, his
rhetoric often suggests that he himself has been scrupulous in not
taking actions that benefit campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign records examined Saturday include funds that McCain
raised for his presidential campaign during the first three
quarters of 1999, and funds donated to his 1998 Senate reelection
camapaign. In 1998, McCain faced only token opposition, and was
able to transfer about half the $4 million he raised to his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of BellSouth are among his largest contributors. In
1999 officials of BellSouth, a regional Bell operating company,
have contributed nearly $30,000 to McCain's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth wanted entry into the lucrative long-distance
business, and petitioned the FCC to that end. The FCC was then
required to judge whether there was enough competition in the local
market to warrant their entry into long distance. McCain wrote two
letters _ one on March 6, 1998, and the other on Sept. 15, 1998 _
arguing that wireless service should be taken into account as
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The $16,750 fund-raising event was on May 6, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the September letter, McCain said: ``I encourage you to give
serious consideration to whether PCS is providing competition to
the local exchange market.'' He said the FCC ``should be focused on
implementing the Telecommunications Act to encourage competition,
not maintain the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote to the commission to express his view as to the
law,'' said Mark Buse, the Commerce Committee staff director. ``The
FCC ignored this, and denied BellSouth's petition in 1998 to get
into the long-distance business.''
</P>
<P>
   Echostar chairman Charles W. Ergen has long sought permission to
broadcast the network affiliate programming into homes. But the
company was stymied by a 1998 court case. McCain wrote a letter on
Aug. 19, 1998, to the FCC chairman, William E. Kennard, in order to
``raise our concerns'' over the case.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wrote that the case _ which led to a ruling in favor of
the networks and against the satellite companies _ ``threatens to
undermine the progress we have made in promoting competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard replied that he essentially agreed. Correspondence led
to the Satellite Home Viewers Act, passed last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Echostar and DirecTV did both come in and meet the chairman,''
Buse said. ``They did not ask him to do anything specific.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and its major long-distance competitors had a far different
concern, according to Buse _ the so-called ``Gore tax'' on
long-distance carriers. The money goes to the installation of the
Internet in classrooms and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   The big three long-distance carriers wanted to be able to
itemize this tax on phone bills, so customers would know this was a
federal imposition rather than a rate increase by the phone
companies. The FCC wanted the companies to bury the tax in the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wrote a letter on June 2, 1998, on behalf of the
long-distance carriers arguing that ``consumers have an absolute
right to know how much their bills are going up and why their bills
are going up.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Buse said, ``None of these companies came to us on this
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the amount of the tax was lower than people had
expected. But most companies are still unable to itemize it the way
they had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T fund-raiser was held on Oct. 13, 1998. It netted
McCain's campaign $25,800.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has consistently said, as he did again Saturday, that his
only goal has been to prod the FCC, which often moves slowly, to
take action. And he has also insisted that there has been no
connection between the fund-raising and any action he has taken as
the Commerce Committee chairman.

KREMLIN PLAYS DOWN MILITARY SHAKEUP
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Insisting nothing has changed in its military campaign
against separatist rebels, the Kremlin Saturday played down a
shakeup among its top field generals in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Acting President Vladimir V. Putin also cited concern for
civilians and the weekend's Orthodox Christian and Muslim holidays
as reasons for the announcement Friday of a temporary halt in the
bombardment of Chechnya's capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the announcement, television stations in Russia reported
fighting and artillery strikes Saturday on the outskirts of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   As officials scrambled to explain away the command shakeup,
military analysts said the reason was simple: Russian forces have
lost the initiative to the outnumbered but determined Chechen
rebels. After easily winning control of northern Chechnya, Russian
forces have been bogged down for weeks on the outskirts of Grozny
and desperately need to regroup, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin told reporters the removal Friday of his top two generals
in Chechnya _ Lieutenant General Gennady Troshev, who commanded
forces in eastern Chechnya, and Major General Vladimir Shamanov,
who led troops on the west _ was not a reflection on their
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia doesn't throw away such generals as Troshev and
Shamanov. There has been no replacement and no replacement has been
planned. It is a technical question,'' Putin said early Saturday
morning after leaving an Orthodox Christmas Divine Liturgy. He gave
no further details.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's statement went against the Defense Ministry announcement
naming new leaders. Troshev's replacement, Sergei Makarov, told NTV
television that Troshev had been given a promotion and would serve
as deputy head of the Northern Caucasus military district.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also offered various reasons for the bombing halt,
including respect for the Orthodox Christmas and for Muslims who
were celebrating the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. Another
reason, according to Putin, was concern for the civilians trapped
in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not forget that and we will respect the feelings of
believers,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin leader also repeated accusations that Chechen rebels
had blown up containers of toxic chemicals as a means of defense.
Putin said that in such circumstances, artillery attacks and
airstrikes against Grozny ``are not safe for the civilian
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based defense analyst, said Russia's
bombing pause was unrelated to humanitarian or religious concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian forces are losing the initiative and the Chechens
are effectively counterattacking. Russian troops are bogged down
and the reserves are depleted, and they need to regroup,''
Felgenhauer said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that while the rotation of field generals is often
routine, the timing of the reshuffle, made after Russian troops
have been stuck in Grozny's outskirts for weeks, looked suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the situation is due to the bad work of the generals
in the field, who have split the troops into many small units that
cannot help each other,'' Felgenhauer said, adding that the shakeup
may be a prelude to a change in tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin launched its military assault on Chechnya in late
September after a series of apartment bombings that killed hundreds
of people in Russian cities. Authorities blamed Chechen rebels for
the bombings. The rebels contend they were not involved in the
attacks.

GORE, BRADLEY DEBATE HEALTH CARE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Vice President Al Gore raised questions about Bill
Bradley's health care plan and commitment to farmers, while the
former New Jersey senator accused his rival of repeated
misrepresentations during their debate here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While the pair largely covered ground they plowed earlier in
their race for the Democratic presidential nomination, there were
moments of sharp repartee involving some of Bradley's votes in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued to press for twice-weekly debates in exchange for
an agreement not to use TV commercials. And focusing on a key issue
for Iowans as they head into the state's Jan. 24 caucuses, Gore
said, ``I think we ought to come back to Iowa and have a debate on
farm policy.'' Bradley dismissed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also renewed his attacks on Bradley's health
care proposal, claiming the plan would not only cancel Medicaid,
but make Medicare insolvent by denying government surpluses to the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``A slight misrepresentation,'' Bradley said, explaining that
under his program, Medicaid would be replaced with ``something
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded by calling Bradley's plan ``a little old
$150-a-month HMO voucher'' that would be insufficient for coverage
in Iowa. He presented the moderator, Des Moines Register Editor
Dennis Ryerson, with a list of Iowa health programs and invited the
newspaper to check out his charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, you're misrepresenting,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bradley's approach to Medicare reminded him ``of the
guy who fell off a 10-floor building, and as he passed the fifth
floor, he shouted: `So far, so good!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley used his rebuttal time on a question regarding farm
issues to return to the Medicare debate, rejecting Gore's
assertions. ``For 18 years in the United States Senate I fought to
protect Medicare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the tenacity of a courtroom prosecutor, Gore also used
sympathetic spectators in the audience as props to try to keep
Bradley off balance. At one point, the vice president called on an
Iowa farmer to stand up as Gore described a 1993 flood that
inundated the man's land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you oppose disaster relief?'' Gore asked Bradley, who
served in the Senate at the time of a vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ignored the question. ``This is not about the past, but
about the future,'' he told Gore, and suggested that Iowa farmers
suffered from the failed agricultural policies of the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   It was a point Bradley returned to in his closing remarks, when
he adapted a question used by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 campaign
against Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al's been hammering me on my agriculture votes 15 years ago,''
Bradley said. ``But I would simply ask the family farmers of Iowa
today, are you better off than you were seven years ago? Or do we
need a change? Do we need to take a step to make things happen?''
</P>
<P>
   From his opening remarks, Gore was the aggressor. He recalled
that Bradley had accused him of holing up in a ``Washington
bunker'' during their debate in New Hampshire Wednesday. Rather
than working in siege conditions, Gore said, he and ``other
Democrats'' had been laboring to create 20 million new jobs, win
passage of major gun control legislation, and sustain a booming
economy. ``That's a front line in the fight for the future,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After being put on the defensive for the first half of the
hour-long debate, Bradley began to counterattack. In response to a
question involving national security, he said the Clinton-Gore
administration had failed to press for a reduction in the number of
nuclear weapons held by the US and the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also charged that Gore wanted to use the budget surplus
``to spend another $120 billion on the military and less than that
on education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not right,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he was ``proud to have the support of
the Iowa teachers,'' whose statewide organization has endorsed his
candidacy. He introduced another spectator, a teacher, and said,
``She needs help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his education program would ``start at birth and
extend for a lifetime.'' He vowed to double the Head Start program,
add 600,000 ``great new teachers'' to the public schools, and
invest in community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also exchanged implicit barbs aimed at each
other's backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   At least three times, Gore mentioned that he was a Vietnam
veteran. Bradley served in the Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradley described himself as the product of a
small Missouri town. His father had been a banker ``who never
foreclosed on a single home.'' His mother was a public school
teacher, Bradley said, while he attended public schools. Gore, the
son of a US senator, attended an exclusive prep school in
Washington.

SURVEY FINDS BOTH RACES TIGHT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senator John McCain's surge among likely Republican primary
voters in New Hampshire appears to have stalled, amid evidence that
his reformist image has been harmed by disclosures that he
interceded with federal regulators on behalf of a major campaign
donor, according to a new Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which sampled opinion among both Republicans and
Democrats, found that candidates in both races are deadlocked
barely three weeks before the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the polling indicates volatility in both; 40 percent
of likely GOP voters and a third of Democratic primary voters who
expressed a preference said they are not yet sure of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican contest, the survey found that two major
positions the six GOP candidates have embraced have little
resonance with voters: Although all the candidates say they oppose
abortion, and some highlight that position, a plurality, 43
percent, of likely GOP voters say they support a right to an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The same sentiment seemed to hold true on taxes: A plurality of
Republican primary voters _ and an overwhelming majority of
Democratic primary voters _ would prefer to use the surplus for
programs such as health and education than to use most of the funds
to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The separate polls, each of 400 likely voters, were taken
Wednesday through Friday for the Democratic contest, and Thursday
and Friday for the GOP primary. For each sample, the interviewing
was done after the debates were held last week in Durham, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The polling was done for the Globe and WBZ-TV by KRC
Communications Research. The margin of error is plus or minus five
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Both contests are deadlocked, although the views of voters on a
number of issues might be worrisome for McCain and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic contest, 44 percent voiced a preference for
each candidate, with 11 percent undecided. A month ago, in a poll
by KRC, it was similarly locked up, at 43 percent apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Among the GOP primary voters, 35 percent said they plan to vote
for McCain, while 32 percent favored George W. Bush, the Texas
governor. Running a distant third, with 14 percent, was publisher
Steve Forbes. Among the remaining candidates, Alan Keyes, the
former diplomat, had 5 percent, Gary Bauer had 2 percent and
Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah had 1 percent. When KRC polled GOP
primary voters on Dec. 15 and 16, the numbers were almost the same:
37 percent for McCain, 33 percent for Bush and 13 percent for
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   That poll showed strong gains for McCain, and slippage for Bush.
In November, Bush led McCain by 45 percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the poll suggests that McCain's gain in
popularity since November has leveled off. Meanwhile, voter doubts
seemed to have eased about whether Bush is qualified to be
president. And Bush was viewed as the strongest nominee his party
could field in November.
</P>
<P>
   When the GOP voters were asked whether McCain and Bush have the
experience and judgment necessary to be president, the two
front-running Republicans scored evenly. McCain had a slight edge,
35 percent to 30 percent, when voters were asked which of the two
has the leadership qualities they would most want to see in their
president.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the poll, doubts about McCain seemed to have
increased. And the change appeared to have been related to the
finding last week that McCain, whose campaign against powerful
special interests has resonated in New Hampshire, had interceded
with the Federal Communications Commission on behalf of business
interests that have made contributions to his campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Among those polled, 65 percent said they were aware of the
controversy. And among them, 17 percent said the disclosure had
made them less likely to vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 76 percent of likely voters expressed a favorable
view of McCain, and just 10 percent viewed him unfavorably. Last
week, those figures were at 65 percent and 15 percent. Bush's
favorability/unfavorability numbers have remained steady, at 64
percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the sampling, Bush's underlying numbers have
improved. Last month, when GOP primary voters were asked which of
the two men would make the better standard bearer against the
eventual Democratic nominee, Bush was the choice, 49 percent to 27
percent. Last week that figure was 56 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the GOP poll, 57 percent said they were sure of their choice,
while 40 percent said it was too early.Among Bush supporters, 67
percent said they were certain to stay with their candidate; 57
percent of McCain supporters said the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic survey, 66 percent said they are sure of their
preference, while 32 percent said it is too early to say for
certain that they will stay with their preference. Neither
candidate has an advantage on that question.
</P>
<P>
   Among likely Democratic primary voters, 85 percent said they are
very concerned about the cost of health care. And with HMOs in New
England suffering catastrophic losses, 77 percent said they were
very concerned about the availability of health care.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though Bradley has offered the more comprehensive plan
to cover those with no insurance or little coverage, Gore's attacks
on the details of Bradley's plan seemed to have taken a toll: Asked
which would do the better job of making affordable health care
available to all Americans, the voters chose Gore, by 39 percent to
32 percent. Respondents also gave Gore an advantage when asked who
had the background to be president.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to which of the two would be the stronger
general election candidate, Democrats and Independents who plan to
vote in the Democratic primary gave Gore a substantial edge, by 55
percent to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The polling also found that the debates last week had little
impact. Nor, it seemed, did the week's endorsements. Elizabeth
Dole, who abandoned the GOP race for want to money, endorsed Bush.
For the the vast majority of Republican voters, the endorsement had
no effect.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's endorsement of
Gore had no impact on 75 percent of voters, although 14 percent
said Kennedy's backing of Gore had made it more likely that they
would back the vice president; 7 percent said Kennedy's blessing
had made them less likely to vote for Gore.

NACKEY LOEB, 75; WAS PUBLISHER OF THE UNION LEADER NEWSPAPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A legendary chapter in American journalism came to a close
Saturday with the death of Nackey Scripps Loeb, the retired
publisher of The Union Leader and New Hampshire Sunday News. She
was 75.
</P>
<P>
   For more than half a century, Mrs. Loeb and her husband,
William, ran the Union Leader and used its biting front-page
editorials to crown or destroy presidential candidacies, promote
conservative policies, and oppose all attempts to adopt a
broad-based tax in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the end of an incredible, colorful era,'' said Thomas
Rath, a former New Hampshire attorney general and prominent
Republican Party operative.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Loeb died at her Goffstown home, her newspaper said. She
had run the Union Leader and its New Hampshire Sunday News from the
time her husband died in 1981 until her retirement last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very bright, courageous and with conviction. She had
great impact on the political process, not only in New Hampshire
but all over the country,'' said Executive Councilor Ruth Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither Mrs. Loeb nor her paper ever abandoned her
conservative principles, she is credited with making the Union
Leader a more refined and professional newspaper during her years
as publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely thought her effect on the paper was to moderate
its harshness,'' said Michael Pride, editor of the Concord Monitor.
``While the paper retained its really strong views, it did so in a
less bombastic way under her leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union Leader's influence has diminished somewhat in recent
years, with the rise of Manchester's television station, WMUR-TV.
But it remained the state's biggest newspaper, with a circulation
of about 63,000 on weekdays and 85,000 on Sunday, and continued to
play a role as kingmaker in Republican Party politics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Mrs. Loeb's endorsement of Pat Buchanan helped him
claim an upset victory in the state's storied presidential primary
over Senator Bob Dole. Buchanan called her his political
``godmother.'' She was a longstanding irritant to the presidential
campaigns of former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't want someone who is either so stupid or so
dishonest as president of the United States,'' Mrs. Loeb wrote,
when Bush was still vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush said Saturday that while he and
Mrs. Loeb ``did not always agree, her opinions and influence always
helped shape the politics and the independent spirit of the state
of New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Union Leader settled on a candidate, it trumpeted that
person's virtues in comprehensive coverage, editorial cartoons, and
trademark front-page signed editorials, often adorned in red, white
and blue. Though the practice has ebbed in recent years, the Loebs'
ardor was usually reflected in their newspaper's news stories as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``God Has Chosen Reagan To Lead The Country,'' read the
front-page headline on one ``analysis'' in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mrs. Loeb's prose could certainly be piquant, she never
matched the slashing, wild screeds of husband Bill, a bullying
right-wing character who bought the newspaper in 1946 and put it on
the map in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Loeb called the Rev. Martin Luther King ``a pious, pompous
fraud.'' Robert F. Kennedy was ``vicious and most dangerous.''
President Gerald Ford was ``Jerry the Jerk.'' Nelson Rockefeller
was the ``wife swapper.'' President Dwight Eisenhower was ``Dopey
Dwight.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 the Union Leader's vitriolic editorials, and its
influential role in US politics, came together in one historic
afternoon. Senator Edmund Muskie, the front-runner for the
Democratic presidential nomination, was enraged by Loeb's critiques
of Mrs. Muskie and staged a news conference at the newspaper's
door.
</P>
<P>
   Lashing back at Loeb in the midst of a sleet storm, Muskie was
overwhelmed with emotion. He called Loeb a ``gutless coward,'' but
his voice quavered and some reporters thought the senator had
cried, an assertion Muskie later denied. The episode helped doom
his presidential hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The Loebs' most lasting and important legacy may be their long
opposition to broad-based taxes, said Pride. Any candidate for
governor in the state had to take ``the pledge,'' promising not to
enact a state income tax or sales tax, or earn the vilification of
the Union Leader.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge fit well with New Hampshire's libertarian ``live free
or die'' ethos, but the state's reliance on local property taxes
has left disparities in the quality of education offered by wealthy
and poor communities. Attempts to resolve the problem have
dominated the state's politics for the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Loeb, an heiress to the Scripps-Howard newspaper fortune,
was partially paralyzed and needed to use a wheelchair after a 1977
car accident. Her stewardship of the newspaper began soon
thereafter, as she began to play a leading role during her
husband's final illness.
</P>
<P>
   Former governor Meldrim Thomson, the Loebs' political ally,
said, ``Her determination in the face of her physical problem has
been of special significance to me these last few years. She was a
courageous lady and a dear friend and we shall miss her.''

 &HT;    Retailers look to hook buyers with January bargains
 &HT;    By Brian Stevens
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Looking for bargains this winter? Traditional
seasonal sales abound as retailers look to lure back shoppers with
exhausted credit cards and exhausted spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do see household items _ whites, linens and towels _ on
sale,'' said Wright State University assistant professor of
marketing Chuck Gulas.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales typically occur in January after the holiday buying
blitz of November and December, Gulas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holiday credit card bills are coming due and people realize
they can't spend as much,'' Gulas said, leading retailers to use
winter sales as a draw for mall-weary post-holiday shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Brown, operations manager at Waccamaw's Homeplace in
Centerville, said the store's annual winter white sale always
brings in shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new year and people are looking for a fresh look. They
want something to take them through the winter doldrums,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gulas said after-Christmas advertising is often driven by the
winter blahs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are indoors, they're looking at things in the house _
getting organized and maybe looking to lose a few pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at the Sunday newspaper ad circulars proves Gulas' point:
The copy tells shoppers it's ``time to get organized'' with sales
on closet organizers, ``store it in style'' with heavy-duty plastic
containers, offers discounts on treadmills and a ``towel continuity
sale.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gulas said customers are drawn out by the discounts and
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Tabatabaie, a local shopper, said she hit the stores the
day after Christmas, ``knowing there's probably a sale this time of
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulas said savvy consumers can employ a ``shopping strategy,''
using the technology of the Internet to search for bargains at
traditional ``brick and mortar'' stores.
</P>
<P>
   Surf store Web sites and ``get a feel for price and selection''
before you head out to buy, Gulas said. While Internet commerce
accounts for only a fraction of retail sales, Gulas said the
technology is ``changing the whole face of retailing. Consumers
expect bargains on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for sales on big-ticket items like televisions and
electronics as the Super Bowl draws near, Gulas said.
</P>
<P>
   One full-color electronics store advertisement promised
``guaranteed delivery before Tuesday's big game'' on a 60-inch
projection television, and 10 others were for sale _ all tuned to
football games.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what your shopping fancy, Tabatabaie has this advice:
``Never pay full price.''
</P>
<P>
   HOT DEALS, COLD SHOPPERS
</P>
<P>
   Looking for bargains? Here are some ideas to get you started on
post-holiday sales shopping:
</P>
<P>
   _ Take advantage of big after-holiday markdowns and clearances
by shopping for wrapping paper, holiday cards and seasonal
decorations now.
</P>
<P>
   _ Plan ahead. Impulse buying never pays. Set a realistic budget
and stick to it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Compare prices and shop carefully. Post-holiday sales
sometimes aren't the bargains they appear to be.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before buying anything _ especially sale items _ ask about the
store's refund and exchange policy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be aware of your shopping mood. Don't let a case of winter
blues blow your budget on a shopping binge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use store coupons. Even the larger department stores
occasionally offer coupons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wait for a sale. If you don't absolutely need it now, waiting
may pay off.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: HISTORY LESSONS FROM THE SLAVES OF NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to replace word `those' with word `women' in 8th graf, 3rd
sentence. This editorial first moved on Saturday, Jan. 8.)  
(js) 
 By BRENT STAPLES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While New Yorkers celebrated a new century, a team of biological
anthropologists at Howard University in Washington were intensely
focused on a most grisly aspect of New York City's past. Led by Dr.
Michael Blakey, the team has spent several years examining the
skeletal remains of more than 400 African slaves whose graves were
accidentally uncovered during the construction of a federal office
tower in lower Manhattan nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That the graves existed at all surprised New Yorkers who grew up
believing that theirs was a ``free'' state where there had never
been slavery. But a series of reports from the Blakey team _ the
first due out early this year _ will present statistics to show
that colonial New York was just as dependent on slavery as many
Southern cities, and in some cases even more so. In addition, the
brutality etched on these skeletons easily matches the worst of
what we know of slavery in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The first slave ship that sailed into Jamestown Harbor in
Virginia in 1619 contained a handful of captive Africans. But by
the end of the Atlantic slave trade more than two centuries later,
somewhere between 8 million and 12 million Africans had arrived in
the New World in chains. The historian Ira Berlin, author of ``Many
Thousands Gone,'' estimates that one slave perished for every one
who survived capture in the African interior and made it alive to
the New World _ meaning that as many as 12 million more captive
Africans perished along the way.
</P>
<P>
   During the 16th century, the massive outflow of slaves decimated
countries like the Kingdom of the Kongo, whose monarch, King
Affonso I, wrote letter after letter imploring King Joao III of
Portugal to cease the slave trade because it was generating
``depravity ... so widespread that our land is entirely
depopulated.'' He said that ``a monstrous greed pushes our
subjects, even Christians, to seize members of their own families,
and of ours, to do business by selling them as captives.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the stolen Africans ended up in the United States, some
of them in the Dutch colonial city of New Amsterdam, which later
became New York City. The Dutch recruited settlers with an
advertisement that promised to provide them with slaves who ``would
accomplish more work for their masters, at less expense than
(white) farm servants, who must be bribed to go thither by a great
deal of money and promises.'' Integral to the colony from the
start, slaves helped build Trinity Church, the streets of the city
and the wall _ from which Wall Street takes its name _ that
protected the colony from military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In life, slaves lived in attics, hallways and beneath porches,
cheek to jowl with their masters and mistresses. In death, these
same slaves were banished to the Negro Burial Ground, which lay a
mile outside the city limits and contained between 10,000 and
20,000 bodies by the time it was closed in 1794, according to the
historian Dr. Sherrill Wilson. The graveyard was paved over, built
upon and forgotten _ until 1991, when the General Services
Administration excavated the foundation for a new tower. After
protests from black New Yorkers, the agency agreed to finance
research on the skeletons, but failed to budget the necessary money
and generally dragged its feet, putting one of the most important
archaeological projects of the century years behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Howard team has yet to identify among the skeletons the many
Africans who are known to have been burned at the stake during the
rebellion-plot hysteria that swept the colony in 1741. But what the
researchers have found is brutal enough on its own. Of the 400
skeletons taken to Howard, about 40 percent are of children under
the age of 15, and the most common cause of death was malnutrition.
Most of the children had rickets, scurvy, anemia or related
diseases. About twice as many infant girls seem to have died as
boys, suggesting at least some infanticide. As Blakey said, ``Women
who gave birth in these conditions knew that they were bringing
their children into hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The adult skeletons show that many of these people died of
unrelenting hard labor. Strain on the muscles and ligaments was so
extreme that muscle attachments were commonly ripped away from the
skeleton _ taking chunks of bone with them _ leaving the body in
perpetual pain. The highest mortality rate is found among women
ages 15 to 20. Blakey has concluded that some died of illnesses
acquired in the holds of slave ships or from a first exposure to
the cold _ or from the trauma of being torn from their families and
shipped in chains halfway around the globe. But in many cases, he
said, ``what we see is that these women were worked to death by
owners who could simply go out and buy a new slave.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blakey team will conduct two sets of studies in an attempt
to determine more closely where the slaves where born. One study
will analyze tooth enamel for trace minerals that would mark the
captives as having grown up in Africa, the Caribbean or in North
America. If DNA research proceeds as planned, it will further pin
down the country of origin by comparing the dead with known
populations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The skeletons will be returned to their graves by 2002. By then
the burial ground will have rewritten the book on slavery in New
York and given historians something to talk about well into the
next century.

   SOLDIER-DEATH (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Somewhere amid a long ordeal
of grief for her murdered son, it dawned on Patricia Kutteles that
she will never be done with the U.S. Army, where her son found a
home that proved his undoing and left her a cause she pursues now
as his only true memorial. ``I realized it won't ever end `til I
die,'' Mrs. Kutteles said of her struggle to absorb, first, the

programs that help poor, minority children to attend the schools of

the growing acceptance of for-profit ventures in education. Now
they are going further. Their aim is nothing less than to overhaul
the nation's system of public education. To do so, they want to

NEW TRADEMARK POLICY PROVIDES MORE WEAPONS TO DEFEND INTERNET
DOMAIN NAMES 
SCRIPTURE AT THE TAP OF A FEW KEYS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A larger arsenal of trademarks is now available to anyone
striving to prove that someone else has appropriated their property
for the domain name of an Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of domain-name registrations have sparked rival claims
of ownership, and the value of well-known names has led to
cybersquatting, the registration of names in hopes of selling them
to the highest bidder. To ease the burden of proving ownership, and
to thwart cybersquatting, the group that issues domain
registrations began a new policy last week for resolving disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers, added state and common law trademarks to the federally
registered trademarks that already qualify as precedent for
determining ownership of a domain name.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded trademark databases were added to a policy from
August 1994, which gave federal trademark owners the right to
prevent anyone from using their trademarks in a domain name. Now,
anyone registering a domain name will not be required to search the
trademark data bases of all 50 states. But if a dispute arises, a
trademark registration will settle the issue in favor of the
trademark holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trademark search is not required, but it's certainly the
best business practice,'' Lynn Tellefsen, marketing director for
MicroPatent, a patent and trademark research company, said. ``I
think of it as an insurance policy. You want to see if there any
marks close to yours, who the owners are, where they are, what
they're using them for. Otherwise you may get into a situation
where you're powerless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an infringing domain name, and someone can produce
a valid state trademark registration, they can stop the person from
using the domain name,'' she said. ``That was true in the past only
on the federal level. And now that it's extended to the states, it
will increase the number of trademarks that are active.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would be difficult for a domain-name holder to research
existing state and common law trademarks without help. The
trademark database at the Patent and Trademark Office contains only
federal trademarks, and at its World Wide Web site, the agency
warns that the database is incomplete; it does not contain
applications or registrations that are temporarily inactive.
Additionally, many states have conflicting methods for keeping
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically, you could make telephone calls to all of the
states, or try and physically go to all the states and check the
records,'' Ms. Tellefsen said. ``But the records are haphazard.
There's no uniform search system for the state trademark files. The
amount of information is different within the states: some states
retain certain information, some don't, some states maintain clean
renewal information, some don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative is to pay commercial trademark databases like
MicroPatent, Thompson &AMP; Thompson, or Trademark Research.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy also states that until a domain-name dispute is
resolved, the Internet address in question will remain active.
</P>
<P>
   ``DomainMagistrate.com will supposedly have capability to
resolve disputes within 57 days,'' Ms. Tellefsen added.
DomainMagistrate is an online dispute resolution service offered by
Network Solutions, the oldest and largest domain registrar. ``But
knowing what I know about the history of whole issue,'' she said,
``I'll be really surprised if they can get them resolved within 57
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Scripture at the Tap Of a Few Keys
</P>
<P>
   Typically, personal digital assistants are electronic organizers
for cataloging address books, memos, calendars and to-do lists. But
if your to-do list includes looking up Biblical references, then a
hand-held electronic device that will seek and even narrate Old and
New Testament verses may be faster than turning pages of a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   A user of the device would still need to know something about
Scripture, though. The device, invented by Rainer Oehm, can locate
a particular verse from among more than 31,000 in the Bible _ but
only after a user punches three keys on its keyboard to identify
what he is looking for. That requires knowing which book of the
Bible is involved.
</P>
<P>
   The device has 66 keys, each one representing a biblical book,
with Genesis being the first key and Revelations the last. Chapter
and verse numbers also share the keys. When a user inputs a
request, the device regards ``the first keystroke as Bible book and
the subsequent keystrokes as Bible chapters and/or verses,'' Oehm
writes in his patent.
</P>
<P>
   He says his device requires three key punches to retrieve a
passage, greatly reducing the time it takes to look up a passage in
a printed bible or to type the entire name of a passage on a
traditional keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``After about three seconds, the verse can be heard by means of
a built-in speaker, an earphone or a loudspeaker, thus providing an
exact pronunciation of Bible names and terms,'' Oehm writes in an
announcement of his patent. The inventor, who lives in North
Tonawanda, N.Y., won patent 5,987,451.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joel Stein, a 28-year-old magazine columnist, likes to pepper
his columns with bawdy humor, tasteless one-liners and something
that can best be described as a sort of polished vulgarity.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, he began one column about Susan Faludi's book
``Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man'' by writing, ``I don't
want Susan Faludi's pity. I want her tight little body.''
</P>
<P>
   He once asked the comedian Don Rickles if he liked to ``use
insult humor during sex.''
</P>
<P>
   He has written of his desire to wax his hairy body, printed a
discussion with the actor Ben Stiller about male sexual appendages,
and has suffered the wrath of a furious Sharon Stone, who slammed
down the phone and has sworn never to speak to him again.
</P>
<P>
   If you think Stein writes for Penthouse, Maxim magazine or the
local campus newspaper, think again: He writes for Time magazine.
As Time, the flagship publication of Time Warner Inc., and its
other newsweekly cousins _ Newsweek, published by the Washington
Post Co., and U.S. News and World Report, owned by the real-estate
developer Mortimer Zuckerman _ pay more attention to entertainment
and lifestyle reporting, the baby-faced 28-year-old Stein is
emerging as a symbol, if an extreme one, of the new newsweekly
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, I don't think I am a real journalist,''
Stein said in an interview in his Time office recently, the walls
papered with letters from readers. ``If Watergate happens, it's not
like they're going to send me out in the field. I feel like I am,
well, whatever we all are now: I am a celebrity journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pace of news has quickened _ Americans get their news
from 24-hour cable television networks, directly from the Internet
or automatically downloaded to their Palm Pilot at the lunch table
_ the newsweekly magazine has undergone a transformation in the
last decade. Instead of staid cover portrait of generals or
presidents or political newsmakers, Time features cover stories
about Harry Potter books, the sudden popularity of the high-protein
diet, whether to have laser eye surgery and when to treat children
with Ritalin. When a major politician or public figure chooses a
media venue for an interview, the preferred outlet is usually
television, not a printed magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And while Time, Newsweek and U.S. News &AMP; World Report have all
broken news in recent years and still jump all over big stories,
they have definitively devoted more space to feature-friendly
categories like self-improvement, health, entertainment and
financial security.
</P>
<P>
   Their circulations have not budged in years. Time's circulation
has not moved from 4.1 million since 1994; Newsweek's has remained
at 3.1 million during that period and the circulation of U.S. News
and World Report has also remained flat, at about 2.2. million.
</P>
<P>
   One key to their future guaranteed readership is to gather
younger readers into the fold. Enter Stein, who said that he
receives his most ardent mail from teen-agers and college students.
One recent letter to Stein described the author's Joel Stein
college dormitory-room shrine.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 graduate of Stanford University and former writer for the
Martha Stewart Living television show, Stein had limited
journalistic experience before joining Time, with the exception of
a two-year stretch writing sports articles and a humor column at
Time Out New York.
</P>
<P>
   After catching the eye of Walter Isaacson, Time's managing
editor, Stein joined the magazine in 1997 as an entertainment
reporter, noting the foibles and failures of celebrities on the
People page. He graduated to question-and-answer interviews, then
features, and now also writes a column that shares space with the
noted belletrist Calvin Trillin. In every three-week cycle, Stein
writes two weeks of columns, and Trillin writes one.
</P>
<P>
   Stein's ``Notebook'' columns _ in the self-mocking, openly
ironic tradition of Jerry Seinfeld and Howard Stern _ focus on
three topics: himself, his life and his deep, private, personal
thoughts. There was ``My Mother, The Bride,'' in which Stein
offered this advice about a parent's wedding: ``Unlike at a
friend's wedding, it's a bad idea to get drunk and hook up with
guests, because of the preponderance of cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shaving the Body, Fantastic,'' Stein fantasized for 4.1.
million readers about denuding his entire body of hair and offered
this piece of personal punditry: ``You see, the thing about me that
I find most lamentable, besides my hairy butt, is that I am
attracted to the wrong things in women.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Stein wrote of his dislike for dogs: ``How can
people love something so much that they're willing to walk behind
it and retrieve its feces with their own hands every day? I have
yet to meet a woman for whom I'd do that.'' The magazine received
almost 100 negative letters.
</P>
<P>
   Dog feces. Hairy body parts. Drunken sex with cousins. Is Time
magazine's august founder, Henry Luce, turning in his grave?
Isaacson said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Luce founded this magazine based on humor and a bit of
sassiness, and it's nice to see what we can do to keep up the
tradition,'' he said. Isaacson noted that Stein's columns guarantee
an influx of reader mail. ``There are people who love him and there
are people who are baffled by him, and I think it's good to have
someone in the magazine who provokes opinions,'' he said. Readers'
letters have described Stein variously as ``flat-out obnoxious''
and ``a journalistic mosquito'' as well as ``the best thing to
happen to Time.''

 UNDATED: to Time.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stein said that his columns provoke a response because their
tone is so unexpected in a magazine from which older readers still
expect a tone of somewhat grave authority. After all, who expects a
Time columnist to ask a septuagenarian actress like Esther Williams
``was there a guy in Hollywood you didn't sleep with?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were writing this stuff for Entertainment Weekly or Vibe
or Pop Smear, I would get no reaction,'' Stein said. ``Take the
same stuff and put it in Time and everybody suddenly gets freaked
out. You can do very small things and the people who have been
subscribers for 50 years are either delighted or very, very upset
by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein said that his provocative personal voice is a key
difference in the Time of today, as opposed to the Time of, say,
1972. ``There is a difference in the magazine now,'' he said.
``Walter lets writers have a voice. He lets you express your
opinions and thoughts and feelings in a way that I didn't think a
news magazine ever would.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein's interviews, which the magazine runs as straight
question-and-answer pieces, are seemingly rambling sessions, a
hallmark of which is that they annoy celebrities. When he
interviewed Jennifer Lopez, the singer and actress, he asked her a
series of questions about her body. ``Well, if you really think
about it, what else do you want to know about Jennifer Lopez? Do
you really want to get to know the real Jennifer Lopez?'' Stein
said. ``It saves me from doing a lot of research. I just asked her
questions about her butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most journalists who freely offer their opinion in print,
Stein has ruffled feathers and bruised egos. The comedian Buddy
Hackett will only say this after his experience with Stein: ``I
don't think he's ever going to have a nice life. When you give out
pain, that's what you get back. Plus, he talked about himself the
whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stone won't talk to him anymore, Stein said, because a year
ago he asked her inappropriate questions when he was interviewing
her for a question-and-answer piece. Cindy Berger, Ms. Stone's
public relations agent at PMK, said that Stein had asked questions
of an intimate nature that had upset Ms. Stone. The piece never
ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was persona non grata around here for a while,'' said Ms.
Berger. Stein sent flowers to Ms. Berger and Ms. Stone. Asked if
she had forgiven him, Ms. Berger said: ``A publicist never
forgets.'' As for Ms. Stone, Stein said in a Church Lady voice:
``Well, I don't like her one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the contretemps with Jay McInerney, a novelist.
``Jay McInerney wanted to beat me up,'' Stein said brightly.
</P>
<P>
   Stein wrote a searing profile of McInerney, the author of
``Bright Lights, Big City'' when his last novel, ``Model
Behavior,'' was published in 1998. In an interview last week,
McInerney, apparently still smarting, called Stein ``a supercilious
nonjournalist with an ax to grind'' and said that the one other
piece he had read by Stein was an interview by Stein with Irvine
Welch, the author of the novel ``Trainspotting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it extremely annoying because it was all about Joel
Stein demonstrating his wit at the expense of Irvine Welch,''
McInerney said. ``I wanted to hear what Welch had to say and it was
all about Stein.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyndi Stivers, the editor in chief of Time Out New York and
Stein's former boss, said that Stein is as much a cultural observer
as he is a sort of self-focused monologuist _ if not the embodiment
of a trend as significant as the New Journalism was in the 1970s _
who uses Time as his bully pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful that they are putting first-person
voices in Time,'' she said. ``It makes Time fun to read. I just
can't believe that he gets away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stivers said that at Life magazine, another Time Inc.
publication, where she worked in the 1980s, ``you had to learn to
write in the Time Inc. generic prose, in the voice of the magazine,
and Joel is certainly not that. The first time I saw him write a
reported piece with a first-person reference in the lead I almost
fell out of my chair.''
</P>
<P>
   To Stein, the fact that he reveals intimate, seemingly eccentric
but actually quite normal aspects of his personality to the readers
of Time does not seem terribly original.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth Wurtzel was shocking when she wrote ``Prozac
Nation,'' Stein said. ``Howard Stern talks about himself, and
Seinfeld. People have been talking about themselves in ways they
really shouldn't be for so long that I no longer think I am
original.''
</P>
<P>
   And Isaacson said that Stein is not just an intentional lure for
young readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds like so much marketing talk to me,'' he said.
``He's here because not only is he funny but his humor has a real
intelligence and a real soul. It's not as if you say, `Let's skew
this way by adding a young writer.' You read his stuff and say,
`Hey. That's neat.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. _ To be human, the writer Chinua
Achebe has said, one must have a story. ``It's one of the things
humans do,'' he insists. ``Not just have a story, but tell a
story.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than four decades, Achebe, the man widely regarded as
the progenitor of the modern African novel and the author of the
groundbreaking 1958 book ``Things Fall Apart,'' has been telling
the story of his native Nigeria, before and after its encounter
with European colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, as Nigeria takes its first steps toward
democracy after a long spell of political repression, Achebe is not
in place to tell the tale. Since 1990, when a car accident outside
Lagos left him paralyzed from the waist down, he has made a modest
wood-frame house here on the Bard College campus his improbable
and, he maintains, his impermanent home.
</P>
<P>
   He has been unable to move back to Nigeria not just because the
country was, until recently, in the grip of a corrupt dictatorship,
but also because the civil order _ including a health-care system
that can tend to his needs _ have all but collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Now 69, he waits for things to fall into place in Nigeria once
again. And he waits to go home. ``I have chosen a particular story,
or maybe that story has chosen me,'' he said. ``I just find it
useful, fruitful to be in that community, as a writer, as a human
being. There is so much to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That apparently came into sharp relief in August when, for the
first time in nine years, Achebe went home to Nigeria for a visit.
One recent evening at a talk at Bard College, where he has taught
since 1990, he spoke of that visit publicly for the first time.
Thomas Keenan, a professor of comparative literature and the
director of a nascent interdisciplinary human rights project who
sponsored the talk, called it a ``homecoming after his other
homecoming.''
</P>
<P>
   And what a strange, anticlimactic homecoming it was. Here was
this giant of world literature, sitting in a wheelchair in a gray
wool vest, reporting back on his momentous trip home to a roomful
of earnest-faced undergraduates inside the Bard College student
center.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking softly and with remarkable modesty, peppering his
lecture with metaphors, Achebe talked with his hands, sweeping the
air in an arc when referring to Nigeria, sometimes clasping his
hands as though in prayer, pointing a long finger when speaking of
the reign of dictators. The country, he said at one point, is like
a wobbly tripod, and its three major ethnic groups _ the Hausa,
Igbo and Yoruba, who frequently contest one another for power and
turf _ are its three unwieldy legs. ``Nigeria,'' he observed,
``refuses to stand on three legs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still very emotional about it,'' he said of his five-week
sojourn. ``It's really a wonderful experience to connect again to
people who share this culture, this land of Igbo, and to be with
people who have been treated very badly by rulers.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later that evening he tried to explain the
conditions of his strange exile here by turning to the novel
``Ambiguous Adventure,'' by the Senegalese writer Cheik A. Kane.
Its protagonist, a young African aristocrat, goes to France,
seeking to master French philosophy. When he gets there, he
discovers how unnecessary he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not saying, `You can't stay here,''' Achebe explained.
``There's no work for you. That's a terrible thing for an artist _
to be trying to work, trying to scratch around for work, when at
home work is all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he feel like this sometimes?
</P>
<P>
   He nodded wordlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Will he return to Nigeria?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, sure,'' came the unequivocal answer. ``I will go back as
soon as I can, as soon as I think it's safe, which means if I need
to go to hospital, there will be a hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Achebe's coming to Bard College for so long a stay was wholly
unexpected. He was flown to London for surgery immediately after
his accident. Six months later he was invited to Bard. At the time,
Achebe said, he and his wife, Christie, who now teaches psychology
at Bard, thought they would be here for a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   But their stay dragged on as political conditions in Nigeria
deteriorated. Elections were held and annulled. Gen. Sani Abacha _
``that hideous tyrant,'' in Achebe's words _ took power. In 1995
the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged. Nigerians, Achebe is fond of
saying, saw how far the bottom really was.
</P>
<P>
   In all these years Achebe has not lost touch with Nigeria.
People call, they write. But it doesn't make it easier to be away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like, `Come and help!''' he said. ``For me it
begins to sound like, `Am I running away?'''
</P>
<P>
   At Bard Achebe spends much of his day reading in the college
library or writing letters by longhand, which a colleague
transcribes. Usually he teaches a class on African literature each
semester, though he had the fall term off to work on a book of
essays, ``Home and Exile,'' due out from Oxford University Press in
the spring. &UR;  &LR; He writes when the spirit moves him, he says. He calls
himself ``a lazy writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Assessing Achebe's work is a daunting task for many scholars of
African literature. ``Things Fall Apart,'' the story of the Igbo
people of Nigeria just before British arrival and the first African
novel to enjoy a wide international audience, became the seminal
text of postcolonial literature. It was one of the first books to
present European colonialism from an African point of view and to
express in English the way Africans spoke in their native tongues.
</P>
<P>
   The book has been translated into 50 languages and has sold more
than 8 million copies worldwide. Altogether he has written five
novels, four books of nonfiction, numerous books of short stories,
children's books and poems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the English language, he is the founding father of modern
African literature,'' said K. Anthony Appiah, a Harvard University
philosophy professor who grew up in Ghana. ```Things Fall Apart' is
the beginning of the modern canon. You can't imagine the rest of
the literature without it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Somalian writer Nuruddin Farah, with whom Achebe is
scheduled to read in March at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, calls
him ``the most singular contribution Africa has made to world
literature.''

</P>
<P>
   For Achebe, an Igbo by ethnicity and the son of a Christian
evangelist, writing in English was never a conscious choice.
English was the language of his education; Igbo was for
conversation. English was the language of the novel; Igbo, the
medium of poetry. ``I have two hands,'' he said simply. ``So I give
them different things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   His novelist's hand has been in repose awhile. Perhaps it, too,
is waiting to go home. ``Anthills of the Savannah,'' published in
1987, was Achebe's last novel. Shortly after it was published he
made a prescient observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very, very sad to have to live in Europe or
America,'' he said in an interview in February 1988, two years
before his accident. ``The relationship between me and the society
I write about is so close and so necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Has it been difficult to write away from home?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he confessed, adding that he hoped Bard College did not
feel too bad about it. Of course he can conjure pictures from
memory. But ``you need to have continuous contact if this is what
you've elected to talk about,'' he said. ``You don't want to miss
any important event in that life.''
</P>
<P>
   That he was missing many events in that life became all the more
plain in his account of his trip home.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled landing at the Lagos airport and there being no
wheelchair anywhere, until his family complained vigorously and a
wheelchair suddenly arrived. He spoke of people milling about at
the airport, apparently aimlessly. He described the main
thoroughfare through Ogidi, his hometown 400 miles east of Lagos,
as a road so rutted that his car had to snake its way around,
practically through people's homes. And he remembered that at home
the electrical generator designed to be a backup during power
failures became the main source of power. ``This is a country that
has ceased to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also spoke of the festive cannon fire announcing his
arrival, when his car pulled into Ogidi, and of the six young men
who appointed themselves his bodyguards, to protect him from
ruffians known to rob visitors from abroad. All through his stay,
he recalled with relish, a stream of guests arrived: journalists
seeking interviews, relatives coming to share a meal, political
leaders coming to chat.
</P>
<P>
   Achebe's recollections sounded like those of an elder, pleased
to be wanted. Or perhaps of a man who feels not quite so paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like people were saying: ```Oh, you've come home! Talk
to us!''' he remembered. ``You realize you serve a certain need.
And that is to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to the trip, he said, a new novel may be on its
way soon.
</P>
<P>
   The homecoming also included a meeting with the new president,
Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria's first civilian ruler in 16 years. For
him Achebe offered guarded praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the possibilities we had,'' he said, ``Obasanjo is
probably, well, probably the best at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   For the prospects of democracy Achebe is remarkably optimistic,
but characteristically cautious, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have done is turn around,'' he insisted. ``We were
facing the wrong direction before.''
</P>
<P>
   Achebe and his wife seem to have been reluctant to re-create
their Nigerian home in Annandale. There are few mementos of Nigeria
in their house: a Yoruba carving of a horse sits above the
television, and some of his manuscripts have been shipped over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost pathetic to create an atmosphere of home in this
situation,'' he said, looking around his living room. ``You make a
new home where you go.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't become an American citizen, nor does he plan to. He
said he was superstitious about these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason we were planted in a certain place,'' he
observed. ``Our people have a saying: The whole essence of travel
is to go back home.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ When history records the names of Microsoft's great
adversaries, one that might someday join the list alongside Apple,
Netscape and America Online is an Internet company called
RealNetworks.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the intensifying competition, both companies
announced partnerships during the Consumer Electronics Show here to
utilize their software.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by one of Microsoft's former executives, Rob Glaser,
RealNetworks makes so-called media player software _ programs that
companies use to send video and audio files over the Internet and
that consumers use to listen to and view those files.
</P>
<P>
   With some 95 million registered users of its software,
RealNetworks is thought to have a commanding lead in the
media-player market. But lately the company's success has whetted
the competitive appetite of Glaser's former boss, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   For several years Microsoft has had a media player of its own
tucked into the company's market-dominating Windows operating
system for personal computers. Only in the last 12 months or so,
though, has the company been stepping up its efforts to make the
Windows Media Player a central selling point.
</P>
<P>
   At the industry show here, RealNetworks announced an agreement
with Seagram's Universal Music Group, the biggest record label,
which will begin providing music for use with a RealNetworks music
player known as Jukebox. Microsoft, not to be drowned out,
announced that several new portable digital devices coming soon
from various manufacturers would be compatible with Microsoft's
Windows Media Player technology.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly intense competition, which is taking on
overtones of the Microsoft vs. Netscape and Microsoft Network vs.
America Online battles, underscores how much is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, industry analysts say, the contest is not
only about which software will be used to listen to music, or view
video snippets. Instead, the outcome could determine which
company's technology may be the basis for how television, film,
music and other media are distributed and digested in the coming
digital environment known as convergence. By most accounts,
convergence is still many years away, but it could mean huge
business for the companies that sell software to media
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we do have convergence, these streaming media players
could be the ones who dominate it,'' said Allen Weiner, vice
president of analytical services for Nielsen/NetRatings, an
Internet research organization. ``This is the most significant
battle in the marketplace today.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner and numerous other industry analysts say that, for now,
RealNetworks has a substantial lead in distributing its main media
player, called RealPlayer. More important, they say, there is far
more media material on the Internet that is compatible with
RealPlayer than with the Windows Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Nielsen/NetRatings reported that in the month of
November, various versions of RealPlayer were used by 8.9 million
people on the Internet, representing 12.1 percent of active
Internet users. Microsoft's Windows Media Player was not only far
behind; with 2.4 million users and a market share of 3.2 percent,
it was not even in second place.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 in November was Apple Computer's Quick Time media player,
with 5.4 million users and a 7.4 percent market share. But in key
ways, some analysts do not see Apple Quick Time as a direct
competitor with the other two programs. Unlike Quick Time, the
RealNetworks and Microsoft players are meant for so-called
streaming media.
</P>
<P>
   With streaming media, the audio or video files remain on a Web
company's site and are played as a continuous stream by the end
user, but are not stored on the user's computer. With Quick Time,
popular for viewing material likes sports clips or movie previews
online, the file must be downloaded onto the user's computer and
then played back. Although Weiner considers Quick Time part of the
digital media future, he does not see it as part of the
streaming-media showdown between RealNetworks and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser, 37, who founded RealNetworks in 1994 after leaving his
position as vice president for multimedia consumer systems at
Microsoft, said he was ``hugely confident in our leadership
position.'' He said RealNetworks planned to expand beyond media
player software to provide an ``integrated suite of media
delivery'' that would include forums for selling copyright-secured
music online, for offering streams of free music and video and for
placing advertising alongside the media content.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this business model is already in place with
RealNetworks' Jukebox software, which consumers can use to store
and organize music collections on their computers. So far consumers
have registered 20 million copies of Jukebox. Microsoft has no
analogous product, although a handful of companies make Web-based
jukeboxes that are based on the Windows Media Player technology.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts note that the online media market is too new to yet
declare RealNetworks the winner. They note that Microsoft has begun
calling its Media Player a ``key component'' of the Windows
operating system. And Microsoft is bundling the player technology
with its industrial-strength Windows NT Server software, which a
Web company could use to disseminate both video and audio in the
Media Player format.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage to a Web media company, Microsoft executives say,
is that they get a media server and corporate computing software
system for a single price. ``Otherwise, you have to buy Sun plus
RealNetworks or Linux plus RealNetworks,'' said Anthony Bay, vice
president for streaming media at Microsoft, referring to competing
industrial-strength software systems. ``Why buy both?''
</P>
<P>
   But RealNetworks executives say that price is largely beside the
point. To begin with, most of the downloads of the RealNetworks
server software used by Web companies are free, according to the
company. And while licenses for the more enhanced versions cost
upward of several thousand dollars, they say such fees are minimal,
compared with the cost of network transmission capacity a company
needs to make audio and video accessible to many users
simultaneously _ whether Microsoft or RealNetworks software is
used.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts note, however, that it is difficult to dismiss
Microsoft's ability to leverage its dominance in the operating
system market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very similar behavior pattern'' to the way Microsoft
went after the Netscape market, said Rob Enderle, vice president
and research leader at Giga Information Group, a market research
firm in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Neither Microsoft nor RealNetworks much likes drawing parallels
to Netscape, whose early dominance in the Web-browser software
field was undermined by Microsoft's bundling of its own browser
into Windows. For its part, Microsoft _ amid an ongoing antitrust
case involving that very issue _ does not want to be characterized
as wielding Windows as an anti-competitive weapon in the
media-player war.
</P>
<P>
   And RealNetworks, lest it be cast prematurely as a Microsoft
victim, says the current battle is more analogous to Microsoft's
less successful effort to unseat America Online with the Microsoft
Network.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks executives say their company's advantage is not
simply its millions more users, but the fact that so much more of
the media content on the Internet has been formatted for use with
RealPlayer software _ at least 85 percent of the audio and video
files available on the Net, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft offers no figure of its own, though it does not
dispute that RealNetworks holds an advantage so far. Yet Microsoft
officials contend that their rival's advantage primarily involves
aging material on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are legacy files,'' said Dave Fester, director of
marketing for Microsoft's streaming media division, who noted that
most newer content is compatible with both companies' media-player
software. The Web sites of CNN, Fox and NBC , for example, stream
their audio and video in both the RealPlayer and Windows Media
formats.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever this battle may lead, the rhetoric has become
increasingly testy between the two companies. Enderle of Giga
Information Group thinks Microsoft is especially intense because
Glaser once testified against his former employer's hardball
tactics at a Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Glaser believes the intensity is simply part of Microsoft's
culture. ``As a motivation technique,'' he said, ``they like to
package targets.''

EVEN AS AN ADULT, MIKEY STILL LIKES LIFE  
 WRITER FIGHTS SUBPOENA IN SHEPPARD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most familiar, most liked television commercials ever
_ the Mikey spot for Life cereal _ is being revived, with a
contemporary twist or two.
</P>
<P>
   The spot, which originally ran nationally from 1972 through
1984, featured two skeptical boys who pushed a bowl of Life at
their finicky brother Mikey, sure he would not enjoy it, because
``he hates everything.'' But to their surprise, Mikey liked Life,
then as now sold by Quaker Oats Co.
</P>
<P>
   The revival is in the form of a remake of the original spot,
which was created by Doyle Dane Bernbach in New York, now part of
the DDB Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   The remake, by the Chicago office of FCB Worldwide, part of True
North Communications, replaces the three boys with three adults to
show that, as an announcer proclaims, ``no one ever outgrows the
terrific taste of Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The remake, which is scheduled to begin running Jan. 17, adds
Life to a list of cereal brands aiming pitches at grown-ups. Others
include Cap'n Crunch, also sold by Quaker, and Frosted Flakes, sold
by Kellogg Co.
</P>
<P>
   In the remake, the adults _ two men and a woman _ follow the
original script word for word. The woman and one man play the
skeptics and the other man is the new Mikey. The only differences
are a new ending, showing the two skeptics also eating bowls of
Life, and the announcer's proclamation of Life's appropriateness
for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neat part is that they're adults,'' Todd Magazine, vice
president for ready-to-eat cereals at Quaker in Chicago, said of
the new cast, ``but they're kids at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The response to the remake in testing has been overwhelming,''
he added. ``We expect it to be a big hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The new spot, scheduled to run through June, will be
supplemented with promotions like an online trivia contest at
www.lifecereal.com.
</P>
<P>
   If the original commercial generated questions from consumers
wondering who the boys were (three brothers named Gilchrist), the
new one might inspire a question, too: Why are the three adults
seated together at the breakfast table, with the woman and one man
in pajamas and the new Mikey dressed as if getting ready for work?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good question,'' Magazine said, laughing, ``but the
spot is about Life, not the people and their relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps someday there'll be a sequel to the remake, a soap opera
called ``As the Cereal Bowl Turns.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Writer Fights Subpoena in Sheppard Case
</P>
<P>
   More than 45 years after Marilyn Sheppard was murdered in her
Cleveland home, the case that inspired the television series ``The
Fugitive'' is still generating heat.
</P>
<P>
   The case is back in court again, and a battle is emerging
involving the media: Prosecutors want the files of an investigative
reporter who is writing a book about the case; the writer is
fighting the subpoena, and his lawyers are charging that
prosecutors have threatened to do him financial harm.
</P>
<P>
   The battle comes 33 years after Dr. Sam Sheppard, Ms. Sheppard's
husband, was retried in the murder and acquitted. He had served 10
years before the Supreme Court overturned the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The writer, James Neff, a 46-year-old former reporter for The
Cleveland Plain Dealer, plans in his book to recount the latest
trial, which is set to begin on Jan. 31 in Cuyahoga County Common
Pleas Court, to determine whether Sheppard was innocent or was
simply not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   If the jury determines that he was innocent, his estate will be
able to sue the state of Ohio for lost wages and $250,000 for the
10 years he spent in prison. Sheppard died in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuyahoga County prosecutor has issued a subpoena seeking all
the evidence that Neff collected. Neff said he feared the evidence
would enter the public record and thus be available ``to somebody
doing a quickie book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a government taking of years of my work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Marburger, the First Amendment specialist at the Baker &AMP;
Hostetler law firm in Cleveland who is representing Neff, said a
prosecutor, Dean Boland, had threatened that ``if Neff did not
cooperate, they would put him on the witness list'' for the trial
and then get a court order barring him from the courtroom until he
testified, perhaps as the last witness.
</P>
<P>
   William Mason, the Cuyahoga County prosecutor, said he was
convinced that Boland had not made such remarks. Mason said he
could appreciate that Neff felt threatened both journalistically
and economically, but he said Neff appeared to have evidence
central to the case, including the original 1954 police reports.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Dever, the lead prosecutor on the Sheppard civil case,
said that any First Amendment issues ``must be subordinated to our
search for the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Neff is the author of three books, including ``Mobbed Up,'' a
1989 biography of Jackie Presser, the Teamsters Union president who
was secretly an FBI informant. The book became the basis of the
film ``Teamster Boss.'' Random House will publish his book on the
Sheppard case, tentatively titled ``Chasing the Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Esther Newberg, Neff's agent, said ``it is hideous that he would
have to turn over'' a decade of work.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors want material from Neff's interviews with Richard
Eberling, a window washer who worked for the Sheppards. DNA
evidence uncovered in 1998 by Terry Gilbert, the lawyer for the
Sheppard estate, implicated Eberling while appearing to exonerate
Sheppard. The prosecutor's office, which maintains that Sheppard
killed his wife, says this evidence should be inadmissible because
the crime scene was contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Eberling died while serving a life sentence for killing another
woman.

 &HT;    Bringing the famous Winecoff fire picture into sharper focus
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Arnold Hardy never met the poor woman who streaked
through his viewfinder in a flash and then vanished into the cold
December night more than half a century ago. He was an old man
before he knew for sure what happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   In another sense, though, he's always known: His photograph made
her an enduring emblem of the Winecoff Hotel fire, one of the
saddest episodes in Atlanta history.
</P>
<P>
   Now 77, Hardy is retired from the X-ray equipment manufacturing
firm that he founded and sold to his son. He lives comfortably in
Stone Mountain with his wife, Lorraine, in a house where the only
visible reminders of his prize-winning picture are some framed
awards in the den. The camera was stolen years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He takes a seat at a polished dining room table and places
half-moon glasses under his wispy white eyebrows. He opens a brown
leather valise _ his Winecoff scrapbook _ and a hint of mustiness
escapes from the yellowed clippings and congratulatory telegrams he
received after becoming the first amateur photographer to win the
Pulitzer, journalism's highest honor.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he ever thought of himself as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE
</P>
<P>
   When the Winecoff burned in 1946, Hardy was a 24-year-old
veteran with a physics degree from Centenary College, in his native
Shreveport, La. He had moved to Atlanta to take a job as a
laboratory research assistant at Georgia Tech, where he enrolled in
some graduate courses. Photography was a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   That year he bought a new camera, a $200 Speed Graphic that
folded into a box carrying case. To pay for it, he figured he could
earn some free-lance money shooting athletic events at Tech. Just
before Thanksgiving, he applied as a stringer at one of the
newspapers (he can't recall whether it was the Journal or
Constitution). The photo editor seemed interested until he saw the
camera, which was half the size of the large-format contraptions
most of the pros lugged around back then.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't use a toy like that to shoot pictures for the
newspaper,'' he blurted. ``Come see me when you get a real
camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy remembered those words a couple of weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Friday night. He had a date with an attractive
brunette. They stayed out late. By the time a bus returned him to
his Midtown rooming house, it was past 3 a.m. Saturday _ the fifth
anniversary of Pearl Harbor. He was undressing for bed when he
heard sirens screaming down West Peachtree Street. He phoned the
fire department and tried a line straight out of a B movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Press photographer,'' he lied. ``Where's the fire?''
</P>
<P>
   The Winecoff. He called a cab and grabbed his ``toy'' camera.
</P>
<P>
   The 195-room hotel on Peachtree Street was completely booked
with more than 280 registered guests, most of them Christmas
shoppers or teen-agers in town for a state meeting of the Hi-Y and
Tri-Hi-Y service organizations. Built in 1913, the Winecoff
advertised itself as ``fireproof,'' an insurance term meaning that
the steel-and-brick frame of the 15-story structure would not burn.
The furnishings were another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after 3:15, an elevator operator smelled smoke coming
from the fourth or fifth floor. (In their 1993 book, ``The Winecoff
Fire,'' Sam Heys and Allen B. Goodwin suggest that it was set by an
ex-con angry over being tossed from a poker game.) When Hardy
arrived _ the first photographer on the scene _ the windows were
glowing like jack-o'-lanterns. The hotel had no fire escapes or
sprinklers, and the fire department ladders couldn't reach past the
seventh floor, so scores of people were trapped in the inferno.
Bodies were thudding onto the pavement as people jumped or fell
from ropes made out of bedsheets.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy had five flashbulbs _ four after one of them burst in the
chilly air. He took three pictures. Then, with his final flash, he
trained his lens on the mezzanine, where bodies were bouncing on
the awning and striking the marquee. He noticed a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked to me like she was holding onto a rope, trying to
climb down, and then she lost her grip,'' Hardy says. ``It didn't
look to me like she jumped.''
</P>
<P>
   He clicked the shutter.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to take any more pictures, he turned his attention to a
drugstore across Peachtree, where a fireman and police officer were
discussing whether to call the owner and get the first-aid supplies
inside. Hardy suggested they break down the door. When they
hestitated, he kicked in the plate glass himself and was promptly
arrested. The desk sergeant at the station booked and released him
almost as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy went back to Tech and developed his film in a darkroom at
the laboratory where he worked. It was about 6 a.m. when he saw the
image of a dark-haired woman in a free fall, her white panties
glaringly visible as her skirt billowed around her head.
Remembering his encounter with the newspaper photo editor, he
decided to call The Associated Press instead. The wire service's
Atlanta bureau paid him $300 (a $200 bonus came later) and
dispatched the dramatic picture around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In Buckhead, the father of the young woman Hardy had taken out
that weekend looked at his Journal. The photo _ captioned: ``Woman
Hurtles to Death in Winecoff Fire'' _ took more than a quarter of
the front page.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was that boy's name?'' he asked his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnold Hardy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it looks like he had quite a night after he left you.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few weeks, as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the fire, Hardy went back to the drugstore and
paid the owner for the broken glass. ``He really blistered me,'' he
says. ``He said we should have called him, he would have been there
in an hour. An hour? People were dying in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner changed his tune a week later in court. Hardy's
photograph had made him a minor celebrity by then, and an AP
reporter and cameraman accompanied him as he faced a complaint of
breaking and entering. The owner told the judge that he wouldn't
dream of pressing charges against such a fine young man.
</P>
<P>
   THE `JUMPING LADY'
</P>
<P>
   AP thought it only fitting that Hardy investigate what had
happened to the woman in the photo. There was a critical patient at
Grady that some of the reporters thought had to be her. But when
Hardy arrived at the hospital to see her, he was met by an AP man
who had already shown her the picture and been told in no uncertain
terms that she was not the ``jumping lady,'' as the papers were
calling her. Hardy made no further effort to contact her.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, it was her.
</P>
<P>
   According to Heys, who co-wrote the book about the fire, the
woman was Daisy McCumber, a 41-year-old secretary at the Fulton Bag
and Cotton Mill (the scene of last year's big blaze in Atlanta).
She was not registered at the hotel but was spending the night
there with a girlfriend visiting from Florida. Heys and Goodwin
identified her from photos, contemporary accounts and interviews
with relatives and her nurse at Grady.
</P>
<P>
   McCumber never admitted it publicly. ``I think she was
embarrassed to have her underwear showing like that,'' Heys says.
``That would have been scandalous at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   McCumber's account of her fall differed from Hardy's
recollection. In 1953, she told a reporter about her struggles for
one of the many stories that have been written about Winecoff
survivors over the years. The photo never came up, but McCumber did
say that she had jumped from the 11th floor when she saw the flames
closing in. She wasn't sure how she landed.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, Hardy received a letter from a New Jersey man who
said he had witnessed the moment. Claud Beckham said he had been
moonlighting downtown for Southern Bell when he heard the fire
engines, hurried to the Winecoff and saw McCumber's plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they took her away, she was breathing but bleeding
profusely,'' wrote Beckham (who died last spring). ``We were
certain that she wouldn't survive the ride to the hospital. The leg
that was straight down in your picture was almost totally broken
off at her ankle; her foot was hanging on by a small scrap of
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   McCumber suffered a broken back, broken pelvis, broken ribs, a
fractured hand, compound fractures of both legs and a brain injury.
She underwent numerous operations and eventually had a leg
amputated. ``I think I would rather die than go through all of it
again,'' she said 6 1/2 years after the fire.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't want to talk about it anymore when Heys tracked her
down for a 40th anniversary story in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   McCumber died in 1992 in Jacksonville, Fla., where she had lived
in a nursing home. The following year Heys and Goodwin identified
her in their book as the woman in the photograph.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Hardy could recall hearing her name.
</P>
<P>
   NO MORE PRIZES
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the fire, AP offered Hardy a job. He turned it
down. His whole attitude toward news photography was changing _ and
it wasn't just because of his suspicion that he'd never be able to
top himself. One incident did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an industrial fire in Atlanta,'' he says. ``I went
out there and hung around a while; there wasn't anything worth
shooting. But the next day my picture appeared in the paper with
some caption about the Winecoff photographer looking for another
prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Captions, always those damned captions.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy didn't want people to think of him as some kind of
ambulance-chaser. He retired his press card.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only pictures I've taken since then,'' he says, ``have
been family and vacations.''

<P>
   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A shift of the jet stream will bring some changes to the weather
pattern across the nation on Monday and during the rest of the
week. A series of potent disturbances will flood into the
Northwest, bringing windswept heavy rain to coastal sections and
heavy snow to the interior mountains. Meanwhile, a rapidly
developing storm will bring wet weather to the Northeast on Monday
with drier conditions arriving in its wake for the remainder of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a stream of moist Pacific air ahead of a cold front
will take aim on the Oregon coast, causing heavy rain in western
sections. As the moist air intercepts the Cascades, it will ascend
and cool, setting the stage for very heavy snow. Snow levels will
average near or slightly below pass level. Locally heavy snow will
also affect many west-facing slopes of the northern and central
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and scattered showers will stream into northern
California while southern sections stay mainly sunny and mild.
Farther east, air warming by compression upon descending the
eastern Rockies will bring mild, gusty winds to the Colorado Front
Range. As the wind weaves through the complex terrain, local gusts
near 70 mph are possible.
</P>
<P>
   A period of heavy rain will dampen sections of the Northeast on
Monday as low pressure over Ontario draws moisture from the
Atlantic Ocean into its circulation. The rain will reach the New
England seaboard by evening. Colder air sweeping around the low
will traverse the Great Lakes late Monday night and Tuesday,
bringing locally heavy snow squalls.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Uncertain Record
</P>
<P>
   Not a single snowflake has been recorded this season in the
official observations for Boston that are taken at Logan Airport.
Previously, the record for the latest date without any snow was
Dec. 22, 1998. However, there have been many reports of flurries
near the airport this season, some as early as Nov. 11. The
automated system that takes official observations may not be
sensitive enough to detect light flurries that are apparent to the
human eye. Observation systems have changed many times in the last
century, adding uncertainty to the direct comparison of weather
records.

ADVERTISING: AGENCIES BRACING FOR INTERNET BUSINESS SHAKEOUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Mass., Ill., Ore., Mich., Ga.)  (rk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Madison Avenue is bracing for the Internet version of
Darwinism, a winnowing process that could be called
SurvivaloftheFittest.com.
</P>
<P>
   After a record advertising blitz during the fourth quarter,
particularly among electronic commerce Web sites anxious to
stimulate holiday sales, agencies are wondering whether the new
year will bring a shakeout. The e-tailers that spent the most on
campaigns in mainstream national media did not necessarily attract
the most shoppers, according to preliminary data, a setback
threatening to jeopardize the continued flow of money from clients
to agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the Wild West, but now people are getting
educated,'' said Donny Deutsch, chairman and chief executive at
Deutsch Inc., which handles dot-com clients like Ashford.com,
Britannica.com, Expedia and MyFamily.com from its offices in New
York and Marina del Rey, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lessons are being learned,'' Deutsch added. ``And it's a lot
of learning.''
</P>
<P>
   One lesson involves timing. Many dot-coms, including
MyFamily.com, a geneology Web site, decided to wait until the first
quarter to introduce campaigns rather than add to the plethora of
ads that saturated television and radio, magazines and newspapers
in the weeks before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth quarter had a bunch of companies lighting their
solid rocket boosters, fueled by cheap venture capital, and hoping
to get into space,'' said Jay Walker, founder and vice chairman at
Priceline.com in Stamford, Conn., the auction Web site for airline
tickets, hotel rooms and groceries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, it was more like fireworks,'' he added, ``going a
thousand feet high and exploding instead of reaching orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the space race, Priceline.com waited until last week to
bring out its first corporate image advertising, a humorous
campaign by Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, part of
the Interpublic Group of Companies. The commercials are centered on
the company's spokesman, the actor William Shatner, who spoofs his
erstwhile second career as a recording artist to warble corny
parody songs about Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson involves so-called targeting, aiming ads more
precisely for improved efficiency and effectiveness. For instance,
there is an increase in the use of local media rather than more
extensive _ and expensive _ national pitches.
</P>
<P>
   To help generate awareness for Career Mosaic, an Internet job
search site (www.careermosaic.com), for example, ``we're looking at
newspapers in certain high-volume markets like New York, Chicago
and San Francisco,'' said Diane Epstein, group account director at
the company's agency, Merkley Newman Harty in New York, part of the
Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to focus initially on our core markets,'' she added,
referring to an upbeat campaign carrying the theme ``Happy in a
career. Happy in life,'' which began on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of targeting is a change in plans by Stamps.com,
which is shifting from general market advertising to more narrowly
focused appeals to the small-office and home-office consumers most
likely to buy postage over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company moved its account, with billings
estimated at $15 million, to Draft Worldwide in Chicago, an
Interpublic agency that specializes in direct marketing, from
Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., which created a tongue-in-cheek
general campaign that featured the comedian Bob Newhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved the work Wieden &AMP; Kennedy did,'' said Chris Hylen,
chief marketing officer at Stamps.com in Santa Monica, Calif. ``It
took us from nowhere to the 65th-most trafficked site on the
Internet and worked very effectively in saying who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we felt we needed to be more direct,'' he added,
``with a mix of direct-response television, the type of ``1-800''
commercials that Draft does for marketers like American Express;
targeted marketing events in big cities, and online partnerships
with AOL and Quicken.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson from the fourth quarter dot-com deluge is that
haste often makes waste, as in hastily rushing a campaign into the
market can waste precious ad dollars. So Internet marketers are now
testing elements of their campaigns before exposing them widely to
potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking it slow,'' said Arley Baker, corporate
communications director at Earthlink Networks in Pasadena, Calif.,
an Internet service provider scheduled to start its first national
campaign on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Commercials and billboards by the Los Angeles office of BBDO
West, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, were
tested ``in a dozen markets for four months,'' he added, ``to make
sure our message is fine tuned before going out on a national
basis.'' The test results included increased awareness of the
Earthlink brand and additional sign ups for its Internet access
service.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the campaign to run through this month, ``then
we'll go back to see how it does,'' Baker said. ``If everything in
our first flight goes well, we have the potential to spend $50
million to $60 million over the coming year.''
</P>
<P>
   Another dot-com that tested its campaign was AutoTrader.com, a
Web site for buying and selling used cars, which will start
advertising on Jan. 30 with a commercial by Doner in Southfield,
Mich., to run during Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We did an extensive amount of pretesting prior to
production,'' said Clark Wood, vice president for marketing at
AutoTrader.com in Atlanta, ``and we were extremely pleased with the
results.'' The tests included briefly running the Super Bowl spot
last month on cable television, then benching it until Super
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIV is to have the most dot-com sponsors ever,
despite the highest prices ever for commercial time _ up to an
average of $3 million for each 30-second spot. The list includes
AutoTrader.com, Britannica.com, Computer.com, Hotjobs.com,
MicroStrategy, Monster.com and Pets.com.
</P>
<P>
   One or two dot-coms that identified themselves in the last
couple of months as Super Bowl advertisers _ including
Angeltips.com, an online marketplace for entrepreneurs _ have since
reversed course, announcing they would back out of the game. That
led to speculation the Darwinian struggle is intensifying, claiming
its most visible victims _ with perhaps more to come.
</P>
<P>
   But pulling out of the Super Bowl is not easy. The dot-coms were
told months ago by ABC _ the network owned by the Walt Disney Co.
that will broadcast the game _ that they would have to pay in
advance for time bought during the Super Bowl. And the process by
which the sponsor lineup changes is complicated. The network has to
agree to release advertisers from their commitments; they cannot
simply try to resell the commercial time on their own.
</P>
<P>
   For all programming on ABC, ``we're writing more and more
dot-com business through the first quarter,'' said Marv Goldsmith,
president for sales and marketing at the ABC Television Network in
New York, ``the quarter that's traditionally the softest in network
television.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're already getting feelers for the second quarter,'' he
added, ``though we're not ready to release inventory yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmmmm. Perhaps all the dot-coms that waited for the cluttered
fourth quarter to end before opening their wallets are going to
produce another cluttered quarter or two as 2000 begins.
</P>
<P>
   Roll over, Darwin, and tell Madison Avenue the news?

<P>
   If you were to reconstruct the 1999 to-do list of The Nashville
Scene's editor and publisher _ two 40-something Southerners who
have invested passion and an undisclosed amount of cash in the
small alternative weekly _ it would read something like this:
</P>
<P>
   _ Badger the town's lone daily, The Tennessean.
</P>
<P>
   _ Let the prize-winning investigative reporter loose on another
local institution (maybe the police, now that he has shaken up a
major nonprofit hospital).
</P>
<P>
   _ Collect advertisements from Exit/In, the Bluebird Cafe, 328
Performance Hall and other clubs featuring singer-songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy a stake in some other newspapers. (Try Lexington, Ky., and
New Orleans. Maybe The Village Voice?)
</P>
<P>
   By last week, the publisher, Albert Del Favero Jr., and the
editor, Bruce Dobie, could check off every item. Well, almost.
Margot DuBos, owner of Gambit Weekly in New Orleans, said she was
having too much fun to sell. But if they lost New Orleans, they
gained a piece of New York's Village Voice.
</P>
<P>
   By joining David Schneiderman, the publisher of The Voice, and
Arthur Howe, the former publisher of Philadelphia's City Paper, as
owners of The Voice and the five other Stern Publishing weeklies,
the two Tennesseans have become bit players in the crowd scene of
media investors, and among those who believe that alternative
weeklies, perennial prodigals, are reservoirs of value.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, alternative newspapers have changed hands in
Hartford, St. Louis, Cleveland, Kansas City and Lafayette, La. _
and that was before Stern Publishing was sold. After years of being
accused of selling out by their passionate, political writers and
readers, many publishers of alternative weeklies are basking in the
comforts of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the times, but the cash-flow multiples, that are
a-changin'. ``You have a whole bunch of money in private equity
looking for a home,'' said Robert Broadwater, a managing director
at the investment banking firm of Veronis, Suhler &AMP; Associates.
``These people have decided that media properties are good
investment vehicles. You have recurring revenue and predictable
cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   The sassy fringe of the newspaper industry is now getting
attention. Some alternatives have profit margins that can match
those of some dailies: margins at The L.A. Weekly and City Pages in
Minneapolis exceed 20 percent, according to their owners; The
Village Voice's margins are about 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They have the kind of young, educated audiences coveted by
advertisers, music companies in particular. ``Say you want to
target a college market'' that might be interested in alternative
rock, said Fran Aliberte, executive vice president for sales at
WEA, the distribution arm of Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Music Group.
``You're talking about Static X, Owelsey, artists like that.'' The
weeklies ``target those albums to the people that we feel will be
the early adopters of those artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Put that kind of advertising together with ads for extreme
sports contests, body piercers and futon stores, and it adds up to
about $450 million in annual advertising revenue _ double the
amount five years ago, according to Richard Karpel, president of
the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies.
</P>
<P>
   That is just 1 percent of the estimated $45 billion that
advertisers spent on daily newspapers in 1999. But supporters of
alternative papers are just as irreverent about the business of
daily newspapers as their columnists are about daily journalism.
Pointing to a drop in dailies' circulation (down 10 percent the
last decade, to 56.1 million from 62.3 million), Howe said: ``What
other business franchise loses that many of its core customers
every year? It tells me something is broke.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the circulation of alternatives is up from three
million in 1990 to more than seven million in 1999. The Association
of Alternative Newsweeklies had 64 members in 1990; this year, it
has 120.
</P>
<P>
   This activity has attracted some attention in the financial
community. The money-management firm of Weiss, Peck &AMP; Greer and the
Canadian bank CIBC chipped in a large portion of the more than $150
million paid for the Stern properties.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Mindich, the publisher and chairman of the Phoenix
Media/Communications Group, said the alternatives' lucrative niche
is their lure. ``We have, collectively, been able to deliver to our
constituency what they want,'' he said, adding that advertisers and
investors are accepting the notion that free newspapers have value.
</P>
<P>
   Broadwater, who handled the sale for Stern, agreed.
``Historically, free circulation was denigrated,'' he said. ``But I
believe free circulation is a growing trend across all media. The
Web is training the next generation that you don't pay for
content.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DuBos, publisher of Gambit Weekly, said last week that more
than 100 outlets in New Orleans want regular deliveries of the free
paper _ requests she cannot yet fulfill.
</P>
<P>
   Given her reception in New Orleans, she started another Gambit
Weekly in Baton Rouge last year. Mindich has created local versions
of his Boston Phoenix in Portland, Me., Worcester, Mass., and
Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lacey does not buy his newspapers in one region but
wherever he finds them. Then he often makes major changes. Lacey,
executive editor of The New Times Inc., the largest chain of
alternatives with 11 newspapers, has also alienated some in the
industry who feel he has a buy-and-fire ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey, however, points to a recent purchase, The Riverfront
Times in St. Louis, and says, ``All the writers and editors are
still there.'' He added, ``What we did was come in and expand the
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Now mainstream newspaper companies are in the mix. A Lafayette,
La., weekly, The Times of Acadiana, was sold last year to The
Advertiser, the town's daily, which is owned by Thomson Newspapers.
The Hartford Advocate and four nearby weeklies were sold to Times
Mirror's Hartford Courant.
</P>
<P>
   The question, Karpel said, is whether new owners can maintain a
weekly's local feel. As Dobie of Nashville said, ``In Chicago, what
has worked is an extraordinarily literary narrative style. In
Nashville, what works is serious news stories. In San Francisco, it
is' `Katy bar the door, we're going to napalm City Hall.' The term
alternative. means we are going to write and edit a product that
works in our market.''

 &HT;    Plastic pooch hot dog at electronics show
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ At an electronics show featuring displays from
15,000 manufacturers, engineers, software developers, importers and
distributors, perhaps the most popular booth featured a toy: Sony's
AIBO robot dog.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 International Consumer Electronics Show wrapped up
Saturday after drawing about 90,000 people to the Las Vegas
Convention Center to display and view products for the consumer
electronics market.
</P>
<P>
   While the show featured the latest in home entertainment,
computing, telephone products, electronics for cars and just about
everything else run by electricity, attendees said they didn't see
anything startlingly new or groundbreaking. Most of the products
displayed were variations and advancements on products already on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I haven't seen anything really new,'' said Vic
Jones, who runs a home theater company in Ontario. ``I've basically
been looking at smaller niche items I can add to the lines we're
already carrying.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of break-out products to stir their imaginations,
many show attendees gathered around a Sony display to watch a
demonstration of Sony's AIBO, a plastic pooch that interacts with
its owners and other objects. Sony says the robot dog, which sells
for about $2,500, learns from its environment so that each dog is
unique.
</P>
<P>
   Though this year's electronics show didn't produce any
blockbuster product introductions, attendees found lots to talk
about.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hottest topics were networking and the exploding
interest in music that can be downloaded in digital form from the
Internet. Speakers and panelists at the electronics show agreed
that the next bug push in home electronics will be in
``convergence,'' which means bringing different types of devices
together in systems so they can work with one another.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that a person who has a computer in one room should
be able to use the computer to set a video recorder in another
room, for example. Or someone with an electronic personal organizer
should be able to get the organizer to interact with a telephone
made by a different manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The big mystery of convergence is how the communication between
devices will be handled. There are several competing designs for
communication systems and no one seems to know which will become
dominant or if they all will coexist and cooperate in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Among the competing device connection systems being promoted are
the specialized wiring format called IEEE 1394 (also known as
firewire), radio frequency devices that communicate over short
distances using radio waves, and Universal Plug and Play formats
that use existing Internet formats to link devices.
</P>
<P>
   Portable MP3 players started showing up at last year's Consumer
Electronics Show, but this year they were everywhere. MP3 is a
technology that allows users to download music files from the
Internet for storage in digital form. The idea is popular with
young adults who use it to download and swap their favorite tunes.
Casio devoted one of the largest, loudest displays in the show to
promote its new line of wrist audio players. Computer peripheral
specialist, Creative Technology, won a Popular Mechanics design
award for its Nomad Jukebox, an MP3 player with enough memory to
store 100 hours of CD-quality music. But even the MP3 craze may not
last, according to Creative. The company has introduced a new
portable MP3 player that can be upgraded later if better ways to
download music take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``MP3 just became popular in the last year or two, but it's
really 10-year-old technology,'' said Thong Le, a marketing
associate with Creative. ``There are already other ways that could
be used to download music faster in files that don't take up as
much storage space as MP3.''
</P>
<P>
   Other trends and developments apparent at this year's Consumer
Electronics Show were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Digital television is continuing to build but hasn't nearly
peaked. Most broadcast television signals are sent in analog form,
but satellite systems and cable providers are starting to provide
digital broadcasts. Networks like CBS and ABC are to carry digital
signals within six years. The Consumer Electronics Association,
show sponsors, said digital television sales reached 120,000 in
1999 and will reach 600,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Single-use devices are coming back. The personal computer is
the ultimate multi-use device, but because it tries to do just
about everything, it can be complicated to use. The next wave will
be simpler devices that do one thing well, such as small consoles
that send and receive e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   _ E-commerce is maturing. It became clear during the recent
Christmas shopping season that American consumers are becoming
comfortable shopping online. The consumer electronics industry is
moving quickly to shore up that business by offering things like
repair services and warranties geared to Internet buyers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Everything is smaller, faster and cheaper. Though brand new
concepts were scarce this year at the electronics show, there were
plenty of examples of improvements on old products. Digital
cameras, high definition televisions, DVD players and other
recently introduced categories are becoming affordable to the
typical middle class family. And established categories, such as
video recorders, are selling for a fraction of their original
costs.

GERMAN PRESS REPORTS PUTIN WAS HONORED FOR KGB WORK, BUT WHY
REMAINS A MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A spate of reports in the German press suggested this
weekend that Acting President Vladmir Putin was decorated for his
work as a KGB agent in East Germany during the 1980s, and was even
expelled from West Germany at one point after being identified as a
Soviet spy.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond vague statements from German intelligence spokesmen,
there was little to confirm the accounts. American intelligence
officials, speaking privately, have said that to their knowledge,
Putin's 15-year career as a KGB agent was not exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who became Russia's acting president when President Boris
Yeltsin resigned on December 31, entered the KGB's foreign
intelligence arm after graduating from Leningrad State University
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He is said to have left the service in 1990 after spending most
of his career in Dresden, then an East German city frequented by
Western businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely what he did there was of little interest until Putin's
sudden ascension to prime minister last August, and then to the
Russian presidency last month. Since then, reports in the Western
press have covered the spectrum of possibilities, from the chance
that he was a drudge who filed reports about East German political
leanings to the prospect that he ran a vast economic espionage
campaign against the West in the Soviet Union's dying days.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular of this weekend's German reports, in the
newspaper Saechsische Zeitung, the main daily of the Saxony region
where Putin was active as a KGB agent, quoted German intelligence
sources as saying Putin was expelled from West Germany near the end
of the 1970s on suspicion of espionage in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   The report states that Putin worked under the cover of a
correspondent for TASS, then the official Soviet news agency. It
quoted Oleg Kalugin, a former KGB official who has made a name as a
critic of the agency, as saying that Putin's work there was not
particularly successful.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, other reports this weekend claimed that Putin
was a frequent visitor to West Germany in the 1980s, sometimes
moving through Checkpoint Charlie, the Cold-War gateway between
East and West Berlin, and sometimes using the name of Lt. Col.
Adamov or Mr. Adamov.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Berliner Zeitung reported that allied intelligence
agents photographed Putin in the mid-1980s outside the posh West
Berlin department store KaDeWe, perhaps _ they suspected _ waiting
for a rendezvous with a Soviet agent.
</P>
<P>
   Several journals reported that Putin received an award from East
Germany late in his career for his work there, but differed over
the nature of the recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Former East German security minister Erich Mielke, once one of
the most feared men in East Germany, told the magazine Focus that
Putin was honored ``in recognition of considerable services to the
ministry.'' But the weekly Der Spiegel called the award a routine
commendation. And a spokesman for the Gauck Commission, a German
office poring over records of the old East German spy apparatus,
Stasi, said the award was ``not entirely routine,'' but not all
that important, either.
</P>
<P>
   Missing in all this, unfortunately, was what Putin did to earn
the honor.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Germany's Federal Intelligence Service said
Putin had held an ``important post'' for the KGB in Dresden from
1984 to 1990, but added: ``It's difficult to say exactly what he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few firsthand reports on Putin's work, in Sunday's
edition of the newspaper Welt am Sonntag, suggests that Putin was a
mid-level KGB agent performing fairly routine duties.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted a former Stasi officer who worked with
Putin, Gunther Kohler, as saying that Putin and his family lived in
a two-and-one-half room apartment in Dresden, a 10-minute walk from
his office, and that he frequently made secret visits to West
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler said Putin, who called himself Adamov, spoke excellent
German _ so well, in fact, that he could imitate German dialects.
Unlike many Russian agents posted there, he appeared to like
Germans and especially admired German discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Putin never drank alcohol, enjoyed fitness training, especially
judo, frequently socialized with his neighbors, most of them Stasi
employees, and was said to be a strong supporter of economic and
social reforms then proposed by the Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   Some reports have suggested that Putin not only tried to recruit
Western businessmen and East Germans traveling to the West, but
also kept track of East Germans who supported economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   East Germany was a ferocious critic of Gorbachev's policy of
openness and restructuring of Soviet society, and the Kremlin was
said to have kept a register of pro-reform Germans who could take
over the government in the event of a putsch.

A TIE FOR BEST FILM, A FIRST FOR THE CRITICS' SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich,'' the quirky comedy directed by Spike
Jonze, and ``Topsy-Turvy,'' Mike Leigh's loving 19th-century
backstage drama, shared the award for best picture handed out on
Saturday by the National Society of Film Critics. It was the first
time in the society's 34 years that two films had tied for the
award, reflecting what voters felt was an unusually strong field of
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The society, made up of 53 movie critics from New York, Los
Angeles and other cities, had less of a struggle voting for a best
director, giving the prize to Leigh. David O. Russell took second
place for his work on ``Three Kings,'' a dark comedy about three
soldiers during the final days of the Gulf War. Sam Mendes, a
first-time director whose ``American Beauty'' is considered a
strong Oscar contender, won third place, though the film's
cinematographer, Conrad L. Hall, won the society's top prize for
his lush, rose-dappled visuals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the nod for best picture, ``Being John
Malkovich'' was cited for best screenplay. Written by Charlie
Kaufman, the film follows the story of a puppeteer who discovers a
magical portal that allows adventurers briefly to enter the mind of
the actor John Malkovich. Second place was given to ``Election,''
by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, for their political satire set
in a suburban high school.
</P>
<P>
   The men's acting awards were dominated by one film: ``The
Insider,'' a drama about CBS News' handling of a potentially
explosive story on the tobacco industry. Russell Crowe, a handsome
leading man whose physical transformation into a downtrodden,
besieged tobacco executive impressed many critics, won best actor.
Runners up included Jim Broadbent, who played the prudish composer
William S. Gilbert in ``Topsy-Turvy,'' and Kevin Spacey, who
starred as a rebellious middle-aged father in ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Best Supporting Actor award was won by Christopher Plummer
for his portrayal of the CBS newscaster Mike Wallace in ``The
Insider.'' Plummer edged out Philip Seymour Hoffman, the ubiquitous
young character actor who placed second for his roles in both ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley'' and ``Magnolia.'' In third place was another
young talent, 11-year-old Haley Joel Osment, who played an eerily
unsettled boy in ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In women's roles, Reese Witherspoon won a small upset by winning
best actress for her depiction of an overeager climber in
``Election.'' The runner-up was Hilary Swank in ``Boys Don't Cry,''
a film about a real-life Nebraska girl, Brandon Teena, whose
gender-bending led to her rape and murder; Ms. Swank played Ms.
Teena and has often been mentioned as a leading Oscar candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Chloe Sevigny, who played Ms. Swank's love interest in ``Boys
Don't Cry,'' was voted best supporting actress. Julianne Moore was
second in that category for her work in four separate films,
including ``Magnolia'' and ``Cookie's Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   The society has a history of unorthodox votes _ it selected the
sexy thriller ``Out of Sight'' as last year's best film _ and its
assessment of the year's best foreign-language film was no
exception. In a close vote the society selected ``Autumn Tale,''
directed by Eric Rohmer, as the best film, over ``The Dreamlife of
Angels,'' by Erick Zonca. Dropped into third place, however, was
``All About My Mother,'' by the Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar,
which has been an almost unanimous choice as best foreign film by
other film societies, including the New York Film Critics Circle
and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.
</P>
<P>
   In nonfiction films, the group selected ``Buena Vista Social
Club,'' a look at Cuban musicians, directed by Wim Wenders, as the
year's best, followed by ``Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A.
Leuchter Jr.,'' directed by Errol Morris. ``Mr. Death,'' about an
execution expert who becomes an unlikely Holocaust denier, was
followed by ``American Movie,'' a look at a would-be filmmaker
whose big screen dreams are thwarted by his low-rent life. It was
directed by Chris Smith.

 AS SIGHTINGS INCREASE, TALK OF UFOs IS ACCEPTED BY CHINESE PEOPLE,(rk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The last few months have been a boom time for UFO
enthusiasts in China.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the start of the year 2000, there were dozens of
sightings. Strange shining objects were observed scooting through
the sky by hundreds of people, from former airport workers to
college deans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warning Wuhan! Warning Dalian! Warning Xian! Jiangsu! Beijing!
Shanghai!'' exulted the Jiangsu UFO Research Society web site.
``Frequent UFO visits have enveloped all of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the sightings, the ranks of the research societies in
major Chinese cities devoted to unidentified flying objects have
grown to more than 40,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   More important still, the normally conservative official news
media have been lavishing attention on UFO news, with documentaries
on the main government television station, CCTV-1, and credulous
newspaper articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of interest and acceptance is rising rapidly,'' said
Sun Shili, a retired Foreign Ministry official who is chairman of
the Beijing UFO Research Society. ``Because of the frequent
sightings recently in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities that have
had many witnesses, even the media _ which are very serious and
careful _ has been paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in many ways it would seem a most awkward time for
fleets of extraterrestrials to be buzzing China, what with the
government jailing leaders of the Falun Gong spiritual movement and
a few other groups that favor traditional Qigong exercises as a
health measure _ for ``superstitious'' and ``anti-scientific''
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, at least, the government has placed UFO research in
the realm of science. Officials of UFO societies are determined to
keep it that way, warning members to stay away from qigong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study of UFOs is fundamentally different from other things
like Falun Gong and Qigong, which have come under criticism
lately,'' said Jin Fan, an engineer who heads the Dalian UFO
Research Society in Northeast China. ``This is a purely scientific
field, whereas Falun Gong deals with cults and superstition.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most of China's UFO enthusiasts are scientists and
engineers, not the sci-fi buffs or apocalyptic stargazers who are
the stereotype in the United States. Many of China's UFO research
societies require a college degree and published research for
membership. The Chinese Air Force attends important UFO meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our conditions for membership weren't so strict, we'd have
millions of members by now,'' said Sun, a cheerful intellectual in
a gray sweater and striped tie, who seems to embody the movement _
a bit offbeat, yes, but also scholarly, serious and strictly
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In his cluttered Beijing study, he proudly displays both
photographs of himself interpreting for Chairman Mao _ and a more
recent vintage alien collection set, containing models of the
Nordic Alien and the Roswell alien, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Applauding the Chinese government's ``enlightened and practical
attitude,'' Sun said: ``In the U.S. scholars investigating this are
under pressure and have been derided. But in China, the academic
discussion is quite free, so in this area American academics are
quite jealous of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The cluster of dozens of sightings in the last four months has
given China's enthusiasts new grist for discussions. Most involved
glowing orange-yellow objects that were reported to have lingered
in the late afternoon or night sky for more than 15 minutes before
disappearing in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where camcorders and cameras are now common
household equipment, many were captured on film, which found its
way into newspapers and onto television.
</P>
<P>
   Jin videotaped some suspected UFOs over Dalian on Dec. 25. ``I
believe what I saw was a UFO based on its pattern of movement, its
glow, its shape and its appearance,'' he said. ``It had substance
and dimensionality _ it was clearly an object.''
</P>
<P>
   Jin, an engineer, said that the turns and dips made by the
objects _ as well as their rapid acceleration _ could not have been
made by man-made planes or rockets and the sighting was on a clear
day. Anyway, he added, he has been researching the subject long
enough to distinguish UFOs from ``atmospheric phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts have various theories about the rash of UFO sightings. A
recent article in the Journal of UFO Research, published by the
Gansu Science and Technology Press, notes that sightings in China
peak each year around October 1, China's National Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense that visitors
from an extraterrestrial civilization would come now,'' said Jin.
``We're entering a new millennium so any extraterrestrial
civilization that's been observing us would want to document the
state of our civilization at this particular moment, as sort of an
historical snapshot.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the high frequency of sightings in China to its
population density.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, flying saucers are mostly consigned to the
lunatic fringe. But more than half of Chinese are interested in
UFOs and believe they might exist, club officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing UFO Research Society has 280 members, and 30 percent
are Communist Party cadres or managers. The yearly research
meetings of the national UFO society is covered by reporters from
all major news media.
</P>
<P>
   But this is an extraordinary reversal in a country where, 25
years ago, life was so focused on Communist politics that most
people could not imagine anything so ethereal as an unidentified
flying object and expressing belief in them might have been a
ticket to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sun said, he did not appreciate his one and only UFO
sighting _ a ``bright object in the sky'' _ in 1971, when he was
sent to the countryside as a young Communist Party cadre during
Mao's Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed it must be some sort of monitoring device, since
relations between China and the Soviet Union were very tense at the
time,'' he said, laughing. ``It was only years later when I got
more access to foreign materials that I realized what I'd
experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others credit China's two decades of liberalization and
market reforms for allowing UFO fever to flourish. ``As China has
opened to the outside world in the last 20 years, people's thinking
has also opened,'' said Jin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the current UFO research in China centers on
investigating sightings, but much of it involves trying to create
new forms of propulsion that might explain how UFOs might work.
</P>
<P>
   Sun describes with great excitement a small balloon-like device
invented by one of his members that moves faster than other
objects. Although it only exists now as a small model, the society
is planning to test it first on water and then on land and in
space. ``We are hoping it could be a tourist attraction and use the
concept to make a toy _ but we haven't produced one as yet because
we're worried it would be easily pirated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Research Societies also share information and reports on the
quirkier aspect of UFOs, like alien abductions. They are currently
looking into the case of a Beijing worker who said that in December
he was held on an alien spacecraft for two hours, where he was
studied as part of a medical experiment.
</P>
<P>
   But Chinese UFO societies prefer to maintain a sober exterior,
often downplaying controversial and preferring to discuss far out
theories in private.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the most recent issue of the Journal of UFO Research,
published last November, scoffed at the notions of a millennial
apocalypse _ even as it carried articles on ``interstellar
migration'' and the notion that the Egyptian pyramids were
instruments for communication with extra-terrestrials.
</P>
<P>
   And UFO enthusiasts say that they will avoid the troubles that
have befallen Qigong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very careful and cautious to present things
scientifically and to filter out things that head in a
superstitious direction,'' said Sun. ``Since there's a great deal
of fakery in the UFO field, as well as real occurrence.''

suck the last drops from wells producing an average of a quarter of
a barrel a day. Now, the few hundred people still employed in the
industry face a threat they say could bring state oil production to
an end. Environmental authorities are requiring them to spend

REVISIONS COLUMN: CRITICS SHOULD LOOK AT ART BUT ALSO AT
THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)  
By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a critic, what do you most want to see happen this year,
someone asked me during the holidays? Whereupon I began to
formulate what I hoped would be an eloquent response, both analytic
and prophetic, only to be stopped short. No, my friend said, I mean
what as a critic would you like to change about the way you and
critics in general work? How you think, feel and write?
</P>
<P>
   I'd start by saying that I'd like us to ask questions as
vehemently as we sling judgments. We're still inclined to believe
that critical authority comes mostly from assertion or virtuoso
displays of intellectual mastery. What about intelligent questions
asked forthrightly? What about admitting sometimes that we're not
sure we're asking all that needs to be asked? And what about
ambivalence? Well expressed ambivalence is as interesting in
criticism as mixed motives in fiction or microtones in music.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism is supposed to be a kind of adult education. And it's
not just the readers who are to be educated (and entertained and
unsettled and even moved). Sometimes, given a short deadline or a
new subject, you have to cram the way you used to cram for exams.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than that now. The amount of cultural material
that comes our way _ trash, treasures, ephemera, alien matter _ is
overwhelming. New forms pop up. Old, even ancient traditions we
once knew nothing about are suddenly center stage. We've all had a
particular kind of intellectual training. We've inherited canons
and then lovingly constructed our own personal cultures.
</P>
<P>
   And like most adults (audiences, scholars and plenty of
artists), we're not necessarily eager to re-educate ourselves. It
takes time to study some discipline that didn't exist 20 years ago
when you were on the cutting edge of things. And it takes nerve to
expose yourself to the uncertainties, the humiliations even, of
learning new ways of reading, seeing and listening. Learning is as
much a process of surrender as of mastery.
</P>
<P>
   Our devices of resistance include the well wrought sneer,
complete with thesaurus-worthy adjectives and literary references.
There's the ``Aren't I witty, detached and generally more fun than
what I'm writing about?'' stance. There's the high-rhetoric
denunciation, bolstered with theories about civilization's
debasement and accounts of one's own lonely, valiant struggle to
uphold certain values. And there's the ``Ah, but how undisciplined
and ultimately how boring'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   Read closely whenever you see the word ``boring'' used by a
critic, including me, who has just encountered new or deliberately
unsettling material (the ``Sensation'' show at the Brooklyn Museum
of Art, say, or a culturally foreign foreign movie). Sometimes
boredom is just boredom. But ``boring'' is a smoke-screen word,
too, as when people loftily declare that they find pornography
boring. This is sex-crazed America, for heaven's sake. What are the
odds that most people's first response to pornography is sheer
boredom?
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time the culture was more cohesive and more
exclusionary. A critic could be like an actor who played the same
character week after week in a series. The specifics changed but
the framework stayed pretty much the same. Now if you write for a
newspaper or magazine with a reasonably wide readership, your
position keeps shifting around.
</P>
<P>
   Take the term ``popular music.'' Preposterously enough, it is
now supposed to include jazz, folk, gospel, some new music and some
world music. (``Classical,'' despite efforts to extend it to jazz
and some new music, still holds fast to its traditional
boundaries.) Never mind that composers on all fronts have sampled
one another's goods and raided one another's turf for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Most critics have a specialty, an art music they know intimately
and love passionately. How do they write, as they periodically do,
about forms they enjoy but give less time and thought to? If you
are an opera fan, how do you listen to jazz singers, and vice
versa? What standards do you judge them by? What bias (or
ignorance) marks your listening? When does the personal _ age, sex,
ethnicity, where you grew up and what you grew up listening to _
shape what you present as objective criticism? How do you write
``objectively'' about music meant to be danced to when you are too
old to want to dance to it or to look good dancing to it? (I know I
must have liked singers as silly as Christina Aguilera when I was
as young as she and her fans are. I just cannot remember their
names at the moment.)
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, in the 1970s, I accepted an assignment from Ms.
magazine to write about Dolly Parton and her success in moving from
the country and western ghetto to mass market popularity. I decided
to use the piece to learn more about country and western music than
I'd ever been willing to before. With the help of more
knowledgeable friends, I gave myself a music seminar, starting in
the 1920s and moving up to the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   I was an outsider to the music, being Northern, urban, bourgeois
and black. And to my surprise, for I thought myself above such
failings, I responded with exactly that blend of excitement and
condescension I had spent years lambasting in certain white blues
and soul-music critics. I cared only for the purest, the simplest
and, therefore, most heartfelt music. The closer the singers and
instrumentalists got to Nashville, to big studio arrangements and
songs that had something in common with Tin Pan Alley pop, the more
appalled and disdainful I became.
</P>
<P>
   I felt pity, too. These people were poor and working class, so
of course arrangements larded with violins plus a lessening of that
authentic rural twang would appeal: they represented upward social
and musical mobility. I had heard sentiments like these before,
when some critic would bemoan those violins that Charlie Parker and
Billie Holiday insisted on recording with, or when they declared
that middle-class aspirations in soul music (a voice too sweet, a
style too embellished) were bogus and unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this rather mortifying cultural education, I had
come to like some of those Nashville strings very much. Not all, of
course. But often all those Vivaldi violins drive me mad, too.

`BUTTERFLY ECONOMICS': WHEN ECONOMIC THEORY FAILS, CONSULT AN
INSECT
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where are those famous and irritating rational individuals of
classical economic theory who always maximize their own overall
well being or, in the jargon of the discipline, their ``utility''?
Nowhere, says Paul Ormerod in his useful and sensible new book,
``Butterfly Economics: A New General Theory of Social and Economic
Behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Such individuals don't exist, argues Ormerod, who has been head
of the economic assessment unit at The Economist and a visiting
professor at the Universities of London and Manchester and whose
first book was ``The Death of Economics.'' For one thing, few
people possess the skills to act completely rationally. More
important, he says, people are not isolated machines with fixed
tastes but rather social organisms who interact with and are
influenced by other individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Hence humans act unpredictably, Ormerod continues. At Christmas
they flock after toys like Cabbage Patch dolls or Nintendo Gameboys
in numbers that no manufacturer can anticipate. They turn films
like ``Anaconda'' and ``The Full Monty'' into unexpected hits. They
choose inferior technologies like VCRs and QWERTY keyboards over
superior alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   They drive up the price of stocks and currencies irrationally.
They become criminals in times of affluence and go straight when
times are bad. Their patterns of marriage and fertility often have
nothing to do with the economic conditions that theoretically ought
to influence them.
</P>
<P>
   How do we model the behavior of such creatures? Ormerod
illustrates how economists have been trying for a century or more,
vainly assuming that individuals have fixed tastes and live in
economies that operate like machines. Most egregiously, these
economists have failed to put their models to empirical tests, with
the inevitable result that the models have proved inadequate for
predicting.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Butterfly Economics'' Ormerod introduces a new kind of
model based on a view of society as a living organism and
underpinned by the mathematics of nonlinear probability. As he
writes, his image of the butterfly ``draws upon popular ideas of
chaos theory, in which the beating of the wings of a butterfly can
in principle cause a tornado on the other side of the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   His central image is based on a series of experiments with ants
carried out in the mid-1980s by entomologists. Two food sources
were placed equidistant from and on opposite sides of a nest and
kept equal in size no matter how much the ants took from each.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the experiments there was, by design, absolutely no reason
for the ants to prefer one of the sources to the other,'' Ormerod
writes, ``so we might start by expecting that the ants would split
evenly between them.'' But instead, partly because ants can signal
one another as to where food sources lie, the distribution
fluctuated wildly, even swinging at times from an 80:20 ratio to a
20:80 one. And when an economist modeled the behavior of the
colony, the resulting graph oscillated unpredictably in a pattern
resembling the fluctuations of a business cycle plotted over many
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But what do ants really have to do with the behavior of economic
man? Plenty, Ormerod argues. After showing how conventional
economic models have failed either to explain or predict how
industrial growth has been achieved in the West, he builds a
simplified model based on the principles of the ant experiment,
using companies instead of ants. And while the model doesn't
explain why growth occurs in a functioning economy, it reproduces
the pattern of that growth with an accuracy surpassing any
classical model, even suggesting why industrial growth in the
United States has surpassed that of any other region in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butterfly Economics'' is written for ``members of the general
public,'' as the author puts it. It is accessible and even
entertaining, avoiding the mathematics on which its ideas are based
(except in the appendices), although at times in his effort to be
lightly anecdotal Ormerod wanders somewhat far from the point.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance he proves his point a little too effectively.
Illustrating how people are generally ill-equipped to make rational
economic judgments, he introduces what he calls the Monty Hall
problem, in which a game-show contestant is asked to choose among
three doors, behind two of which are rubber ducks. Behind the third
is $10,000. When the contestant picks door A, the host, knowing
where the money lies, opens door C, revealing a rubber duck. The
contestant is then given the option of sticking with door A or
switching to door B.
</P>
<P>
   While most people stay with A, the correct strategy is to switch
to B because, Ormerod reasons: ``There is a 1 in 3 chance of the
money being behind door A, and a 2 in 3 chance of it being behind B
and C together. If you know there is zero chance of it being behind
C _ because Monty has opened it up for you _ then there is a 2 in 3
chance of it being behind B.''
</P>
<P>
   Can this really be the case? No wonder the problem tends, in
Ormerod's words, ``to lead otherwise sane and rational citizens to
the heights of frenzied argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in every other respect ``Butterfly Economics'' is
penetratingly lucid. It argues with particular strength that
governments ought to stop trying to control and predict what they
can't and start concentrating instead on enhancing the process by
which markets make important decisions, or, in the terms of
Ormerod's informing experiment, how ants choose to go to one food
source or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Ormerod even illuminates to what extent Marx was wrong in
predicting the end of capitalism's growth, and why Marx's mother,
in an anecdote the author insists is true, wrote to a relative,
``If only little Karl had made some capital rather than just
writing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ormerod not only writes about capital, but also points to a way
it may at last be understood.

<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ In the long, lurid history of drug trafficking
along Mexico's border with the United States, perhaps no fugitives
have been more notorious than the six brothers Arellano Felix.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, when gunmen working for them murdered a Roman
Catholic cardinal, several of the brothers have been among the most
wanted men in Mexico. In 1997, after the Arellanos were accused of
killing a series of Mexican police officials, one of them was named
to the FBI's 10-Most-Wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the most sustained and costly fight ever waged
against one of the drug mafias that have tormented Mexico, the
Arellanos and their most important associates have evaded capture,
emerging as glaring symbols of the failure of the American and
Mexican governments even to disrupt the powerful gangs that control
Mexico's drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Through plan after secret plan to combat the traffickers, their
business has thrived. According to American customs and law
enforcement officials, the flow of drugs across this part of the
border may now be heavier than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not working,'' said Thomas A. Constantine, former
head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. ``We know who they
are. We have arrest warrants against them. But for all the
high-level meetings, the task forces, the millions of dollars
spent, the major figures still aren't arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   A lengthy examination of the campaign against the Arellanos,
based on intelligence reports from both countries and dozens of
interviews, suggests that its most basic obstacle remains the
corruption that pervades Mexican law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But although officials of both governments have come to
acknowledge that corruption openly, some U.S. officials say it has
become almost a blanket excuse for failings that are both far more
complex and more evenly shared.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some American officials' insistence that finding the
Arellanos is simply a matter of Mexican political will, there is
considerable evidence for the assertions of Mexican officials that
the intelligence they get on the traffickers from the United States
is often inaccurate or incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, though a program to train elite Mexican police teams
is a centerpiece of the United States' international drug
enforcement strategy, the training is so limited that some American
officials say the new Mexican units are capable of only modest
antidrug operations.
</P>
<P>
   And though American agents and prosecutors have won sealed
indictments against most of the Arellanos and their main
associates, officials say the Clinton administration has done
little to press Mexico City to join in a viable plan to apprehend
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not rocket science,'' the former acting U.S. attorney
for the Southern District of California, Charles G. LaBella, said
in an interview. ``The Mexicans and the Americans could get these
guys tomorrow if they really wanted to. If we were serious about
it, we would pull out the stops.''
</P>
<P>
   With congressional pressure on the authorities rising in both
countries, particularly after their largely unsuccessful
collaboration in the recent search for mass graves purportedly left
by drug traffickers in Ciudad Juarez, officials are vowing once
again to step up their pressure on the Tijuana gang.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, federal prosecutors may soon unseal some of their
indictments against the Arellanos and their closest lieutenants.
Officials in Mexico City are considering moving federal police
forces into Tijuana as they once did in Cancun, raiding
traffickers' safe houses, confiscating their properties and
attacking their protective network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the Arellanos have a network of official
protection,'' the Mexican drug enforcement chief, Mariano Herran
Salvatti, said in an interview. But he added, ``We are now at a
point of being able to take action against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many officials who have worked on the Arellano case remain
skeptical. Though the Cancun operation was highly ambitious by
Mexican standards, they note, almost all of the big traffickers it
sought got away. In Baja California, moreover, such promises have
been heard many times before.
</P>
<P>
   Although few officials recognized it at the time, the slaying of
Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, during a gun battle between the
Arellanos and one of their rivals at the Guadalajara airport in
1993, signaled the emergence of a new drug threat in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Like their most prominent rivals along the border, those accused
in the cardinal's killing were sons of a well-known
drug-trafficking family, one of several clans that rose from the
peasantry in the rugged poppy and marijuana fields of the western
Sierra Madre.
</P>
<P>
   A second cousin of the Arellano brothers, Miguel Angel Felix
Gallardo, was thought to be the country's most powerful trafficker
before his 1989 arrest for the murder of an American drug agent.
But even compared to Felix Gallardo, the Arellanos were both more
cosmopolitan and more brazen about challenging the state.
</P>
<P>
   According to American court files, three of the older brothers _
Francisco, Eduardo and Benjamin, the reputed leader of the family's
criminal operations _ moved up the trafficking ladder by running
cocaine into Southern California. Once established in Tijuana in
the late 1980s, the brothers recruited gunmen from San Diego street
gangs and socialized widely, making friends among business people,
government officials and young English-speaking men from affluent
Tijuana families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in Tijuana had a chance to be friends with the
Arellanos in those days,'' a former mayor of Tijuana, Hector Osuna,
said of the years before the cardinal's killing. ``They weren't
fugitives, they weren't considered dangerous and they had a lot of
money to spread around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arellanos had very specific territorial ambitions. While
other big smugglers tried to extend their influence around the
country, the brothers focused on Tijuana and the rest of the Baja
California peninsula, the main drug gateway into the Western United
States. They might even have remained figures of secondary
importance had the cocaine trade not taken a timely, lucrative
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Like their biggest rivals, the brothers began demanding payment
in kind instead of cash for the South American cocaine they
smuggled north. The shift strengthened them as competitors with the
Colombians in the wholesale drug market in California and sent
their profits soaring, officials said.

 TIJUANA, Mexico: officials said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As law enforcement pressure on them intensified after the
cardinal's killing, the Arellanos lavished part of their windfall
on a network of lawyers, officials and others who paid bribes and
managed business beyond the brothers' underworld.
</P>
<P>
   According to one intelligence report, corrupt police agents
provided them with a steady flow of stolen vehicles, while allies
in the Mexican military arranged for their purchase of hundreds of
AK-47 assault rifles and even M-50 machine guns. Of every 10
Tijuana judges, one senior Mexican official who has worked in the
region said, ``11 of them are on the Arellanos' payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Through intermediaries, the brothers offered campaign
contributions to up-and-coming politicians and loans to struggling
business people. They expanded their contacts in government
offices, hotels and airports, newspapers and television stations.
Though American drug-intelligence analysts know little about their
finances _ including the real extent of their wealth _ they believe
the Arellanos began laundering profits into offshore accounts, real
estate and other investments.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and American officials said the brothers also grew more
sophisticated about communications and counterintelligence. From
safe houses set up with electronic surveillance equipment, they
wiretapped the telephones of police and military officials and even
some of their own associates. By stealing or ``cloning'' digital
cellular telephones in both Mexico and the United States, they are
able to change their numbers on almost a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, officials said, the Arellanos solidified their
network of protection with bribes, threats and killings on a scale
that Mexico had not seen before.
</P>
<P>
   After four years of frustration, U.S. and Mexican officials
resolved in 1997 to redouble their efforts in Tijuana,
collaborating more closely than ever before. To many officials it
seemed inevitable that the brothers' luck would run out.
</P>
<P>
   Over the previous year, the slayings of half a dozen senior
police officials and prosecutors had been attributed to the gang.
One former prosecutor was killed on his doorstep. The federal
police commander for Tijuana was ambushed in Mexico City. The head
of a special state investigations unit was shot to death in his
driveway; the killers then repeatedly ran over him with their van.
</P>
<P>
   That fall the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list included its first
Mexican drug trafficker, Ramon Arellano, 34, the brother who is
thought to run the gang's security forces. Washington ultimately
detailed more than 100 agents, analysts and prosecutors to the
case, and American officials sought to take advantage of what they
saw as new resolve in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are signaling a new, international effort to target this
very powerful drug cartel,'' the FBI director, Louis J. Freeh, said
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, American officials began meeting regularly with
leaders of two new Mexican antidrug squads: a police organized
crime unit trained by the enforcement agency and the FBI, and a
Mexican army intelligence unit trained by central intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   A third Mexican force _ a small police intelligence team that
had also been selected and trained with American help _ was to work
with a few American agents stationed in Tijuana. Should the police
teams ever locate the Arellanos, they could turn for support to new
airborne units of the Mexican army that were trained for drug raids
by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Initially American officials were thrilled with their progress.
</P>
<P>
   First, a Mexican army general who had taken over as the federal
attorney general's representative in Tijuana stunned the Americans
by turning in another general who had come to him on the Arellanos'
behalf offering bribes of $1 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   Then, tipped off by yet another Mexican general, Jesus Gutierrez
Rebollo, American agents arrested two of the gang's young gunmen at
a condominium on San Diego's tony Coronado Island. Next, in
December 1997, Mexican police officials arrested one of the
Arellanos' better-known lieutenants and agreed to try to extradite
him for trial in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A new Mexican attorney general, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, let
American agents and prosecutors comb Mexican files on dozens of
killings attributed to the Arellanos so that they might develop
witnesses for their own cases in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the new organized crime force, Samuel Gonzalez
Ruiz, went further, quietly assigning three of his own agents to
work directly with the Americans in San Diego. Later, over the
objections of other Mexican officials, Gonzalez even arranged the
secret transfer of two Mexican convicts to American prisons so they
could testify before a federal grand jury hearing evidence against
the Arellano gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing like it had ever happened before,'' an American drug
enforcement official recalled. ``Of course we were encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the new policies and programs, however, the two
governments made scant progress toward their goal of arresting the
brothers and their main associates.
</P>
<P>
   The army general who had famously refused the traffickers'
bribes later shocked American officials by announcing publicly _
and without any apparent proof _ that the Arellanos had abandoned
Tijuana and might be out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Gutierrez Rebollo, whose pressure on the brothers had
helped him gain appointment as Mexico's drug enforcement chief, was
found to be working secretly with their main rival. The promised
extradition of the Arellano lieutenant quickly got bogged down in
Mexican courts.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, drug enforcement and FBI officials grew so
suspicious of a Mexican federal police commander in Tijuana that
they cut him out of sensitive meetings altogether, several
officials said. Eventually they began holding early-morning
strategy sessions with Gonzalez Ruiz, the trusted anticrime chief,
and then having him sneak out the back door of their offices so he
could come back in the front for meetings to which the less
trustworthy officials were also invited.
</P>
<P>
   But even Gonzalez, a former academic with little police
experience, was distressingly straightforward about his
limitations. At one meeting described by several American
officials, he urged them not to press for the arrest of the
Arellanos' chief lieutenant, Ismael Higuera, arguing that the
trafficker was simply too well protected. A senior Mexican justice
official would not comment on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1998, officials said, Gonzalez and other senior Mexican
officials had effectively abandoned Tijuana for what appeared to be
a more fruitful investigation of traffickers working out of the
southern resort of Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   The Arellanos, however, did not wait for the Mexican authorities
to retreat.

 TIJUANA, Mexico: to retreat. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As law enforcement pressure rose, officials said, the
traffickers killed at least half a dozen Mexicans whom they
suspected of informing on them to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   American officials responded by relocating whole Mexican
families to the United States to safeguard witnesses who did not
enter the federal witness protection program. But the impact was
felt nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly has a chilling effect on the police and the
judges and the prosecutors when some of them get killed,'' William
D. Gore, FBI chief in San Diego, said of the violence. ``It has to
have a chilling effect on the witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late summer of 1998, Washington's interest in Tijuana
also appeared to be waning. LaBella, who had taken over as interim
U.S. attorney in San Diego after spending six years as deputy,
concluded that the hard-won indictments would be wasted unless the
two governments developed a strategy to capture the Arellanos.
</P>
<P>
   He offered a bold plan, which required the Clinton
administration to press the Mexican government for significant new
help.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoning that only Mexican agents could pursue the traffickers
in Mexico and that Arellano informers would detect even a small
Mexican force in or around Tijuana, LaBella proposed stationing
such a force in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   If its members were carefully chosen, isolated and fed the best
intelligence information that the United States could develop, he
argued, why could the team not slip back across the border by
helicopter to hit the traffickers?
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have gone to the Mexican government at a high level
and said, `This is our opportunity to catch these guys,''' he said
in an interview. ``What were they going to say?''
</P>
<P>
   Some other law enforcement officials questioned whether such a
plan would work. But LaBella said his main obstacle was that senior
Justice Department officials simply ignored the proposal. A Justice
Department spokesman, Myron Marlin, declined to comment on the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the Arellanos have prospered even as they have
gone deeper underground, leaving the handling of their smuggling
operations and graft arrangements to Higuera. At the same time, the
failings of the campaign against them have grown more evident,
calling into question the two governments' regular assertions of
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   One example of those problems followed the birth of a son last
year in San Diego to Eduardo Arellano, 42, the brother who is
believed to handle the gang's financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
   American agents tracked Arellano's common-law wife and the baby
back to the Tijuana border, where the agents handed the information
off to a small Mexican police intelligence unit stationed there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten minutes later, they said they had lost them,'' one senior
American official complained. Another official added, ``And that
was it: no followup, no wiretaps, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some American agents suspected corruption, a
knowledgeable Mexican official gave a simpler explanation: The
neophyte Mexican agents knew little about how to follow criminal
suspects in a car.
</P>
<P>
   Few U.S. officials seemed surprised by the account. Even before
the elite teams began operating in 1996, senior American officials
argued that in order to be effective, the new Mexican agents _ most
of them fresh from the police academy _ would need considerably
more American training than the five weeks they get. More senior
officials, eager to get the teams in place, decided otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mexican and U.S. officials who work with the teams,
some of the new agents barely knew how to drive. Agents assigned to
so-called border intelligence units are not even allowed to
cultivate informers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite American promises of new computers, some Mexican agents
said, they work on machines so old that they cannot run a basic
program to encrypt the intelligence reports they send to Mexico
City. For a time they were even without office furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, for all their complaints about Mexican corruption, have
U.S. law enforcement officials devoted much effort to solving the
specific problems that such corruption creates. Again, Eduardo
Arellano was a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 22, 1998, according to a Mexican intelligence report,
Arellano and his wife, Sonia Martinez, were at home with their two
children in Tijuana when the propane barbecue grill exploded in
their patio, burning them badly. Ms. Martinez and her children were
rushed across the border to a burn treatment center at the
University of California at San Diego hospital, where they were
immediately put under surveillance. Arellano was treated by doctors
in Tijuana, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the brothers' reputation for lavish bribes, the family
hit a cash shortage as the hospital bill shot toward $1 million,
officials said. FBI agents investigating one of the Arellanos' San
Diego-based associates learned that he had been solicited by
Higuera for an emergency contribution, and they passed word of a
planned meeting to agents of the Mexican intelligence team in
Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   As some American officials told the story, the Mexicans simply
dropped the ball, backing off at their first glimpse of what was
apparently Higuera's formidable security detail and then waiting
almost eight hours to carry out a raid.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials denied that their agents backed away and said
it was unclear whether Higuera was ever even at the house. But
their account, which picks up where the American version left off,
is enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   When Mexican agents went to a Tijuana district judge seeking an
arrest warrant, they said, the judge ignored the request. After
hours of pleading while the house was under surveillance, the
agents eventually persuaded a local army commander to send 20
soldiers to back them up. But when they did finally hit the house,
35 strong, they found only the San Diego trafficker's mother,
another of her sons and two of her nephews.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, a lawyer who the authorities believe is linked
to the Arellanos arrived on the scene, demanding to see a search
warrant and then complaining of an illegal search. For days
thereafter, officials said, Tijuana newspapers carried articles
attacking the army commander for the raid; American officials said
they overheard the San Diego trafficker, in wiretapped
conversations, arranging to pay off reporters for the articles.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican police officials said the agents called the army
commander again on Jan. 17, when an American agent in Tijuana sent
them a report that Eduardo Arellano could be found at the home of
Ms. Martinez's parents. This time the commander balked, saying he
would move without a warrant only if the agents were absolutely
certain that someone named Arellano would be found inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think that the moment they give us information, we're
supposed to burst into whatever place they point to,'' one Mexican
intelligence official said. ``We have laws here _ just as you do _
and we have to respect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Arellano was in fact not at the house, Mexican officials said,
and the raid was never ordered.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico _ In the long, lurid history of drug trafficking
along Mexico's border with the United States, perhaps no fugitives
have been more notorious than the six brothers Arellano Felix.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, when gunmen working for them murdered a Roman
Catholic cardinal, several of the brothers have been among the most
wanted men in Mexico. In 1997, after the Arellanos were accused of
killing a series of Mexican police officials, one of them was named
to the FBI's 10-Most-Wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the most sustained and costly fight ever waged
against one of the drug mafias that have tormented Mexico, the
Arellanos and their most important associates have evaded capture,
emerging as glaring symbols of the failure of the American and
Mexican governments even to disrupt the powerful gangs that control
Mexico's drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Through plan after secret plan to combat the traffickers, their
business has thrived. According to American customs and law
enforcement officials, the flow of drugs across this part of the
border may now be heavier than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not working,'' said Thomas A. Constantine, former
head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. ``We know who they
are. We have arrest warrants against them. But for all the
high-level meetings, the task forces, the millions of dollars
spent, the major figures still aren't arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   A lengthy examination of the campaign against the Arellanos,
based on intelligence reports from both countries and dozens of
interviews, suggests that its most basic obstacle remains the
corruption that pervades Mexican law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But although officials of both governments have come to
acknowledge that corruption openly, some U.S. officials say it has
become almost a blanket excuse for failings that are both far more
complex and more evenly shared.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some American officials' insistence that finding the
Arellanos is simply a matter of Mexican political will, there is
considerable evidence for the assertions of Mexican officials that
the intelligence they get on the traffickers from the United States
is often inaccurate or incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, though a program to train elite Mexican police teams
is a centerpiece of the United States' international drug
enforcement strategy, the training is so limited that some American
officials say the new Mexican units are capable of only modest
antidrug operations.
</P>
<P>
   And though American agents and prosecutors have won sealed
indictments against most of the Arellanos and their main
associates, officials say the Clinton administration has done
little to press Mexico City to join in a viable plan to apprehend
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not rocket science,'' the former acting U.S. attorney
for the Southern District of California, Charles G. LaBella, said
in an interview. ``The Mexicans and the Americans could get these
guys tomorrow if they really wanted to. If we were serious about
it, we would pull out the stops.''
</P>
<P>
   With congressional pressure on the authorities rising in both
countries, particularly after their largely unsuccessful
collaboration in the recent search for mass graves purportedly left
by drug traffickers in Ciudad Juarez, officials are vowing once
again to step up their pressure on the Tijuana gang.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, federal prosecutors may soon unseal some of their
indictments against the Arellanos and their closest lieutenants.
Officials in Mexico City are considering moving federal police
forces into Tijuana as they once did in Cancun, raiding
traffickers' safe houses, confiscating their properties and
attacking their protective network.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials who have worked on the Arellano case remain
skeptical. Though the Cancun operation was highly ambitious by
Mexican standards, they note, almost all of the big traffickers it
sought got away. In Baja California, moreover, such promises have
been heard many times before.
</P>
<P>
   Although few officials recognized it at the time, the slaying of
Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, during a gun battle between the
Arellanos and one of their rivals at the Guadalajara airport in
1993, signaled the emergence of a new drug threat in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Like their most prominent rivals along the border, those accused
in the cardinal's killing were sons of a well-known
drug-trafficking family, one of several clans that rose from the
peasantry in the rugged poppy and marijuana fields of the western
Sierra Madre.
</P>
<P>
   As law enforcement pressure on them intensified after the
cardinal's killing, the Arellanos lavished money on a network of
lawyers, officials and others who paid bribes and managed business
beyond the brothers' underworld.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to one intelligence report, corrupt police agents
provided them with a steady flow of stolen vehicles, while allies
in the Mexican military arranged for their purchase of hundreds of
AK-47 assault rifles and even M-50 machine guns. Of every 10
Tijuana judges, one senior Mexican official who has worked in the
region said, ``11 of them are on the Arellanos' payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Through intermediaries, the brothers offered campaign
contributions to up-and-coming politicians and loans to struggling
business people. They expanded their contacts in government
offices, hotels and airports, newspapers and television stations.
Though American drug-intelligence analysts know little about their
finances _ including the real extent of their wealth _ they believe
the Arellanos began laundering profits into offshore accounts, real
estate and other investments.
</P>
<P>
   After four years of frustration, U.S. and Mexican officials
resolved in 1997 to redouble their efforts in Tijuana,
collaborating more closely than ever before. To many officials it
seemed inevitable that the brothers' luck would run out.
</P>
<P>
   Over the previous year, the slayings of half a dozen senior
police officials and prosecutors had been attributed to the gang.
One former prosecutor was killed on his doorstep. The federal
police commander for Tijuana was ambushed in Mexico City. The head
of a special state investigations unit was shot to death in his
driveway; the killers then repeatedly ran over him with their van.
</P>
<P>
   Washington ultimately detailed more than 100 agents, analysts
and prosecutors to the case, and American officials sought to take
advantage of what they saw as new resolve in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are signaling a new, international effort to target this
very powerful drug cartel,'' the FBI director, Louis J. Freeh, said
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Initially American officials were thrilled with their progress.
</P>
<P>
   First, a Mexican army general who had taken over as the federal
attorney general's representative in Tijuana stunned the Americans
by turning in another general who had come to him on the Arellanos'
behalf offering bribes of $1 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   Then, tipped off by yet another Mexican general, Jesus Gutierrez
Rebollo, American agents arrested two of the gang's young gunmen at
a condominium on San Diego's tony Coronado Island. Next, in
December 1997, Mexican police officials arrested one of the
Arellanos' better-known lieutenants and agreed to try to extradite
him for trial in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A new Mexican attorney general, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, let
American agents and prosecutors comb Mexican files on dozens of
killings attributed to the Arellanos so that they might develop
witnesses for their own cases in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the new organized crime force, Samuel Gonzalez
Ruiz, went further, quietly assigning three of his own agents to
work directly with the Americans in San Diego. Later, over the
objections of other Mexican officials, Gonzalez even arranged the
secret transfer of two Mexican convicts to American prisons so they
could testify before a federal grand jury hearing evidence against
the Arellano gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing like it had ever happened before,'' an American drug
enforcement official recalled. ``Of course we were encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the new policies and programs, however, the two
governments made scant progress toward their goal of arresting the
brothers and their main associates.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Gutierrez Rebollo, whose pressure on the brothers had
helped him gain appointment as Mexico's drug enforcement chief, was
found to be working secretly with their main rival. The promised
extradition of the Arellano lieutenant quickly got bogged down in
Mexican courts.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, drug enforcement and FBI officials grew so
suspicious of a Mexican federal police commander in Tijuana that
they cut him out of sensitive meetings altogether, several
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the Arellanos have prospered even as they have
gone deeper underground, leaving the handling of their smuggling
operations and graft arrangements to an associate. At the same
time, the failings of the campaign against them have grown more
evident, calling into question the two governments' regular
assertions of resolve.

SURVEY OF THE MILITARY FINDS STRESS AND WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's armed forces are stressed out, underpaid
and worried about the military's ability to meet all of the new
demands placed on it, according to a two-year private survey of
military personnel released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned by the Center for Security and International
Studies, the survey asked 12,000 members of the military about
morale, leadership, readiness, quality of life and commitment to
military values.
</P>
<P>
   Their answers have a familiar ring to Defense Department
officials who have made improving the quality of life for the
military a top priority and to candidates for the presidency who
are debating how to strengthen the American armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``In taking the pulse of today's military this study found a
profound stress on the armed forces,'' said the report, entitled
``American Military Culture in the 21st Century.''
</P>
<P>
   That stress is rooted in the 300 percent increase in overseas
deployments for a force that has been cut by more than one-third
over the past decade. At the same time the defense budget was
reduced earlier in the decade to reflect the end of the Cold War
and the breakup of the Soviet Union, leading to cuts that the
report says were too deep.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Defense Department had its first real budget
increase of the decade, including a 4.8 percent pay increase for
the military. But the report claims there are still not enough
resources to keep up with technological changes and with the
military's new ``nontraditional'' roles, like peacekeeping, drug
interdiction and humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a thoughtful study and it raises issues that we as a
department are focused on day in and day out, '' said P.J. Crowley,
a Pentagon spokesman. ``When you look back at the decade of the
'90s there is no question that we have undergone a dramatic shift
in the way we operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the all-volunteer military has older service members,
more than half of whom are married, often to spouses who work
outside the home, the questions of pay, housing, health benefits
and family stability were top on the list of concerns, the survey
found.
</P>
<P>
   Those worries translated into lower morale, said Joseph Collins,
the project director at CSIS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just at a time when military members are needed at home more
and more to share family responsibilities they are being deployed
more often,'' said Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found a concern about how the increasing emphasis
on minimizing casualties was affecting the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire military cultural ethic depends on self sacrifice,
so if you tell the military to go into harm's way but you can't
take casualties, you've got a problem,'' said Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Two pleasant surprises from the survey were the strength of
those military values in all services and all ranks, and the number
of close friendships between members of the military and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Less welcome were results showing an uneven quality of
leadership and questions about the necessity for all the overseas
deployments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The complaints contained in the study read alternately like a
plea from the Defense Department for more money and like a campaign
stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   In his first address on defense, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the front-runner for the Republican nomination, said that something
had to give in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely has our military been so freely used _ an average of
one deployment every nine weeks in the last few years,'' Bush said.
``Since the end of the Cold War, our ground forces have been
deployed more frequently, while our defense budget has fallen by
nearly 40 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowley, the Pentagon spokesman, said that while there was no
question of the increased stress and strain of deployments on the
military, the United States has more often been criticized for
refusing to intervene, most recently to prevent genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say in the rhetoric of a campaign there are
too many missions, '' he said. ``But when you ask which would you
not have done, it becomes much harder.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Metropolitan Museum of Art's ambitions have
grown, the target of its fund-raising drive, which in 1994 was set
at $300 million, has ratcheted higher and higher. With an
announcement to be made Monday, the Met has more than doubled its
goal, to $650 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Met's initial fund-raising campaign was for construction
work that included renovating and expanding its Greek and Roman
galleries and establishing a $100 million endowment for curatorial,
educational and conservation projects. In 1997 the museum increased
its goal to $400 million to expand the Greek and Roman galleries
project, among other endeavors, as well as to increase the museum's
endowment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the museum is to announce that it hopes to raise
another $250 million for further renovations and investments, for a
total of $650 million.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe de Montebello, director of the Met, said that $450
million had been raised, including $50 million that had been
dedicated to the latest effort.
</P>
<P>
   Since the museum cannot expand into Central Park because of an
agreement it made with the city in the 1970s, it has been scouring
its building for air shafts and stairwells, neglected storage rooms
and unused areas surrounding skylights _ any scrap of overlooked
space _ that could be used to enlarge a gallery or create a new
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a campaign of ingenuity,'' de Montebello said.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a campaign that for the first time in the museum's
history includes $50 million earmarked only for acquisitions. Since
1997, when the museum was hard hit by the loss of more than $10
million from Reader's Digest Association stock dividends, 25
percent of which were budgeted for acquisitions, the Met has been
looking for alternative sources of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good chunk of acquisitions money, which is the
lifeblood of the place,'' said John Rosenwald Jr., vice chairman of
the museum and executive chairman of its fund-raising campaign.
``It has deflated the myth that the Met is huge and rich and
doesn't need anything.''
</P>
<P>
   New York state has contributed $6.1 million for projects like
the Greek and Roman galleries. The city has committed $14.8 million
toward those galleries and projects like a new Center for Imaging
and Photography.
</P>
<P>
   For the newly broadened campaign the city has committed another
$30 million for rehabilitating the Great Hall, cleaning and
relighting the facade, redesigning the exterior fountains, doing
structural work on the Egyptian wing, and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   One of the campaign's biggest undertakings will move the
restaurant from the south side of the museum to the terrace along
Central Park at the western edge of the glassed-in Charles
Englehard Court, which is part of the American Wing.
</P>
<P>
   The former restaurant area will become a Roman sculpture court,
following a plan from 1910, when the museum opened that portion of
the building. (In April the Met opened its 140-foot-long
neoclassical barrel-vaulted Greek galleries along the south
corridor of the Great Hall.)
</P>
<P>
   Plans also call for preservation work on the Cloisters, the
Metropolitan's branch for medieval art in Fort Tryon Park, made
from the reconstituted remnants of centuries-old chapels,
cathedrals and monasteries from Spain and France. The building,
which suffers from water damage, needs to be stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an urgent need,'' de Montebello said. ``It can't be
delayed any longer without risking the works of art.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many places in the Met now being refurbished had not been
touched for decades. The Great Hall, or lobby, was last redesigned
in 1968, when the museum had fewer than 2 million visitors a year;
it now must accommodate more than 5 million a year. For the last
three months the museum has been repositioning the admissions and
information desks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're experimenting with different configurations to see how
they work,'' de Montebello said. ``The idea is to keep it
uncluttered and very user-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   In looking for space for new galleries, museum officials
discovered all kinds of forgotten places, like a storage area for
European metalworks beneath the Great Stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went down there, I realized it's a turn-of-the-century
arched, all-brick space that looks like a crypt in a Byzantine
church,'' de Montebello said. The space will become an additional
Byzantine gallery. ``Demolition has already started,'' he added.
``We're leaving the bricks exposed. It will be a magical, romantic
place when it opens later this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, where thousands of museum
visitors come each week for concerts and lectures, has not been
renovated since 1954. Plans include upgrading the acoustics,
installing new lighting and sound-system equipment and replacing
the seating and stage floor.
</P>
<P>
   By using former air shafts the museum plans to enlarge and
renovate its Thomas J. Watson Library. Designed in 1965 for what
was then a collection of 300,000 books, catalogs and periodicals,
the library would expand into a courtyard next to its reading room
to accommodate its 450,000 titles and a new electronic resource
center providing access to other museums worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never-ending,'' de Montebello said. ``By the time we
finish this, we'll have to start all over again.''

L.A. TIMES PROMOTES EDITOR WHO CRITICIZED PROFITS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of the rebellion in the newsroom of The Los Angeles
Times after the disclosure of its profit-sharing agreement with the
Staples Center sports arena, Michael Parks, the newspaper's editor,
has given day-to-day responsibility for the paper to one of the
critics of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Wolinsky, who had been one of four managing editors, was
promoted to executive editor. The announcement was greeted with
applause when announced last Friday, said Henry Weinstein, a Times
reporter. Wolinsky will have ``overall responsibility for The
Times' newsroom operations,'' a news release said.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Wolinsky said the changes were ``the
result of Michael's introspection following Staples.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not just Staples,'' he added. ``It's his estimation
of everything we've seen since then and what's wrong with the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the unusual arrangement to share with the
Staples Center the profits from an issue of the paper's Sunday
magazine devoted to the opening of the arena infuriated The Times'
newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of their fury was summed up by John Morton, an
industry analyst, who wrote recently that the deal broke two
newspaper ``golden rules.'' First, that ``readers should always
know what is and is not for sale in the newspaper.'' Second, that
``a newspaper should never have an economic, political or other
interest in enterprises or institutions that are subject to news
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks had been widely criticized for failing to scuttle the
agreement, to kill the Sunday magazine or to inform readers of the
arrangement. According to both Wolinsky and Weinstein, Parks told
the staff last Friday that he had considered resigning in recent
weeks but had rejected the idea, saying he thinks he can play a
positive role.
</P>
<P>
   In a long reconstruction of the events surrounding the Staples
Center deal, The Times' media critic, David Shaw, quoted Parks as
saying, ``I underestimated the impact of the Staples arrangement on
our credibility, on the journalistic ethos that we foster, on our
standing in the community and in the profession. And for all those
things, I have profound regret.''
</P>
<P>
   The news release said Parks had also appointed Ardith Hilliard,
the editor of the newspaper's San Fernando Valley edition, as
associate editor and assistant to the editor. She will be
responsible in part for ensuring that the newspaper's new set of
guidelines for contacts between the business and editorial sides of
the paper are followed.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last Friday, Wolinsky said the Staples Center
controversy ``made us look at the basic values of journalism in the
newsroom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really in a back-to-basics mode here,'' Wolinsky said.
``All these other concerns about increasing revenues and developing
new products _ that's fine for the paper. It's not fine for the
newsroom.''

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Duba-Yurt) _ Russia's acting president,

Grozny to mark Orthodox Christmas and the end of Ramadan, the
Muslim holiday. But there is no moratorium here. In fact, fighting
raged in Chechnya's mountains and lowlands on Sunday, as both sides
decided this was a perfect time to clash. Trying to turn the
Russian-controlled areas of Chechnya into a battlefield and destroy
the confidence of Russian troops, several hundred Islamic rebels
were reported to have surrounded the headquarters of the Russian

flowing from a hole near here, the state's producers are trying to
suck the last drops from wells producing an average of a quarter of
a barrel a day. Now, the few hundred people still employed in the
industry face a threat they say could bring state oil production to
an end. Environmental authorities are requiring them to spend
thousands of dollars a well plugging holes that have been abandoned
for decades. The result is a collision between the heritage of the
industry's earliest days and the real-life environmental
consequences of the present.

INTERNET SHOWS SIGNS OF BECOMING TOP MARKETPLACE IN THE BOOK
BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new holiday survey of seasoned Internet users indicates that
customers are straying from the bookshelves to buy titles online,
with a majority actually making more literary purchases in virtual
book shops than in standard stores.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting released the results last week of an
eight-day survey that showed that old-fashioned shopping remains an
enduring and robust custom but that books are the leading product
that this bellwether group of customers prefers to purchase online.
</P>
<P>
   Books and videotapes were the only items that more people bought
online than in stores, according to the survey, which polled 541
Internet users between Dec. 27 and Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confirms that books are the leading edge of the
transition in shopping that's taking place across the economy,''
said David Brodwin, an associate partner who tracks media and
entertainment for Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven percent of the shoppers bought books online while 37
percent made purchases through traditional stores and the remainder
through catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, video customers made 35 percent of their purchases
through Web sites and 30 percent through physical stores.
</P>
<P>
   The same participants also were involved in a similar October
study. The surveys have a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books are much less risky to buy than buying a piece of
apparel so books have really taken off as a category,'' Brodwin
said, noting that a barrage of advertisements and marketing efforts
from companies like Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com had
apparently helped to reassure customers.
</P>
<P>
   He added that among the shopping categories, which ranged from
clothing and toys to computer software and consumer electronics,
books stood out as a safe electronic purchase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, customers can more easily mimic the retail shopping
experience in a store, by browsing chapters of books posted online.
Still, there appears to be a split developing between men and
women. Men appeared to prefer online shopping; 56 percent of the
men bought books over the Internet, compared with 40 percent of
women.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey suggests there are still limits to Internet
shopping. For example, 81 percent of the customers bought clothing
in conventional stores and 29 percent from electronic stores. The
numbers add up to more than 100 percent because of overlapping
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   And at the same time, the customers reported that the digital
shopping experience was not always smooth. Nine out of 10 shoppers
abandoned their electronic shopping baskets at some point during
their browsing.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly 40 percent reported some problem with the Internet
shopping experience, although they claimed the highest satisfaction
level with that form.
</P>
<P>
   The leading complaint was about out-of-stock products. After
that, users bemoaned that purchases were not delivered on time or
delivery charges were excessive. They also had trouble making
connections or navigating a site.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the dominant and overwhelming complaint about
holiday shopping in traditional stores centered on too many people:
overcrowding, long lines, limited parking. The exception to that
was another dominant complaint: the dearth of sales help to answer
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge with Internet shopping is that there's a
tremendous amount of capacity needed to do the site right,''
Brodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way of looking at this,'' he added, ``is that Internet
shopping is not so great. It still has profound flaws. The key
message is that these companies that want to play in this space
have got to fix these problems.''

AN AFRICAN FAITH RIVALS CATHOLICISM IN BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALVADOR, Brazil _ To the traditionalists who dominate the Roman
Catholic Church here, the choice is clear: the word of God vs. a
resurgent paganism.
</P>
<P>
   But to a predominantly black group of local clergy and lay
people, the doctrinal dispute that has erupted in Brazil's oldest
diocese is merely the latest round in a 400-year struggle for
religious tolerance and respect.
</P>
<P>
   With positions on both sides hardening, the result is a schism
that has taken on racial overtones. Since mid-1998, the diocese's
most prominent black bishop has been transferred to a remote
parish, black laymen's groups have complained that certain churches
have closed their doors to them, and charges that blacks have been
systematically excluded from the priesthood are growing.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the conflict is the African-derived faith known
as Candomble, which has particularly strong roots in this city of 2
million that the Italian writer Umberto Eco called ``the Black
Rome'' in one of his novels. Like Santeria in the Spanish-speaking
Caribbean or voodoo in Haiti, Candomble merges the identities of
African deities and Roman Catholic saints, so that St. George, for
instance, is also Ogum, the god of war and of metals.
</P>
<P>
   Followers of Candomble, created by slaves, were persecuted by
both religious and civil authorities throughout the colonial period
and well into modern times. But the faith was never stamped out.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Candomble adherents has been growing rapidly
across Brazil in recent years, as what was once a lower-class
religion has come to be seen as something to be valued as
authentically Brazilian, and its increasingly assertive clergy have
begun to demand greater recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Many within the Roman Catholic Church, however, see that trend
as harmful. ``I am going to continue combating syncretism,''
Cardinal Lucas Moreira Neves said not long after arriving here in
1987, adding that while such practices might have been
understandable during slavery days, when slave owners tried to
force the slaves to abandon African beliefs, ``now, with total
freedom of religion in Brazil, everyone must follow their own
faith, without mixtures.''
</P>
<P>
   So when an annual conference of black priests and bishops was
held here in July with an agenda that included a visit to the
city's two principal Candomble temples, the criticism from
conservatives was not long in coming. A French-born priest, the
Rev. Pierre Mathon, quickly announced that he intended to celebrate
a ``mass of repudiation'' of religious practices that he described
as ``demonic,'' and he accused black clergy of deviating from the
one true faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dialogue is fine, but to condone Catholic priests receiving
blessings from Candomble priests just is not acceptable,'' Mathon
said in a sermon. ``These priests are the Church itself, and they
are setting a bad example.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is the world's largest Roman Catholic country, at least
nominally. More than 80 percent of the country's 165 million people
identify themselves as Catholics, though many _ perhaps even a
majority _ also profess or practice Candomble and its variants,
such as Macumba and Umbanda.
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute here has repercussions for Roman Catholicism
that go far beyond Brazil. Early this year, Neves was promoted to a
new post in Rome, prefect of the Bishops Congregation, which put
him in charge of the process of selecting new bishops and gives him
powers to see that his orthodox views are enforced around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the rift has appeared at a time when the Catholic
Church has made proselytism in Africa and Asia its top priority for
the new century. In those places, according to clerical leaders
here who are sympathetic to Candomble, Catholicism is inevitably
going to have to seek accommodation with other local religions that
have animist elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue here is the evangelization of Africa and who is
going to go there and what they are going to say,'' said the Rev.
Alfredo Souza Doria, chaplain of the Church of Our Lady of the
Black Rosary, a center of black religious consciousness here since
its founding in the 1700s by freed slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 500 years, we believe that we, the colonized, have a
right to speak, because we have a theology and philosophy too.''
</P>
<P>
   Neves has been replaced here by Monsignor Geraldo Majella, who
was transferred from Rome, where he had been secretary of the
Congregation for the Divine Faith and Discipline of the Sacraments,
which oversees questions of liturgy. Though Majella has attended
some ecumenical events since his arrival last March, he made it
clear in an interview at his office here that he intends to
continue to enforce doctrinal orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syncretism arises when people may not have a profound
knowledge of religion and their faith,'' he said. ``Therefore they
believe that anything goes, that everything is fine, that you can
mix the faith of the Church with that of another creed, as if with
some kind of blender.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Majella continued, the notion that ``I can go to a church
and take the sacraments and also go to Candomble'' is a
misconception, ``the result of a lack of training in catechism.''
He added: ``We must respect the doctrine of the Church, respecting
the faith of each and every person, but we want that faith to be
enlightened, without confusing people.''
</P>
<P>
   Within Candomble, there are also disagreements about the proper
relationship with the Catholic Church. Maria Estella Azevedo dos
Santos, who is the ialorixa, or high priestess, of the Ile Axe Opo
Afonja terreiro, or temple, and is the most influential religious
figure here, has also condemned syncretism in terms that Majella
said he applauds with ``the greatest admiration and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not against the Catholic religion, but we do oppose
syncretism,'' Ms. Azevedo dos Santos _ better known by her
religious name, Mae Stella de Oxossi, or Mother Stella _ said
recently. ``One thing does not take away the validity of the other,
but you cannot mix them together very much.''
</P>
<P>
   But until her death this year, the leader of another powerful
Candomble temple, Gantois, always argued that since ``all roads
lead to God,'' to hold so dogmatic a position is unrealistic.
``After all these centuries, you cannot separate them,'' Mother
Cleusa of Gantois said of Catholicism and Candomble in an interview
a few years ago.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government, which has long had political
differences with the National Council of Bishops, has largely
remained aloof from the theological dispute here other than to note
that the Constitution of 1988 guarantees full freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Candomble followers got an important boost when
the minister of culture, Francisco Weffort, came here in late
November to declare the Ile Axe Opo Afonja temple part of the
``national patrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a national monument and we should protect it,''
Weffort said in a speech at the temple, adding that the measure was
part of an effort to ``right wrongs done to blacks in the past.''
He also awarded the ``medallion of cultural merit'' to Mother
Stella, who was celebrating the 60th anniversary of her induction
into the priesthood, and was photographed kissing her hand in the
same manner as the supplicants who seek her blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The local governor and mayor also attended the ceremony.
Ignoring the criticisms of other members of the church hierarchy,
the black bishop who had been sent to the periphery, Monsignor
Gilio Felicio, came too and was wildly applauded when one speaker
described him as a ``companion and partner in our struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That event was an enormous victory for Candomble followers,''
said Juca Ferreira, a city councilman who has worked closely with
Mother Stella and other priestesses. ``The state was saying it
finally recognizes that not only Catholic churches are part of our
national legacy and birthright.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a prosecutor here has started an investigation of
Mathon with the intention of filing charges against him for
violating Brazil's freedom-of-religion statute. ``It is against the
law to create a climate that discourages others from practicing
their faith, and that is what he has attempted to do,'' the
prosecutor, Lidivaldo Britto, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Majella acknowledged that the Brazilian church must do more to
address the spiritual needs of its black parishioners and urged
them to be patient, saying that an effort is under way to attract
and train more black priests and bishops. But Alberico Paiva
Pereira, leader of the Brotherhood of Our Lady of the Black Rosary,
a Catholic layman's group here, argues that this is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Church must come to understand the religious dualism that
has always existed in Bahia and Brazil, and recognize that its
values are not the only ones that are worthwhile,'' he said. ``In a
country in which most people are black, you have to do this, or
else the Church itself will die.''

   By now the outlines of Eleanor Roosevelt's life and worthy works
are so well known that a television account of them, even at two
hours, promises little news. That expectation is fulfilled in
Monday night's ``American Experience,'' which tells the oft-told
story with due sympathy for a young woman's quest to find her own
strengths and with ample appreciation of how she used them.
Although unstartling, this affectionate biography should enhance
the reputation that Mrs. Roosevelt won over the decades and that
has survived in the years since her death in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up with a mother who was disappointed in her looks, her
shyness and her social prospects and with a father whose alcoholism
sent him to an asylum. Her potential was awakened at an English
boarding school where, Alfre Woodard, the narrator, says she was
``taught to be independent and politically aware.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her marriage in 1905 to the up-and-coming Franklin D.
Roosevelt was a love match, it brought his young wife under the
domination of his mother, Sara, a tough old bird who tried with
considerable success to run the young couple's lives. As children
came, the younger Mrs. Roosevelt found that being a mother was no
more fulfilling than being a daughter-in-law; working outside the
home in behalf of immigrants and the needy proved far more
rewarding. (Her record as a mother was not brilliant; her five
children managed to accumulate 19 marriages among them.)
</P>
<P>
   The much-explored peeks into Franklin Roosevelt's long affair
with Lucy Mercer, his wife's social secretary, and into Mrs.
Roosevelt's relationship with Lorena Hickok, an Associated Press
reporter, are covered with understanding for all parties and
discretion as to the details. As the program puts the situation
politely, after Mrs. Roosevelt learned of the Mercer affair, the
Roosevelts ``never lived together as husband and wife again.''
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways the two grew closer after Roosevelt was struck
by polio yet resolved to continue his political career. Whatever
the connubial restraints, the program assures us that they proved
to be ``extraordinary political partners.'' Mrs. Roosevelt became a
sort of ambassador for her husband and a player on her own, joining
in reform movements for many causes (including some, she would
discover, run by Communists), writing her famous newspaper column,
``My Day,'' and even endorsing products. (Her first client was the
Simmons Mattress Co.)
</P>
<P>
   She is credited here with orchestrating the recital of Marian
Anderson, the black contralto, at the Lincoln Memorial after the
Daughters of the American Revolution had denied her permission to
sing in Constitution Hall. It was a tribute to the breadth of Mrs.
Roosevelt's causes and the nature of her associations that she
attracted the attentions of J. Edgar Hoover. Her biographer,
Blanche Wiesen Cook, reports that the first lady's 3,000-page FBI
file reflected Hoover's intense dislike and suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of Roosevelt's death in 1945, his wife had long
since found her own voice. She traveled endlessly, headed the U.N.
committee to draft a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, opposed
Sen. Joseph McCarthy, campaigned for Adlai Stevenson and even had a
little-known late-life crush on a much younger man, Dr. David
Gurewitsch, to whom she wrote: ``What I have in the few years I
have left is yours before it is anyone else's.'' That was not to
be, but the affection and regard that she had won from the nation
endured.

PBS: PEOPLE BLUNDERING ON SCHEDULES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ Any critics worth their bile are angry
about something by the time the midseason press tour rolls around,
so let's go beat up on Steven Gray, PBS vice president for
scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   The bone of contention is a real femur _ PBS' stubborn
insistence on running its best programs at the worst possible
times.
</P>
<P>
   Remember ``An American Love Story,'' all those hours about a
biracial family forever fixing breakfast? PBS carried it in
September, just as the commercial networks were flooding the
airwaves with their new, lavishly promoted, fervently reviewed
wares.
</P>
<P>
   Or ``Not for Ourselves Alone,'' the Ken Burns two-parter about
the rugged early days of the American feminist movement? PBS sailed
that one in the first hectic weekend of the November sweeps,
against corpulent miniseries on NBC and CBS and ABC's lovely remake
of ``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to find the appropriate words for PBS' tactic. But
``insane'' is a good start.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American Love Story'' chugged along without provoking much
comment, and ``Not for Ourselves Alone'' rang up a 2.1 rating,
attracting 3 percent of the homes where TV sets were in use those
nights. It was the worst rating ever for a major Burns documentary,
about as popular as a Susan B. Anthony dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, PBS found itself spitting into a gale. Then, right
after ``Not for Ourselves Alone,'' PBS tossed 10 hours of its ``New
York'' documentary saga onto the air, also in the teeth of the
November sweeps. The result was a 2.8 rating, which Gray insists
``isn't bad for public television.''
</P>
<P>
   But how many more people might have watched in, say, December,
when the commercial networks had embarked on their long winter's
naps. PBS has no need to strut itself for advertising advantage in
sweeps months. No one expects its member stations to shut down
their transmitters, but the public would be better served by a bare
minimum of common sense and programming acumen from the Public
Broadcasting Service.
</P>
<P>
   Gray was a spectator here in Pasadena as PBS' interim president,
John Swope, fielded routine questions from the press. As soon as
the Swope session ended, though, several critics made beelines for
Gray, their stingers locked in and loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Gray put up a defense. Not all major PBS programs air in
September or sweeps months, he said. PBS tries to schedule some
sort of event programming each month and doesn't want to turn timid
in the big sweeps months, November, February and May, when
commercial television audiences are measured to set advertising
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a sweeps period, we don't want to not be there,'' he
said. ``We don't want to be there with nothing but repeats, and we
don't want to be weak.''
</P>
<P>
   This argument didn't go far, so Gray pointed out that PBS
scheduling is ``not my decision alone. We're a consortium of
several hundred stations.'' Also, Gray said he's virtually helpless
in December, March, August and sometimes June, which are PBS pledge
months stocked with specially packaged self-help shows and concerts
_ ah, John Tesh _ adored by local PBS stations.
</P>
<P>
   We hadn't noticed previously that the PBS schedule was so
jam-packed with viewing delights, but never mind.
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested that the highest-profile PBS shows ought to be
set aside for pledge periods. Really bad idea. Imagine: we'll
return to ``The Civil War'' after 30 minutes of unbearable begging,
cajoling, wheedling, whining and shameless guilt trips from our
cash-starved member stations. No thanks.
</P>
<P>
   But PBS could still scour its schedule for more opportune nights
to showcase a Burns documentary, a lavish science series or an
``American Experience'' excursion into the life of a Douglas
MacArthur or Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Gray backed down enough to concede that ``I wish `Not for
Ourselves Alone' had not been on against sweeps competition. If we
had it to do over again today, things might be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think that through these experiences, we are learning,
and our member stations are learning, that we have windows of
opportunity we need to take better advantage of ... It's going to
be slow progress, the stations deciding they want to make a change
in the way we've traditionally gone about scheduling.''
</P>
<P>
   And with a conspiratorial wink, Gray suggested we watch to see
how Burns' next big project is scheduled. That presumably would be
his 20-hour history of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds better. But when a PBS executive promises slow progress,
you can be assured it's a promise that will be kept. The ``slow''
part, anyway.

 &HT;    New head of Coke shuffles managment team
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola President Doug Daft continued his series of
management changes Sunday by announcing new executives to head the
company's Africa and Middle East operation and its Minute Maid Co.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Short, 46, will become president of the newly named
Africa and Middle East Group less than a week after Carl Ware was
promoted from heading the African operation to taking charge of the
newly created global public affairs and administration division.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Knauss, 48, will be the new president and chief executive
officer of Minute Maid, replacing Stephen Jones, who was named
Coke's chief marketing officer Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are swiftly taking steps to put in place the leadership
team that will take our business to new levels,'' Daft said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, said Daft
still has at least one other major issue to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question now is will he name a No. 2, when and who? My
expectation is we won't have long to wait to see those questions
answered,'' Sicher said.
</P>
<P>
   Sicher was referring to the naming of a president when Daft
leaves that job to become chairman and chief executive officer in
April. That's when the current chairman, M. Douglas Ivester, is
scheduled to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street expects Daft to give the No. 2 job to Jack Stahl,
who is currently in charge of the company's operations in North
America and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Daft announced three major management changes
including Ware and Jones, he was rewarded with an 8 percent rise in
the company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Knauss, who returns to Minute Maid after heading Coke's Southern
Africa division, will be replaced by Doug Jackson, 39.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, currently Daft's executive assistant, will report to
Short, who will now oversee all of Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Two people will replace Short, who briefly headed the company's
Middle East and North Africa division after serving as president of
Coke's India division.
</P>
<P>
   John Guarino, 40, now will head the Middle East and North Africa
division. He also will report to Short.
</P>
<P>
   Alex von Behr, 40, becomes president of the India division. He
will report to Sandy Allan, recently appointed president of the
renamed Asia Pacific Group.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Allan will now have responsibility over Japan, one of the
company's most important markets. Previously, the head of the
company's Japanese operation reported directly to Daft.

GOVERNMENT FIGURES WILL SHED LITTLE LIGHT   ON HOLIDAY ONLINE
SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Commerce Department will announce estimates of
U. S. retail sales for December, putting a solid number on the 1999
holiday sales season.
</P>
<P>
   Those wishing to gain a better sense of the e-commerce holiday
results _ to see if the E-Christmas lived up to all those
commercials _ are out of luck. Rather, policy makers, investors and
analysts will have to resort to their own crystal ball
formulations, cobbled together from shards of statistics and
economic assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   These are the mathematical gymnastics that produced pre-holiday
estimates of e-commerce sales ranging from $4 billion to $15
billion, a statistical chasm that has yet to close in the
post-holiday reporting.
</P>
<P>
   With so much attention focused on e-commerce in general, and
this holiday season's online results in particular, why is the
Commerce Department seemingly ignoring an area of such intense
public interest? The answer is that it is, in fact, developing a
means of tracking Web sales. But it is working on the issue at a
pace that does not exactly call to mind the phrase ``Internet
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Department officials say that in March, they will
release total e-commerce sales figures for the fourth quarter of
1999. That trickle of information will give the public at least a
general sense of holiday e-commerce sales, but officials said they
expected such reports to grow in scope and frequency in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all flying blind about the exact impact and breadth of
e-commerce,'' said William M. Daley, the secretary of commerce.
``So we're trying to respond quickly'' to the need for more
reliable data.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the Commerce Department ``has had to move
cautiously down this road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will remember if the private estimates are off,'' Daley
said, ``but clearly people will have a right to be angry if the
government is fooling them.''
</P>
<P>
   The first e-commerce sales report will provide a simple tally of
Internet retail sales, based on a survey of roughly 2,000 Web
merchants. That is a far cry from the monthly retail reports
released by the Census Bureau, which break down sales totals of
traditional retailers by categories like shoes, liquor and
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau officials said they hoped to achieve a similar
level of detail with their e-commerce results, but are pleased they
have reached even this modest level of statistical success. Three
obstacles in particular have slowed the effort, beginning first
with the issue of how to categorize retailers who appear, disappear
or change their product offerings with dizzying regularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a question of taxonomy,'' said Lee Price, chief
economist with the Economics and Statistics Administration. ``It's
one of evolving taxonomy. Amazon used to just sell books. Now they
sell a much more varied selection. You have to figure out how to
capture that.''
</P>
<P>
   Projecting data from 2,000 respondents so it represents the
entire universe of e-commerce spending also presents analytical
dilemmas, Price said. For example, analysts must weigh the data
from those who failed to respond, just as they weigh the results of
those who responded. And in an industry in which retailers are
sprouting quickly in every category, determining the relative
importance of merchants is a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the hurdle of actually collecting the data.
``The last thing in the world some of these e-tailers want to do is
bother with sending that information to us, and making sure it's
encrypted and protected,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the response has been good. The Census Bureau
culled the e-commerce data from questions asked in its monthly
retailing survey, which is sent to 12,300 companies. Of that total,
7,500 companies responded _ 2,000 of which indicated they were
involved with Internet retailing. Notably, the Commerce Department
cannot compel companies to respond. ``We're relying on the kindness
of strangers,'' said Elliot E. Maxwell, an e-commerce adviser to
Daley.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and executives said this method would provide much more
reliable information than is now available. ``This will do a lot to
cut down on all the bull about how much people spend online,'' said
Jerry Colonna, managing partner of Flatiron Partners, an Internet
venture capital firm. ``Was it a billion or a trillion this
Christmas? I've heard every number.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Colonna said, the figures will do little to sate the
thirst for more immediate data on Internet sales. ``This will be
important for seeing long-term trends,'' he said. ``But for the
day-to-day investors in the trenches, it's mostly irrelevant.
People are looking for more real-time data.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Bartlett, an e-commerce analyst with the investment
firm Dain Rauscher Wessels, agreed. ``Knowing the fourth-quarter
sales total for '99 isn't going to help me predict the fourth
quarter of 2000,'' he said. ``But as the industry gets more mature
and we see more long-term trend lines, then it becomes securities
analysis 101. Those are exactly the things you look at.''
</P>
<P>
   For the short term, perhaps the greatest benefit of the Commerce
Department's Internet sales data will be to finally assign an
authoritative number to the size of the digital economy. That is a
figure that could prove pivotal this year as politicians ponder the
future of a tax-free Internet _ and its effect on the 30,000 tax
jurisdictions now barred from levying new taxes on Web sales.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the prospect of Internet taxation is enough to raise
questions among some executives about the government's motivation
in seeking e-commerce data. ``I have this sinister feeling that the
only reason the government wants this data is for tax planning
purposes,'' said Steve Jurvetson, managing director of Draper
Fisher Jurvetson, a venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just say that it's good for the world to know, private
industry will figure it out much more efficiently because there's
so much economic incentive to do so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, there is little question that entrepreneurs see
opportunity in the data confusion. An entire industry has developed
around the Internet sales forecasting arena, with firms like
Forrester Research, Jupiter Communications and others vying for
statistical pre-eminence. But the inconsistency of those numbers is
what rankles executives and policy makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have our secret sauce of ways to come up with the
important numbers,'' said Jack Staff, chief economist with Zona
Research, an Internet research firm. ``The bottom line is, there
are a number of ways of going at the numbers right now, and each of
them has advantages and disadvantages.''
</P>
<P>
   The flaws in each of the various statistical approaches will not
prove fatal, he said, even with the appearance of the Commerce
Department data. ``It'll take at least three years for the
government data to be highly usable,'' he said. ``But there's a
whole segment of the Internet industry that's devoted to the
numbers, and it'll be fundamentally changed once better numbers
come along. And that's as it should be.''

flowing from a hole near here, the state's producers are trying to
suck the last drops from wells producing an average of a quarter of
a barrel a day. Now, the few hundred people still employed in the
industry face a threat they say could bring state oil production to
an end. Environmental authorities are requiring them to spend
thousands of dollars a well plugging holes that have been abandoned
for decades. The result is a collision between the heritage of the
industry's earliest days and the real-life environmental
consequences of the present.

<P>
   In another wave of appointments designed to put his imprint on
Coca-Cola, Douglas N. Daft, the president, named new executives
Sunday to head the company's African and Asian operations. At the
same time, he reorganized the divisions along geographic lines.
</P>
<P>
   Donald W. Short, most recently the president of Coke's India
division, will lead the Africa and Middle East group. The Middle
East had been combined with Coke's Asian business. The previous
president of the Africa group, Carl H. Ware, Coca-Cola's
highest-ranking black executive, had announced his retirement in
November but is now staying on as executive vice president for
corporate affairs and government relations.
</P>
<P>
   Donald R. Knauss, until recently the president of Coke's South
African division, was named president and chief executive of the
company's Minute Maid division. In October, Stephen C. Jones was
selected for the post, but he was promoted to chief marketing
officer by Daft on Friday. Knauss joined Coke in 1994 and
previously was an executive with the Frito-Lay division of PepsiCo,
Coke's archrival, and also with Tropicana, now also part of
PepsiCo.
</P>
<P>
   Coke said it was changing the name of its Asian operations from
the Middle and Far East group to the Asia Pacific group. The former
Africa group will have three divisions with the addition of the
Middle East territory.
</P>
<P>
   The company also named three division presidents. They are Doug
Jackson, a 39-year-old South African who will run the company's
business in Southern Africa, based in Johannesburg; John Guarino, a
40-year-old American who will become president of the Middle East
and North Africa division; and Alex von Behr, a 40-year-old Briton
who will take Short's spot as president of the India division. &QL;

GATEWAY TO USE CHIPS BY ADVANCED MICRO 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gateway Inc., the computer maker that last week
blamed supply problems with Intel Corp. for an earnings shortfall,
plans to announce on Monday that it will again use microprocessors
produced by Intel's archrival, Advanced Micro Devices.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway executives said that the new machines using Advanced
Micro's chips would be available through its stores, World Wide Web
site (gateway.com) and toll-free number (800-846-4208).
</P>
<P>
   It was only last year that Gateway switched from buying some
microprocessors from Advanced Micro to relying on Intel exclusively
for microprocessors, the electronic brains of computers. But last
week, when it cited supply problems as it reduced its earnings
forecast, it described Intel's shipments of chips and computer
boards as ``severely constrained, spotty and unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gateway executives said then that they would not remain so
dependent on a sole supplier and would seek another source of
chips.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, that decision led inevitably to Advanced
Micro. While a handful of companies produce microprocessors
compatible with Intel's, Advanced Micro has been the most
aggressive in terms of meeting, and at times beating, Intel in
absolute performance. And it has the broadest product line of all
Intel's rivals. Last week, Advanced Micro said it was producing an
800-megahertz version of its Athlon microprocessor, giving it, for
now, the fastest chip on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is, this solves their supply problem,'' Charles Wolf,
an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read, said of Gateway. The move, he
said, ``is in part buying insurance, to make sure they have enough
processors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're also sending a message to Intel: `In the future,
treat us better.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said that Gateway's supply problem suggested Intel was
having difficulty meeting production goals for its newest chips and
was allocating them to its most important client, which would be
the Dell Computer Corp., not Gateway. ``Dell has never dual-sourced
on processors,'' he said. ``They're a lot bigger than Gateway and
they've been a loyal customer forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Gateway win was an important one for Advanced
Micro, which for the first time in years is fielding a product line
that can compete head to head with Intel. Previously, Advanced
Micro has either lagged in performance or been unable to produce
its fastest chips in high volumes. But these problems appear to
have been addressed. In addition to Gateway, PC makers that have
said they will use Athlon processors include Compaq Computer, IBM
and CyberMax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gateway's decision to use the AMD Athlon in its Select PC
series enhances AMD's credibility and demonstrates that the Athlon
is gaining acceptance at the high end of the desktop computer
market,'' said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst with Insight 64.
``AMD's win at Gateway reinforces the position of the AMD Athlon
processor as a legitimate challenger in the performance segment.''
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro also plans to announce on Monday that Pionex, an
East Coast computer maker whose machines are sold through
resellers, is offering commercial desktop computers and
workstations based on the Athlon processor. Via Technologies, based
in Taiwan, will also begin shipping a chipset using Athlon,
Advanced Micro said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ The Internet boom is bringing sweeping
demographic changes to Silicon Valley, according to an annual
report card for the region, which shows that the number of nonwhite
residents surpassed whites for the first time in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of new immigrants, particularly Asians and Hispanic
people, also is increasing a ``digital divide,'' said an annual
report to be issued on Monday by Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a
coalition of corporate and civic groups.
</P>
<P>
   People who describe themselves as white comprise 49 percent of
the population of the counties of San Mateo and Santa Clara,
Silicon Valley's main geographic area. Among the region's
school-age population, whites are an even smaller minority, said
the report, which is prepared each year by researchers at
Collaborative Economics, a consulting firm here.
</P>
<P>
   The two counties' school-age population is 39 percent white, 31
percent Hispanic, 26 percent Asian and Pacific Islander, 4 percent
African-American and 0.2 percent American Indian, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   The changes reflect both traditional immigration patterns and a
new wave of high-skilled, highly entrepreneurial immigrants moving
to Silicon Valley, while at the same time maintaining close ties
with their homelands, said AnnaLee Saxenian, a social scientist on
the advisory committee for the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best and the brightest in the world all want to be here,''
said Ms. Saxenian, a senior fellow at the Institute for Economic
Policy Research at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Venture index, which has been issued each year since
1994 as a broad assessment of the valley's economy and social and
environment, also showed that while the region's boom is
continuing, job growth slowed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The valley added just 1.7 percent, or 21,200, new jobs, despite
an increase of nearly 90 percent in venture capital, to $6.1
billion. That was down from a recent high of 5.2 percent in 1997,
when the region added more than 60,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The declining growth rate suggests a shift away from traditional
manufacturing sectors like microelectronics, semiconductors,
computers and military-aerospace manufacturing, said Douglas
Henton, president of Collaborative Economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a continuing restructuring away from hardware
and toward software,'' he said, noting that the average size of a
Silicon Valley software company is 27 people, smaller than the
mainstay semiconductor companies that employ thousands.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the new high technology job growth in the
valley last year was in software and related services while both
semiconductors and defense/aerospace employment declined, the
report found.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for programmers, driven by Internet start-up
companies, accelerated, with the average annual wage for the
software industry at $95,800 in 1998, the most recent year for
which data is available.
</P>
<P>
   The high salaries of skilled workers, however, contrasts sharply
with the largest employment sector of the region's economy _ local
and visitor services, which include retail and restaurant workers
and had an annual average wage of $22,900.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, adjusted household income for the most affluent 20
percent of Santa Clara County residents rose about $40,000 from
1996 to 1998, to just below $140,000 a year. But for the least
affluent 20 percent, the 1998 level of $36,700 remains below the
average income level earned by the bottom 20 percent of households
in the early 1990s, when adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the valley is doing well,'' Henton said, ``it has got
to do a much better job in working to prepare everyone for the
digital economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the income disparity, the valley has continued to
outpace the financial standing of the rest of the nation. During
the 1990s, for example, real per capita income for Santa Clara
County rose 32 percent, compared with 13 percent for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The changes described in this year's report come at a time when
the valley is having its longest boom ever, which traces to 1992
and was highlighted by a record 77 initial public stock offerings
by companies in the region during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The slowing job growth did bring some good environmental news.
Despite continuing traffic woes, the valley had fewer days when the
region's air quality exceeded federal ozone standards. Air
pollution exceeded federal standards on 12 days in 1999, down from
21 days in 1998.

GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO CURB BUYING OF PILLS ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Wash., Va.)   (Exclusive)  
(lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With consumers turning to online drugstores based
overseas for bargains, as well as for illicit substances and
prescriptions they are embarrassed to seek from their physicians,
the federal government's seizures of imported drugs soared last
year to thousands of parcels containing more than a million pills.
</P>
<P>
   Customs inspectors intercepted all sorts of drugs, including
steroids, hormones, aphrodisiacs, impotence medications,
anti-cancer pills, painkillers and tranquilizers sent from
Thailand, China, Mexico, Switzerland and many other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the shipments that they impounded are probably only a small
fraction of what consumers are illegally buying from fly-by-night
Web sites, many of which offer to mail drugs in unmarked envelopes
with few questions asked, according to customs and health
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Customs Service seized 9,725 packages with prescription
drugs last year _ about 4.5 times as many as in 1998, when they
confiscated 2,145 packages. The number of pills and tablets
impounded by the Customs Service jumped to 1.9 million, from
760,720 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the drugs that were seized had not been
approved for use in the United States, did not comply with U.S.
labeling requirements, or fell below federal standards for the
quality and purity of drugs. Because of controls like these, most
imports of drugs from Internet suppliers are illegal, although
buyers are rarely prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Raymond Kelly, the commissioner of the Customs
Service, said: ``The Internet has given us a lot more work. We've
been deluged with prescription drugs coming in from overseas. It's
a major challenge to deal with this huge increase in volume.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton recently announced an initiative to protect
consumers buying drugs on the Internet. But his proposal dealt
mainly with online pharmacies based in the United States, which
would, for the first time, have to get approval from the federal
government before they could sell drugs in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   That has left administration officials scratching their heads
over what can be done to police the virtually unregulated foreign
Web sites that have sprung up to cater to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's much more difficult than domestic enforcement,'' said
Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Regulation of offshore Internet sites is tricky for the Clinton
administration because Vice President Al Gore and other Democrats
continually berate drug companies for charging higher prices in the
United States than in other countries, and one of the main reasons
consumers buy online from foreign pharmacies is to get lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Other consumers turn to the Internet to get drugs that are
illegal to sell here, or to get legitimate medicines like Viagra,
the anti-impotence pill, without the trouble and possible
embarrassment of consulting a physician.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration advises consumers: ``Don't
purchase from foreign Web sites at this time. Generally it will be
illegal to import the drugs bought from these sites, the risks are
greater and there is very little the U.S. government can do if you
get ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
   A Web site called Drug Quest says it can, for a fee, help
Americans ``buy almost any drug without a prescription'' from
pharmacies in Mexico, the Caribbean and other parts of the world.
These pharmacies sell drugs at ``drastically discounted rates'' and
ship the merchandise discreetly so that ``95 percent of their
shipments arrive unmolested,'' says the Web site, operated by a
Florida company called LMB Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Another Web site, operated by Vitality Health Products in
Bangkok, Thailand, promises ``prescription-free pharmaceuticals by
e-mail at incredibly low prices.''
</P>
<P>
   And it seems to have a medicine for every malady:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair loss? Try Minoxidil and Finasteride (Propecia). Erection
problems? Try Viagra, Yohimbine and Trazodone. Aging skin? Try
Retin-A and AHA creams. Poor memory, IQ? Try Piracetam, Hydergine
and Vinpocetine. Hormone replacement? Check out testosterone &AMP;
Premarin.''
</P>
<P>
   Vitality says, ``We guarantee to send your order discreetly
packed, without any reference to the contents on the outside of the
packet.'' But it says: ``Be warned. Medicines sent by post are much
more likely to be stolen in transit or intercepted by the
authorities than other mail-order products. If your order is lost,
stolen in the post or confiscated by the authorities, we guarantee
to refund your money immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The company even has a Web page on ``customs problems,'' which
tells consumers what to do if an order is seized by the Customs
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Falanga, a supervisory customs inspector at Kennedy
International Airport in New York, said: ``You can probably buy
anything you want over the Internet and have it shipped to your
house. We've found a big increase in prescription drugs and
anabolic steroids from virtually all parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Falanga said inspectors could not possibly examine every item,
because more than 100 international flights arrived at Kennedy each
day and most carried huge amounts of mail.
</P>
<P>
   Some packages carry customs declarations falsely describing
their contents. Government records show, for example, that potent
unapproved drugs like GBL and GHB have been labeled as wood
softener or bubble bath, even though the products are promoted on
the Web with claims that they can build muscles, enhance sex,
reduce stress and induce sleep.
</P>
<P>
   When the Customs Service seizes drugs, it may send a warning to
the purchaser. In rare cases, if the shipment includes a large
quantity of drugs with a high potential for resale and abuse,
customs agents may deliver the drugs and arrest the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Boyd, a spokesman for the Customs Service, said the
agency usually refrained from taking action when consumers imported
small amounts of prescription drugs _ up to a three-month supply _
for their own use, and the drugs posed no ``unreasonable risk'' to
the users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't arrest Granny just because she wants to get her drugs
cheaper,'' Boyd said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A New Zealand pharmacy routinely ships drugs and hormones in
parcel-post letter packs, saying that such envelopes attract less
attention from inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, International Anti-Aging Systems, based on the
island of Guernsey in the English Channel, offers dozens of drugs
including Proscar, Prozac, Viagra, tetracycline, injectable human
growth hormone and ``brain nutrients, or smart drugs,'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company tells buyers that they are responsible for
compliance with import requirements. Moreover, it says, buyers bear
the risk of financial loss if their products are seized by the
Customs Service, and consumers cannot hold the company liable for
``any entrapment procedures that may be perpetrated by law
enforcement and government agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign Web sites promote Viagra, the anti-impotence drug
made by Pfizer. Andrew McCormick, a spokesman for Pfizer, said the
company had successfully urged state pharmacy boards to shut down
Web sites that sold Viagra without requiring patients to be
examined first by doctors. But, he said, it is more difficult to
take action against foreign Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra has been approved in 90 countries, but McCormick said
sales in the United States exceeded those in the rest of the world
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have repeatedly seized drugs sent to the
United States from a Swiss pharmacy, Victoria Apotheke in Zurich,
on the ground that they were unapproved or misbranded. On its Web
site, the company describes itself as a fully licensed retail
drugstore established in 1880. It offers ``a wide range of 14,000
products available to be sent to customers all over the world,''
and it says it can help consumers ``obtain medicines not available
in your country.''
</P>
<P>
   Debby Fry Wilson, a spokeswoman for one of the best-known online
pharmacies, drugstore.com in Bellevue, Wash., said her company
complied with all federal and state requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson noted that state officials, using state laws, had
already shut down some unlicensed online pharmacies. But, she said,
``most of the illegal operators are doing their business on foreign
soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, said he was skeptical of the administration's proposal
to regulate online pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reluctant to set a precedent for regulation of the
Internet before the full potential of electronic commerce is
understood,'' Bliley said. ``A large number of illegitimate online
pharmacies are based offshore, but the administration's proposal
does not appear to address that problem.''

MIAMI CONGRESSWOMAN DELIGHTS IN BEING VILIFIED BY CASTRO

<P>
   MIAMI _ People usually grimace and squirm when they are publicly
vilified, painted as traitors and mocked as vicious animals. But
for Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican and a
fist-shaking anti-communist, it's the next best thing to a shot of
Cuban coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the new year, Granma, the state-run newspaper in
Cuba, ran a full-page article that denounced Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, in
head-spinning Marxese, for her involvement in the Elian Gonzalez
case. ``The ferocious wolf disguised as a woman,'' the giant
headline read.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Cuban government started showing a documentary on
state-run television, morphing her image ever so slowly into that
same ferocious wolf, a ``loba feroz,'' as they called her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba, was so touched by the
gesture that she immediately ordered a new vanity license plate:
LOBA FRZ. ``I wish I had a vowel there, like Vanna White,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased as punch,'' Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said over a bagel and
a cafe con leche at a cafe here one morning. ``I've been trying for
so many years to get him to pick on me,'' she said, referring to
Fidel Castro. ``I don't know why now, and I don't know why twice.
Something I've been saying has really gotten to him lately because
I've been attacking him forever. Heck, he's the reason we're all
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because Elian, the 6-year-old boy whose father wants
him sent back to Cuba, is living with relatives in her district in
Miami's Little Havana now, and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, a slim, hiply
coiffed bundle of energy, has seen fit to fling rhetorical
lightning bolts Castro's way as often as possible.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Immigration and Naturalization Service decided
that Elian's father, as his legal guardian, had a right to be
reunited with his son in Cuba. Ever since, Miami has been in an
uproar. A congressional subpoena has been issued to try to prevent
immigration officials from sending him home by Friday. And a state
judge is deciding whether to grant temporary custody of the boy to
his great-uncle here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, 48, was involved in the case from the start.
Soon after a fisherman found Elian, his little body peeking out
from under a bobbing inner tube, on Thanksgiving day, the boy's
relatives called her to pay a visit and find out what to do.
Elian's mother was among those who died when the boat carrying them
from Cuba sank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there just about the day he was released,'' she said.
Her cell phone rings yet again with another interview request.
```Burden of Proof.' Doesn't everyone shout on that show?'' she
asks her aide. ``No. No. Tell them no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be on national news everyday,'' she said, after
clicking off the phone. ``But I go for local radio. I'm a local
gal.'' Besides, she's got to pick up her two daughters at school.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since Elian's release, his relatives have invited her back
several times. She showed up twice around Christmas, once with a
monster truck for sweet-faced Elian and toys for the other kids in
the family. She also attended Elian's birthday party at a local
park with her 12-year-old daughter, Patty, and her father, and she
keeps in touch with the family's lawyers to monitor the case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen shrugs off her critics, who say she and other
politicians have turned the case of a little boy who lost his
mother into a political circus. ``I've visited many families in my
district, sometimes the media comes and sometimes it doesn't,'' she
said. ``I don't pick which one is the celebrated case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' she added, ``these cases invite opposition. I
don't need help to solidify my base.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most members of Congress get lots of attention for the pork they
bring home or the roads they help build. That happens in Miami,
too. But Ms. Ros-Lehtinen's bread-and-butter issue is reminding the
U.S. government that Castro is a dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``These years with Clinton have really hurt our cause,'' said
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, a former state legislator who was elected to
Congress in 1989. ``He's brought us no help.''
</P>
<P>
   Battling Castro isn't just politics for her, it's also personal.
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen was born in Havana in 1952 and was just a year
older than Elian when she came to this country at age seven. The
year was 1959, Castro had overthrown the government in January and
thousands of Cubans, including Ms. Ros-Lehtinen's family, were
fleeing the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, she met her husband, Dexter Lehtinen, a former U.S.
attorney here, during her stint as a state legislator. Like so many
extended Cuban families, hers is tight-knit. Her mother and father
live right across the street and help take care of her daughters
when she is in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Her constituents are smitten. She has run unopposed during her
last three elections. Janitors and yard workers and businessmen
recognize her on the street, something that can't be said for most
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The waiter, who it turns out arrived here from Cuba four years
ago, asks if she wants more coffee, then leans toward her and nods
his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kid can't go back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope not,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope nothing,'' he said. ``It can't happen. That kid is too
important to the exile community.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At a Little Havana senior center, her fans rush her with flowers
and well-wishes. ``Elian, Elian,'' they shout. She slips from
Spanish to English and back again, whatever the moment requires. A
few old Cuban men play Cuban music on the stage and Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen, who admits to having two left feet, shuffles around.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one talks about Elian's mother, about her sacrifice, so he
could reach liberty in this beautiful country,'' she tells the
crowd in Spanish. It is something they love to hear.
</P>
<P>
   But, away from the hubbub, here in the cafe, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen
tones down the rhetoric and shows a pragmatic streak. How can the
community justify separating a 6-year-old from his father, who by
all accounts was a good parent?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never said in any way that Elian should be here or Elian
should be with the father,'' she said. ``All I've ever said and
continue to say to this day, is that the family wants a fair,
impartial court procedure. This is a nation of laws, and we should
be ruled by that, and we shouldn't rely on secretive administrative
decisions. The family has the right like anybody else to have their
day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become such a huge issue,'' she said, ``but we have to
get back to the basics that this really is about a 6-year-old
child.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, and in Cuba, where politics, passion and memories make
for a volatile brew, it's never quite that simple, and she knows
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge may very well decide to send Elian back,'' Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen said. ``If the family had had a fair, impartial and
free open hearing, then we would understand that decision. Now it
has gone so far beyond that, that I don't know what would happen.''

PATRICK O'BRIAN: A JANE AUSTEN OF THE DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON CARROLL  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick O'Brian led two different lives. In 1945 he changed his
name, his nationality and the circumstances of his personal life.
He reinvented himself, which allowed him to invent two of the most
enduring characters in 20th century fiction: the brave,
good-natured, slightly thick career naval officer Jack Aubrey and
the analytical, melancholy, secretive naval surgeon Stephen
Maturin.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brian died last week at age 85. He was a widower; he had
completed what he said would be the 20th and last book in the
Aubrey-Maturin series (although he was rumored to be working on the
21st); he had become rich and famous at a time of life when even
lucky men and women depend on reputation and memories. He went out
on top, in one of the cities he loved. His passing was sad but not
in any sense a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   People unfamiliar with his books can be forgiven for thinking
they are the literary equivalent of Errol Flynn movies, filled with
blood running on the decks and talking parrots and men with peg
legs calling each other ``matey'' _ appropriate perhaps for sailing
geeks with a little Peter Pan in them. This impression was not
helped by his publisher's decision to put the identical
frontispiece in each book: a drawing of a square-rigged
three-masted naval vessel with each sail carefully labeled, as
though such knowledge were important for an understanding of the
books. It's not.
</P>
<P>
   The books do have wonderful scenes of naval warfare, with a full
complement of blazing guns and sudden death. There is a chase scene
in ``Desolation Island'' that can raise the respiration rate of
adults by as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Brian's favorite writer was Jane Austen, and the books can
best be thought of as companion volumes to her novels, with formal
differences in rank replacing the differences in social position
that intrigued her, and the complicated friendships of men
replacing the complicated negotiations of courtship.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brian's readership was by no means exclusively male; his
memorable 1995 visit to Herbst Theatre in San Francisco, a
gathering of addicts, drew a diverse and loving audience.
Typically, the author did not milk the adoration; he wanted to be
read, but he had no use for celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brian's books are novels of manners as much as they are sea
stories. There is much comic conversation, as in Austen, although
O'Brian went in for broad slapstick as well, as in Aubrey's trek
across the mountains of Spain attired in a bear suit. Throughout,
the real topic is the intricate and steadfast friendship between
Aubrey and Maturin.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brian (who hated talking about himself, partly because he had
told so many lies about his personal life) would never say so
directly, but it is clear that Maturin was almost a self-portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Maturin, like O'Brian, was slight of build, clever, interested
in scientific matters (O'Brian once wrote a biography of British
botanist Joseph Banks), physically inept although always game,
moody to the point of depression. Maturin was a spy by trade as
well as a doctor, which meant that he had many secrets, just like
O'Brian, and that he kept them well, out of loyalties he felt no
need to explain.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brian, born English, claimed to be Irish. The truth eventually
came out, but when he died in Dublin (too far from his adopted home
of Collioure in France), the Irish Times had the last word on that,
editorializing that if he wanted to be Irish that badly, well,
let's call him an Irishman then.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the books survive. Newcomers are advised to read them
in order; the first three are ``Master and Commander,''
``Post-Captain'' and ``H.M.S. Surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   There will always be time for a little fiddle music in the
captain's great room after dinner, with Stephen's melancholy cello
keeping up with Jack's sprightly violin on perhaps the Scarlatti,
with the royals and loftier staysails swollen with a following wind
and white bow wave spreading wide, out into the night.

ECONOMISTS DEBATE SOLUTION FOR MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Prominent experts in the Microsoft antitrust case
replayed their arguments at the American Economic Association's
annual conference over the weekend, and some proposures that
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson might impose if the
case reaches a penalty phase.
</P>
<P>
   One penalty proposed on Saturday by Robert E. Hall, a Stanford
University economist, was a multibillion-dollar fine representing
the amount that he estimated the Microsoft Corp. tacked onto the
price of its Windows software because of its monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   In a second proposal, Steven J. Davis, a University of Chicago
economist, did not suggest a specific penalty but said that
whatever penalties Jackson decides, he should let Microsoft keep
``bundling'' Internet browsers with other software in its Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you share the view that Microsoft engaged in
anticompetitive practices, one has to think very hard about
remedies that restrict complementarities,'' Davis said, referring
to the practice of offering separate software in a single package
at a price that undervalued some elements, like Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any remedy that restricts Microsoft's ability to compete in
complementary software,'' Davis said, ``would raise prices to
consumers, lower profits and reduce incentives to innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall describes himself as an independent expert, serving neither
the Justice Department nor Microsoft in the federal antitrust
trial, in which Jackson has issued findings of fact that Microsoft
engaged in anticompetitive practices intended to give its Explorer
an unfair advantage over Netscape and other competing Web browsers.
Davis is a paid consultant for Microsoft. Nearly all the others who
spoke here were on one side or the other in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting the results of a mathematical model, Hall said
Microsoft overpriced Windows, taking advantage of its market power.
But the overpricing did not offer the prospect of enough profit to
encourage personal computer makers to develop an operating system
of their own and offer it to customers in place of Windows, along
with alternatives to Microsoft's browser.
</P>
<P>
   With their own operating system, manufacturers could nullify
pressure from Microsoft to favor Internet Explorer over Netscape
and other browsers, a key issue in the antitrust case. Hall
calculated the overpricing at $11, from a price of about $60 for
Windows software. Thus, if PC makers had their own operating
system, they could lower the price of a computer by $11 each, he
said, saving purchasers about $6 billion over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the creation of this artificial barrier were Microsoft's
only wrongdoing, then the damages owed to past purchasers of
computers are a similar number,'' Hall went on, suggesting a fine.
``More aggressive punishment of Microsoft, such as breaking it up
into competing entities that lowered shareholder value by more than
$6 billion may fail the standard of fitting the punishment to the
crime.''

MCCAIN PURSUES AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY OF OPENNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with a campaign finance controversy at a
critical juncture of the presidential race, John McCain, the former
Navy aviator, has adopted the tactic of flying straight into the
political flak.
</P>
<P>
   In a strategy calculated to demonstrate that he has nothing to
hide, the Arizona senator released hundreds of letters he has
written to regulators as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee,
some of them benefiting campaign contributors. He has also asked
federal agencies to open their files.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday, as in last week's debates, he was on television
again patiently dealing with questions about letters like the ones
he wrote to the Federal Communications Commission on behalf of
Paxson Communications and other companies whose executives have
been his contributors.
</P>
<P>
   His avowed goal is to persuade the public that the letters
demonstrate not some kind of political hypocrisy, but rather a
``clear pattern of my acting on behalf of my constituents and
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a risk as well: that the volume of letters, the
vast majority of them seemingly unconnected to any donors, might
leave the impression of a lawmaker constantly intervening on behalf
of business, if only to urge speedy action by federal agencies. Or
even that somewhere in the pile of correspondence there is
something his critics might turn against him.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain's insurgent candidacy, built largely on his cries for
campaign finance reform, this could be a make-or-break moment. It
comes far too close for comfort to his golden opportunity for an
upset of Gov. George W. Bush in New Hampshire. Yet his aides say
they believe there is also enough time, with three weeks to go
before that Feb. 1 primary, for him to recover.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, who is neck-and-neck in the polls with Bush
in New Hampshire, appears to be the only one standing between Bush
and the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   So, taking advantage of the hyperkinetic pace of modern campaign
news cycles, McCain's counter-barrage of openness this weekend
marked an effort by the senator to bring the controversy to a close
with the Sunday talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   The risk that unknown problems in the volumes of records might
lie ahead is related to the complexity of the issues involved, and
the layers and varieties of campaign donations from companies,
lawyers and lobbyists, including donations to the senator's past
congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The letters McCain wrote touch on arcana that is often difficult
for the average voter to grasp. Often it is unclear whether McCain
was even aware of the details of the letters he signed, or whether
the staff that prepared them could have known about campaign
contributions _ which in any event sometimes came after the letters
were drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Was an airline's plan to offer service in Flagstaff, Ariz.,
anticompetitive, as the city managers thought? he asked the
Department of Transportation. (It was not, came the reply.)
</P>
<P>
   Please consider the views of FareSearch, a Tucson, Ariz.,
company that researches air fares, when studying the
ticket-purchasing practices of consumers who try to outsmart the
airlines on fares, he implored the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   But other letters involved multibillion-dollar communications
mergers and substantial campaign contributions; and in some cases
it is hard to discern whether related contributions might have been
made, or by whom.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates doubtless will now face similar questions.
</P>
<P>
   While traveling through Des Moines, Iowa, on Sunday, former Sen.
Bill Bradley, a Democratic candidate, was asked whether he would
allow letters to federal agencies that he wrote while on the Senate
Finance Committee to be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly have no problem with that,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a senator I had a basic policy and that was I did not
intervene in regulatory matters,'' he said, although he might have
intervened on behalf of New Jersey, his home state, before agencies
like the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would write a letter to HUD saying give Newark (N.J.) the
grant but I did not intervene on behalf of people in a regulatory
process. I can't think of any time I did that in the U.S. Senate.
Somebody pulls up and finds one somewhere, I'd be extremely
surprised because I had that as a basic policy,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that the outcome of campaign crises turns less
on specific allegations than on how a candidate handles them. So
the last few days have been instructive in taking the measure of
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He has steadfastly refused to go into hiding. In fact, he did
not come off of the campaign trail for a moment. Nor did he
distance himself in any way from the press.
</P>
<P>
   He has said repeatedly that he learned lessons from watching his
friend Bob Dole campaign in 1996 and that he thought Dole made a
terrible mistake when he locked himself away from reporters after
he caused a furor by saying that tobacco was not addictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his greatest assets was his relationship with the
media,'' McCain said recently, saying that Dole inexplicably cut
himself off from reporters who had covered him for years on Capitol
Hill, ``who knew him well and liked him. What do I mean by liking?
That they wouldn't sandbag him.''
</P>
<P>
   So, riding through South Carolina on Saturday afternoon on the
bus he calls the ``Straight Talk Express,'' McCain chattered to
reporters about how the New Hampshire cold aggravates the arthritis
in his bones broken during his captivity as a prisoner of war in
Vietnam. He discussed brands of long underwear. He accused a
reporter who had skipped covering one of his town meetings of being
AWOL and in need of court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   His television appearance Sunday allowed him to touch on broader
campaign themes. He was soon going after the size of Bush's tax
cut. ``Gov. Bush said that Washington is awash in cash,'' he said.
``We've got a $5.6 trillion debt.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was able to give a more nuanced view of the controversy
in South Carolina over the Confederate flag than Bush did in a
debate on Friday night, when he insisted that it should be a local
issue and resisted several opportunities to talk about his own
feelings about the flag.

FOR-PROFIT WEB SITES GIVE NEW MEANING TO CAMPAIGN FINANCING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif.)  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in category `p') 
(rk) 
 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in October, when Voter.com was pressing the two Democratic
presidential campaigns to pay for space on its new for-profit Web
site, the sales staff sent campaign aides e-mail messages saying
the other camp was about to sign contracts with the site.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic, according to campaign officials, prompted an unusual
exchange: a campaign aide for Vice President Al Gore called the
office of Bill Bradley to ask if the former New Jersey senator's
campaign was really about to sign. The Bradley campaign had no such
plans. Now, neither organization plans to do business with
Voter.com.
</P>
<P>
   Voter.com's 25-year-old chief executive, Justin Dangel, said his
sales staff was truthful at all times and that the campaigns had
merely wavered in their decisions. But the bottom line is that the
contracts were crucial for the Web site because, in Dangel's words,
``it's important for the whole project to have campaigns provide
content.''
</P>
<P>
   Voter.com, which is based in Boston, is among a handful of
Internet start-ups hoping to make money in campaign politics, a
world traditionally dominated by nonprofit and volunteer groups.
But as these commercial political sites strive to cash in on
campaign advertising in a major election year, they are finding it
harder to earn credibility with candidates and the public than to
raise millions of dollars in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   The sites' founders predict they will attract millions of users
this year because an increasing number of Americans have Internet
access and the elections will bring attention to political sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great time to get involved with the process,'' said
Joshua King, spokesman for a new company, SpeakOut.com. The
company's business strategy is to offer users a conduit to write to
their elected representatives, then sell the data about the users'
political views in aggregate form to campaigns and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of likely voters who use the Internet showed
that about a quarter of respondents had searched for information
about political candidates. The research, a random telephone survey
of 1,200 adults, was conducted by George Washington University in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The findings also showed, however, that the respondents were
highly selective about which sources of online political
information they trusted, placing the most trust in church groups
and state election boards, and the least trust in online service
providers, political parties and campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   As new players compete for this group's attention, Voter.com
plans to spend $70 million advertising its site this year. Dangel
said the company had already raised part of that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Another start-up, GoVote.com, was established to be ``the
leading destination for politics on the Web,'' said Paul Hrabal,
the company's president, a 33-year-old former executive at Dell
Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of these sites say the public needs a politics portal
that will provide voters with information about all candidates in
one visit. That feature _ along with the ability to sell sharply
aimed advertising to candidates and lobbying groups _ could make
the business model work, these investors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who will pay for it will be the people who spend
money trying to reach audiences,'' said Chris Gabrieli, a general
partner in Bessemer Venture Partners in Boston, an investor in
Voter.com. ``I believe there will be one clear winner here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many venture capitalists in Silicon Valley are skeptical,
however. For example, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, a venture firm in
Redwood City, Calif., says it routinely rejects business plans
describing catch-all political sites because the firm is concerned
about the short business cycle, which ends when the election is
over, and because it doubts any single site will dominate the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's going to be one first-to-market site
that's going to make it,'' said Barry Hutchison, a spokesman for
the firm. ``There's not going to be a panacea for the industry.
Those first-to-market sites that are trying to be catchalls are
going to weed themselves out.''

</P>
<P>
   The key for many of these companies is to collect individuals'
political opinions, then direct advertising from political groups
at them or sell aggregate information on political opinions to
outside parties. Dangel said that if a user on Voter.com indicated
an interest in the environment, then an environmental group that
was a paying client would be given the opportunity to send e-mail
messages to her about the group's positions on evolving issues.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who question this application of electronic commerce
to politics is a privacy advocate who says that databases of
individuals' political beliefs are tempting targets for subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be creating some particularly sensitive databases
that they would have no control over,'' said David Sobel, general
counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit
research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In an environment of fear about terrorism, he said, police
agencies would be likely to serve subpoenas on companies that hold
information about individuals who express extreme views. That
threat could jeopardize the companies' business models.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would assume that users, when they understand the potential
ramifications, would be very apprehensive about providing this
information,'' Sobel said. ``If the value that these sites intend
to collect is information on political preferences of individuals,
they're going to have a hard time.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Internet companies said they were careful to
keep the data they collected separate from information that would
identify individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do it the right way,'' Dangel said. ``If we
find out we're not, we'll change it.''
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the profit-seeking sites has also, in part,
influenced the Markle Foundation's decision to devote $100 million
to public-interest uses of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Blau, program director for the foundation, said nonprofit
groups should not fold their tents just yet. Their advantage, he
said, is that they carry the most credibility. The profit-seeking
companies have the advantage of access to capital, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the content side, certainly the dot-orgs have nothing to be
afraid of,'' Blau said, alluding to the .org suffix in the Internet
addresses of nonprofit groups. But they may need to move faster to
compete, he said, adding, ``Their ability to be responsive is going
to be tested by these new players.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, many of the new players know their weakness
and are gunning for credibility. Richard Kimball, director of
Project Vote Smart, an award-winning nonprofit group that has
provided exhaustive candidate information online since 1996, says
that in recent months he has constantly battled new companies that
steal the nonprofit site's data, logo and name to gain credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The project has developed a threatening legal letter for those
cases. Though Kimball says the situation is troubling, he said that
the attempts to tap into his group's credibility was ``actually
flattering, in a nasty way.''

FOR-PROFIT WEB SITES GIVE NEW MEANING TO CAMPAIGN FINANCING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif.)  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in category `f')

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in October, when Voter.com was pressing the two Democratic
presidential campaigns to pay for space on its new for-profit Web
site, the sales staff sent campaign aides e-mail messages saying
the other camp was about to sign contracts with the site.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic, according to campaign officials, prompted an unusual
exchange: a campaign aide for Vice President Al Gore called the
office of Bill Bradley to ask if the former New Jersey senator's
campaign was really about to sign. The Bradley campaign had no such
plans. Now, neither organization plans to do business with
Voter.com.
</P>
<P>
   Voter.com's 25-year-old chief executive, Justin Dangel, said his
sales staff was truthful at all times and that the campaigns had
merely wavered in their decisions. But the bottom line is that the
contracts were crucial for the Web site because, in Dangel's words,
``it's important for the whole project to have campaigns provide
content.''
</P>
<P>
   Voter.com, which is based in Boston, is among a handful of
Internet start-ups hoping to make money in campaign politics, a
world traditionally dominated by nonprofit and volunteer groups.
But as these commercial political sites strive to cash in on
campaign advertising in a major election year, they are finding it
harder to earn credibility with candidates and the public than to
raise millions of dollars in venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   The sites' founders predict they will attract millions of users
this year because an increasing number of Americans have Internet
access and the elections will bring attention to political sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great time to get involved with the process,'' said
Joshua King, spokesman for a new company, SpeakOut.com. The

</P>
<P>
   Two employees of CARE USA have been shot to death in Sudan and
two others
</P>
<P>
   are missing, the Atlanta-based relief and development
organization announced
</P>
<P>
   Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which took place between Jan. 2 and Jan. 5, is the
second
</P>
<P>
   fatal shooting involving CARE employees since the New Year
began, and it
</P>
<P>
   served to highlight the increasing dangers humanitarian workers
face when
</P>
<P>
   they try to improve living conditions in countries torn by civil
strife.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Ibrahim Ishag Abaker and Mekki El Ekheir Mekki, and
two
</P>
<P>
   others set out Jan. 2 from the town of Bentiu, about 450 miles
south of
</P>
<P>
   Khartoum, Sudan's capital. They drove a truck carrying food and
medical
</P>
<P>
   supplies, and were bound for Mayoum, where they planned to open
a new health
</P>
<P>
   clinic.
</P>
<P>
   After they failed to arrive, a search and rescue team composed
of
</P>
<P>
   employees of CARE, the United Nations and the government of
Sudan was sent to
</P>
<P>
   the area. The truck and Mekki's body were found Jan 5 along the
road to
</P>
<P>
   Mayoum. Abaker's body was found a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The two other men _ on a CARE staffer, the other a private
contractor _
</P>
<P>
   have not been found.
</P>
<P>
   The area in which they were traveling is nominally controlled by
the
</P>
<P>
   government of Sudan, but it is close to the front lines of
Sudan's
</P>
<P>
   long-running civil war, said Peter Bell, president of CARE USA,
in an
</P>
<P>
   interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to government forces and forces of the Sudanese
People's
</P>
<P>
   Liberation Army _ which is the main rebel group _ splinter
groups not necessarily
</P>
<P>
   affiliated with either side also operate in the region, Bell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a hazardous area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are shocked and sickened by this terrible news, and our
hearts go out
</P>
<P>
   to the families of the dead and missing,'' said Jonathan
Mitchell, regional
</P>
<P>
   director in East Africa for CARE International, the umbrella
association of
</P>
<P>
   national CARE organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he was ``appalled by the blatant disregard for the
principle
</P>
<P>
   of protection for humanitarian workers exhibited by whoever
committed this
</P>
<P>
   crime,'' and called on Sudanese authorities to redouble their
efforts to find
</P>
<P>
   the missing men and to investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The incident came close on the heels of an ambush shooting Jan.
2 in
</P>
<P>
   Somalia, in which S. Mohammed Hussein, a CARE engineer, was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said CARE is extremely concerned for the safety of its
staff in various
</P>
<P>
   countries of the world. But he noted that this was the first
such incident
</P>
<P>
   CARE has suffered in 20 years of work in Sudan, and said he had
no reason to
</P>
<P>
   believe CARE workers had been specifically targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That having been said, as long as CARE is going to work in
situations of
</P>
<P>
   conflict, we are going to run risks,'' Bell said. ``The deaths
of these three
</P>
<P>
   workers only underlines the sacrifices that our staff are
prepared to make in
</P>
<P>
   order to relieve suffering. Many of them are real heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Abaker, a team leader for CARE, is survived by a wife and five
children.
</P>
<P>
   Mekki, a driver, left a wife and six children. Both men were
Sudanese, and
</P>
<P>
   each had worked for CARE for about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said that CARE delayed the announcement of the incident for
several
</P>
<P>
   days in to try to avoid jeopardizing the return of the two
missing men, and
</P>
<P>
   to avoid having the incident become a political issue in Sudan
when so few
</P>
<P>
   facts were known.
</P>
<P>
   CARE has been aware of the increasing dangers to its workers,
Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he sent to all CARE country officers a new set of
guidelines for
</P>
<P>
   staff safety and security. The new guidelines were not in
response to the
</P>
<P>
   most recent incidents in Africa, but were approved in November
by the board
</P>
<P>
   of CARE International at its meeting in Cambodia, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, CARE staffers will need more training on safety and
security
</P>
<P>
   matters, he said. But he said there was no indication that the
staffers in
</P>
<P>
   either Somalia or Sudan did anything wrong, or that their deaths
could have
</P>
<P>
   been avoided other than by having CARE abandon those areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the families has in fact been visited by senior care
staff in the
</P>
<P>
   countries, and they have _ as I have myself, by e-mail to our
country
</P>
<P>
   offices _ expressed our gratitude for their service and for
their
</P>
<P>
   willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of CARE's
mission,''
</P>
<P>
   Bell said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLIVAR, N.Y. _ Some 135 years after New York state's first
marketable oil for sale started flowing from a hole near here in
western New York, the producers are trying to suck the last drops
from wells producing on average a quarter of a barrel a day.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the few hundred people still employed face a threat that
they say could bring the long history of New York state oil
production to an end. State environmental authorities are requiring
them to spend thousands of dollars a well plugging holes that in
many cases have been abandoned for decades. The oil producers'
admitted failure to plug these holes as they went, and as the laws
have long required, has turned tap water in some homes into a
black, odoriferous ooze. One homeowner can demonstrate the
pollution at his kitchen sink by igniting his water with a pocket
lighter.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a collision between the heritage of the oil
industry's earliest days and the real-life environmental
consequences in the present. The weary survivors of a local
industry with its roots in the era of John D. Rockefeller see it as
another setback in their struggle to hang on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to assure there will be an oil and gas industry for
our children,'' said Paul Plants, president of the New York State
Oil Producers Association. ``About the only thing we have going for
us is our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Production peaked in 1882. Now, in the first four and a half
hours of Jan. 1, Texas produces about as much as New York does all
year. In 1998, exactly one new oil well was drilled in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivar (pop. 2,500) still has a Pioneer Oil Museum, open by
appointment. But over recent decades the area has become so
depressed that Robert F. Kennedy, when he was one of the state's
senators, had it declared part of Appalachia, among the nation's
poorest rural counties.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year after the world's first oil well was drilled in 1859 at
Titusville, Pa., drilling began nearby in New York, with commercial
sales five years later. The general area is described hereabouts as
the Southern Tier, huddling along the Pennsylvania border nearly
two hours from Buffalo on winding roads.
</P>
<P>
   Oil producers say their business became so obscure that during
the mid-1980s, when Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan spoke on a bill to
tax away the windfall profits that high prices had given major oil
companies, he stated that New York, after all, produced no oil.
About the only concern state officials have heard from
environmentalists has been an objection to possible drilling for
natural gas in a state park.
</P>
<P>
   Many families have been in the oil business here for
generations, but doubt they will be in it for generations more.
They cheer the recent rise in prices, but say it has not lasted
nearly long enough to change their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn in the corrugated steel shed that serves as his
company's office, garage, changing room and machine shop, Plants
huddles with a clutch of workers including his son, Stephen.
Plants, at age 62 still as rugged as the rocky local terrain, has
all his oil properties in New York but his headquarters just over
the state line, in Shinglehouse, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   As slight as New York's oil output may be, Plants says that a
national issue is at stake: helping domestic oil producers maintain
what is left of the nation's energy independence. ``The United
States is absolutely addicted to foreign oil,'' Plants said. ``But
here, we're being viewed as a dying industry.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In a shed, a huge, spoked steel wheel, powered by natural gas
produced along with the oil, rotates like a merry-go-round, pulling
on cables radiating out around the hillside that in turn work the
pumps down in the holes. Valves, gears and pistons clank, hiss and
pop, evoking a place down much deeper than the wells. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Obsolete? No more so than the region's family farms, Plants
said, adding: ``Are cows an environmental threat? They walk in
streams, they belch, they give off methane, so let's get rid of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   For James H. Plyler II, 29, and Heather S. Gunn, 22, oil poses
more of an environmental threat than indecorous cows. Early in
1999, as they looked over a two-bedroom home with peeling vinyl
siding near Wellsville, just east of Bolivar, on a narrow mountain
road convenient mostly to hunting clubs, they noticed that the
water was dark.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring no inspector, they say they were assured that it was just
a result of the house's having been vacant for months after the
woman who lived there had moved to a nursing home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After putting down about 10 percent on this $35,000 house, they
moved in on May 16, ran the faucets for hours and saw no
improvement. Checking their water well, they saw that the pump and
the wires leading to it were coated with oil. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For three months, they cooked and bathed with water from a
nearby spring, which appeared clean, or at least cleaner. They
called lawyers, their bankers, their real estate agency and the
local health department, which they say had certified the quality
of their water. An official there, they said, commiserated, saying
she had grown up with the same problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plyler, a machinist who regularly arrives at his plant by 4 a.m.
and stays until 4 p.m. to earn overtime, was finally advised by a
supervisor to call the Department of Environmental Conservation.
The state agent came out, took pictures and found out who owned the
oil well just a few dozen paces from the water well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know there were this many oil wells in New York
state,'' Plyler said. ``They must all be in my backyard.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plyler and Ms. Gunn installed a $5,000 filtration system, plus
clean new water lines, a holding tank and a hot water tank. Filters
expected to last more than three months were worn out in one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They, and their lawyer, want Timothy Quaintance, the investor
who controls the oil rights, at least to help cover their costs.
Quaintance, having plugged four wells near the Plyler home in 1999,
said he had no further responsibilities since he neither drilled
the wells nor produced oil from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing to do with this whole thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not until 1974 did the state start backing up its rules for
plugging abandoned oil wells by requiring owners to set aside the
necessary cash or bonds. But most of the state's wells date from
long before.
</P>
<P>
   As oil prices fell through most of the last decade, well
abandonment, and state enforcement, increased. To cover the costs
of plugging the wells, the state has sued some oil producers for
hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some have simply gone out of
business, fled or let matters drag on so long that they became an
issue for their heirs. Others say they lack the money to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The oil producers are negotiating with the state over tighter
rules, to clean up both current production and past messes. They
say that $1 million in fees they paid to help plug wells vanished,
in the early 1990s, into the state's general fund. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Gregory H. Sovas, director of the minerals division at the
State Department of Environmental Conservation, put it, ``I'm not
there to be a shill for the industry.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the chronic New York theatergoer there are
certain names whose very presence on a cast list provokes a purr of
anticipation. They make opening a Playbill like sitting down with
the menu in your local bistro and discovering that your favorite
special, which doesn't come around nearly enough, is at last being
served again.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Hecht is one of those names, at least for this chronic
theatergoer. She is a rarity on the American stage these days: a
young actress who combines professional agility with a quirky
individual style that feels as personal and specific as
handwriting. Though she has served time in the upholstered prison
of sitcoms (``Friends,'' ``The Single Guy''), she glows brightest
in live performance, bringing to mind the early careers of, say,
Sandy Dennis, Barbara Harris or, from a later generation, Swoosie
Kurtz.
</P>
<P>
   So it is gratifying to report that Ms. Hecht, seen last season
as the perpetually distracted heroine of Diana Son's ``Stop Kiss,''
is back on the boards in the Playwrights Horizons production of
``Lobster Alice,'' a thick slice of whimsy by Kira Obolensky. It is
doubly gratifying to report that after her triumphs as the dithery
neurotics of ``Kiss'' and Christopher Kyle's ``Plunge,'' Ms. Hecht
here assumes a more focused, aggressive persona without sacrificing
her very particular charms.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hecht plays a Hollywood secretary named Alice Horowitz whose
life is turned inside out by an encounter with Salvador Dali in
1946. She is also the principal reason to be of this show, which
has been staged by Maria Mileaf with a level of insight and visual
sophistication that the script itself rarely lives up to.
</P>
<P>
   The evening features a top-of-the-line production (with sets by
Neil Patel and astonishing mutating projections by Jan Hartley),
inspired music and sound effects by the invaluable David Van
Tieghem and a stylishly loose portrait of all-American uptightness
by Reg Rogers as Alice's romantically challenged boss, a Walt
Disney animator.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for a play that plunges its characters into a vortex of
mind-scrambling surrealism, ``Lobster Alice'' has a deeply
conventional heart. Its formula evokes, to its disadvantage, the
more spontaneous-feeling screwball movies of the 1930s, in which
repressed and timid souls learned how to live, laugh and love
through the stimulation of some madcap muse, usually an anarchic
heiress.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance the Carole Lombard type is replaced by Salvador
Dali (played by David Patrick Kelly), who in the wake of
``Fantasia'' has been commissioned to devise an animated ballet for
the Disney studios. The man overseeing the project, John Finch (
Rogers), is simultaneously working on the cartoon film of ``Alice
in Wonderland.'' ``Lobster Alice,'' which was inspired by a brief
and little-known chapter in Dali's career, accordingly presents a
world in which rigid logic and protocol melt like all those clocks
in Dali's ``Persistence of Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Such cultural material has been shaped into heady theater by
dramatists from Tom Stoppard to David Ives. Ms. Obolensky has an
ingenious conceit here, but she works it doggedly. The oppositions
of order and chaos, of tradition and iconoclasm are set up with
textbook neatness, just as the Freudian slips planted throughout
the dialogue pop out like road signs.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, every time the play starts to float into some
ether of the subconscious, the gravity of its self-conscious script
pulls it earthward. Even as the view through the windows of John's
Burbank studio magically turns from tidy photo-realism to Dali
dreamscape, the play consistently registers as too, too solid. It
is telling that in a fantasy sequence in which Dali and Finch fight
it out in the style of cartoon adversaries it is Von Tieghem's
sound effects, all those boings and sproings, that get your
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the conception of Dali, whom the play
presents as a cute pet eccentric. In the works of Richard Foreman,
Kelly has provided wonderful studies in what Dali called concrete
irrationalism, but here he is too much the captivatingly wacky
foreigner, suggesting Maurice Chevalier with an Italian accent and
a scatological obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Only when he is cozying up to Rogers' alarmed middle-class prig
does he hint at the sexual danger the character is meant to convey.
The evening is at its most confident when Dali is offstage, and it
might have been better to have left him as a presence much talked
about but never seen.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and Ms. Hecht both offer shrewd and winning exaggerations
of period styles. You sense that their characters' sense of sexual
identity has indeed been shaped by the movies.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Mileaf makes the most of their awkward artificiality,
especially in a compellingly uncomfortable seduction scene.
Everything in that moment works together: the stiffness and
tentativeness of the dialogue, the geometric absurdity of the
actors' postures, the abrupt shifts in emotion-matching lighting by
Frances Aronson.
</P>
<P>
   It is Ms. Hecht, however, who has been given the play's one
fully realized character, and she expands upon it with delicious
detail. Alice Horowitz is a Jewish variation on a familiar American
archetype: the small-town Midwestern girl who would rather be
practically anything other than ordinary. As she puts it: ``I am a
slave to the interesting. ... Why else do I study Chinese, Finch?''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in postwar costumes (the excellent work of Ann
Hould-Ward) whose discreet touches of flash whisper a craving for
attention, she brings to mind another Alice, Booth Tarkington's
socially ambitious Alice Adams, especially as played by Katharine
Hepburn in the 1935 film. You get the feeling that this Alice has
watched Ms. Hepburn and borrowed a few vowel sounds and speech
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   But the loopy inflections Alice Horowitz brings to even simple
phrases, not to mention the pauses that open up like black holes in
midsentence, are all her own and reveal more about her than she
ever intends. Ms. Hecht's performance is impeccably contained. But
it is Alice, far more than the mystical Dali, who provides the most
vivid map of the shifting underground paths in the human mind.

FAN-FRIENDLY OWNERS  
 HILL'S AWESOME ARSENAL
</HEADLINE>
   (With BKN-NOTEBOOK-MAGIC) 
(rk) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Pat Croce in Philadelphia to Larry Miller in Utah, the NBA
has no shortage of hands-on owners who hug their players and mingle
with their ticket-buying public. Mark Cuban, the prospective owner
of the Mavericks, should fit right in.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old co-founder of Broadcast.com has been e-mailing
Maverick fans on the team's Web site for weeks, intimating that he
will quickly put his stamp on the team. Cuban last week reached a
preliminary agreement to buy a controlling interest in the team for
a reported $280 million. According to a news release from the team,
the Hillwood Development Corp., led by Ross Perot Jr., will retain
a minority share of the Mavericks after completion of the proposed
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   A Pittsburgh native, Cuban became one of the country's richest
people last year when Yahoo, the California-based Internet company,
bought the four-year-old Broadcast.com for about $6 billion.
Cuban's personal take was about $1.5 billion. He is the guy who
invented streaming radio technology, in which subscribers can hear
live sports events broadcast over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's stock market plunge, he was said to have lost
$600 million in net worth. Informed of his projected loss, Cuban
was said to have merely smiled and shrugged his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   His purchase means two things for the league. One, franchise
values are not going down. Given that the Nets were sold for a
league-record $227 million in 1998 and the Mavericks will bring
close to $300 million, what will a playoff-bound NBA team
dominating its own sports market bring?
</P>
<P>
   Also, more and more people who spent their college years surfing
the Net _ long ago, these people were referred to simply as
``computer geeks'' _ are continuing to morph into free-spending,
fan-friendly owners. It is all the fault of the Blazers owner Paul
Allen and his Microsoft partner.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban has already met with Don Nelson, the Mavericks' coach and
general manager, who said he would not return as coach next season.
Entering the weekend, Dallas had lost five in a row and 9 of 10 to
drop to 9-23 this season under Nelson, whose coaching and personnel
decisions have come under scrutiny. The coach is just a few
victories short of 900 in his career but has a winning percentage
of only .300 with the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's Awesome Arsenal
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill did not make a 3-pointer all last season and had made
only 22 in his first five years. But the Pistons' All-Star forward
made a concerted effort to work on the mechanics of his jump shot
during the off-season, and now it has become part of his awesome
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting 40 percent from beyond the arc, Hill has already
connected on 16 3-pointers this season. Always hailed as an
incredible athlete who could slash and score at will, he has
suddenly blossomed into a consistent jump-shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Street &AMP; Smith's anointed Hill this past week as a possible most
valuable player based on his numbers and the fact that Detroit had
won six straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Hill parlayed back-to-back 42-point games at Orlando and Atlanta
into a 31-point performance against Milwaukee on Thursday night. He
scored 19 points in the fourth quarter against the Bucks, knocking
down two crucial 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have the best player in the NBA, we certainly have
the best noncenter,'' Pistons coach Alvin Gentry said of Hill.
``But the great thing about him, it's all about winning. He doesn't
care if he has to score 46 points or four points; whatever he needs
to do to win the game is what he will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill is averaging a career-high 27.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and
5.8 assists. He is making 48.5 percent of his shots. Named to the
U.S. Olympic basketball team this past week along with Ray Allen
and Alonzo Mourning, he is gradually becoming the league's most
versatile and productive player.
</P>
<P>
   All that is missing is a signature playoff performance for a
player on a team that has yet to escape the first round during his
career. Hill can exercise an escape clause in his contract this
summer and sign with another team. Depending on how far the Pistons
advance and whether he sees a championship in his future, he may
get antsy soon.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he stays or goes, with an improved outside shot and his
team finally on a roll, Hill's market value is soaring. And he
still has more than half a season in which to catch Shaquille
O'Neal, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett in the MVP voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's playing great,'' Hill said last week. ``We have to
continue to maintain this and not get too full of ourselves. It's
only a couple games that we've played well. In the past, we just
felt like we were never going to get it going. But this year, we
expect to do better. We expect to win.'' &QL;

ARMY TO INVESTIGATE EVENTS BEFORE KILLING OF GAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)  
(See also SOLDIER-DEATH) 
(lb) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the sentencing of a second soldier in the
killing of a gay private, the Army plans to investigate whether
officers at Fort Campbell, Ky., overlooked the daily harassment
that trial witnesses said the private faced before his beating
death, an Army official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is expected to announce on Monday that it has approved
a request by Fort Campbell's commander, Maj. Gen. Robert T. Clark,
to conduct an investigation into the events surrounding the killing
of the private first class, Barry Winchell, last July.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, by the Army's inspector general, could lead
to further disciplinary actions against soldiers and officers at
the base.
</P>
<P>
   A military court sentenced Winchell's roommate, Spc. Justin
Fisher, to 12{ years in prison on Saturday evening as part of a
plea bargain that allowed him to avoid more serious charges of
being an accomplice to the murder and helping cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, a 26-year-old soldier from Lincoln, Neb., pleaded guilty
to two counts of obstructing justice, three of making false
statements and one of providing alcohol to a minor during the
beer-soaked evening that led to Winchell's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pvt. Calvin Glover, 19, was convicted and sentenced
to life in prison for bludgeoning Winchell to death with a baseball
bat.
</P>
<P>
   The killing has reverberated throughout the military and
political establishments and has become an issue for both parties
in the presidential primary campaign. It has renewed the debate
over the Clinton administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy,
which allows gay men and lesbians to serve in the military provided
they keep their sexual orientation to themselves and do not engage
in homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   After Glover's conviction, President Clinton said the policy was
``out of whack,'' and Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered
the Pentagon's inspector general to investigate whether gay men and
lesbians face harassment on military bases because of their sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's inspector general, Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman, would
focus on what appeared to be a highly charged environment at Fort
Campbell in the months leading up to Winchell's killing.
</P>
<P>
   In Glover's trial, soldiers testified that Winchell repeatedly
experienced taunting with anti-gay slurs and that superiors did not
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   One sergeant, Michael Kleifgen, even testified that he had
questioned Winchell about his sexuality, a clear violation of the
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's inspector general is expected to investigate other
aspects of discipline and leadership at the post, including why
soldiers were allowed to drink excessively and openly at their
barracks with little apparent oversight or intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to assume they'll look into whether there were
violations of the `don't ask, don't tell' policy,'' the Army
official said Sunday. ``They'll also look into some of the other
elements of what the Army calls `command climate.'''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of allowing gays to serve openly in the military have
repeatedly cited the murder of Winchell as evidence that the
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy has failed, because, in practice,
gay service members continue to face harassment.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, Winchell, a machine gunner in the 101st
Airborne Division, kept his sexual orientation to himself, fearing
discharge under the policy, but still found himself subjected to
relentless harassment. Some soldiers in his unit testified that
they reported the taunting to Fort Campbell's inspector general,
but that nothing came of it, something that will likely be an
element of the Army's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the slaying, Glover goaded Winchell into a fist
fight and lost the fight. That prompted Glover, egged on by Fisher,
to retaliate by attacking the private with a bat while he slept.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's sentencing, Winchell's parents and
representatives of an organization that provides legal advice to
gay men and lesbians in uniform criticized the plea bargain with
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Winchell's mother, Pat Kutteles, called it ``a travesty.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to testimony, it was Fisher who first began to
circulate rumors about Winchell's orientation after taking him to a
bar in Nashville, Tenn., frequented by transvestites. Fisher also
provided the baseball bat and helped clean up evidence after the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the killing, a military policeman reported
seeing Fisher covered in blood and shouting ``Let him die! Let him
die,'' as an ambulance carried Winchell to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At court-martial on Saturday, Fisher tearfully apologized for
his part in the killing and asked for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry for the part I played in this,'' he said,
addressing Winchell. ``I know you are in a better place. I hope you
know that if I could go back to the morning it happened, I would
have changed it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army initially charged Fisher with helping commit
premeditated murder and acting as an accessory after the fact,
charges that could have led to life in prison. As part of an
agreement that included his cooperation in the investigation,
prosecutors dropped those charges and agreed to cap his sentence at
12{ years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army dropped the two charges directly related to the
crime, despite overwhelming evidence against him,'' Michelle
Benecke, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network,
an organization in Washington that provides legal aid to gays in
the military, said Sunday. ``That's the troubling part.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benecke said the Army's decision to order an inspector
general's investigation came too late and fell short of what was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army needs to do more than a review,'' she said. ``Army
leaders need to take action and make changes in the command climate
at Fort Campbell and elsewhere.''

   DUBA-YURT, Russia _ ``Artillery ready?'' Lt. Col. Yuri Budanov
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the planned targets!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Merry Christmas!''
</P>
<P>
   A thunderous blast reverberated through this Chechen town as
Russian artillery fired a salvo at rebel positions about 10 miles
away in the snow-covered mountains of southern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, had declared a halt
to air and artillery strikes on Grozny to mark Orthodox Christmas
and the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holiday. But there was no
moratorium here. In fact, fighting raged in Chechnya's mountains
and lowlands Sunday, as both sides decided this was a perfect time
to clash.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to turn the Russian-controlled areas of Chechnya into a
battlefield and shake the confidence of Russian troops, several
hundred secessionist rebels have surrounded the headquarters of the
Russian commandant in Argun, a town east of Grozny that the
Russians had seized in early December, according to Russian media
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Fierce fighting was said to be raging in Shali, southeast of the
Chechen capital. And clashes were reported on the outskirts of
Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, which the Russians had
wanted to use as an administrative capital for the Chechen
territory under its control. There were shootings and attempted
infiltration reported at checkpoints elsewhere in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The southern front near Duba-Yurt was tense, too.
</P>
<P>
   Duba-Yurt is located just north of the Caucasian ridge, a
stunning tableau of rugged mountains, shrouded in mist. It is also
the gateway to the Argun gorge: one of the main routes from central
Chechnya to the rebel bases in the mountains of southern Chechnya
and, eventually, to neighboring Georgia, less than 40 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are trying to push south into the gorge and destroy
the rebel bases on both sides of it. The militants are struggling
to move north toward Grozny and the lowlands, hoping to regain the
initiative and save their comrades fighting in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the war to follow the 1996 scenario,'' a situation
report issued by the Russian command said Sunday, referring to the
Russian military's humiliating defeat at the hands of Chechen
rebels in the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   That war ended with Chechnya gaining de facto independence from
Moscow; in the three years that followed, the territory became
largely lawless, with many Chechens, Russians and foreign visitors
being kidnapped. Last August, Islamic insurgents from Chechnya
invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan, and were
blamed for a series of unsolved apartment bombings in Dagestan and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow retaliated by bombarding Chechnya, starting the current
war _ a conflict that Moscow hoped it would win quickly, but where
its forces increasingly appear bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, militants left their hideouts in the mountains and
tried to break through the Russian lines here. They were repelled,
and Sunday Russian helicopters flew reconnaissance missions over
the mountains, searching for targets for Russian artillery. After
they picked out two rebel gun positions, Budanov ordered the
barrage.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Duba-Yurt's strategic significance has also made it one of the
most miserable places imaginable. Russia's 160th regiment and 138th
motorized infantry brigade have dug in near the village.
</P>
<P>
   Young Russian soldiers endure the bone-chilling cold and an
ocean of thick mud, churned by armored vehicles that prowl the
countryside. Hardened to the winter chill, some soldiers in a tank
battalion at the foot of the mountains had put aside their coats
and were simply wearing open-necked shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The tank crews live next to their vehicle in heated tents
pitched in the thick mud and snow.
</P>
<P>
   An unheated metal trailer, which functioned as a mess hall for
officers, served a high-calorie lunch to give them the energy to
cope with the frigid conditions: a sweet soup of milk and rice,
beef stew and sala, or salted pig fat, which the officers regard as
a great delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Russian troops fought their way to the edge of the mountains
here in December and they say their toughest fight was on New
Year's Eve, when hundreds of militants attacked the Russian lines.
The rebels were repulsed by Russian 122 mm self-propelled artillery
and tank fire, and the Russians claim that 150 rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not think we would come here, and we did not think
they would try to break through,'' Budanov said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are three cemeteries near Duba-Yurt. The Russians say
Chechens bring rebel corpses there for a proper Islamic burial. The
Russian soldiers keep their distance and do not interfere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come and bury the dead,'' the colonel added. ``What can
we do? We are not monsters. Let them go and bury.''
</P>
<P>
   This gesture is also way to gather intelligence, since according
to Islamic tradition here a Muslim who has been killed in a battle
has to be buried on the same day before sunset.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although the Russians are proud of their New Year's victory,
some tough fighting appears to lie ahead. Trying to control the
opening to the gorge, Russian infantry has already moved into the
mountains and seized many of the heights.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian forces here have yet to take back two key peaks
from the rebels, including one they have nicknamed ``Devil's Peak''
because it is 666 meters, which Russians consider a satanic number.
Even re-supplying the Russian soldiers in the mountains can be a
dangerous adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every mission to deliver food, water and ammunition is
essentially a combat operation,'' said Roman Bagreyev, a senior
lieutenant and the deputy chief of staff of a tank battalion.
``They make good use of the terrain and are constantly on the
move,'' he said of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Bagreyev's battalions were making a supply run when
an armored personnel carrier triggered a rebel booby-trap. The
militants had attached a tripwire to a grenade launcher. The
grenade just missed the armored personnel carrier before exploding.
Supplies strapped to the top of the vehicle were destroyed, but the
crew survived.
</P>
<P>
   As the artillery boomed, Budanov joked about the rebels' New
Year's Eve attack and the ongoing clashes during the Russian and
Muslim religious holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They congratulated us on the New Year, and we are
congratulating them,'' he said. ``We really don't have holidays
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The colonel apparently thought one congratulation was not
enough. So he ordered another barrage: ``Salvo. One shell. Fire.''

 &HT;    CARE confirms deaths of workers in Sudan; two still missing
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two employees of CARE USA have been shot to death in
Sudan and two others are missing, the Atlanta-based relief and
development organization announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which took place between Jan. 2 and Jan. 5, is the
second fatal shooting involving CARE employees since the New Year
began, and it served to highlight the increasing dangers
humanitarian workers face when they try to improve living
conditions in countries torn by civil strife.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Ibrahim Ishag Abaker and Mekki El Ekheir Mekki, and
two others set out Jan. 2 from the town of Bentiu, about 450 miles
south of Khartoum, Sudan's capital. They drove a truck carrying
food and medical supplies, and were bound for Mayoum, where they
planned to open a new health clinic.
</P>
<P>
   After they failed to arrive, a search and rescue team composed
of employees of CARE, the United Nations and the government of
Sudan was sent to the area. The truck and Mekki's body were found
Jan 5 along the road to Mayoum. Abaker's body was found a few miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   The two other men _ one a CARE staffer, the other a private
contractor _ have not been found.
</P>
<P>
   The area in which they were traveling is nominally controlled by
the government of Sudan, but it is close to the front lines of
Sudan's long-running civil war, said Peter Bell, president of CARE
USA, in an interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to government forces and forces of the Sudanese
People's Liberation Army _ which is the main rebel group _ splinter
groups not necessarily affiliated with either side also operate in
the region, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a hazardous area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are shocked and sickened by this terrible news, and our
hearts go out to the families of the dead and missing,'' said
Jonathan Mitchell, regional director in East Africa for CARE
International, the umbrella association of national CARE
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he was ``appalled by the blatant disregard for the
principle of protection for humanitarian workers exhibited by
whoever committed this crime,'' and called on Sudanese authorities
to redouble their efforts to find the missing men and to
investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The incident came close on the heels of an ambush shooting Jan.
2 in Somalia, in which S. Mohammed Hussein, a CARE engineer, was
killed. Bell said CARE is extremely concerned for the safety of its
staff in various countries of the world. But he noted that this was
the first such incident CARE has suffered in 20 years of work in
Sudan, and said he had no reason to believe CARE workers had been
specifically targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That having been said, as long as CARE is going to work in
situations of conflict, we are going to run risks,'' Bell said.
``The deaths of these three workers only underlines the sacrifices
that our staff are prepared to make in order to relieve suffering.
Many of them are real heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Abaker, a team leader for CARE, is survived by a wife and five
children. Mekki, a driver, left a wife and six children. Both men
were Sudanese, and each had worked for CARE for about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said that CARE delayed the announcement of the incident for
several days in to try to avoid jeopardizing the return of the two
missing men, and to avoid having the incident become a political
issue in Sudan when so few facts were known.
</P>
<P>
   CARE has been aware of the increasing dangers to its workers,
Bell said. Last week, he sent to all CARE country officers a new
set of guidelines for staff safety and security. The new guidelines
were not in response to the most recent incidents in Africa, but
were approved in November by the board of CARE International at its
meeting in Cambodia, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, CARE staffers will need more training on safety and
security matters, he said. But he said there was no indication that
the staffers in either Somalia or Sudan did anything wrong, or that
their deaths could have been avoided other than by having CARE
abandon those areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the families has in fact been visited by senior CARE
staff in the countries, and they have _ as I have myself, by e-mail
to our country offices _ expressed our gratitude for their service
and for their willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit
of CARE's mission,'' Bell said.

WITH CANDIDATES DEBATING MORE, COMPETITION PICKS UP BEHIND THE
SCENES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ They posted security guards at the doors to the
press room during the presidential debates at the University of New
Hampshire last week. Not to fend off angry readers, but to keep the
candidates' spin people at bay.
</P>
<P>
   During past debates, overeager campaign staff members would
invade the room to make pitches for their candidates as harried
journalists were trying to watch and write. ``They would complain
because these people wouldn't leave them alone,'' said Erika Mantz,
a spokeswoman for New Hampshire Public Television, a sponsor of the
Republican and Democratic forums here. ``So we made the decision to
keep the filing room a sterile environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Protecting the press corps from young campaign aides brandishing
stacks of freshly photocopied, point-by-point debate analyses might
not sound like democracy's most dangerous assignment. But that such
a task is necessary at all is a measure of how fiercely competitive
the rituals of presidential debating have become, and of the degree
to which the campaigns have developed sophisticated machinery to
try to turn these crucial encounters to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   These days, opportunities abound to glimpse the backstage
maneuvers _ Ms. Mantz even had to chase out a man from the Bradley
campaign wearing the press credentials of a female reporter _
because the candidates are debating and debating and debating some
more. Already they have bickered and parried in places like Nashua,
N.H., and Des Moines, Columbia, S.C., and Phoenix. They have stood
behind lecterns and sat around tables, answering questions about
public policy and personal preferences asked by famous moderators,
audience members, e-mailing viewers and even one another.
</P>
<P>
   Last week alone, four debates were held in three states, and a
fifth is scheduled for the Republicans on Monday night in Michigan.
Before the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1, at least four more will
be held, and campaign officials in both parties report having
received invitations to dozens of others in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do every debate that is on the list, this will be the
most debated Republican primary of all time,'' said William Dal
Col, campaign manager for publisher Steve Forbes. ``I say, let's
go. Let's have at it.''
</P>
<P>
   This gung-ho attitude is not shared by every campaign, for all
the televised, off-the-cuff conversing carries a different level of
risk for, say, a candidate trying to protect a lead in the polls.
Early on, for instance, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas skipped the
first candidates' forums, though he has participated in the last
five. Others have embraced the debates more enthusiastically. Vice
President Al Gore has even offered to stop running commercials and
participate instead in twice-weekly debates with former Sen. Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've accepted over 40 invitations,'' said Chris Lehane, the
spokesman for the Gore campaign. ``If you want to hold a debate in
your house, we'll be there.'' (The Democrats have met in televised
debates five times, with three more on their schedule.)
</P>
<P>
   Even if, as Bradley has asserted, Gore's offer is a ploy to
steal some of the thunder from Bradley's well-publicized advocacy
of campaign finance reform, there seems little doubt as to why the
proposal might strike a chord with voters, and why as a consequence
the candidates are debating so often. At a time when so much of a
political campaign is tightly scripted, officials involved in the
process say, a debate is one of the few remaining vehicles with the
potential to spark something like a burst of spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown, executive director of the Commission on
Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan group established in 1987 to
oversee the formal general-election presidential encounters, said
she thinks that the electorate is hungry for unfiltered exposure to
the candidates. Not only have the debates begun in earnest earlier
than in previous years, but she said she is also hearing this year
from more and more upset voters who want to watch the debates but
do not have cable television, on which most of the debates are
being broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single thing that sets a debate apart is that the
citizenry believes it still belongs to them,'' Ms. Brown said.
``There are no handlers, no props, and they find that enormously
appealing. That is why the viewership for debates is so high.''

   The country as a whole might not yet be concentrating heavily on
campaign 2000, but it is in full swing in New Hampshire, Iowa,
South Carolina and Michigan, all of which hold their caucuses or
primaries this month or next. And one sign of how full is the
popularity of the debates. For example, on New Hampshire Public
Television _ one of four local and national stations to carry the
debate _ more than 40,000 New Hampshire households tuned in
Thursday night to the GOP encounter, with Tim Russert of NBC as
moderator. Mary Norris, the station's coordinator of broadcast
services, said the program was one of its most-watched of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Already, the debates have produced moments that have helped to
illuminate the campaign, such as the Iowa forum in which Bush
declared that Jesus Christ was the political thinker who most
deeply influenced him, and the installment of ``Meet the Press'' on
which Bradley refused to shake Gore's hand on his proposal to
eliminate campaign commercials. Another memorable moment came last
week when Gore first seemed to accept the idea of a litmus test on
gays in the military and then backed away. &UR;  &LR; They are the kinds of
moments the debates' producers live for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal from the beginning was to find a creative way to make
sure it didn't become a press conference,'' said Beth O'Connell,
executive producer of special events for NBC News. Last month she
produced the Republican debate in Iowa moderated by the NBC anchor
Tom Brokaw and his local counterpart in Des Moines, John Bachman.
They were applauded by television critics and others for keeping it
lively: It was during that debate that Bush made his now famous
allusion to Jesus.

   By the time the six Republican and two Democratic candidates
arrived in Durham for the encounters sponsored jointly by the
Manchester Union Leader, New England Cable News and the public
television station, they were full-fledged debating veterans. So
were the organizers. ``You could say that we started planning this
four years ago,'' said Charles Perkins III, the Union Leader's
executive editor. They had decided to make it a traditional format,
with a moderator and three reporters asking the questions.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   No matter what format, though, the two parties' encounters at
the podiums already were taking on distinct personalities. The more
crowded Republican field was becoming more raucous, the more
intimate Democratic contest growing a bit testier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite edgy,'' said Peter Jennings, the ABC newsman, who
refereed the Democrats here last Wednesday night. He wondered, he
said, if the palpable antagonism between the candidates could be
picked up by the cameras. ``The thing I was dying to tell the
audience was how much goes on backstage,'' Jennings said. ``Gore
has dressing room A; Bradley wants to have dressing room A.
Everything's got to be equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the pre-debate elbowing for position was grueling,
according to those who put together the shows. The angles of the
cameras, the size of the candidates' holding rooms, the number of
aides who could be with the debaters backstage: all had to be
argued out with the candidates' handlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my fourth primary; each one has had its own
challenges,'' said Carole Paling, the executive producer of the
Durham debates. ``But this one surprised me in terms of the
boldness of their suggestions as to how we should produce the show.
When I have a cavity I don't tell my dentist how to drill.''
</P>
<P>
   The haggling even got down to the ways the candidates' voices
would be amplified: The campaigns lobbied for wireless microphones.
``It was a comfort thing,'' a slightly exasperated Ms. Paling
recalled. She had to explain the apparatus was not practical,
especially for the Republicans, because six candidates would
require the use of 12 separate frequencies. ``And with 12
frequencies, someone in the audience would have picked one up in
their dental work,'' she said.
</P>

<P>
   The intense preliminaries might actually have served the
process. By the accounts of some experienced political junkies, the
hourlong Durham debates made for taut television. ``I don't know if
it was the format or the press people, but you didn't just get
those pre-packaged, bite-sized answers,'' said Maurice Carroll, a
former political reporter who is now director of the Polling
Institute at Quinnipiac College in Hamden, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Carroll paid the proceedings a higher compliment: ``I
passed up the Rangers to watch.''

MOTHER OF SLAIN SOLDIER CONTINUES TO SEEK JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (See also SOLDIER-SENTENCE) 
(lb) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Somewhere in the long season of grief for her
murdered son, it dawned on Patricia Kutteles that she will never be
finished with the U.S. Army, where her son Barry found a home that
proved his undoing, and where he left her a cause that she now
pursues as his only true memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized it won't ever end till I die,'' Mrs. Kutteles said
recently. She spoke of her struggle to absorb, first, the brutal
barracks bludgeoning of her son; then, the shocking discovery that
he had been taunted for months with epithets; and now, her
deepening despair at military justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life is now at the whim of the Army,'' the mother said,
showing the tightly folded flag that she was given at the funeral
along with the Army's official regrets for the loss of her son,
Pfc. Barry Winchell.
</P>
<P>
   His murder last July at Fort Campbell, Ky., is being cited as
proof of the failure of the military's ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy toward gays.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kutteles spent much of the summer and autumn at the army
base, grasping for details about her son's months of harassment and
his death in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   She attended the court-martial of his confessed murderer, Pvt.
Calvin Glover, who beat her son on the head with a baseball bat as
he slept in the barracks. Glover, 19, who was taunted to act after
he had challenged Winchell to a fight and lost, was sentenced last
month to life imprisonment but with the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   This means, Mrs. Kutteles has learned, that she will have to be
vigilant after the first decade of imprisonment to speak at parole
hearings against any early release from the military justice that
she has learned to distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, it'll never end,'' said Mrs. Kutteles, a 50-year-old
registered nurse. She sat chain-smoking in her home near the edge
of the Kansas City's beltway, worrying about the surprising ways of
the Army. ``I'll have to go to years of hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Mrs. Kutteles is anguished at the leniency being
extended to Glover's accomplice, Spc. Justin Fisher, 26, who
witnesses said spread the rumors about Winchell's private life,
goaded his killer with taunts and handed him the bat, even washing
the blood off afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher, in exchange for testifying against Glover, saw the
most serious charge _ accomplice to murder _ dropped. He faces 12
and a half years for obstruction of justice, making false
statements, and providing alcohol to a minor _ a ludicrous
footnote, in Mrs. Kutteles' view, to the frequent drinking bouts at
the barracks that, the murder investigation showed, went on with no
interference from base commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've fought to find out _ and I don't care whether
Barry was gay or not _ leaves me worried about the safety of all
the young men and women the Army is supposed to be looking after,''
Mrs. Kutteles said. ``I can't bear to hear that Army recruiting
song: `Be all that you can be in the Army.' My son tried to be all
that he could be and he got murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   In her frustration, Mrs. Kutteles and her husband, Wally, who is
Barry's stepfather and a veteran of the Korean War, planned to try
to force the issue into a civilian court by pursuing a wrongful
death suit. They said they would take the step to protect the
rights of other soldiers and to defend their son's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kutteles angrily said her son was still being defamed and
points to stories she has been gathering from members of the
service who say harassment of gays continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making a mockery of his death,'' Mrs. Kutteles said.
She knew her son as a confiding young man who told her about
several girlfriends. ``I think he was just trying to find out who
he was,'' she said of reports that Barry began dating a Navy
veteran who apparently had undergone a sex change and was a dancer
at a nightclub in Nashville, Tenn. ``He, or she, is a very nice
person,'' Mrs. Kutteles said of the dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Her son was first taken to the club by his Fort Campbell
roommate, Fisher, who, witnesses testified, later spread rumors
that Winchell was gay. In violation of the ``don't ask'' policy,
some sergeants then began investigating the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Winchell, caught in this spiral, did not complain
about the persistent harassment for fear of being dismissed from
the Army under the ``don't tell'' part of the military policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry was so proud of himself as a soldier,'' his mother said.
``They called him `Top Gun,''' she said of his awards for
proficiency as a machine gunner in the 101st Airborne Division. He
never once mentioned his troubles, she said, but in frequent chats
would focus on her mundane cares and would offer a bit of
Army-slang advice about always being persistent in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear him now, over and over, telling me, `Suck it up, Mom,
and drive on,''' she remembered. ``Everything I'm doing is for him:
Suck it up and drive on.''
</P>
<P>
   After the slaying, other gay servicemen and women have come
forward to complain about harassment. Gays continue to leave the
military at a rate that has nearly doubled since the inception of
the ``don't ask'' policy in 1993, according to the Servicemembers
Legal Defense Network, a gay-rights group that monitors military
justice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Kutteles stays in touch with the organization, saying that
the case might have been treated by the Army as a classic
drunken-brawl crime but for the information the group received
about a hate crime rooted in homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SLDN helped immensely in finding out what really went
on,'' she said, accepting its cause as her own even though she has
no clear idea about her son's private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter to me one way or the other, and Barry would
know that,'' she said. ``And I think he would have told me as soon
as he figured it out.''
</P>
<P>
   What particularly grieves Mrs. Kutteles is a sense that the Army

 &HT;    Vikings take win over Dallas
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The first step toward purging the emptiness of
last year's playoff failure was successful, albeit shaky for the
Minnesota Vikings on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the NFC Wildcard game, the Dallas Cowboys made like
last year's Atlanta Falcons _ unfazed by the maniacal Metrodome
crowd or the home team's status as favorites. After a solid first
quarter, the Cowboys turned into this year's Falcons, and Minnesota
capitalized on Dallas' stumblebum effort to earn an underwhelming
27-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was the best therapy for a team that admittedly has not
gotten over the Falcons' upset in last year's NFC Championship
Game. The Vikings advance to meet the top-seeded Rams in St. Louis
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get out of the first round to get ourselves sort of
settled,'' said receiver Randy Moss, who had five receptions for
127 yards and a touchdown. ``We started slowly and I was thinking,
`Man, when are we going to get started?' But we were able to remain
composed and overcome that.''
</P>
<P>
   They were duly aided by the Cowboys' sloppy effort.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had three turnovers, including a fumbled punt by Deion
Sanders that set up a Minnesota field goal. The Cowboys twice had
third-down penalties that extended Vikings drives. In one case,
Sanders was playing to the crowd instead of counting the number of
teammates on the field. Dallas had 12.
</P>
<P>
   Those type of mental errors plagued the Cowboys all day.
Quarterback Troy Aikman (22-for-38, 286 yards) had three third-down
passes dropped. Said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey: ``If you make that
many mistakes _ turnovers, dropped passes, mental mistakes _ you
don't give yourself a great chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's chances were enhanced when running back Robert Smith
took charge while quarterback Jeff George struggled. Smith set a
Vikings postseason record with 140 yards on 28 carries, but it was
his reception and run in the second quarter that seemed to lift the
Vikings' spirits while demoralizing the Cowboys'.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas led 10-3 in the second quarter, when, on third-and-25
from the Cowboys' 26, George completed just his second pass of the
game, a little hitch to Smith in the left flat. With only George
Teague between him and the goal line, Smith gave the Cowboys'
safety an impromptu stutter step _ ``I don't know where that move
came from,'' Smith said _ and sprinted up the sideline for a
game-tying touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits Robert in the flat and he takes and 8-yard gain and
turns it into a touchdown,'' Minnesota coach Dennis Green said.
``That's what you have to be able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   From that point, Dallas did not muster much offense, then became
clueless on how to defend Moss. On third-and-8, Chris Warren
dropped a first-down opportunity, forcing a Dallas punt. Five plays
later, George connected with Moss on a 58-yard touchdown that put
the Vikings ahead 17-10 with 28 second left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith, who had a 65-yard run in the game's first drive,
became a virtual nonfactor after halftime. The Vikings stacked the
line of scrimmage and dared the Cowboys to beat them passing.
Dallas couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Rahib Ismail, Aikman's only reliable receiver, had receptions of
46 and 25 yards to set up an Emmitt Smith 5-yard touchdown. Ismail
finished with eight catches for 163 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's receivers weren't too sure-handed, either. Jake Reed
dropped a pass that would have put the Vikings inside the 5 yard
line; they settled for a Gary Anderson field goal. Moss let a
touchdown pass slip through his hands. And Chris Carter had only a
few balls thrown his way _ one was a diving reception that was
overturned on replay.
</P>
<P>
   Carter did catch a 5-yard touchdown pass from George early in
the fourth quarter to all but assure the Vikings another chance to
get over last year's Falcons loss. The 17-point lead was more than
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was last year, but we wouldn't be honest if we
didn't say we won't get over it until we get to the Super Bowl,''
defensive lineman Jerry Ball said. ``We don't dwell on that. We're
concentrating on who's in front of us. But we know how terrible it
felt to lose last year against Atlanta when we expected to go to
the Super Bowl. We still have a ways to go, but at least we've
gotten started.''

IRISH PHONE CONCERN MAY GET SECOND OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Telecommunications is considering a bid for
Ireland's second-largest telephone company, the Esat Telecom Group,
possibly rescuing it from a hostile offer from Telenor of Norway,
executives close to the talks said here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Esat, a telephone concern that has benefited tremendously from
Ireland's recent economic boom, said last week that it was in talks
with several unidentified companies about being acquired in hopes
of thwarting Telenor. Esat's rapid growth and small size attracted
Telenor, which is eager to expand beyond Scandinavia. Last month,
Telenor increased its bid for Esat in hopes of keeping a company
like British Telecommunications from spoiling its expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to British Telecommunications said that if the
company decided to proceed with an offer, it would bid about $2.1
billion. The executives stressed that the company had not yet
settled on its plans and could still decide to abandon the effort.
</P>
<P>
   British Telecom would have to at least match Telenor's offer of
$1.9 billion for Esat, which values each American depository share
of the Irish concern at $85. Originally, Telenor had bid for Esat
jointly with Telia of Sweden, with which it had planned to merge,
but that deal collapsed last month. Telenor has forged ahead with
its bid independently, raising it to $1.9 billion from $1.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors still seem convinced that Esat will be
sold to a third party at a premium over Telenor's bid. On Friday,
ADR's of Esat closed up $2.375, at $91.125, $6 above Telenor's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Esat's battle to stave off Telenor's hostile bid, the
two companies are partners in a mobile phone joint venture. Both
companies own 49.5 percent each of Esat Digifone, Ireland's
second-largest mobile phone network. It is unclear whether British
Telecommunications could gain control of the mobile unit because
both companies have the right of first refusal to the remaining 1
percent in the partnership, which is owned by Demot Desmond, an
Irish businessman. &QL;

DEAL MAKES LLOYD WEBBER DOMINANT OWNER OF LONDON THEATERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British composer Andrew Lloyd Webber on Sunday won
an international bidding war for ten of London's leading playhouses
and variety halls in a $145 million deal making him a dominant
owner in the world's largest theater district.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber, author of a dozen hit musicals including ``Cats,''
``Evita'' and ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' member of the House of
Lords and proprietor of three other West End theaters, said he was
moving into his new role to protect the stage from business
interests less concerned with what appears behind the footlights
than on the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is vital that the theater be in the hands of people who
know and love the theater,'' Lloyd Webber, 51, said in an interview
in his Belgravia townhouse. ``Otherwise our lifeblood is taken away
from us, and there's no room anymore for the old-fashioned producer
who will back shows that take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The composer said that he was not motivated by any desire to
control showcases for his own productions. While he expected to
realize profits from the new holdings, he said: ``I would like to
think that we will be more sympathetic to shows that deserve a
break to survive. There are lots of shows that don't look good on
paper and appear not to be good business where we'll say, `Let's
get behind this and hope it pays off.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's action marked another dramatic step in a revolution in
British stage ownership that began this summer when the ten Stoll
Moss Theaters houses and the eight stages owned by Associated
Capital Theaters (ACT) were put up for sale, and Apollo Group,
owner of 23 theaters across the country, was purchased for $255
million by SFX Entertainment, the American company that is a
worldwide promoter, producer and operator of live events.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people begin to talk about being able to stage shows well
because they have a vertically integrated company, you begin to
worry,'' Lloyd Webber said.
</P>
<P>
   While the composer's work today is no longer considered to be
the kind of artistically daring theater he professes to want to
sponsor now, it was, he argued, at the time. ```Cats' on paper was
the worst idea conceivable, but we got it on stage because Bernard
Delfont, an old-fashioned showman, took a bit of a flier on it. Can
you imagine a bunch of bankers sitting around saying, `Why don't we
put our money on a big musical about the wife of an Argentine
dictator?'''
</P>
<P>
   Among the theaters in Sunday's deal are the London Palladium,
the Garrick, Her Majesty's, the Lyric and the Theatre Royal Drury
Lane. They are part of the Stoll Moss group that was put up for
sale in August by Janet Holmes a Court, 56, who said she was
returning home to Australia to enter politics and attend to family
businesses developed by her husband, Robert, a well-known
international investor who died in 1990, leaving no will.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber's privately owned Really Useful Group was joined by
NatWest Equity Partners, a firm taking a 50 percent stake in the
new theater company that will be run by Richard Johnston, the
current chief executive of Stoll Moss. The Really Useful Group will
put the two theaters it owns outright _ the Palace and the New
London _ and the house whose ownership it shares with the New
York-based Nederlander Group _ the Adelphi _ into the new business.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 groups from Europe, the United States and Australia
became involved in the confidential Stoll Moss auction before the
choice came down to Lloyd Webber and Max Weitzenhoffer, a wealthy
Oklahoma entrepreneur with an interest in London theater who had
been a backer of some of the composer's shows. In the press release
announcing the transaction Sunday night, Lloyd Webber noted his
pleasure at bringing the theaters ``back into British ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Mackintosh, 53, the British impresario who once was a
producer of Lloyd Webber musicals but in recent years has become
the composer's rival, was portrayed in press reports this fall as
his chief competitor for the Stoll Moss properties. Last month,
however, he said he was not a bidder. Mackintosh already owns three
West End theaters and will most likely take control of two of those
bought by Lloyd Webber _ the Gielgud and Queen's _ because he owns
the leaseholds on them that expire in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Holmes a Court was said to be seeking $165 million for the
Stoll Moss properties, a figure that many investors, particularly
those with no established presence in London, found discouraging.
Theater purchases are sometimes derided as trophy hunts rather than
sound investments, but Lloyd Webber defended the $145 million final
figure, saying, ``We feel certain that at that price, with our
other theaters and other savings, it will work for us, though we
went to the limit of that.''
</P>
<P>
   His own company rang up losses in 1997 after making excessive
investments in foreign productions of his ``Sunset Boulevard,'' but
a year later Lloyd Webber took full control, replaced his
management and the company returned to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Though the West End has been thriving in recent seasons from the
boom in London tourism and entertainment, running theaters remains
a volatile venture. Many of the city's playhouses are grandly
ornamental Victorian and Edwardian buildings that call for urgent
renovation and involve high costs because of the antiquity of much
of the physical plant.
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners here, however, enjoy revenue-generating
advantages over their counterparts in New York because of more
demanding terms for producers, larger bar business, paid programs,
greater control of ticketing operations, and a tradition known as
personal property or ``p.p.,'' whereby the proceeds from the first
dozen tickets sold to every performance go directly to the owner
with no service deductions.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber said he foresaw massive changes in theatergoing
because of the anticipated move of ticket purchasing to the
Internet. ``If the time comes that these Internet companies want to
try to take over the theater business, they'll have to do it with
us, and that was a huge argument behind my management's thinking
about doing this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber was in an ebullient mood Sunday as he left his
house to answer a press photo call at one of his new theaters. He
said he was headed for the London Palladium, currently running
``Saturday Night Fever,'' and would take special care not to pose
in front of either the Piccadilly or the Theatre Royal Drury Lane.
The show at one, he pointed out, was ``Spend, Spend, Spend,'' and
at the other, ``Dancing on Dangerous Ground.''

   WEB SITE OFFERS HELP WITH IRS PENALTIES
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common problems business owners face is being
hit with a penalty by the Internal Revenue Service for not
complying with its intricate rules for quickly turning over to the
government the income and payroll taxes withheld from paychecks.
Now some relief is available from a company that makes tax
software.
</P>
<P>
   At www.taxpenalty.com, a site owned by TimeValue Software of
Irvine, Calif., business owners can list the amount of their
payments and other data to check how much penalty, if any, is due
for late payments or underpayments. While IRS agents have been
shown in some cases to have guessed at the penalty, TimeValue built
its own database to calculate penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS proposed 3.7 million penalties in 1997 totaling $3.23
billion, an average of nearly $900 per case. That means penalties
were sought for about one of every seven payroll tax reports,
TimeValue estimated. The IRS reduces the penalties in about
one-fifth of the cases, but the remaining penalties still totaled
$1.2 billion, or an average of nearly $400 per case in 1997 _ the
most recent year for which data are available.
</P>
<P>
   Often the IRS proposes a larger penalty than is required under
the complex rules on timing of payments, said Tom Persky, a former
IRS executive who designed TimeValue's penalty calculation
software.
</P>
<P>
   He said 91 percent of the businesses that had used TimeValue's
site since it was launched in August had had their penalties
reduced or eliminated. He said that on average penalties are
reduced 44 percent after using the site.
</P>
<P>
   TimeValue, which is privately owned, charges $49 if its site
determines that a proposed penalty should be reduced by $500 or
more. If the penalty reduction is less than that, or no reduction
is warranted, the service is free. The site generates a printout to
send to the IRS to apply for a reduction in penalties.

   VENTURE CAPITALIST'S PLAN TRIPPED UP BY NCAA
</P>
<P>
   When John Hummer, co-founding partner of Hummer Winblad Venture
Partners, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, created a
collegiate competition for Internet business plans, he figured
``March Madness'' had a nice ring to it.
</P>
<P>
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association thought otherwise,
telling Hummer Winblad that the name infringed on a trademark
reserved for the NCAA basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Hummer expected better treatment. He had participated in the
collegiate tournament as Princeton's starting center in 1969, long
before the postseason playoff was known as March Madness. But the
6-foot-9-inch Hummer, who went on to a six-year career in the
National Basketball Association and averaged 6.9 points a game,
knew better than to fight the NCAA on the point.
</P>
<P>
   The new name for the Hummer Winblad tournament is the February
Madness Start-Up Tournament: Nothin' but the Net. Not exactly a
slam dunk, but at least it evokes the basketball court _ and keeps
Hummer out of court.

GORE TO PRESIDE OVER SECURITY COUNCIL SESSION ON AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time, the U.N. Security Council will
convene on Monday to take up a health issue _ the spread of AIDS,
especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where the United Nations calls it
``the worst infectious disease catastrophe since the bubonic
plague.''
</P>
<P>
   In an election-year bonus for Vice President Al Gore, the
Clinton administration has designated him to preside over the
session, where he plans to announce that the administration is
seeking $100 million from Congress in next year's budget to combat
AIDS abroad. Most of it would go to sub-Saharan Africa, where,
American officials say, 10 people are infected with the virus every
minute. A portion of the money would go to India, which is expected
to become the next epicenter of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The money would go toward education and prevention programs,
home care, testing, blood screening and care for the millions of
children left orphaned by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   One focal point would be increasing money for the distribution
of a relatively inexpensive drug that can help block the
transmission of the virus from pregnant women to their children.
The United States now supplies $3 million worth of such drugs
overseas. The administration wants to triple that amount, although
the children who are saved usually become orphans because the
treatment does not save the mothers.
</P>
<P>
   In opening the session, Gore plans to say that the spread of the
human immuno-deficiency virus, which causes AIDS, has escalated
beyond a health epidemic to become a threat to global security and
stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no doubt that HIV/AIDS is a security threat,''
his draft speech says.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech notes that experts predict that more people will
die of AIDS in the next decade than have died in all the wars of
the 20th century. ``For the nations of sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS has
crossed beyond the borders of a humanitarian crisis to become a
security crisis,'' the remarks say, ``because it threatens not just
the citizens of those nations _ it threatens the very institutions
that define and defend those nations'' an apparent reference to its
major impact on business and professional people.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is also to announce that the administration is seeking $50
million for vaccines against other diseases that are ravaging poor
countries. And he plans to call for more involvement by
foundations, private corporations and other countries to help
provide basic health care in the developing world. Only 2 percent
of all global public and private biomedical research is devoted to
the diseases that are the major killers in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that vaccines that exist for some of these
diseases, including hepatitis B, influenza and yellow fever,
already save about 3 million lives a year and that the additional
money could save 4 million more. The idea, officials said, is to
establish a health network so that if an AIDS vaccine is ever
available, it can reach those who need it. Health care is so
minimal in many places that only an estimated 5 percent of Africans
know their HIV status.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is overseeing the Security Council meeting in his capacity
as vice president, but his presence is not without its political
component.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his sole rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley, have both been courting the
gay vote, which makes up more than 9 percent of the primary
electorate in the important states of New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS transmission in Africa has been primarily heterosexual,
while in the United States it has disproportionately affected gay
men and, more recently, members of minority groups. So the chance
for Gore to preside at an international forum to emphasize the vast
global consequences of the disease could help him secure his
standing both among gay and African-American voters, two heavily
influential voting groups in the Democratic party..
</P>
<P>
   There is another political element to Gore's visit to the United
Nations. The man who made Gore's appearance possible was Richard
Holbrooke, the new chief U.S. delegate. By providing this
opportunity to the candidate, Holbrooke could increase his own
chances to be named secretary of state in a Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   Since HIV was identified in the early 1980s, 50 million people
around the world have been infected with it and 16.3 million have
died. In sub-Saharan Africa, where 80 percent of cases are believed
to be transmitted through heterosexual activity, the virus has
killed vast numbers of teachers, members of the military and
employees in business enterprises from mining to banking, leading
to marked declines in gross domestic production in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Development in these countries has been set back 40 years,''
said Paul De Lay, chief of the HIV/AIDS division at the U.S. States
Agency for International Development.

COMMENTARY: DON'T BUTT IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The great temptation for President Clinton, host of
the Syria-Israel semi-summit in Shepherdstown, is to try to force a
deal by making promises on which he will not be around to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   His eagerness to bring the two antagonists to agreement is
understandable. First, it is traditional for the United States to
facilitate such talks. Second, Clinton surely yearns for a
peacemaking ``legacy.'' And a pre-election ``October surprise'' of
a comprehensive peace _ complete with signing ceremony at the White
House providing a boost to senatorial candidate Hillary _ adds a
practical incentive.
</P>
<P>
   For all three motives _ selfless, historical and personal _ the
heat is on to be peacemaker. However, his desire to bridge the gap
between Israel and Syria may induce him to give guarantees that
would lead only to a paper peace.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak, reportedly willing to give up
Israel's commanding position on the Golan Heights, expects a peace
treaty, water rights and, most important, ``security guarantees.''
That phrase means an American force of some kind to act as
observer, tripwire or border patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of putting U.S. troops on the Golan was a bad idea
when Yitzhak Rabin took it up in 1994. When I remonstrated with
him, he insisted: ``The whole idea was Bush and Baker's. They
proposed a whole division.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State James Baker's aide, Dennis Ross, demurred at
that number, but now Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national
security adviser, writes, ``It would be unacceptable to deploy a
token force or an unarmed peacekeeping presence that could be
easily brushed aside in a crisis.'' If needed for a settlement,
``the United States should be prepared to deploy combat units ...
to use force against any attempted armed incursion.''
</P>
<P>
   The only idea worse than unarmed U.S. ``monitors'' atop Mount
Hermon, helpless to avert or even report attack, is a permanent
American armed force, vulnerable to the sort of terror attacks that
drove U.S. Marines out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Our commitment to our ally Israel has long been to provide it
the qualitative edge in modern weaponry. The Israelis generations
ago won the respect of Americans by their willingness to defend
themselves. Our strategic presence is strengthened by our tactical
absence.
</P>
<P>
   A brave self-reliance also gave Israel the power to strike
pre-emptively when disaster loomed, without asking any other
nation's permission. Is Israel now willing to share its survival
decisions with future American presidents, or French presidents, or
U.N. officials?
</P>
<P>
   Barak is asking for that ``contingent'' of Americans atop the
Golan to help him sell the pullout to his public. The false sense
of security will help him gain support in a referendum. Clinton is
inclined to promise that his successors will send and maintain that
border force because he needs to close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The second element of peacemaking, in the Clinton approach, is
underwriting the costs of the removal and resettlement of 17,000
Israelis who mistakenly believed assurances that the Golan was
essential to Israel's defense. This is to be added to the U.S.
subsidies to be granted Palestinian leaders to close that end of
the comprehensive peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   American foreign aid going to Egypt and Israel since the Camp
David accords two decades ago now totals $100 billion. Is this the
sort of financial commitment being given to Israel and Syria by
Clinton in Shepherdstown?
</P>
<P>
   This may not be the kind of outlay that this Congress will
approve, or that future Congresses will continue. The Syrian regime
would have to change mightily to attract any sort of U.S.
investment. The Barak government has not yet replied to a November
letter from the Senate Foreign Relations chairman, Jesse Helms,
asking about sale of AWAC's technology to Beijing that threatens
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   A peace negotiation that relies at the outset on the uncertain
patrolling of foreign nationals and the iffy support of foreign
money is not likely to lead to agreement that will stand the test
of time. A deal that counts on outside policing and subsidy
encourages the principals to avoid reality.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should facilitate, not intervene with fast-souring
sweeteners. He should press Syria and Israel to make peace with
each other and not with him.
</P>

WHEN WILL LAKERS LOSE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eventually, one presumes, the Los Angeles Lakers'
winning streak will end. It's just getting tougher to figure out
how, when or why, or to whom.
</P>
<P>
   In winning 14 straight, they've beaten some of the league's best
teams (San Antonio, Toronto, Charlotte) and some of the worst
(Dallas, Vancouver). They've won at home (7-0) and on the road
(7-0). They've won with routs (122-98 over the Clippers) and with
comebacks (beating Seattle after a 19-point deficit).
</P>
<P>
   Even when they seemingly should lose _ Saturday's victory at
Seattle was the fourth game in five days, and they had to fight
back from a 13-point deficit the night before against Charlotte
they win anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to look at the results and think the Lakers,
winners of 21 of the last 22, might be, ahem, unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we're a very good team, we don't feel like we're
unstoppable just yet,'' Glen Rice said. ``We've still got a lot of
things we've got to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but it only makes the streak more impressive. The Lakers
have shown they can win despite their own nightly failures, as the
victories over the Hornets and Sonics showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning does help that, but you don't want to get into a
position where you get comfortable,'' Rice said. ``You don't want
to make it a pattern of trying to come back from behind all the
time. You want to go out there and get rid of teams early and get
the other guys on the bench involved as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests will keep coming as the Lakers try to reach 16
consecutive wins _ which would match the second-longest streak in
franchise history _ and stir notions of challenging the NBA record
of 33, set by the 1971-72 Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the next nine opponents have winning records, and the
Lakers have a tough three-game trip this week to Milwaukee, Indiana
and Minnesota. So they might have to stop spotting opponents
double-digit leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't turn it on and off,'' Kobe Bryant said. ``You get on
the road in Indiana or Milwaukee, that might bite you in the butt.
So we have to nip this in the bud.''
</P>
<P>
   A loss will surely come soon, but that doesn't seem a sure bet
anymore. As Rice notes, when the Lakers are clicking the way they
did at Seattle, anything seems possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can put 48 minutes together like we had that second
half,'' he said, ``I don't think there's a team in the league that
can come out and even compete with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The last word: The Bryant-Ruben Patterson grudge match, featured
as a prominent subplot by Seattle media, pretty much fizzled. As
expected, they rarely guarded each other, and while Patterson
reeled off 19 first-half points, he was held to two in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant did beat Patterson for a few key baskets in the second
half as he amassed a game-high 31 points, but said he didn't bother
saying anything to the self-proclaimed ``Kobe stopper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For what?'' Bryant said. ``He knows he can't guard me.''

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MINNEAPOLIS _ Good start, poor finish, with plenty of mistakes
sprinkled throughout. Sound familiar?
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys played Sunday's NFC wild-card game like many
of their others this season. The Cowboys looked impressive for a
quarter, then flailed hopelessly as they succumbed to the Minnesota
Vikings 27-10 at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith would make three defenders miss for a 65-yard gain
to the three. The Cowboys would then fail to get the final three
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman would complete a third-and-eight pass to Jason
Tucker, who would get to the Minnesota six. Tucker would then
fumble the ball through the end zone, resulting in a touchback for
the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's game symbolized our whole season,'' Smith said. ``We
can put it together one week, look totally lost the next. It's been
like a roller coaster _ up and down, up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost, confused, dazed _ all describe how the Cowboys looked at
times Sunday. There were the three timeouts they were forced to
take in the first 10 minutes because of miscommunication and
personnel problems. There was a 12-men-on-the-field penalty on a
punt return. There were passes that went one way when receivers
went another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to do one thing; he did something
else,'' said Aikman, describing one of the failed pass attempts to
Chris Warren.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the blown coverages. On one third-and-one
play, the Dallas defense let Cris Carter catch a five-yard
touchdown pass with nobody around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get off blocks and make plays,'' Cowboys
linebacker Randall Godfrey said. ``Surely I didn't come off blocks
and make plays I was supposed to make today, and a lot of other
guys didn't. But this thing can be corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Just not this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense went in with the goal of preventing the
long pass to Randy Moss or Carter. And Dallas pretty much
accomplished that, save one 58-yard touchdown pass to Moss. In
fact, Vikings quarterback Jeff George was 0-for-4 in the first
quarter and didn't complete a pass to a wide receiver until midway
through the second.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Vikings' short passing game _ underneath routes
and screens to the running backs _ that was the most dangerous.
With Minnesota trailing 10-3 and facing third-and-25 at the Dallas
26, running back Robert Smith caught a screen in the flat and
waltzed into the end zone untouched. Running back Leroy Hoard
caught a 10-yarder on third-and-six to keep a field-goal drive
alive in the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, Smith had a
32-yard reception on third-and-five to set up Carter's touchdown
catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the ball, they were so concerned with the guys
outside (Moss and Carter), they took off,'' George said of the
Dallas secondary on his TD pass to Smith. ``Robert is so smart. He
took off for the flat. I don't know if he knew I was coming to him,
but he was all I had. I just kept the ball in his hands and let him
do his magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also frustrated the Cowboys with his elusive running,
carrying the ball 28 times for 140 yards, an average of five yards
per attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game, if you would have told me we'd only give up
(199 net yards passing), I'd have chalked that up as a win,''
Dallas safety George Teague said.
</P>
<P>
   Moss caught five passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. Carter's
only catch was his five-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody would have told me they'd only have (199 yards)
passing, I'd have done cartwheels on the plane,'' Dallas cornerback
Deion Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   But even a spectacular defensive performance _ and this one
wasn't _ wouldn't have been enough to save the Cowboys from their
mistakes. Dallas fumbled three times, with two of the mistakes
leading to 10 Minnesota points and the other keeping the Cowboys
from scoring at least three.
</P>
<P>
   The first error came after a three-and-out series by the Vikings
on their first possession. Sanders fumbled the punt, which was
recovered at the Dallas 30 by Vikings linebacker Dwayne Rudd. Four
plays later, Gary Anderson kicked a 47-yard field goal to tie the
game at 3 with 7:01 elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not acceptable in a game of this caliber,''
Sanders said. ``And it started a series of turnovers by this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The next one came early in the second quarter after linebacker
Dat Nguyen had tipped a third-down pass to force a Minnesota punt.
On the ensuing possession, Aikman connected with fullback Robert
Thomas on a third-and-two pass. As Thomas was stretching for the
first down, Rudd stripped the ball, which safety Anthony Bass
recovered at the Dallas 23.
</P>
<P>
   Four plays later, George connected with Smith on the 26-yard
touchdown screen. Teague had a chance to make a tackle inside the
10, but rather than step up to meet Smith, he let the running back
juke past him into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's fumble, the Cowboys' third, came in the fourth quarter
on the ninth play of what had been the most productive Dallas drive
of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get an offense, especially our offense, back on the
field, that's always a good feeling,'' Rudd said. ``Turnovers in
the playoffs are huge. When you get a chance to put our offense
back on the field with turnovers, it's tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   As was the case when the teams played in November, the Cowboys'
offense got off to a quick start, with Emmitt Smith breaking three
tackles to race 65 yards to the three on the fourth play from
scrimmage. But the Cowboys, who have had red-zone problems much of
the season, were able only to kick a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   After the Vikings evened the score at 3, Dallas sustained a
seven-play, 79-yard drive on its next possession. Smith capped it
with a five-yard touchdown run with five minutes left in the first
quarter, but the Cowboys never scored again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was pretty much reminiscent of the year we've had,''
Aikman said.
</P>

COMMENTARY: THE TEACHER CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be fairly easy to get large numbers of decent
teachers for the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s and '40s, young people shaped by the harsh lessons
of the Depression were happy to have a steady job that was
respectable, even though the pay was low. In the 1950s and '60s,
when the baby boomers flooded the schools, women moved en masse
into teaching. Few other professional options existed. Women who
wanted a career became, for the most part, teachers or nurses.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s and early '70s, a wave of men went into
teaching. These were young, draft-eligible guys anxious for a
deferment that would keep them out of Vietnam. Only one out of five
remained in the profession for the long haul, but that 20 percent
was a significant boost to the ranks of teachers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Those more or less natural sources of teachers have long since
vanished, and the United States now finds itself in the midst of a
teacher shortage that is threatening the viability of school
systems from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shortage of competent teachers is one of the most glaring
problems we face right now,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
who plans to introduce federal legislation that is designed to
encourage more young people to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've entered a whole new type of economy in which ideas are
the generators of wealth, of jobs and growth,'' Schumer said in an
interview last week. ``But the No. 1 storm cloud on the horizon is
the lack of a young, high-quality, dedicated group of professionals
to teach our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the teacher shortage in a speech on Sunday, the
U.S. secretary of education, Richard Riley, said, ``It's gotten so
bad that some schools have been forced to put any warm body in
front of a classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortage will only grow worse over the next decade as tens
of thousands of teachers reach retirement age. It is estimated that
2 million new teachers will have to be hired during that period.
But how many first-rate teachers can you reasonably be expected to
recruit when the average starting salary is roughly $25,000 a year?
</P>
<P>
   Schumer noted that the greatest need for new teachers is in the
areas of math and science. School systems find it particularly
difficult to recruit competent men and women in those disciplines
because they can so easily command much higher salaries and much
better working conditions elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shortages in math and science are desperate in all but the
wealthiest districts,'' said Schumer. ``So of the 40,000 math or
science teachers we needed last year, only 3,000 had the necessary
math or science training.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortage overall is so acute that many school districts are
hiring just about anybody with a college degree. ``They get into a
classroom,'' said Schumer, ``and they don't know what to do. They
don't know how to teach.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of states and local districts are offering enticements
to young people to go into teaching. Gov. George Pataki of New York
has put together a tuition subsidy plan, and Gov. Gray Davis of
California is proposing, among other things, cash bonuses and
low-interest home loans.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's proposal, which he is calling ``The Marshall Plan for
Public School Teachers,'' would offer a variety of federal
incentives to potential teachers across the country. The key
elements are as follows:
</P>
<P>
   _ All undergraduate student loans would be forgiven for anyone
who becomes certified and teaches for five years.
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government would provide a $5,000-a-year salary
supplement for teachers who pass a special test in math and science
given by the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   _ The federal government would cover 75 percent of the cost of a
cadre of master teachers who would serve as trainers and mentors
for new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal employees who retire and go into teaching would be
permitted to begin receiving their pensions as soon as they left
their federal post. Schumer said he would encourage local
governments and private businesses to adopt a similar policy.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said his program would cost about $15 billion over
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are beginning to see education as an important issue,''
he said, ``but they don't yet see this teacher shortage as a real
crisis. It is.''

Question: Whatever happened to Steve Fisher, the coach of
Michigan's Fab Five? Answer: He's now coaching the Mediocre 5 at
San Diego State. Only at SDSU could they have a great facility in
Cox Arena and an attractive city like San Diego to lure kids from
the East Coast and still be a sub-.500 program. Utah at San Diego
State, ESPN, 9 p.m. 
TUESDAY 
Sure, the Kentucky-Auburn game two hours later may be the better
matchup, but how it's hard to resist tuning in an Indiana game in
the hopes of a Bobby Knight meltdown. Indiana at Michigan State,
ESPN, 4 p.m. 
WEDNESDAY 
With UCLA struggling and an NCAA bid far from automatic this
season, this game takes on added importance. Not to mention the
crosstown rivalry and bragging rights. UCLA coach Steve Lavin may
need an extra coat of oil for this game if the Bruins play like
they did at Washington. UCLA at USC, Fox Sports Net, 7:30 p.m. 
THURSDAY 
When they built Staples Center, it was supposed to give the Kings a
better chance to survive in the NHL. A better facility with luxury
suites and increased attendance would give the team more revenue.
However, it hasn't made the Kings a better home team. And playing
one of the better teams in St. Louis doesn't help matters. St.
Louis Blues at Kings, Fox Sports Net, 7:30 p.m. 
FRIDAY 
The Lakers may be best in the West, but can they beat the beast
from the East? Take off from work a little early and grab some dip
and chips as the teams with the two best records in the NBA square
off. Lakers at Indiana Pacers, Channel 9 and TNT, 5 p.m. 
SATURDAY 
These two teams received byes for the first week of the NFL
playoffs, and yet it's not beyond the realm of possibility that
Jacksonville and Tampa Bay could be upset. The Bucs defense has
been strong all year, but the team's offense could be a question
mark. Meanwhile, Jacksonville won the AFC Central, but will be
without the services of All-Pro left tackle Tony Boselli. Miami at
Jacksonville, Channel 2, 9:30 a.m.; Washington at Tampa Bay,
Channel 11, 1 p.m. 
SUNDAY 
The NFL's two best quarterbacks begin postseason action as Curt
Warner and the Rams and Peyton Manning of the Colts play host to
playoff games. Minnesota at St. Louis, Channel 11, 9:30 a.m.;
Tennessee at Indianapolis, Channel 2, 1 p.m.

CREDIT-CARD ISSUERS WARY OF NAME-A-PRICE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jay Walker first introduced the Priceline ``name your own
price'' system of buying airline tickets, he promised that other,
similar markets would follow soon.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, Priceline offers a range of products including
hotels, cars and groceries. In each of these areas, the concept is
the same: customers get to propose the price, but Priceline gets to
pick the actual hotel, car dealer or brand of chicken soup.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Walker said credit cards were a perfect market.
If customers can get a Visa card with the interest rate and
features they want, why would they care which bank actually offered
the card?
</P>
<P>
   But in practice, the idea was not so easy to execute. Priceline
is finally set to announce a name-your-own- price credit card
system Monday. But there is' only one card issuer _ NextCard Inc. _
rather than competing providers as in most of Priceline's other
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards, it turns out, are harder in some ways even than
airplane tickets, said Richard Braddock, Priceline's chief
executive. While NextCard had the technology Priceline needed to be
able to evaluate and respond to bids instantly, other banks did not
have comparable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Under its existing system, NextCard, a two-year-old San
Francisco company takes applications online (NextCard.com), looks
up the applicant's credit history, and offers a choice of three
different card products with different rates, fees and other
features. People with better credit records and those willing to
transfer big balances, get better deals.
</P>
<P>
   On Priceline.com, by contrast, customers will fill out a short
application and will also describe the credit card features they
want: An interest rate, an annual fee, a credit limit, and
optionally a rewards program (like travel miles). The system will
instantly respond, either by offering that card, or offering
alternative structures that are close to what the applicant wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, NextCard will check how much the applicant owes
on other cards and will offer lower rates if customers transfer all
their balances to the new card.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear, however, that in the absence of competing banks,
whether NextCard will offer any better deals on Priceline than it
does on its own site.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Springer, NextCard's director of marketing, said the company
had every incentive to satisfy those customers who go through the
bother of expressing interest on Priceline.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone says they want a 7.9 percent card, and I normally
would give them a 9.9 card, I'm highly motivated to give them what
they want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, Springer concedes, that NextCard could
well find itself charging higher prices to Priceline customers
because they turn out to be less loyal than card holders from other
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some concern that a Priceline type of customer may be
less attractive because they are more focused on finding the best
deal,'' said ``Many people don't shop around and just want a simple
solution.''

GM AND FORD IN AOL AND YAHOO DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The world's two largest automakers announced
partnerships Sunday with two of the biggest Internet portal
companies _ America Online and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   The General Motors Corp. linked up with America Online and the
Ford Motor Co. joined with Yahoo. The deals are supposed to make it
easier for customers to find car companies and for car companies to
find customers.
</P>
<P>
   The deals are similar. GM or Ford buyers who register through
special pages on America Online or Yahoo, respectively, will
receive periodic messages from the carmakers or their dealers _
everything from notices about changing the oil to recall
information to advertisements about rebates. And consumers can go
to the Web pages to look up information about cars sold at
dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, they make odd couples _ two old-line manufacturers
whose products take years to develop and two icons of the Internet
Age. ``The auto industry is one of the oldest around and we are one
of the newest,'' Jerry Yang, Yahoo's 31-year-old co-founder, said.
</P>
<P>
   The deals have benefits for both sides. ``We look at the
automobile as an Internet device,'' Yang said. ``Car companies have
never had a great way to communicate with their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The partnerships do not preclude the Internet portal providers
from doing business with other automakers. In fact, other alliances
could be announced later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exclusivity really isn't the name of the game,'' said Mark
Hogan, president of e-GM, GM's electronic-commerce unit. ``AOL is
clearly the one that brings the most eyeballs _ I'm sure Ford will
come to AOL'' in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   GM will pay America Online for some advertising, and for the
sales leads the company generates. Hogan said that the deal was
worth tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Yahoo executives refused to discuss the financial terms
of their deal. Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said,
``This relationship with Yahoo will reach 105 million consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are not the only deals brewing as auto executives gathered
here for the annual North American International Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Eaton, vice chairman of DaimlerChrysler AG, said the
company had talked with Renault, Fiat, Honda and others about
cooperating to build vehicles, and perhaps further links.
DaimlerChrysler, which resulted from the 1998 merger of
Daimler-Benz and Chrysler, would buy another automaker ``if the
right opportunity presented itself,'' Eaton said. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Times headline seemed almost a
parody, a ``Saturday Night Live'' spoof come to life: ``Davis Hails
First Year in Office as Total Success.'' But in fact, for Gov. Gray
Davis of California, much of the last year has been a string of
media superlatives, legislative achievements, fiscal luck,
political popularity and, yes, success.
</P>
<P>
   He won new reading programs for students and training for
teachers, exit exams for high school graduates and a plan to reward
schools for improved performance. He signed a half-dozen gun
control bills, including a toughened ban on assault weapons, a ban
on cheap handguns, a requirement for trigger locks on new handguns
and a limit of one handgun purchase a month per person.
</P>
<P>
   He approved a package of measures granting patients in health
maintenance organizations new rights to contest decisions on care.
</P>
<P>
   He even raised a record $8 million in campaign contributions in
the eight months after taking office, building a war chest aimed at
deterring any serious challenge to his re-election in 2002. In all,
not bad for a 57-year-old cautious but ambitious career politician
who was long scorned as the dullest, most unprepossessing player in
the California political pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been underestimated my whole life, and I don't want it to
change,'' Davis said with a self-mocking chuckle in an interview in
his office late last week. ``It's my greatest strength. You know,
this whole business is exceeding expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the expectations are higher. When Davis proposes his second
state budget on Monday, the news will still be good: An expected $3
billion surplus in the roughly $65 billion budget will mean more
money for education, including college loans, bonuses and
fellowships for teachers, more summer-school sessions for
underperforming students and a tenfold increase, to 70,000, in the
number of teachers to be given extra training in reading, algebra
and other skills.
</P>
<P>
   In all, aides say, he will propose spending about $257 million
more on education than is required by law, more than twice the
level of extra spending he proposed last year.
</P>
<P>
   But a state Legislature that has learned to take Davis' pledge
of moderation seriously will be demanding far more on a host of
fronts. Democrats, who control both chambers, want more spending on
mental health and the homeless, while Republicans want to halve
tuition at the University of California and California State
University systems.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful teachers union, which backed Davis strongly, is
sponsoring a fall ballot measure aimed at raising the state's
per-pupil spending _ which now lags in the bottom third _ to the
national average at a cost of nearly $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he would oppose that measure because it would require
a tax increase, which would break his campaign vow ``to do my level
best within the resources that the economy provides.'' He has also
vowed to veto every new gun control measure that comes before him
until those passed last year have had some time to be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm vetoing those bills,'' the governor said. ``They're
wonderful bills, but we've done enough for this year. Let's wait
until the prosecutors and the police come back to us'' and are
prepared to deal with more.
</P>
<P>
   The smart money in Sacramento predicts some rough sailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, he's had such a good first year, it's going to be
tough,'' said Richard Ross, a veteran Democratic political
consultant who is friendly to Davis but does not work for him.
``Listen, repeating is tough. I'm sure he's quite aware of it, and
he's seeing now that it's almost harder to govern in times of
plenty. The list of demands will always exceed the results.''
</P>
<P>
   The shrewdest of Davis' liberal legislative scourges is the
leader of the state Senate, John Burton of San Francisco, who has
called for a major effort to address the problems of the mentally
ill who were deinstitutionalized and swelled the homeless
population in cities like his.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment the other day on Davis' first year, Burton
puckishly proposed: ``Why don't you just rewrite Time?'' referring
to the news magazine's depiction of Davis last fall as ``The Most
Fearless Governor in America,'' a headline that prompted gales of
derision in the capital, where Davis stays close to the 50-yard
line on almost every issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known the guy since 1972,'' Burton said, ``so I don't get
disappointed and I don't get upset. He is what he is, and I am what
I am and it's no big deal to me. I think last year there was some
feeling around, but there was a tremendous willingness and desire
on our part to help him be successful. I think this year will be a
little bit different. He'll have his point of view, we'll have
ours, and we'll try to work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis himself acknowledged some rocky moments with his
legislative colleagues, as in a celebrated eruption last summer
when the governor, frustrated that legislators were sending him a
raft of health care bills that might be costly or contradictory,
declared, ``Their job is to implement my vision.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, legislative leaders groused that Davis, famously
disciplined in the details of fund raising and electioneering, had
been slow to fill appointive posts and occasionally seemed
underprepared in policy discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has accused Davis, a former lieutenant governor,
controller and assemblyman and the first Democrat to lead the state
in 16 years, of not doing his political homework.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he and his chief political adviser, Garry South, have
what amounts to a unified field theory of California politics,
which holds that the only way to win and govern successfully
statewide is as a resolute moderate, able to win support not only
in the coastal urban centers but in the rapidly growing inland
suburbs and the Central Valley.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because Davis cut his political teeth as chief of staff to
former Gov. Jerry Brown, the last Democrat to lead California,
politicians in both parties assumed that his moderate stance in
last year's campaign was largely tactical, a page from the
playbooks of President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, South notes, Davis has always been hard to pigeonhole,
the only Democrat in a staunchly Republican family, who was
inspired to enter politics after serving as an Army captain in
Vietnam and seeing how the war was being fought disproportionately
by minorities and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the candidates I have ever worked with, Gray is the
most anomalous blend of conservative beliefs and progressive
instincts,'' South said. ``He's a longtime vociferous supporter of
the death penalty. He was the only statewide Democratic elected
official in California in 1996 to support Clinton's signing of the
welfare bill. At the same time, he's a strong supporter of workers'
rights to organize, of health and safety regulations, with an
almost unequaled record on environmental protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis himself said simply: ``There's nothing government can do
to substitute for a growing economy. Twenty-five, 30 years ago I
might have thought differently, but now I'm convinced that
government has to do a few things and do them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he thought much of the recent federal devolution of
power to the states had worked well, especially in areas like
welfare, but he has continued to press hard, for example, for more
federal money for jailing illegal immigrants who commit crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis also said ``it would take me about an hour'' to simply
list California's biggest needs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what changes in the economy, or what unanticipated
problems might cause him to rethink his opposition to any tax
increase, the governor said: ``I don't want to go down that road.
What I tell people today is that we're experiencing the best
economy known in the history of man, and the problems that I
inherited, almost across the board, took 25 or 30 years to develop,
and we can't expect to solve them in one year.''
</P>
<P>
   Given California's size, and his success, Davis' name inevitably
surfaces as a potential vice presidential candidate, but he pledges
to serve out his term and expects to run for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just any state,'' he said. ``This is the
seventh-largest economy in the world, and I'm not going to trade
that in for the job of adviser, and that's what the vice president
is.'' Few doubt that Davis would prefer to wait for a potential run
for the presidency itself.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Davis seems to be savoring the rewards of his
gradualism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The times demanded that he basically leave well enough alone,
and any changes he was going to make be incremental,'' said state
Sen. Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, one of the capital's chief
Republican strategists, who praised the governor for incorporating
about seven major Republican proposals into his coming budget.
``And clearly that's his style, so that's a good match for
California. The first rule of a physician is `Do no harm,' and I
think Gray Davis has adopted that as a political axiom, too.''

AS TALKS WIND DOWN, BARAK VISITS SITE OF U.S.' BLOODIEST BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.V. _ On what appeared to be the last full day
of an initial round of peace talks between Israel and Syria, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak took a lengthy tour of the site one of the
deadliest single day confrontations in American history, the battle
of Antietam, and spent the evening at a final dinner with President
Clinton and Syria's foreign minister hashing out a path to an
elusive peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   The former general's visit to the Antietam National Battlefield
came at the end of an inconclusive week of negotiations, but one
that all sides said had finally resulted in a framework for
negotiations. And as he roamed the haunted Civil War site, where
more than 23,000 were killed or badly wounded, he turned to his
aides and said in Hebrew, ``It is amazing that more people died
here in one day than in all of Israel's wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was literally correct depends on how one assesses
what happened to those wounded in the battle, most of whom died
later of their injuries. But his intent in uttering the point in
front of Israeli, Syrian and American reporters, was clearly to
underscore his desire to strike a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak also underscored to reporters that the talks with
Syria were tough ones. ``There is no doubt it will be a tough
diplomatic battle,'' he said in his first public comments since he
arrived a week ago. ``It is impossible now to forecast how long it
will last, or the results.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, at least, Barak, mindful of the considerable
suspicion in Israel about any peace accord that calls for giving
back the buffer zone seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, has never
said here that such an accord is on the way. ``We won't sign an
agreement unless it strengthens Israel's position,'' he said on the
battlefield, which Clinton administration officials said he'd asked
to visit. Barak, a student of military strategy, also offered an
ex-general's analysis of the tactical errors committed by Gen.
Robert E. Lee and his Union opponent, Gen. George B. McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   He then boarded his motorcade and proceeded to a good-sized
working farm in Boonsboro, Md., owned by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. Albright, who leases out the land, offered
Barak a brief glimpse of American agricultural life.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian negotiator, Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, had
visited the same farm for tea on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Sunday, according to an official at the lunch,
Barak passed a clock, mounted on a barn, that clearly has not
worked for years. ``If we get a peace agreement,'' he said to
Albright, ``I'll come back and fix your clock in two phases.'' It
was a reference to the painfully slow talks here, where the phasing
of a withdrawal from the Golan has been among the many points of
constant argument.
</P>
<P>
   As they dined, Israeli negotiators finally met their Syrian
counterparts on the questions of national borders if the Golan was
returned, and the critical issue of access to water. The two
committees set up to discuss those issues at the beginning of the
talks last week had never actually met, a sign of the depth of the
discord over what issues the two sides felt they could talk about
first.
</P>
<P>
   That the committees met Sunday suggests that both sides now are
confident that they have signaled to their constituencies at home
that they are holding tough and can finally take up the substance
of their disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time just to get them to the point where they
could actually have a meaningful discussion,'' one American
official said Sunday. ``It doesn't sound like much progress, but
you should have seen what it looked like five days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is now in a delicate position. At the dinner he was
holding for Barak and al-Sharaa, he was clearly tempted to bring up
possible ways of bridging the differences that the United States
had put forth in a ``working paper'' given to the Syrians and
Israelis on Friday. But one senior official said Sunday that it was
``too early'' for Clinton to make that move, and suggested that he
might focus instead on a schedule for a second round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow time for Barak, who intends to leave Monday,
Israeli officials said, to go home and take the temperature on the
likelihood that any deal he strikes would actually pass muster in a
national referendum. And it would give Syria's ailing president,
Hafez el-Assad, time to consider whether getting back the Golan is
a big enough prize to put up with Israel's demands for a pullback
of Syrian forces, more military aid from the United States, and a
more normalized relationship with Syria. The timing of al-Sharaa's
departure remained unclear.

MCCAIN PURSUES AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY OF OPENNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to add 2nd take with fresh news from McCain's campaign trail.
Modifies 2nd and 4th grafs of 1st take for clarification.) 
(mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with a campaign finance controversy at a
critical juncture of the presidential race, John McCain, the former
Navy aviator, has adopted the tactic of flying straight into the
political flak.
</P>
<P>
   In a strategy calculated to demonstrate that he has nothing to
hide, the Republican senator from Arizona released hundreds of
letters he has written to regulators as chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee, some of them benefiting campaign contributors.
He has also asked federal agencies to open their files of his
letters.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday, as in last week's debates, he was on television
again patiently dealing with questions about letters like the ones
he wrote to the Federal Communications Commission on behalf of
Paxson Communications and other companies whose executives have
been his contributors.
</P>
<P>
   His avowed goal is to persuade the public that the letters
demonstrate not some kind of political hypocrisy, but rather, as he
said today on the CBS program ``Face the Nation,'' a ``clear
pattern of my acting on behalf of my constituents and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a risk as well: that the volume of letters, the
vast majority of them seemingly unconnected to any donors, might
leave the impression of a lawmaker constantly intervening on behalf
of business, if only to urge speedy action by federal agencies. Or
even that somewhere in the pile of correspondence there is
something his critics might turn against him.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain's insurgent candidacy, built largely on his cries for
campaign finance reform, this could be a make-or-break moment. It
comes far too close for comfort to his golden opportunity for an
upset of Gov. George W. Bush in New Hampshire. Yet his aides say
they believe there is also enough time, with three weeks to go
before that Feb. 1 primary, for him to recover.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, who is neck-and-neck in the polls with Bush
in New Hampshire, appears to be the only one standing between Bush
and the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   So, taking advantage of the hyperkinetic pace of modern campaign
news cycles, McCain's counter-barrage of openness this weekend
marked an effort by the senator to bring the controversy to a close
with the Sunday talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   The risk that unknown problems in the volumes of records might
lie ahead is related to the complexity of the issues involved, and
the layers and varieties of campaign donations from companies,
lawyers and lobbyists, including donations to the senator's past
congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The letters McCain wrote touch on arcana that are often
difficult for the average voter to grasp. Often it is unclear
whether McCain was even aware of the details of the letters he
signed, or whether the staff that prepared them could have known
about campaign contributions _ which in any event sometimes came
after the letters were drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Was an airline's plan to offer service in Flagstaff, Ariz.,
anticompetitive, as the city managers thought? he asked the
Department of Transportation. (It was not, came the reply.)
</P>
<P>
   Please consider the views of FareSearch, a Tucson, Ariz.,
company that researches air fares, when studying the
ticket-purchasing practices of consumers who try to outsmart the
airlines on fares, he implored the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   But other letters involved multibillion-dollar communications
mergers and substantial campaign contributions; and in some cases
it is hard to discern whether related contributions might have been
made, or by whom.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates doubtless will now face similar questions.
</P>
<P>
   While traveling through Des Moines, Iowa, on Sunday, former Sen.
Bill Bradley, a Democratic candidate, was asked whether he would
allow letters to federal agencies that he wrote while on the Senate
Finance Committee to be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly have no problem with that,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a senator I had a basic policy and that was I did not
intervene in regulatory matters,'' he said, although he might have
intervened on behalf of New Jersey, his home state, before agencies
like the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would write a letter to HUD saying give Newark (N.J.) the
grant but I did not intervene on behalf of people in a regulatory
process. I can't think of any time I did that in the U.S. Senate.
Somebody pulls up and finds one somewhere, I'd be extremely
surprised because I had that as a basic policy,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that the outcome of campaign crises turns less
on specific allegations than on how a candidate handles them. So
the last few days have been instructive in taking the measure of
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He has steadfastly refused to go into hiding. In fact, he did
not come off of the campaign trail for a moment. Nor did he
distance himself in any way from the press.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after a youth forum in New Hampshire
Sunday, McCain said, ``The worst thing you can do is get diverted
by something like this, which puts you off your game and causes
your wife to cry.'' His wife, Cindy, who was at his side, burst out
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   He has said repeatedly that he learned lessons from watching his
friend Bob Dole campaign in 1996 and that he thought Dole made a
terrible mistake when he locked himself away from reporters after
he caused a furor by saying that tobacco was not addictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his greatest assets was his relationship with the
media,'' McCain said recently, saying that Dole inexplicably cut
himself off from reporters who had covered him for years on Capitol
Hill, ``who knew him well and liked him. What do I mean by liking?
That they wouldn't sandbag him.''
</P>
<P>
   So, riding through South Carolina on Saturday afternoon on the
bus he calls the ``Straight Talk Express,'' McCain chattered to
reporters about how the New Hampshire cold aggravates the arthritis
in his bones broken during his captivity as a prisoner of war in
Vietnam. He discussed brands of long underwear. He accused a
reporter who had skipped covering one of his town meetings of being
AWOL and in need of court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   His television appearance Sunday allowed him to touch on broader
campaign themes. He was soon going after the size of Bush's tax
cut. ``Gov. Bush said that Washington is awash in cash,'' he said.
``We've got a $5.6 trillion debt.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was able to give a more nuanced view of the controversy
in South Carolina over the Confederate flag than Bush did in a
debate on Friday night, when he insisted that it should be a local
issue and resisted several opportunities to talk about his own
feelings about the flag.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McCain, too, said that he thought the decision about the flag
should be made locally. But he said of his own feelings: ``The
Confederate flag is offensive in many, many ways as we all know.
It's a symbol of racism and slavery. But I also understand how
others do not view it in that fashion. My forebears from
Mississippi fought under the Confederate flag. They were not slave
owners. And I'm sure that they considered their service _ one I
believe died at Shiloh _ was honorable.''
</P>
<P>
   There were signs Sunday that McCain might have turned the
corner, at least with the Sunday talk show pundits. Bob Schieffer,
the host of ``Face the Nation,'' said to him of the letters his
committee had released, ``I must say in all fairness, I've been in
Washington a long time, they look a lot like letters most committee
chairmen write to the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important question is whether voters, who have been
warming to McCain's themes and humor, accept his explanations.
</P>
<P>
   In Camden, S.C., on Saturday, Laura Rose, a 40-year-old nurse
who is leaning toward supporting McCain and had come to see him at
a barbecue, had not even heard of the regulatory matter. Her friend
Janice Cozzens, a 42-year-old artist, was dismissive of it. ``To
me, that's piddling little stuff,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And in New Hampshire Sunday, Stephen Connelly, 50, a Bell
Atlantic technician, said he saw McCain as a man of honesty. ``I
think that's a point of character, that he has said he has probably
been influenced by campaign money,'' Connelly said. ``I respect the
man for at least starting out by saying, `Me.'''
</P>
<P>
   But another voter, Elaine Langer, a retiree living in Hooksett,
N.H., said she had been leaning toward McCain until she decided
that his opposition to gun control was not strong enough. And she
said the letters he wrote sealed her decision to vote for either
Bush or Steve Forbes. ``I was a little disappointed,'' she said.
``I thought the way he talked he'd be more or less out of that kind
of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, McCain hopes to turn the debate in the Republican
presidential race to tax cutting and Social Security. He plans to
unveil his own tax-cut proposal on Tuesday, one that takes the
unorthodox approach of bringing class considerations, usually a
staple of Democratic politics, to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been going after Bush's proposal, saying it uses too
much of the federal surplus and gives too many benefits for the
wealthy. His own plan, he said Sunday, is ``going to give tax
relief to about 25 million Americans, low- and middle-income. It's
not going to give a lot of relief to the very rich.''

VIKINGS' SMITH RUNS THE COWBOYS BACK HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Dallas Cowboys entered Sunday's game the way
all Vikings opponents do: by picking their pain and attempting to
escape at least one of the two dangers presented by the Minnesota
Vikings' balanced inside-outside offense. Dallas decided it would
focus on the outside threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys insisted, in so many words, that they would not be
riddled and ripped by the Vikings' top receivers, Cris Carter and
Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   But the riddle and rip came anyway _ but from the inside, in the
person of running back Robert Smith. He was the difference as
Minnesota beat Dallas, 27-10, before 64,065 fans in the Metrodome.
And his performance allowed the Vikings to advance in the playoffs
for a meeting with the Rams in St. Louis next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith rushed for 140 yards, a Vikings playoff record. He
averaged 5 yards a carry, helped the Vikings gain nine rushing
first downs, and enabled them to lead Dallas in rushing attempts by
38-16 and in rushing yardage by 175-111. In the second quarter, he
added a 26-yard catch-and-run touchdown on a screen pass.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and after Smith broke Dallas down, Moss (with a 58-yard
scoring catch just before halftime) and Carter (who had a 5-yard
scoring grab in the fourth quarter, concluding the scoring) offered
a riddle and a rip, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to expect that both our running game and passing game
would explode at some time in the game, so I don't know how they
went about choosing to play us,'' Smith said. ``It just didn't work
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota line _ center Jeff Christy, guards David Dixon and
Randall McDaniel and tackles Todd Steussie and Korey Stringer,
along with the blocking of the three tight ends _ was marvelous.
The line pounded the Cowboys, draining their stamina, especially in
the second half when Minnesota, already leading by 17-10, outscored
Dallas by 10-0. On defense, Minnesota took advantage of a variety
of Dallas mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   As for the quarterbacks, the Vikings' Jeff George (three
touchdown passes, no interceptions) outplayed Dallas' Troy Aikman
(no touchdown passes, one interception).
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, though, was hampered by dropped passes, broken routes,
missed assignments and mental miscues all day. Only Raghib Ismail
(8 catches and a game-high 163 receiving yards) made consistent
plays among Aikman's targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make that many mistakes, and there were different
types, those type of things don't give you a great chance to win,''
Chan Gailey, the Dallas coach, said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Green, the Vikings' coach, said: ``We feel real good
about the game. We ran the ball, and in the playoffs you have to do
that, along with not having turnovers and having field position.
Dallas clearly made some plays in the secondary, but the run was
there for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Smith is a big plus for us. He's running stronger. This
is the only time this year he's been healthy. He feels great, he
feels frisky and he wants the ball. He knows he can break tackles
and he can also use his speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith exhibited all of those skills against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, though, struck early.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith burst around left end for 65 yards to the Minnesota
3-yard line on the game's opening possession. But Dallas could not
get into the end zone and settled for a field goal. The Cowboys
then stopped the Minnesota offense on three plays, forcing the
Vikings to punt, but Deion Sanders muffed the reception at the
Dallas 30. That led to a Gary Anderson field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas was up by 10-3 at the end of the first quarter because it
had marched 79 yards on a drive capped by Emmitt Smith's 5-yard
scoring run. Its defensive plan looked sharp. Minnesota had not
gained any passing yards, and Robert Smith was being held in check.
</P>
<P>
   But early in the second quarter, Dallas fullback Robert Thomas
fumbled at his 23 and Robert Smith capitalized with his touchdown
on the screen play for a 10-10 tie. Then Moss, with 28 seconds left
in the half, beat cornerback Kevin Mathis in a jostling match on a
deep ball, a 58-yard touchdown strike by George. The Vikings were
ahead by 17-10 at halftime, and the Cowboys were deflated. Mathis
was called for pass interference on the play, but Moss and the
Vikings did not care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got open,'' Moss said. ``He had his hands up against my
chest. Once the ball started to come, I had to get him off me. This
was a game, with the way their safeties were playing, so deep and
out of the run picture, that somebody in the backfield had to get
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Smith did.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only do so much,'' Carter said about the way Dallas'
defense chose to defend against the pass rather than the run. ``And
you only get so many opportunities to make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas committed seven penalties, and a few of them were costly
ones that kept Minnesota drives in gear. Even late in the game,
when Dallas was trying to rally, driving from its 20 to the
Minnesota 19, receiver Jason Tucker took a third-and-8 pass to the
Minnesota 6, then fumbled the ball through the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep doing the same old thing you have always done,''
Sanders said of the Cowboys' play, ``you are going to get the same
old thing you have always got.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith said: ``We are an 8-9 team. Mediocre, up and down,
nothing consistent, and consistently bad at times, showing some
signs of brilliance and being a very good ballclub, but a team that
couldn't put it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, however, is 9-2 in its last 11 games with George as
the starting quarterback. The Vikings have won four straight.
Minnesota is 11-6 now, but St. Louis is 13-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know about St. Louis is they have scored a lot of points
and won a lot of games,'' Robert Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Moss added about the matchup: ``They are supposed to be the
best. I think we are the best.''

CLINTON PLANS $2.4 BILLION IN ACROSS-THE-BOARD CUTS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under orders from Congress, President Clinton will
cut $2.4 billion in federal spending by applying a scalpel to the
budgets of all government agencies and departments, the White House
said Sunday. Some of what he will excise from the 2000 budget is
special projects inserted for constituents by individual members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   About $1 billion will be cut from the Defense Department. In
addition, White House officials said, Clinton will cut $180 million
from the Transportation Department, $166 million from the
Department of Health and Human Services, $108 million from the
Education Department, $96 million from the Agriculture Department
and $91 million from the Department of Housing and Urban
Development. The remainder of the $2.4 billion will come from
smaller reductions elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and
Budget, said Clinton had tried to protect programs that he
considered particularly important.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ricci said he cut $477 million from more than 2,300 projects
for which Congress had earmarked specific amounts. Such projects
include roads, bridges and other public works, as well as weapons
systems and special programs at various hospitals, clinics,
schools, colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Ricci said, the administration cut 5 percent
from spending for a Navy ship favored by the Senate Republican
leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi. In November, Lott got $375
million to begin building the ship, a $1.5 billion helicopter
carrier known as the LHD-8, though the Navy had not requested the
money. The ship will be built at the Ingalls shipyard in
Pascagoula, the largest private employer in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ricci said there will be no cuts in nutrition assistance for
low-income women and children, and no cuts in the Head Start
program for children from low-income families, or in child
immunization programs or child care or heating assistance for poor
people. Likewise, she said, there will be no cuts in the Superfund
program, for cleaning up toxic waste sites, or in the number of FBI
agents.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Ricci said, Clinton will delete $100 million from
spending on buildings and laboratories at the National Institutes
of Health. She said the move could delay maintenance work, but
would not harm the quality of biomedical research financed by the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders of Congress and Clinton wrangled over
spending for most of last year. Many Republicans wanted to make
across-the-board cuts in federal spending. Clinton argued that such
automatic cuts were mindless. He and Congress eventually worked out
a deal that whittled down the size of the cuts to 0.38 percent of
each agency's appropriation and gave the president some discretion
on what to cut.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insisted that Clinton could carry out the law by
cutting wasteful or unnecessary spending.
</P>
<P>
   Federal spending is expected to exceed $1.7 trillion this year.
Only one-third of that amount was subject to the latest round of
cuts, which did not apply to benefit programs like Social Security,
Medicare and food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   A total of $191 million will be cut from 30 weapons systems,
White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also cut $192 million from salaries and related
expenses at federal agencies. But, Ms. Ricci said, the bulk of all
the savings, $1.7 billion, came from cuts in various government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Ricci said, the Transportation Department is
cutting $63.5 million from federal grants to the states for highway
construction, and it is cutting $54 million meant for construction
of airports.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the department is cutting $61 million from specific
transportation projects earmarked by Congress.

IBM TO USE LINUX SYSTEM IN INTERNET SOFTWARE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM, the standard-bearer of mainstream corporate computing,
plans to announce Sunday that it is placing a big bet on Linux, a
symbol of software's counterculture, as the operating system of the
future for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Linux campaign at the International Business Machines Corp.
will include substantial financial investment, an aggressive
marketing campaign and a reorganization. A high-profile IBM
executive, Irving Wladawsky-Berger, former general manager of the
Internet division, is being placed in charge of the company's
software development for Linux, a version of the Unix operating
system available free on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement by IBM is the most striking evidence to date
that Linux is no longer a fringe technology, one that has sometimes
been viewed askance as more a political movement than a serious
development in software.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo last Friday to Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the IBM
chairman, and to the rest of the senior management team, Samuel
Palmisano, a senior vice president, described the rise of Linux as
``an important shift in the technology world,'' as companies use
the Internet more and more to overhaul their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next generation of e-business will see customers
increasingly demand open standards for interoperability across
disparate platforms,'' Palmisano wrote. ``Linux _ a
community-developed version of Unix _ will play a pivotal role in
this. We will embrace Linux.''
</P>
<P>
   Linux is a leading example of so-called open-source software _
software that is distributed free, with its underlying source code
openly published. Open-source technology, like Linux, is developed
by an international community of programmers who also examine the
code to fix bugs and suggest improvements.
</P>
<P>
   In his memo, Palmisano said that IBM would retool all its own
software so that it runs smoothly on Linux, and would work closely
with the Linux open-source community to make IBM technologies
available.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, according to one company executive, IBM will
probably set up a Linux software operation in India, which has
become a hotbed of Linux development, and hire a Linux marketing
executive from outside IBM by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies in the Linux market, VA Linux and Red Hat, which
make money by selling computers tailored for Linux or by offering
technical support and services for Linux customers, have had highly
successful public stock offerings in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   But they are fledgling companies compared with IBM, which has
close ties to major corporate customers around the world. And while
IBM has been offering Linux on some of its machines over the last
year, the announcement Sunday represents a wholesale, companywide
embrace of the open-source operating system.
</P>
<P>
   For IBM, the move is an effort to rejuvenate demand for its
servers _ larger machines that run computer networks _ and to
undermine key rivals, notably Sun Microsystems and Microsoft, whose
proprietary software is increasingly used in the Internet commerce
market.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, IBM warned Wall Street that its earnings for the
1999 fourth quarter would be below analysts' previous expectations.
It blamed the shortfall partly on depressed sales as companies put
off purchases and instead spent information technology budgets on
preparation for the rollover to 2000. Sales of servers, whether
mainframes or smaller Unix machines, were a particular weak spot.
Since then, analysts have been watching closely to see when, and
how quickly, IBM's server revenues might pick up.
</P>
<P>
   Palmisano, who previously led IBM's fast-growing services
business, was placed in charge of the server business as senior
vice president of the company's enterprise systems group. In a
meeting with analysts last month in New York, Palmisano was quoted
as saying the server business was a ``work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Palmisano called the Linux move ``a long-term
play, not something that will have a financial impact on the
company in the next quarter or two.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that if IBM could be a leader in the Linux movement,
optimizing its machines and its software applications for Linux,
the impact on the server, software and services business could be
``huge for IBM''
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the highly independent, often anti-corporate Linux
community promises to be a challenge for IBM. As Wladawsky-Berger
observed, ``Linux isn't so much an operating system as it is a
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Linux has become increasingly popular over the last year
_ still mainly on servers instead of desktop machines _ IBM decided
it should move early to embrace the technology. Like the rise of
the microprocessor, which caught IBM on its heels in the 1980s, and
the Internet, which IBM moved swiftly to assimilate in the 1990s,
Linux is ``another disruptive technology,'' Wladawsky-Berger noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you exactly where it's going,'' he said, ``but it
feels like another big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Linux announcement, according to analysts, is evidence that
IBM is increasingly nimble in recognizing and reacting to new
technologies. ``IBM wants to make sure it's in the running as Linux
develops over the next few years,'' said Jonathan Eunice, president
of Illuminata, a research firm in Nashua, N.H. ``It's a smart play,
but a bit speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   Linux does seem to be gaining ground rapidly in the corporate
world, at least as an operating system used for new applications
for electronic commerce on the World Wide Web. A recent poll of
more than 2,000 information technology managers by survey.com, an
online research service, found that they planned to increase
applications development for Linux and BSD, the other main
open-source operating system, by up to 500 percent over the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishing growth,'' said Dave Trowbridge, a senior
analyst for survey.com. ``The era of proprietary standards is dead.
The Internet is changing the way software is developed.''

CONFIDENT DOLPHINS SHUT DOWN SEAHAWKS AND KINGDOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Miami Dolphins did something Sunday they had not
done much of lately. They won a game.
</P>
<P>
   They shook off their late-season collapse, ignored the soap
opera swirling around the futures of quarterback Dan Marino and
Coach Jimmy Johnson and rallied to a 20-17 victory over the Seattle
Seahawks in the American Football Conference wild-card playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going to win this game and I told the team
that,'' Johnson said. ``We had preparation this week like I haven't
seen in a long time. You lose games and your confidence gets
broken. But our guys got a reprieve getting into the playoffs. One
win can do a lot of things, especially a playoff win. Before the
game even started we were shouting, `Let's go to Jacksonville.'''
</P>
<P>
   And they will. The Dolphins advanced will play the Jaguars at
Jacksonville on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks, meanwhile, made the last game ever played in the
Kingdome a forgettable one.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams staggered into the playoffs, losing five of their
final six regular-season games to finish at 9-7. But in their first
post-season appearance since 1988, the Seahawks kept staggering.
They blew two leads against Miami, gained only 32 yards in the
second half and watched Marino engineer the type of 85-yard scoring
drive in the fourth quarter that he is famous for.
</P>
<P>
   After four Marino completions for 84 yards, the rookie running
back J.J. Johnson, playing with a sore leg, scored on a 3-yard run
with 4 minutes 48 seconds remaining in the game to give the
Dolphins their only lead, at 20-17. J.J. Johnson helped the
Dolphins dominate ball possession, gaining 86 yards on 27 carries,
and Miami made no turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan did a great job executing and he did a great job throwing
the ball,'' Jimmy Johnson said. ``We had to make some changes going
in because we knew it would be noisy. We did away with the shotgun,
went to the run, did away with turnovers and showed we could win at
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing with a lead, Miami's defense, which took charge of the
game in the second half, sacked the young Seattle quarterback John
Kitna on three consecutive plays to snuff out one possession.
Terrell Buckley, who had drafted by Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren in
Green Bay, intercepted Kitna's pass with 23 seconds left to seal
Miami's first road playoff victory since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was ours to win,'' Kitna said. ``But you give Dan
Marino too many opportunities and he's going to hurt you. That's
what he did. Now that we're out of it, I hope he gets the Super
Bowl he deserves and tops off his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino completed 17 of 30 passes for 196 yards and a 1-yard
touchdown to Oronde Gadsden. O.J. McDuffie and Tony Martin each had
five receptions. All but 28 of Marino's passing yards came in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to be conservative in the first half,'' said
Marino, whose team was held to 3 points in the first half. ``We
opened it up a little in the second half and I hit some plays. We
didn't turn the ball over and that gave us a chance to win at the
end. It worked perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna was 14 of 30 passing for 162 yards and a 9-yard touchdown
to Sean Dawkins, but he also had two interceptions and was sacked
six times. Seattle was held to 171 total yards and 41 on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miami held the ball nearly 10 minutes more than
Seattle. Jimmy Johnson's game plan was designed as much to
neutralize the noisy Kingdome crowd as it was the home team. No
coach will ever have such a problem as the stadium will be
demolished in March and replaced with a new one by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren said his team's relative inexperience in postseason
games contributed to the loss, but not as much as simply being
outplayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our inability to execute physically hurt us more,'' said
Holmgren, who took Seattle to the playoffs in his first season as
coach and general manager. ``Certainly, a lack of experience hurt
us, but it didn't determine the outcome of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Field position dictated the first-quarter results. Starting at
the Miami 47-yard line, Kitna moved the Seahawks quickly with four
completed passes, two to Mike Pritchard, the last the 9-yard
touchdown to Dawkins for the first score of the game. The Dolphins
responded with a 32-yard field goal by Olindo Mare and Seattle led
at the end of the first quarter, 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   The only second-quarter points came in the final minute of the
half on a 50-yard field goal by Seattle's Todd Peterson after a
seven-play drive stalled. Ricky Watters touched the ball on six of
those plays, but he was tripped up by safety Shawn Wooden on
third-and-1 at the 32 for no gain to force the field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Playing despite a balky knee, Watters was the only ball carrier
for the Seattle offense in the half, carrying 15 times for 38
yards. He ran four more times in the second half for 2 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dolphins were so conservative with an equally
ineffective running game that the offense was limited to 69 yards,
half of Seattle's 139, and only 23 yards through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson let Marino open things up in the second half, which
started with great field position when Peterson's kickoff went out
of bounds. Marino completed an 11-yard pass to McDuffie on the
first play, completed six passes on the drive and capped it with
the 2-yard touchdown pass to Gadsden for a 10-10 tie.
</P>
<P>
   But the tie lasted only as long as it took the rookie Charlie
Rogers to return the kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown. The Seahawks
were back on top, 17-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys could have crumbled at that point,'' Jimmy Johnson
said. ``But we came right back with some points.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami responded later in the quarter. Autry Denson, giving J.J.
Johnson a breather, ripped off runs of 18 and 11 yards. Mare nailed
a 51-yard field goal to cut the lead to 17-13. Wooden recovered
Mare's successful onside kick, but Miami could not score until
Marino put together the decisive drive late in the game.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A mysterious computer intruder has tried to
extort $100,000 from an Internet music retailer after claiming to
have copied its collection of more than 300,000 customer
credit-card files, which could be used by others to charge
purchases online or by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Because the company, CD Universe, has refused to pay blackmail,
the anonymous intruder has released some of the credit-card files
on the Internet. He also claims to have used some other credit-card
numbers to obtain money for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic shakedown attempt is likely to rekindle consumer
concerns about the security of using credit cards for online
purchases. And because the e-mail trail indicates that the
extortionist is somewhere in Eastern Europe _ perhaps Latvia,
Bulgaria or Russia _ the case also demonstrates how the Internet
can enable electronic outlaws to operate beyond the jurisdiction of
U.S. law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet creates a whole new class of criminals,'' said
Elias Levy, chief technology officer of SecurityFocus.com, a
computer security firm. On Friday, Levy's company began alerting
journalists to the existence of a World Wide Web site that the
blackmailer had been using for two weeks to distribute perhaps
25,000 of the stolen card numbers to thousands of other people.
That site was shut down early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Internet you can have criminals coming from countries
where we have no extradition treaties,'' Levy said. ``How do you
prosecute these people, or even investigate their crimes?''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon a Connecticut-based agent for the FBI
confirmed that CD Universe was a victim of an extortion attempt and
said that the agency was investigating the crime. The agent would
not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   CD Universe is an online music store operated by eUniverse Inc.,
of Wallingford, Conn. An eUniverse executive said that the company
had been cooperating with the FBI in an effort to catch the
extortionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely has CD Universe data,'' Brad Greenspan, chairman
of eUniverse, said Sunday evening. ``Whether he hacked the site or
got the data in some other way, I'm not sure exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the company had begun sending e-mail notices to
its customers, alerting them to the theft, and was working with
credit-card companies on a plan to help customers whose card
numbers might have been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   A person who identified himself as the blackmailer and called
himself Maxim _ ``I am 19 and I am from Russia'' _ said in an
e-mail exchange with a reporter on Sunday that he had found and
exploited a security flaw in the software that is used to protect
financial information on the CDUniverse.com Web site. The person
said he had attacked other e-commerce Web sites by the same method,
but did not identify them.
</P>
<P>
   The extortionist said he had sent a fax to CD Universe last
month offering to destroy his cache of stolen credit-card files if
he was paid $100,000. After the company did not respond to his
demands, he said, he began placing the credit-card files on a Web
site on Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   The site, in operation until Sunday morning, was called Maxus
Credit Card Pipeline. There, with a single mouse click, a visitor
could obtain a credit-card number, name and address that the site
claimed was obtained ``directly from the biggest online shop
database.''
</P>
<P>
   EUniverse, which besides Wallingford has offices in Chicago and
San Francisco, operates a variety of Internet commercial services
that include CD audio sales, DVD movie sales and online computer
games. But with an estimated 300,000 customers, its CD Universe
site is small, compared with the leader in online music, CDNow,
whose site has some 4 million visitors a month.
</P>
<P>
   The person identifying himself as Maxim e-mailed the reporter a
list of 198 credit cards as proof of what he said was his
successful theft of a much larger credit-card database. A
reporter's calls to several of the people whose credit-card
information was on this e-mail list _ or was available on the Maxus
site _ indicated that at least those credit-card numbers were real.
</P>
<P>
   One of those people, a woman in Los Altos, Calif., who requested
anonymity, confirmed that she had been a CD Universe customer,
though not recently. When told that her credit-card data had been
stolen, she said she would notify the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent conversation, she said: ``I called the San
Francisco office of the FBI and they told me that I should make
certain that I had torn up the carbon copies of my credit-card
receipt. I had to explain to the agent that I had used my card over
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maxus site was shut down early Sunday after a group of
computer security experts who had learned of the Web site alerted
Lightrealm Inc., an Internet carrier based in Kirkland, Wash. The
blackmailer had been using Lightrealm's system to operate his site,
apparently without the company's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Maxus site was shut down, a traffic counter on the
site indicated that several thousand visitors had downloaded more
than 25,000 credit-card numbers from the system since Dec. 25.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In one of his e-mail messages Sunday, Maxim said that he had
been involved in the illegal use of credit cards since 1997.
Originally, he wrote, he had tried to create a legal online company
that would take payments with a credit-card processing system.
</P>
<P>
   But then, he said, he found he could subvert ICVerify, a
credit-card verification software program. The program is sold by
Cybercash Inc., an electronic-commerce security company based in
Reston, Va., whose software is widely used by e-commerce merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998,'' he wrote, ``I hacked in to a chain of shops and got
ICVerify (Cybercash) program with necessary configuration files for
transferring money.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that with the ICVerify program he had been able to make
a charge on a credit card and then give a chargeback refund to a
second credit card, a system that he said gave him an ``almost
anonymous'' offshore credit-card account. He also claimed that he
had been able to obtain cash from an automatic teller machine using
this account, after performing ``tricks'' with ICVerify.
</P>
<P>
   CD Universe employs ICVerify on its site, but Greenspan said
that the company was not ready to conclude that the blackmailer had
manipulated the software to obtain the customer information.
</P>
<P>
   Cybercash said Sunday that it was investigating the claims. Its
chairman, Daniel Lynch, said that about a year ago the company had
found a security flaw in ICVerify, but had created a software
``patch'' for it and notified its clients. He said he did not know
if all clients had installed the patch, though.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said his chief technology officer had told him the
company had routinely installed security patches to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Maxim, in one of his e-mail messages Sunday, said that it was
more typical for him to sell stolen credit cards on the anonymous
Internet ``chat'' system known as Internet Relay Chat or on a
special electronic underground in which stolen credit-card numbers
are exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that in the case of CD Universe he had faxed a
message that stated, ``pay me $100,000 and I'll fix your bugs and
forget about your SHOP FOREVER.......or I'll sell your cards and
tell about this incident in news.''

DESPITE GORE'S REVERSAL, CANDIDATES CRITICIZE `LITMUS TEST' FOR
JOINT CHIEFS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore faced new criticism Sunday
over his conflicting remarks last week on whether, as president, he
would require the Joint Chiefs of Staff to support allowing gays to
serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Gore backtracked from his statement during a
debate on Wednesday that he would make support for such a policy a
requirement for his nominees for the Joint Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said he would simply require them to follow his
orders as commander in chief and not impose a ``litmus test'' on
their personal views.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reversal, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a Republican
presidential candidate, Sunday criticized Gore's views, saying they
would have ``a terrible effect on the civilian-military
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he's backed off to; I guess it depends,''
McCain said during an appearance on the CBS news program ``Face the
Nation.'' ``But his initial statement showed me an incredible lack
of understanding of the role of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in an appearance before the New Hampshire State Republican
Committee, McCain elaborated, saying that questions about ``a
social agenda'' have no place in deciding who should lead the
military. ``The job of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs is to give
the president the best advice'' about military matters. He added,
``Don't ask, don't tell works. I'll support it; I'll continue to
improve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the NBC program ``Meet the Press,'' one of Gore's
campaign advisers, Bob Shrum, insisted that the vice president had
not significantly altered his position, which provoked criticism
from Republicans and retired officers who said Gore's initial stand
would have politicized the process of selecting chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who appeared with Shrum on the
program, disagreed. ``He made a major mistake,'' said Nadler, who
is supporting Gore's opponent for the Democratic nomination, former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey. ``He admitted it. He retreated. He
changed his position.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Gore's position underscored the resonance of the
issue in this year's campaign. The Republican National Committee
had already produced a television advertisement saying that former
Gens. Colin L. Powell and H. Norman Schwarzkopf would not have been
able to pass ``Al Gore's litmus test.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadler and Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said they would press for
legislation to change the current ``don't ask, don't tell'' law,
which allows gays to serve in the military provided they do not
disclose their sexual orientation or engage in homosexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who is one of three openly gay members of Congress, said
it was time to review the Uniform Code of Military Justice, noting
that it prohibited not only homosexual acts, but other acts, like
sex between unmarried heterosexual couples, that society viewed as
private issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that's a little outdated,'' said Frank, who also
appeared on NBC's ``Meet the Press.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who expressed support for allowing gays to serve but
stopped short of saying he would impose a ``litmus test'' on
appointees to the Joint Chiefs, declined Sunday to say how or when
he would order the Pentagon to allow gays to serve openly.
</P>
<P>
   But appearing on ``Fox News Sunday,'' he said the fact that
Congress had turned ``don't ask, don't tell'' into law made a
change more difficult than in 1993, when President Clinton was
forced to retreat from his campaign pledge to allow gays to serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to consult with people,'' Bradley said. ``You'll
definitely consult with the military. This is not something you're
going to do in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he supported the current policy and suggested that a
review of it would not be appropriate in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to change it, I don't think we talk about that
in a political campaign,'' he said. ``We talk about it after we
become the president and say, `I'll have a review of the policy.'''

MCCAIN'S IDEAS ON TAXES AND SOCIAL SECURITY DEFY GOP THINKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MCCAIN-FINANCE) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After decades in which Republican presidential
candidates have reflexively promoted tax cuts as the key to
prosperity and electoral success, Sen. John McCain of Arizona is
betting that there is a more potent issue this time around: Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy casts McCain in a role that President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore have played to the advantage of Democrats:
suggesting that too big a tax cut would be fiscally irresponsible,
disproportionately benefit the wealthy and endanger efforts to
shore up Social Security before the vast baby boom generation
retires. And it has set off a clash with his chief Republican
rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, over whether tax cuts have
lost their punch as a political issue, especially when the economy
is so strong.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few weeks, McCain has sought to highlight the
contrast between his plan, which would devote the bulk of projected
federal budget surpluses to overhauling the retirement system, and
the big tax-cut proposal by Bush, the Republican front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   It is a contrast that Bush has been equally happy to emphasize.
The result is a developing showdown between Bush's adherence to a
venerable Reaganesque approach of winning over the conservative
Republican base with a traditional tax-cutting message and McCain's
belief that voters are more worried about their long-term economic
security than about having a lower tax bill today.
</P>
<P>
   Questioning the wisdom of big tax cuts holds considerable risks
for McCain as he tries to defeat Bush in New Hampshire, a state
where Republicans are ardent tax cutters. And McCain's strategy in
effect wipes out one of Bush's greatest vulnerabilities in the
primaries: the suspicion among some conservatives that like
President Bush, who broke a pledge not to raise taxes, the Texas
governor is more moderate than he talks on fiscal issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has allowed Bush to get to the right of him on fiscal
and tax policy,'' said Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy
studies at the Cato Institute, a conservative research
organization. ``McCain has quite irresponsibly echoed Clinton's
objections to tax cuts in a way that could come back to haunt the
Republicans in the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some analysts say McCain may be astutely tapping into a
shift in national priorities. They say voters are less focused than
in earlier years on improving their current economic condition at a
time when jobs are plentiful and incomes are rising, and are
increasingly convinced that the benefits of the current prosperity
should be used to address tomorrow's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we seem to have moved from irrational exuberance
to rational responsibility, where tax cuts don't resonate as
strongly as they once did,'' said David C. John, a policy analyst
at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. ``Part
of it is that in a time of prosperity the tax bill doesn't hit as
hard. But people also seem to have a real recognition that Social
Security is in trouble and that we should make hay while the sun is
shining.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that their efforts to enact a big tax cut over the
last few years have gone nowhere, Republican leaders in the House
this week said they would concentrate on passing a number of
smaller tax bills. And most polling on the issue in the last year
has found Social Security consistently outranking tax cuts as a
priority among voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is by no means forswearing tax cuts. He plans to set out
a detailed proposal on Tuesday that his advisers say will benefit
lower- and middle-income taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers said the plan would expand the current 15 percent
bracket to higher income levels, reduce the so-called marriage
penalty paid by many two-income couples, provide tax breaks for
savings and expand the child credit. Like Bush's plan, they said,
McCain's would provide substantial benefits to people in the lower
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, they said, McCain's proposal would create a new
type of savings account, patterned after the Individual Retirement
Account, that would give the greatest benefit to people in the
lowest income tax bracket of 15 percent. Contributions up to $3,000
per taxpayer would be tax-deductible, with any gains subject to
ordinary income tax as long as the money remains in the account for
at least one year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will also propose expanded education and retirement
savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his proposal is likely to be no more than half as large
as Bush's plan, which the Bush campaign values at $483 billion over
five years. And rather than pay for his entire tax cut out of the
surplus, McCain plans to finance it in part by closing corporate
tax loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe,'' said Dan Schnur, McCain's communications
director, ``that a significant tax cut coupled with a Social
Security solution is much more efficient from both a policy and a
political standpoint than a huge tax cut that doesn't address
Social Security at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has repeatedly attacked McCain over the last week for not
backing a bigger tax cut, suggesting that McCain sounds more like
Vice President Gore than a Republican when it comes to tax cuts.
And he has asserted that unless the money is kept out of Washington
by cutting taxes, politicians will inevitably spend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush simply rejects the zero-sum mentality that says you
can't both save Social Security and cut taxes,'' said Ari
Fleischer, Bush's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In their debate on Friday, the two leading Republicans sparred
again on fiscal issues.
</P>
<P>
   McCain called it ``fiscally irresponsible to promise a huge tax
cut that is based on a surplus that we may not have.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the two had ``a fundamental disagreement,'' telling
McCain that the surplus ``will go to Washington under your idea,
and under my idea it goes into people's pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent official projections are for the surplus to
total $3 trillion over the next decade, of which $2 trillion would
come from excess Social Security revenue. The surpluses could
evaporate if the economy turns down or if Congress spends at higher
rates than now assumed. But preliminary estimates suggest that
updated projections scheduled to be released by the White House and
the Congressional Budget Office in the next few weeks could give
the candidates as much as $800 billion more to play with.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, McCain has pledged to reserve the $2 trillion Social
Security surplus to shore up the retirement system. Like Bush,
McCain says the best way to do so is to create a system of private
accounts within Social Security that would allow workers to invest
part of their payroll taxes in stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain has gone beyond Bush in proposing to use 62 percent
of the non-Social Security surplus, more than $600 billion in the
next decade under current projections, to help finance the private
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers said his plan would go much further in
assuring Social Security's long-term solvency than Bush's plan,
although they declined to provide any details to support their
assertion.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the real debate over Social Security may not be
the differences between McCain and Bush over how extensive a system
of private investment accounts should be established. Instead, it
is far more likely to be between the general Republican position in
favor of privatization and the insistence of most Democrats that
individuals not be exposed to the risks of investing in the
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The debate could be especially complicated if the market
continues the volatile seesaw pattern that left even the most
seasoned investors off balance over the last week.

GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO CURB BUYING OF PILLS ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Wash., Va.)  (Exclusive) 
(Eds: Rewrites 1st graf.) 
(lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government's seizures of imported drugs
soared last year to thousands of parcels containing more than a
million pills, as consumers turned to online drugstores based
overseas to buy bargains, illicit substances and prescription drugs
that they are embarrassed to seek from their physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Customs inspectors intercepted all sorts of drugs, including
steroids, hormones, aphrodisiacs, impotence medications,
anti-cancer pills, painkillers and tranquilizers sent from
Thailand, China, Mexico, Switzerland and many other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the shipments that they impounded are probably only a small
fraction of what consumers are illegally buying from fly-by-night
Web sites, many of which offer to mail drugs in unmarked envelopes
with few questions asked, according to customs and health
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Customs Service seized 9,725 packages with prescription
drugs last year _ about 4.5 times as many as in 1998, when they
confiscated 2,145 packages. The number of pills and tablets
impounded by the Customs Service jumped to 1.9 million, from
760,720 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the drugs that were seized had not been
approved for use in the United States, did not comply with U.S.
labeling requirements, or fell below federal standards for the
quality and purity of drugs. Because of controls like these, most
imports of drugs from Internet suppliers are illegal, although
buyers are rarely prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Raymond Kelly, the commissioner of the Customs
Service, said: ``The Internet has given us a lot more work. We've
been deluged with prescription drugs coming in from overseas. It's
a major challenge to deal with this huge increase in volume.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton recently announced an initiative to protect
consumers buying drugs on the Internet. But his proposal dealt
mainly with online pharmacies based in the United States, which
would, for the first time, have to get approval from the federal
government before they could sell drugs in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   That has left administration officials scratching their heads
over what can be done to police the virtually unregulated foreign
Web sites that have sprung up to cater to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's much more difficult than domestic enforcement,'' said
Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Regulation of offshore Internet sites is tricky for the Clinton
administration because Vice President Al Gore and other Democrats
continually berate drug companies for charging higher prices in the
United States than in other countries, and one of the main reasons
consumers buy online from foreign pharmacies is to get lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Other consumers turn to the Internet to get drugs that are
illegal to sell here, or to get legitimate medicines like Viagra,
the anti-impotence pill, without the trouble and possible
embarrassment of consulting a physician.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration advises consumers: ``Don't
purchase from foreign Web sites at this time. Generally it will be
illegal to import the drugs bought from these sites, the risks are
greater and there is very little the U.S. government can do if you
get ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
   A Web site called Drug Quest says it can, for a fee, help
Americans ``buy almost any drug without a prescription'' from
pharmacies in Mexico, the Caribbean and other parts of the world.
These pharmacies sell drugs at ``drastically discounted rates'' and
ship the merchandise discreetly so that ``95 percent of their
shipments arrive unmolested,'' says the Web site, operated by a
Florida company called LMB Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Another Web site, operated by Vitality Health Products in
Bangkok, Thailand, promises ``prescription-free pharmaceuticals by
e-mail at incredibly low prices.''
</P>
<P>
   And it seems to have a medicine for every malady:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hair loss? Try Minoxidil and Finasteride (Propecia). Erection
problems? Try Viagra, Yohimbine and Trazodone. Aging skin? Try
Retin-A and AHA creams. Poor memory, IQ? Try Piracetam, Hydergine
and Vinpocetine. Hormone replacement? Check out testosterone &AMP;
Premarin.''
</P>
<P>
   Vitality says, ``We guarantee to send your order discreetly
packed, without any reference to the contents on the outside of the
packet.'' But it says: ``Be warned. Medicines sent by post are much
more likely to be stolen in transit or intercepted by the
authorities than other mail-order products. If your order is lost,
stolen in the post or confiscated by the authorities, we guarantee
to refund your money immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The company even has a Web page on ``customs problems,'' which
tells consumers what to do if an order is seized by the Customs
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Falanga, a supervisory customs inspector at Kennedy
International Airport in New York, said: ``You can probably buy
anything you want over the Internet and have it shipped to your
house. We've found a big increase in prescription drugs and
anabolic steroids from virtually all parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Falanga said inspectors could not possibly examine every item,
because more than 100 international flights arrived at Kennedy each
day and most carried huge amounts of mail.
</P>
<P>
   Some packages carry customs declarations falsely describing
their contents. Government records show, for example, that potent
unapproved drugs like GBL and GHB have been labeled as wood
softener or bubble bath, even though the products are promoted on
the Web with claims that they can build muscles, enhance sex,
reduce stress and induce sleep.
</P>
<P>
   When the Customs Service seizes drugs, it may send a warning to
the purchaser. In rare cases, if the shipment includes a large
quantity of drugs with a high potential for resale and abuse,
customs agents may deliver the drugs and arrest the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean Boyd, a spokesman for the Customs Service, said the
agency usually refrained from taking action when consumers imported
small amounts of prescription drugs _ up to a three-month supply _
for their own use, and the drugs posed no ``unreasonable risk'' to
the users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't arrest Granny just because she wants to get her drugs
cheaper,'' Boyd said.

<P>
   A New Zealand pharmacy routinely ships drugs and hormones in
parcel-post letter packs, saying that such envelopes attract less
attention from inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, International Anti-Aging Systems, based on the
island of Guernsey in the English Channel, offers dozens of drugs
including Proscar, Prozac, Viagra, tetracycline, injectable human
growth hormone and ``brain nutrients, or smart drugs,'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company tells buyers that they are responsible for
compliance with import requirements. Moreover, it says, buyers bear
the risk of financial loss if their products are seized by the
Customs Service, and consumers cannot hold the company liable for
``any entrapment procedures that may be perpetrated by law
enforcement and government agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign Web sites promote Viagra, the anti-impotence drug
made by Pfizer. Andrew McCormick, a spokesman for Pfizer, said the
company had successfully urged state pharmacy boards to shut down
Web sites that sold Viagra without requiring patients to be
examined first by doctors. But, he said, it is more difficult to
take action against foreign Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra has been approved in 90 countries, but McCormick said
sales in the United States exceeded those in the rest of the world
combined.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have repeatedly seized drugs sent to the
United States from a Swiss pharmacy, Victoria Apotheke in Zurich,
on the ground that they were unapproved or misbranded. On its Web
site, the company describes itself as a fully licensed retail
drugstore established in 1880. It offers ``a wide range of 14,000
products available to be sent to customers all over the world,''
and it says it can help consumers ``obtain medicines not available
in your country.''
</P>
<P>
   Debby Fry Wilson, a spokeswoman for one of the best-known online
pharmacies, drugstore.com in Bellevue, Wash., said her company
complied with all federal and state requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson noted that state officials, using state laws, had
already shut down some unlicensed online pharmacies. But, she said,
``most of the illegal operators are doing their business on foreign
soil.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, said he was skeptical of the administration's proposal
to regulate online pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reluctant to set a precedent for regulation of the
Internet before the full potential of electronic commerce is
understood,'' Bliley said. ``A large number of illegitimate online
pharmacies are based offshore, but the administration's proposal
does not appear to address that problem.''

LEFT IN LIMBO, JETS ASSISTANTS CONSIDER THEIR OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Jets could have a new owner by Tuesday _ subject to
ratification by the National Football League _ and that could
trigger the immediate naming of a new (or old) head coach.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain on the coaching end: the Jets are convinced
that Bill Belichick is under contract, and that even if the club
names another head coach it is still entitled to compensation if it
allows Belichick to go elsewhere. Elsewhere, of course, is the New
England Patriots, who already formally requested to interview him
but were rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Jets believe that even if Belichick volunteers to
return to them as head coach, they do not have to take him back and
would still be entitled to compensation if he goes to another team.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' mess began last week after Bill Parcells stepped down
as head coach when their season ended, and by contract, Belichick
replaced him. However, a day later Belichick resigned, saying there
were too many uncertainties about the state of the franchise,
including Parcells' new role and the direction that the new owner
would be taking the team.
</P>
<P>
   The people feeling the worst about all of this confusion are the
assistant coaches _ one of the most highly respected groups in the
league. Pat Hodgson, the tight ends coach, says it is always the
assistants who suffer in coaching upheavals. The offensive
coordinator, Charlie Weis, told friends he worried about what to
tell his 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Two assistants are interviewing for coordinator jobs in
Cleveland _ the defensive line coach, Romeo Crennel, and the
running backs coach, Mo Carthon.
</P>
<P>
   The linebackers coach, Al Groh, recently turned down the head
coaching job at Princeton, in part because his son, Matthew, is a
freshman quarterback there, which would create a delicate balancing
act. Another reason was the possibility that he might become the
head coach of the Jets _ unless Parcells is persuaded to return to
the job himself.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Henning, the successful quarterbacks coach, who played a
large role in the remarkable comeback of Vinny Testaverde in 1998
and in the coming of age of Ray Lucas in 1999, finds himself in
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Henning's contract is over, he is 57 and he is likely to remain
on the job with the Jets only if he is comfortable with the coach
and is rewarded for his accomplishments. A new head coach from
outside the organization could prompt him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Groh, though, goes back with Parcells to West Point and 1969.
Groh was Parcells' defensive coordinator as well as linebacker
coach for four seasons with New England. Parcells and Groh were
also together at Air Force in 1978. Groh was Wake Forest's head
coach from 1981 to 1986 and was a defensive coordinator with the
1991 Giants after Parcells left.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Manhasset, N.Y., the 55-year-old Groh is savvy, a
gifted teacher and a man of some parts. He attended the University
of Virginia, where he studied commerce. He is not only popular
among the players, but he is also communicative with the news media
_ when Parcells grants him permission to speak.
</P>
<P>
   He has molded the Jets' top unit in the linebacker corps and is
respected by the players under him. He coached the Giants'
linebackers for two seasons, including the team that won the Super
Bowl after the 1990 season. When he was at North Carolina, he
helped recruit and then coached Lawrence Taylor. Parcells has told
the coaches he wants to keep everything on an even keel. He told
the players when he resigned that the franchise would remain
stable.
</P>
<P>
   Many people believe that the Jets' situation will stabilize only
with Groh's ascension or Parcells' return, which might happen if he
were rewarded with a piece of the team or another lucrative
addition to his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Monday is the deadline for the Jets to respond to the league on
Belichick's contention that his contract is not valid.
Coincidentally, the executors of the Leon Hess estate are also
meeting today and will presumably decide on the new owner.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the league's finance committee will meet in New York
and should have the choice of the Jets' new owner. The committee
would then discuss the potential owner's merits and decide whether
to recommend acceptance to other team owners later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, this week will see a flurry of activity regarding the
Jets: the new owner in consultation with Parcells about the next
head coach, the league's finance committee weighing the new owner's
acceptance and Commissioner Paul Tagliabue considering the
Jets-Belichick contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Given Tagliabue's history in deciding these sticky situations,
he is likely to ask both sides into his office by the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Pash, a league vice president and its counsel, will have
examined the legal niceties. Tagliabue will then ask Belichick and
the Jets if they would like to add anything to their written
contentions _ and invite them to his office in person.
</P>
<P>
   From there, if the Jets continue to be upheld on the contract,
Tagliabue will ask both sides to make an offer. At this point, the
Patriots will probably have to be involved, too, since Belichick
cannot offer someone else's draft picks. &QL;

   GATEWAY PLANS TO USE CHIPS FROM ADVANCED MICRO AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   The computer maker Gateway, which has attributed an earnings
shortfall to chip-supply problems caused by Intel, plans to
announce Monday that it will again be using microprocessors
produced by Intel's archrival, Advanced Micro Devices.
</P>
<P>
   Only last year, Gateway switched from buying some chips from
Advanced Micro to relying on Intel alone. But last week the company
described Intel's shipments as ``severely constrained, spotty and
unreliable.'' Executives said that the company would not remain so
dependent on a sole supplier.

   BRITISH TELECOM CONSIDERS ESAT BID
</P>
<P>
   British Telecommunications is considering a bid for Esat Telecom
Group, possibly rescuing it from a hostile offer from Telenor of
Norway, executives close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   PROFIT SEEN IN THE COUNTERCULTURE
</P>
<P>
   After years of being accused of selling out by their passionate,
political writers and readers, many publishers of alternative
weeklies are basking in the comforts of capitalism, as the sale of
The Village Voice demonstrated last week. The sassy fringe of the
newspaper industry is now getting attention from private investors
who have come to believe that alternative weeklies, perennial
prodigals, are reservoirs of value.
</P>
<P>
   THE EVOLUTION OF SILICON VALLEY
</P>
<P>
   The Internet boom is bringing sweeping demographic changes to
Silicon Valley, according to an annual report card for the region,
which shows that in 1999 for the first time the number of nonwhite
residents surpassed that of whites. The influx of new immigrants is
also increasing an income disparity between skilled workers and
those in the service industries.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE HOLIDAY SALES STILL GUESSWORK
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the Commerce Department will announce estimates of
retail sales for December, putting a solid number on the 1999
holiday season. Those wishing to gain a better sense of the
e-commerce results, however, will be out of luck. Policy-makers,
investors and analysts will have to resort to their own
crystal-ball formulations, put together from shards of statistics
and economic assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   A new holiday survey of seasoned Internet users showed that a
majority bought more books online than in standard stores.
</P>
<P>
   WEB SITES SEEK PROFIT IN POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Internet start-ups are hoping to make money in
campaign politics, a world traditionally dominated by nonprofit and
volunteer groups. But as these commercial political sites strive to
cash in on campaign advertising, they are finding it difficult to
earn credibility with candidates and the public.
</P>
<P>
   A DIFFERENT MADNESS ALTOGETHER
</P>
<P>
   When John Hummer, co-founding partner of the venture capital
firm Hummer Winblad Venture Partners and Princeton's starting
center in 1969, created a collegiate competition for Internet
business plans, he figured ``March Madness'' had a nice ring to it.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association thought otherwise,
contending that the name infringed on a trademark reserved for the
NCAA basketball tournament. So the new name for the Hummer Winblad
tournament is the February Madness Start-Up Tournament: Nothin' but
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   PRICELINE EXPANDS TO CREDIT CARDS
</P>
<P>
   Priceline is set to announce a name-your-own- price credit-card
system Monday. But there is only one card issuer _ NextCard _
rather than competing providers as in most of Priceline's other
markets.

   LOS ANGELES _ Major League Baseball looks like it's busy playing
the public relations game with its John Rocker mess.
</P>
<P>
   Since when does baseball reveal that it's ordered a player to
undergo psychological testing? For what, being an idiot?
</P>
<P>
   And if psychologists could rid the world of bigotry, what the
world needs is a hell of a lot more psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   __That said, what is up with Jesse Jackson? Ray Rhodes is fired
after an 8-8 season because he's African-American?
</P>
<P>
   How about because _ as they discovered when fired by the Eagles
last year _ he's not a very good coach?
</P>
<P>
   The Packers missed the playoffs for the first time in seven
years. And if it's racial, remember these are the same people who
hired him.
</P>
<P>
   __Maybe if we see that replay of the surreal Titans-Bills final
play another 10 times, it finally won't look like a forward pass.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it doesn't bode well down the playoff road for
Taft's Jeff Fisherthat his Titans had to squeak out a victory at
home on a miracle finish.
</P>
<P>
   __Tonya Harding and ice: The world really doesn't need further
evidence of a wrong match.
</P>
<P>
   __Is Billy Knight with UCLA today?
</P>
<P>
   __What's more fashionable these days, Hollywood blondes turning
Hollywood brunettes or the Mighty Ducks blowing another power play?
</P>
<P>
   __Given their success, it's hard to argue Scotty Pippen hasn't
been a strong addition to the Blazers, but his numbers aren't
making for a convincing story. Although he leads Portland in
assists at 5.3 per game, he is only third in scoring (12.9), third
in rebounding (6.8) and tops in turnovers (2.7).
</P>
<P>
   __Seen sitting courtside about 25 seats away from each other at
last week's second Lakers-Clippers games at the Staples Center were
your former rival NFL L.A. owners in waiting, Ed Roski Jr. and
Michael Ovitz. Just like old times, only without blueprints and
spin.
</P>
<P>
   __One of the things we like best about Phil Jackson as Lakers
coach is the way he's not afraid to criticize his players, even
glamour boys like Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who thinks their current 14-game winning streak means
there's no way the Lakers would now trade free-agent-to-be Glen
Rice need only harken back to last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were riding a 10-game streak when Jerry West traded
Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell to Charlotte last year for Rice and
J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   __Let's see, Al Davis wants $800 million from Oakland/Alameda
County for broken promises and $700 million from the NFL for giving
up his supposed rights to the L.A. market.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Irwindale escaped cheap.
</P>
<P>
   __How could the Dodgers' Single-A team in San Bernardino hire
Jack Clark as their hitting coach without naming Tom Niedenfuer
pitching coach?
</P>
<P>
   __Is it just us, or does every time TV uses a camera from behind
to view a punt, it looks like the punter shanks it?
</P>
<P>
   __So much for parity. Those blowouts of the 8-8 Lions and
Cowboys in the first round of the playoffs didn't exactly enhance
the NFL's postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Barry Sanders: You were right after all.
</P>
<P>
   __Wonder if Marge Schott has ever met Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   __The Rams might have gone 1-2 against teams with winning
records this year, but they were 8-0 at home and won by an average
margin of 25 points. And they have the homefield advantage
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   __Ah, winter is in the air. The Dodgers open their annual winter
workouts this morning. With renovations going on at Dodger Stadium,
this year the volunteer workouts will be held at USC.
</P>
<P>
   The old pasty guy will be Orel Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers sure have worked hard to fill that right-handed
middle-relief need this offseason. Now if only they could do
something about that problem at second base, center, catcher and
the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   __If Steve Lavin thinks he's been under heat now, he'll think
he's fallen into Death Valley on an August afternoon if UCLA
stumbles at the Sports Arena against USC on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he can get Erica Gomez to talk to the boys.
</P>
<P>
   __Now we understand. GM Bill Stoneman is just confused. He
thinks he was hired as the Angels' farm director.

REPUBLICANS PUT THEIR DIFFERENCES ASIDE FOR ONE NIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ While Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has been
scolded even by his own supporters for neglecting the voters of New
Hampshire last year, there were no signs of displeasure at a dinner
here Sunday night attended by more than 1,000 of the state's most
active Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was welcomed with a far more boisterous outpouring than any
of the five other Republican contenders who appeared, including
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is leading Bush in some polls in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The audience reaction at the dinner at the University of New
Hampshire, a fund-raising event for the state's Republican Party,
is not necessarily representative of how Bush will perform in the
first primary in the nation on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But it demonstrated the degree to which many of this state's
Republicans appear to have rallied to his cause. In addition, many
have apparently forgiven him for being the only contender to pass
up speaking at the party's fund-raising dinner last year.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief address Sunday night, Bush stuck mostly to his
basic stump speech about cutting taxes, improving education and
restoring dignity to the White House. But the governor went out of
his way to praise the elected officials who endorsed him in this
state, as well as to fondly recall his trips to New Hampshire last
year, seeming to make the case that he had been here more than
people thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the memories of walking the Fourth of July parade in
Merrimack, Amherst _ or meeting people on the shores of Lake
Winnipesaukee in the summer,'' he said wistfully. ``I remember the
numerous town hall meetings like the one in Dixville Notch, where I
spoke to everybody in the entire town.'' (When Bush finally
ventured to Dixville Notch, in the far northern reaches of New
Hampshire last fall, McCain had already been there twice.)
</P>
<P>
   Although New Hampshire voters expect presidential candidates to
shower them with attention and more attention, they seemed
forgiving of Bush. ``Being the favored national candidate, he had
to spend time in the other states,'' said Stu Gilman, 42, a
software company owner in Weare, N.H., who sported a Bush sticker.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who had upbraided one another in a frenzy of
debates in recent days, took care Sunday night to appear nice to
one another in front of the partisan audience. Several took aim at
the Democratic contenders, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   McCain drew cheers when he castigated the two Democratic
candidates for saying they would expect their appointees to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff to support their positions allowing gays in
the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not qualified to be commander in chief of the armed
forces of the United States,'' McCain said, arguing that it is
inappropriate for a president to appoint military leaders who
follow their ``social agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond speaking about broad policy matters, the Republicans here
also sought to curry favor with voters in this state by trying to
find local common ground with New Hampshirites.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher, opened his remarks with a
tribute to Nackey Loeb, the owner of the Union Leader of
Manchester, who died on Friday and was a revered figure among many
conservatives here. ``We mourn her passing,'' he said. ``Let us be
guided by her spirit.'' (It was also a gentle way for Forbes to
remind people that he received the newspaper's prized endorsement.)
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah also did his best to play up his
bonafides with the Loeb family, saying, ``I go back a long time
with Nackey.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain went further than anyone else in promising that his
attorney general would be former Sen. Warren B. Rudman of New
Hampshire, one of his top advisers and a popular figure in
Republican politics here.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the 6-year-old boy whom the Clinton administration
has decided to return to his father in Cuba, McCain said, ``I'd
have an attorney general of the United States, Warren Rudman, who
would be doing everything in his power to show we wouldn't send the
kid back.''
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, McCain, who is concentrating virtually his
entire campaign in this state, paid tribute to the University of
New Hampshire Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush stayed above the fray, his aides were quick to
pounce on McCain for focusing Sunday night on foreign policy _ not
his signature issue of campaign finance. His decision to not
discuss the issue comes after McCain has been pounded for days in
the press for sending letters to regulators on behalf of campaign
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that on the issue of tax cuts and campaign
finance, Senator McCain obviously felt his position would not be
popular in front of a Republican crowd,'' said Karen P. Hughes,
Bush's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner, billed as ``A Salute to the Next President of the
United States,'' was designed as one last opportunity for this
state's Republican Party to cash in on New Hampshire's electoral
muscle only three weeks before the primary here. Most participants
paid $200 apiece; for $2,000, they met party luminaries at a
``millennium reception'' before the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   This was a particularly important audience for the candidates
because those who traveled to Durham Sunday night, near the coast
in the eastern part of the state, are the most active and loyal
members of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The folks in attendance tonight are the movers and shakers of
the Republican Party,'' said Mike Hickey, a telecommunications
executive in Manchester. ``So you're not going to see people
changing their minds tonight. But they'll come out with stronger
conventions about the candidate that they favor.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The evening was yet another opportunity for party loyalists in
this state to mingle with the White House hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Porter, a Harvard sophomore who is a Bush volunteer, stood
at the front door of the event, greeting supporters of the Texas
governor. But when he spotted Hatch, he ripped the ``Bush'' sticker
off his lapel, put his arm around the candidate's shoulder and
posed for a photograph.

SPORTS COLUMN: GET ROCKER THERAPY AND MAKE BRAVES GO, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime this week Bud Selig will drop the other shoe on John
Rocker. He'll decide what action baseball will take against the
Atlanta Braves' impetuous relief pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Selig, the baseball commissioner, ordered Rocker to
undergo a psychological evaluation in the wake of disparaging
comments he made about minorities and gays in an article in Sports
Illustrated. He ripped teen-agers with purple hair, called an
African-American teammate a fat monkey and made racial and
homophobic slurs about New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The tests were ordered last Thursday. Rocker visited
psychologists on Friday and then left for a hunting trip in
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   But in ordering psychological tests, Selig may have stumbled
upon the beginning of a path to slay the wrenching beast of
prejudice, intolerance, bigotry. Selig equated racism and bigotry
to a psychological disorder to be confronted and wrestled with _
not to be shunted in a closet and hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Hare has observed the Rocker matter from his office in
San Francisco. Hare has also watched what seems like a series of
blunders in judgment and widely chronicled miscues by college and
professional athletes. Hare, 66, the co-founder of the Black Think
Tank nearly 20 years ago, has been intrigued by the failure of
teams to handle their young employees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Born in Slick, Okla., Hare got his master's degree from the
University of Chicago in 1957 and his Ph.D. from the California
School of Professional Psychology in 1975. His first reaction to
Rocker was amusement. ``I'm more concerned by what people do to me,
not what they call me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This incident was about a baseball player being loud and wrong.
Tuesday there will be something else. Next week another incident,
and then another. Selig should order therapy, not simply for Rocker
but for the entire team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of problems young athletes have, being young,
often fresh out of the slums or off the farm, they could handle
better if they had this intensive group therapy all the time about
all kinds of issues that they confront,'' Hare said Sunday night.
``People tell kids things and they tell young athletes things, but
they don't really tell them in a way that really sinks in or in a
way that is constant. Group-therapy requirement _ or whatever you
want to call it _ would give them a constancy of these reminders
and at the same time a social support for facing the world as a
professional athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell them when they first get the job, but they don't
come back and tell you again and again and again. And they need to
be told again and again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the predictions about how Rocker will get beaten up by
his Atlanta teammates, the opposite may happen. Nearly everyone in
the clubhouse has committed a blunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the blind lead the blind best,'' Hare said,
``because you have the team factor: they can talk and laugh about
things that other people can't even mention. It's better to have
the social group talking about things rather than some grand
therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist who is taking an
authoritarian position.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could take the high road and make something out of this,
of a preventive nature. The biggest gain in terms of heart disease
and cancer has been change of lifestyle. If you change the
lifestyle of people to effect physical health, you can change
mental and social health by working on lifestyle _ educational
programs, preventive programs, self-help peer-group therapy and
whatever you might devise to work on making life better for the
athlete and helping them live up to their potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us could use therapy,'' Hare added. ``Even if you go
and talk to a fence post once a week to clarify things.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People like Rocker see the world as a vise closing in, a world
in which the human component becomes less significant with each
merger, each downsizing, as the wealthy increase. Purple hair, a
land filled with texture. People like Rocker lash out. ``Society is
going through so many changes, so many new twists and turns, nobody
even knows what to do, even couples,'' Hare said. ``Who is going to
do what? What are you going to do when one is offered a job? Who
goes where? Do you commute? All these things are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee D. Kassan, a psychotherapist in New York, agreed with Hare.
``Prejudice is ignorance plus fear,'' said Kassan, the author of
``Second Opinions: Sixty Psychotherapy Patients Evaluate Their
Therapists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are scared by these changes,'' he said. ``They don't
know what the effect is going to be on their own life, and that
frightens people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassan also agrees with Hare that group therapy may be more
effective than therapy for just one player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be useful to have someone come in and do a group
workshop,'' he said. ``Face it: Rocker's going to alienate a lot of
teammates, I'm sure. They're going to have to find a way to make
this team work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hare offered one final shock therapy for Rocker. ``I'd like to
see him get a black therapist,'' he said. ``If he sticks with it
long enough, he might come out of it with some change in his
attitude. He would come to terms better with any guilt he has about
having said what he said.'' &QL;

   (NYT12) ALLEGANY COUNTY, N.Y. -- Jan. 9, 2000 -- NY-OIL-WELLS --
Crude oil, water and rock fragments blow out of a newly-drilled
well bore moments after nitroglycerine was detonated at the bottom
of the well to fracture the oil-bearing strata and induce the flow
of oil in 1897. Well depths in the Allegany field typically ranged
from 1,000 to over 2,000 feet. Derricks standing over other wells
are visible downhill from this one. Some 135 years after New York
state's first marketable oil for sale started flowing from a hole
near here in western New York, the producers are trying to suck the
last drops from wells producing on average a quarter of a barrel a
day. (The New York Times/Courtesy of the Pioneer Oil Museum)

Philippe de Montebello, director of The Metropolitan Museum of Art,
which is planning major renovations. Since the museum cannot expand
into Central Park because of an agreement it made with the city in
the 1970s, it has been scouring its building for air shafts and
stairwells, neglected storage rooms and unused areas surrounding
skylights, any scrap of overlooked space, that could be used to
enlarge a gallery or create a new one. ``This is really a campaign
of ingenuity,'' says de Montebello. (Angel Franco/The New York

an encounter with Salvador Dali in 1946. For a play that plunges
its characters into a vortex of mind-scrambling surrealism,
``Lobster Alice'' has a deeply conventional heart. (Sara

of reports in the German press suggested this weekend that acting
President Vladmir Putin was decorated for his work as a KGB agent
in East Germany during the 1980s, and was even expelled from West
Germany at one point after being identified as a Soviet spy. (The

   (NYT7) LOS ANGELES -- Jan. 9, 2000 -- CALIF-GOV -- For Gov. Gray
Davis of California, much of the last year has been a string of
media superlatives, legislative achievements, fiscal luck,
political popularity and, yes, success. Not bad for a 57-year-old
cautious but ambitious career politician who was long scorned as
the dullest, most unprepossessing player in the California
political pack. ``I've been underestimated my whole life, and I
don't want it to change,'' says Davis. ``It's my greatest strength.
You know, this whole business is exceeding expectations.'' (Monica

Glaser, of RealNetworks and a former Microsoft executive announced
a deal last week under which the Universal Music Group will provide
music for use with his company's media-player software. With some
95 million registered users of its software, RealNetworks is

his columns with bawdy humor, tasteless one-liners and something
that can best be described as a sort of polished vulgarity. If you
think Stein writes for Penthouse, Maxim magazine or the local
campus newspaper, think again: He is a humor columnist for Time
magazine who considers himself a ``celebrity journalist,'' writing
pieces readers seem either to enjoy or despise. (Fred R. Conrad/The

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, 48, a Florida Republican and a fist-shaking
anti-communist, with some of her local constituents in Miami. Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen has been involved in the Elian Gonzalez case from the
start. A former state legislator who was elected to Congress in
1989, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen shrugs off her critics, who say she and
other politicians have turned the case of a little Cuban boy who
lost his mother into a political circus. ``I've visited many
families in my district, sometimes the media comes and sometimes it
doesn't,'' she says. ``I don't pick which one is the celebrated
case.'' (Laura Kleinhenz/The New York Times)

NIGERIAN-AUTHOR -- As Nigeria takes its first steps toward
democracy after a long spell of political repression, writer Chinua
Achebe is not in place to tell the tale. He has been unable to move
back to Nigeria not just because the country was, until recently,
in the grip of a corrupt dictatorship, but also because the civil
order, including a health-care system that can tend to his needs,
have all but collapsed. Now 69, he waits for things to fall into
place in Nigeria. And he waits to go home. ``I have chosen a
particular story, or maybe that story has chosen me.'' ``I just
find it useful, fruitful to be in that community, as a writer, as a
human being. There is so much to do.'' (G. Paul Burnett/The New

 &UR; BIOSCOPE _  &LR;   &LR; The lobby of the Westin St. Francis Hotel should buzz
this week with talk of genes and proteins, worms that could teach
humans a thing or two, and sheep that might be coaxed into
producing drugs in their milk.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz will emanate from the Chase H&AMP;Q Life Sciences
conference, an annual event that gives biotech executives from 250
firms four days to schmooze with Wall Street money managers and
venture capitalists. COLUMN By TOM ABATE

 &UR; FUTURE _  &LR;   &LR; San Francisco will peek into the future of biomedicine
Monday, when 4,000 money managers and venture capitalists flock
here for the opening of the four-day Chase H&AMP;Q Life Sciences
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   This year's conference opens as biotech stocks are hitting new
highs, in anticipation that completion of the human genome project
will usher in a new era in drug discovery. ``The year 2000 will be
viewed as the beginning of the genetic revolution,'' said John
Duane, co-director of McKinsey &AMP; Co.'s health care consulting
practice in Palo Alto. By TOM ABATE

 &UR; GADGETS _  &LR;  Las Vegas _ In one view of the future, a combination
CD/DVD player looks like a high-tech flower pot with a handle on
top. A DVD player resembles a hot plate with the unlikely color
combination of orange and silver, while another resembles a wooden
drum, or maybe a '60s-era end table. And in a throwback to the old
days when television sets always came in wooden cabinets, there is
a combination flat-panel TV-DVD player encased in a sleek wooden
pillar. By BENNY EVANGELISTA
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always great to see fresh designs, especially when
everything now is black or silver or gray,'' said showgoer Andy
Logan as he considered the curiously shaped electronic devices on
display at last week's Consumer Electronics Show here.

loyal following among Hispanic Internet users. With content in both
Spanish and English, the 5-year-old site now draws 400,000 unique
visitors a month.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lavonne Luquis, the San Francisco entrepreneur behind
LatinoLink, has lined up $4 million in private placement funding,
increased her staff to 25 people and has big plans to morph her Web
zine into a portal. By CARRIE KIRBY

 HAPPY BIOTECH EXECS TO HOBNOB WITH MONEY MAVENS AT S.F. MEETINGS  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; The lobby of the Westin St. Francis Hotel should buzz this week
with talk of genes and proteins, worms that could teach humans a
thing or two, and sheep that might be coaxed into producing drugs
in their milk.
<P>
   The buzz will emanate from the Chase H&AMP;Q Life Sciences
conference, an annual event that gives biotech executives from 250
firms four days to schmooze with Wall Street money managers and
venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to last year's conference, when biotech stocks were
in the tank and the gathering was gloomy, today's opening session
comes amid a rebound so sharp that it has cured momentum investors
_ at least for now _ of their Internet addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in a long time, 70 percent of the companies
at the conference saw their stocks increase in market value in
1999,'' said Dennis Purcell, Chase H&AMP;Q's top biotech investment
banker and master of ceremonies at the event.
</P>
<P>
   That's a complete reversal from 1998 and 1997, when 70 percent
of the companies at the conference had suffered market value
declines, Purcell said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the sector began bouncing back in October, spurred by
excitement over looming completion of the Human Genome Project, 100
publicly traded biotech firms have seen their shares double in
value, Purcell said.
</P>
<P>
   This sudden good fortune isn't without its concerns. Purcell
fears the momentum investors who've fueled the run up may not
realize it could be a decade before gene data get turned into
drugs. ``The industry will have to learn to live with volatility in
2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investment banker Steve Burrill, who runs his own biotech
boutique in San Francisco, said volatility has been the industry's
consistent, if unfortunate, curse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public and private markets frequently over- or undervalue
biotech companies,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   But who can argue that it's an up market now, and one that has
rewarded recent biotech IPOs. Bay Area firms like Tularik, Caliper
and Maxygen have all soared since their fourth-quarter debuts. When
biotech has been hot in the past, the IPO window has stayed open
about nine months, Purcell said.
</P>
<P>
   So the private firms at this week's conference are blessed. They
have one shot to wow Wall Street during 30-minute slide shows made
to rooms packed crease to crease with suits. For instance, Exelixis
Inc. of South San Francisco will explain how it plans to make
investors rich by figuring out what fruit flies, worms and zebra
fish can teach us about human disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the presentations won't be that exotic. Blue-chip firms
like Genentech or Chiron will use their time to burnish their image
with the institutional money set. Rising stars like Gilead Sciences
_ which had a setback last year when an AIDS drug was unexpectedly
rejected _ will use their 30 minutes to convince investors another
stumble isn't coming.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing will be very new this year _ the Chase name on all
the conference banners. The New York megabank bought Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist for $1.35 billion in September. Like Montgomery Securities
and Robertson Stephens, which sold out before it, H&AMP;Q had been
homegrown and focused on technology, and on H&AMP;Q's part,
particularly on biotech.
</P>
<P>
   ``H&AMP;Q was the last of the boutiques to get eaten up by a big
concern,'' lamented Cynthia Robbins-Roth, a longtime industry
observer.
</P>
<P>
   Investment banks play a crucial role in taking private companies
public, and Robbins-Roth fears that biotech firms _ and their
venture backers _ will get short shrift as once-local bankers start
taking orders from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a vacuum of financiers who really know and want to
serve early stage biotech,'' says Robbins-Roth, predicting that a
new generation of boutique banks and VC firms will spring up to
finance firms too small for the giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far it's just rumblings,'' she says. ``But the people who
love biotech aren't going to be happy working for the big banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Purcell downplays such concerns, insisting it will be business
as usual at Chase H&AMP;Q _ except of course for the name. ``The Chase
management team has its finger on the pulse of the New Economy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, lucky Chase happened to finger biotech just as the
pulse of the industry started to race. We'll have to check back
when _ and it's more likely when than if _ the momentum players
tire of waiting for biotech to cure the common cold, taking their
money and some of the air out of the market.

BIOTECH 2000: EXPERTS PREDICT THE CONCOCTIONS AND CONTROVERSIES 
 THAT WILL TRANSFORM BIOMEDICINE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. _ San Francisco will peek into the
future of biomedicine Monday, when 4,000 money managers and venture
capitalists flock here for the opening of the four-day Chase H&AMP;Q
Life Sciences Conference.
</P>
<P>
   This year's conference opens as biotech stocks are hitting new
highs, in anticipation that completion of the human genome project
will usher in a new era in drug discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year 2000 will be viewed as the beginning of the genetic
revolution,'' said John Duane, co-director of McKinsey &AMP; Co.'s
health care consulting practice in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Morrison, biotech consultant with Ernst &AMP; Young, said the
tools and techniques of bioscience, notably the ability to
manipulate molecules and create new compounds, are finding
application beyond the realm of medicine, opening markets in
agriculture and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Given this burst of millennial optimism, The Chronicle asked
industry executives, scientists, financiers and observers to
identify trends that will chart the industry's course in 2000 and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Here are their predictions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gold rush: &LR;  The hottest word in biotech is genomics, the study
of genes and their functions. This year, researchers expect to
produce the first maps of the human genome _ rough charts pointing
to most of the genes that regulate life.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, according to San Francisco investment banker
Steve Burrill, will be identifying the subtle differences between
the genes of healthy people and the genes of people susceptible to
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists call these differences SNPs, or single nucleotide
polymorphisms.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take five to 15 years to develop drugs based on
knowledge gleaned from the gene maps and SNP databases. So it will
be a long, slow payoff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fountain of controversy:  &LR; Biotech routinely touches ethical,
moral and political nerves. Whether the issue is human embryos in
research, cloning, or the escalating cost of drugs, biotech is in
the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 2000, the biotech industry will be forced to spend an
unprecedented amount of time and money to demonstrate its own worth
amid a great deal of consumer, media and political confusion,''
said David Flores, publisher of BioCentury Newsletter in San
Carlos.
</P>
<P>
   Flores flagged one issue that hasn't yet hit the public radar:
genetic privacy. What happens if the genome maps and SNPs make it
possible to show who has a propensity for heart disease,
schizophrenia, etc.?
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget, 2000 is a presidential election year. ``Medicare
reform and drug prices are certain to be campaign issues,'' said
Dennis Purcell, managing director of Chase H&AMP;Q's biotech investment
banking division.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell fears that even the threat of price controls on
prescription drugs could slow the flow of capital to support
biotech R&AMP;D. Flores said any such slowdown would affect ``everyone
in the prime of middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any novel medicine that has not reached clinical testing in a
few short years probably won't be available when the Boomers will
need it _ and want it _ as seniors later on,'' Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Brain fix:  &LR; Scientists have long studied the brain, but their
efforts have gathered momentum of late thanks to new imaging
technologies _ similar to MRI scans _ that let scientists ``watch''
the mind at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next frontier will be the biology of the brain,''
predicted Zach Hall, vice chancellor for research at the University
of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The new imaging tools give scientists the equivalent of
oscilloscopes, capable of detecting brain activity. Seeing where
the brain lights up when we speak, for instance, is a first step
toward treating damage caused by strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said some researchers are doing more than simply looking;
they're finding ways to tweak the brain's electric grid for
therapeutic purposes. Emory University researcher Mahlon DeLong,
for instance, has reduced Parkinson's disease tremors by delivering
precise electrical charges deep into the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said other researchers have rigged special electronics that
allow people with spinal cord injuries to grasp a glass of water.
To bypass the severed spinal cord, the movements of their hands are
activated by electrical signals from other parts of the body. A
shrug, for instance, might cause the hand to clasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has almost science fiction-like connotations,'' Hall said,
``but I think there's going to be increasingly sophisticated
electronic interventions we can use to create therapies.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Money in monoclonals: &LR;  Nothing better demonstrates the lag
between hype and payoff in biotech than monoclonal antibodies. For
20 years, biotech firms have promised to produce drugs based on
antibodies _ the proteins our bodies use to fight disease.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, that promise is paying off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, monoclonal antibodies, mabs for short, chalked up $1.3
billion in revenues, led by products like Herceptin, a Genentech
drug to treat metastatic breast cancer. ``Humanized monoclonal
antibodies will play an increasing role in cancer treatment,''
predicted predicts  &LR; Lou Lavigne, chief financial officer at
Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monoclonals have been strong all year, and a next generation
is poised for FDA approval,'' said Richard van den Broek, an
analyst with Chase H&AMP;Q in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A list of mabs in late-stage human testing, compiled by industry
analyst Cynthia Robbins-Roth, supports Lavigne's contention.
Protein Design Labs, Idec Pharmaceuticals, MedImmune and Coulter
Pharmaceuticals all have anti-cancer mabs in Phase II or Phase III
clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Mabs for other conditions are also nearing the finish line.
Genentech is seeking FDA approval for a mab to fight asthma.
Abgenix is in late-stage trials of a mab to fight rejection of
organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
   No one takes FDA approval for granted, so some mabs could miss.
But it's good to know, amid he genomics hype, that biotech
eventually delivers cures.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Spare parts: &LR;  Organ transplants have saved many lives, but they
aren't perfect. Heart, lung and liver donors are always scarce. And
patients lucky enough to find a donor spend their lives taking
drugs to stop their immune systems from rejecting their
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be great to grow new organs?
</P>
<P>
   While we're still years away from growing replacement hearts,
Robert Langer, professor of biomedicine with the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said biotech firms are already growing
simpler organs.
</P>
<P>
   Organogenesis Inc. of Massachusetts and Advanced Tissue Sciences
of La Jolla have FDA approval to sell bioengineered skin, grown
from real human cells.
</P>
<P>
   Reprogenesis Inc., a private firm in Massachusetts, is in
late-stage trials of two techniques to grow cells to fix leaky
bladders.
</P>
<P>
   Other research, still being tested in animals, seeks to grow a
whole new liver from a batch of cells. Langer said the human skin
products and bladder trials show that tissue engineers are on the
right track.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Love it or label it:  &LR; The fight over genetically engineered
foods has moved from Europe to the United States, with the focal
point of debate being the demand that whole or processed foods
containing bioengineered ingredients be specifically labeled.
</P>
<P>
   GE opponents in Europe have already won label laws, hoping
popular opposition will drive such foods off the market. A drive
for labeling in the United States is picking up steam.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Van Dyck, chairman of the nonprofit advocacy group As You
Sow, predicts shareholders will force reluctant U.S. firms to
swallow labels. ``You've already got 9 nine  &LR; shareholder
resolutions to that effect filed with life sciences companies, 16
with foodmakers and 13 with supermarkets,'' said Van Dyck, who
manages a socially responsible investment fund for U.S. Banc Piper
Jaffray.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco investment banker Burrill, a supporter of GE
foods, also believes that the industry will lose on labels.
``Expect to see government regulations regarding GE labeling on
foods,'' he said. ``It still remains to be seen if a majority of
American consumers really care.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pet pharmacies:  &LR; The 175 million cats, dogs, birds and other
pets who live in America don't know how lucky they are. To an
increasing degree, their owners are providing them the best
medicine money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending on animal drugs more than doubled from an
estimated $592 million in 1994 to $1.3 billion in 1998, according
to the American Health Institute. ``This is encouraging large
animal-health companies to spend more on R&AMP;D,'' said John Buchanan,
an analyst with the Burrill &AMP; Co. investment bank in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Today's pet potions go far beyond flea, tick and worm medicines.
Novartis, for instance, sells Clomicalm, a drug for separation
anxiety, i.e., to stop dogs from tearing up the house while master
is gone. Pfizer Inc., of Viagra fame, spends $200 million a year
searching for new remedies like Rimadyl, its $35-a-month arthritis
medication for dogs.
</P>
<P>
   With Pfizer betting that pet drug sales will grow 15 percent a
year, we can expect the industry to concoct more Fido and Kitty
pills _ in paw-proof containers, of course.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rodney Dangerfield cured?  &LR; Call it wishful thinking, but Carl
Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry Association,
predicted 2000 is the year elected officials will recognize the
economic potential of biomedicine.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from the high-tech industry, Feldbaum is compiling
data to show biotech's clout. In 1997, for instance, California had
six regional biotech clusters, made up of 2,500 companies, which
directly employed 210,000 people, paid $8 billion in wages and
registered $4 billion in exports.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area boasted 670 biomedical companies and 78,000
employees, double the second-largest cluster in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Official recognition of the industry's importance made a modest
start when the U.S. Senate designated January as ``National
Biotechnology Month.'' Feldbaum thinks the industry can only get
more respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the demographics of the aging Baby Boomers,'' he said.
``The sheer number of people and the depth of their desire for new
medicines will create markets like no one has ever seen before.''

 PEERING INTO THE FUTURE: ENGINEERS DISPLAY WARES IN VEGAS  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ In one view of the future, a combination CD/DVD
player looks like a high-tech flower pot with a handle on top.
</P>
<P>
   A DVD player resembles a hot plate with the unlikely color
combination of orange and silver, while another resembles a wooden
drum, or maybe a '60s-era end table. And in a throwback to the old
days when television sets always came in wooden cabinets, there is
a combination flat-panel TV-DVD player encased in a sleek wooden
pillar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always great to see fresh designs, especially when
everything now is black or silver or gray,'' said showgoer Andy
Logan as he considered the curiously shaped electronic devices on
display at last week's Consumer Electronics Show here.
</P>
<P>
   The futuristic view was provided by engineers at Thomson
Consumer Electronics, which makes products for RCA.
</P>
<P>
   They displayed a series of concept home DVDs, television sets
and VCRs that may, or may not, someday be introduced into the
market. Similarly, car shows always have futuristically designed
cars that turn out markedly different when they finally hit the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson's idea was to get away from the boring standard metal
and plastic boxes that house today's consumer electronics. Instead,
the team of creative designers pushed way past the boundaries and
designed devices that fit better with other home furniture, or that
might be considered outlandish now but stylish in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, ``we didn't want this technology to stand out,
but more to blend in with the overall environment we live in
today,'' said Bryan Watson, manager of retail support for Thomson,
which is based in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   One example was the high-definition TV and DVD player designed
for the bedroom. The 15-inch screen is set into a 2-foot-wide
wooden stand, but is at eye level for someone lying in bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most successful designs are ones that look timeless,''
said Logan, who is himself a product designer for BMW subsidiary
Designworks/USA of Newbury Park in Southern California. ``They
would look good in 2020, or in 1920 or in 1420. They have a pure,
classic form to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Take the ``DVDble,'' the flower pot with a handle. When placed
upright on its base, it is a CD audio player, but when turned on
its side to reveal a TV screen, it becomes a DVD player.
</P>
<P>
   The hot plate, dubbed the ``Mambo,'' looked roughly like a
laptop computer, except instead of a keyboard, there was a large
orange glass plate covering the DVD disc. According to Thomson's
description, ``the aesthetics of the Mambo come directly from the
1950s bowling bag and suitcase forms.''
</P>
<P>
   The designers also dreamed up a pastel blue VCR with an
old-style clock, with hands, for those storied people whose digital
VCR clocks are perpetually flashing.
</P>
<P>
   The Music Alchemy is a series of toy musical instruments that
use DVDs to create the sounds of the basic instrument families:
strings, keyboard and horn. And a backpack, which one woman thought
looked like a vacuum cleaner, combined an MP3 player, speakers and
an insulated food storage compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Other new gadgets throughout the show still had the standard
look and feel of plastic and metal, but Casio offered Dick
Tracy-like gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   The Casio Databank Camera Watch, due out in the spring, can
store addresses and take digital pictures, while the Wrist Audio
Player can play back MP3 music files. The Wrist Audio Player, due
to retail at $250, will be on the market in about two months. The
camera watch should be out this spring for $200.

 TOP COPS TO TACKLE WEB CRIME  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. _ Top law enforcement officials from around
the country plan to converge in Palo Alto Monday to tackle ways of
fighting a troubling new wave of crimes _ those involving the
Internet.
<P>
   To be sure, a handful of sleuths have been tracking down hackers
for years. But with the explosion of access to the Internet,
legions of pettier crimes are taking on a cybertwist.
</P>
<P>
   A Santa Clara high-tech task force, for instance, recently found
someone hawking rare stolen baseball cards on eBay. Federal
prosecutors in Southern California have accused an Infoseek
executive of trying to have sex with a teenage girl he met in a Web
chat room. (The Lolita turned out to be an undercover FBI agent.)
And a growing number of Californians are complaining about
cyberstalking and online fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the crimes are similar to those in the physical
world, experts say the Internet link raises a host of thorny
issues: Many cops aren't trained to track down criminals over the
Net. The Internet potentially makes it easier to commit a crime
from thousands of miles away, crossing multiple state and national
boundaries, and raising jurisdictional questions. And some experts
aren't sure whether juries will be as willing to convict defendants
of committing a crime with a mouse instead of a gun.
</P>
<P>
   To help settle the issue, at least 20 state attorneys general
(and 200 staffers and other law enforcement agents) are expected to
meet today and tomorrow for a cybercrime conference hosted by the
National Association of Attorneys General. Organizers said U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno likely will give the keynote speech.
</P>
<P>
   Several law enforcement agencies around California have already
set up high-tech task forces to tackle the issue of cybercrimes,
and Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he's been meeting with other
officials around the state to come up with ideas for how to fight
high-tech crime. In addition, Gov. Gray Davis told Lockyer he will
set aside some seed money in this year's budget, to be unveiled
Monday, for high-tech task forces and efforts to fight cybercrime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to develop a good game plan'' said Lockyer, a
self-described computer aficionado who helped organize the
cyberconference. Lockyer said sex crimes have gained plenty of
publicity, but he thinks intellectual piracy and other economic
crimes will be a bigger target for prosecutors in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said he's especially interested in the issue because
he's a longtime computer user _ he used punch-card computers in
college in the '60s; has had a computer in his home for nearly a
decade; and even plays games like Myst, Riven and Halflife after
work, in addition to using more standard office programs.
</P>
<P>
   But George Vinson, who started the FBI's West Coast high-tech
task force before becoming director of corporate security for
Barkley's Global Investors in San Francisco, said most law
enforcement officials aren't computer wonks and need more training
to learn how to deal with cybercrimes. ``It's a big challenge,''
Vinson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Vinson added, local law enforcement agents could
rely on the FBI to handle the trickle of hacking and other
cybercrime cases. But the Internet is becoming so pervasive that
they need to take up some of the load. Plus, many of the crimes are
too small for the feds to become involved. ``The states (and towns)
have to do it on their own,'' he said. Santa Clara County, for
instance, has set up a high-tech task force called REACT (Rapid
Enforcement Allied Computer Team) with 11 agents, up from three
when it became a formal group two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a growth industry,'' said task force agent Tom Quilty,
who is also a Santa Clara deputy sheriff. ``We could easily double
our size and be busy. We've just scratched the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Quilty said law enforcement agencies face a particular problem
because cops usually rotate into different departments frequently,
though it often takes a few years to learn the skills to handle
cybercrimes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone thinks the Internet will make cops' jobs
harder.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathon Zittrain, executive director of Harvard University's
Berkman Center for Internet Society, points out that computers can
easily be programmed to keep detailed records that law enforcement
could potentially check to track down criminals. And many Web sites
meticulously monitor everything about users _ from what Web sites
they visit to what they buy online _ so they can target their sales
pitches in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the developments, Zittrain says, are troubling from a
privacy standpoint but offer a mother lode of information for
police trying to track down a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Zittrain points to the recent case of the Melissa virus, which
flooded e-mail systems around the country, forcing many companies
to shut them down. Within days of the attack, federal agents had
arrested a suspect in New Jersey named David Smith, apparently
because the Internet service provider he allegedly used had caller
ID. Plus, an independent computer guru in Massachusetts was able to
find David Smith's name hidden in original copies of the virus,
recorded automatically with a little-known feature of Microsoft
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to be a pretty skilled and tenacious lawbreaker''
to avoid detection in the future, Zittrain says.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Internet also makes it possible to harass Net
users or commit other crimes from tiny countries in remote parts of
the world, where criminals feel safe from prosecution. But Zittrain
points out that it is also just as easy to automatically warn
Internet users about fraud, for instance, when they are dealing
with people in remote locales. And stalking victims might feel
better if they know their attacker is thousands of miles away, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Zittrain and Lockyer are scheduled to speak at this week's
conference. In addition, the conference will feature a number of
panels, including ones on what attorneys general are doing to
tackle cybercrimes around the country, how current laws relate to
the Internet and how to ``create a family friendly Internet.''

LATINO.COM HAS BIG PLANS TO BECOME HISPANIC PORTAL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. _ Run by a staff of two and backed by a
few maxed-out credit cards, Web site LatinoLink.com still managed
to attract a loyal following among Hispanic Internet users. With
content in both Spanish and English, the 5-year-old site now draws
400,000 unique visitors a month.
<P>
   Now Lavonne Luquis, the San Francisco entrepreneur behind
LatinoLink, has lined up $4 million in private placement funding,
increased her staff to 25 people and has big plans to morph her Web
zine into a portal.
</P>
<P>
   Set to debut on Valentine's Day, Latino.com will offer expanded
coverage of Hispanic-related news, sports and entertainment, plus
new features like Web search and e-commerce. LatinoLink.com will
stay on as one section of the new page. An initial public offering
is planned for later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Internet is relevant to people, they'll find a way to
go online,'' said Luquis, 40. That's why the former journalist
makes sure her site has plenty of articles, some written by her
10-person editorial staff, some from wire services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these are stories they would find in their daily
newspaper, but instead of on Page 15, we put it right in front,''
Luquis said. She plans to open news bureaus in Los Angeles,
Chicago, Miami and Texas as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be e-commerce, but it has to be in context. If
you're online planning a quincea &LR; n &LR; ara'' _ a coming-of age party
for 15-year-old girls _ ``you may decide to order certain items for
that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most e-commerce sites try to make shopping more convenient, but
Latino.com will sell things that some users couldn't buy at all
off-line _ where does someone living in a small Minnesota town pick
up tamale flour? EthnicGrocer.com already sells that and other
specialty foods through LatinoLink.com. Luquis says that users
constantly e-mail her asking where to buy hard-to-find food items
and Spanish-language music videos in cities across the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Latino) people are spreading out across the country,'' Luquis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Luquis herself was inspired to start the Web site when she moved
from Puerto Rico to Olympia, Wash., where she served as city editor
at the Olympian newspaper. She found almost no expression of Latino
culture in her new home, and when she went online for help, she
found nearly nothing there too. This was 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Latino.com will be one of many portals wooing the United States'
32 million Latinos. The biggest player is StarMedia Network, the
premier Internet company in Latin America, which set its sights on
the U.S. Latino market in 1998. Other Web sites vying for Latino
eyeballs include QuePasa.com, Yupi.com and El Sitio, which went
public December 15. Mainstream Web properties including Yahoo,
America Online and Prodigy have jumped into the fray with
Spanish-language offerings as well.
</P>
<P>
   All these competitors are fighting for an audience that the
Department of Commerce estimates to be only 12.9 percent of the
nation's 8 million Latino households _ that's how many were using
the Internet in 1998, according to the Department of Commerce's
report, ``Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forrester Research, a technology analysis firm, believes the
Latino online audience is much bigger. Forrester says 36 percent of
Latino families had at least one member using the Internet in
mid-1999, and projects that 43 percent will be connected this year.
Unlike the figure from the Digital Divide report, Forrester's
figures include households whose members access the Internet at
work, at school or at the library.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester analyst Ekaterina Walsh said it's a myth that
minorities are less likely to get on the Internet. ``It's a
complete bogus idea. Race has nothing to do with online adoption or
buying a computer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Luquis believes that Latinos will embrace the Internet just as
they have picked up cellular phones, CD players and other
technological innovations in the past. To help make that goal a
reality, Latino.com will probably be involved in off-line campaigns
to encourage Latinos to get wired, Luquis said. But she believes
that the real key to getting more Latinos online is simply
providing something for them to do on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In her newspaper career, Luquis got to like the idea of service
journalism, or providing people with information that's useful to
their daily lives. She finds that easier to do on the Internet than
it was in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online, people immediately connect to you'' and send feedback,
Luquis said. ``It's easier to connect with readers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of ways the Latino community can benefit from
using the Internet, Luquis said. One area LatinoLink.com is already
working on is helping Latino youth access scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Latino students are in urban schools, where they may not
have access to the best guidance counseling,'' Luquis said. So
LatinoLink.com lists scholarships and internships, some available
to all students and some just for Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   When Internet telephony develops to the extent that users in
Latin America can receive Internet calls, Luquis predicts that
Latinos will benefit greatly from low-priced Internet long-distance
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos are one of the groups that spend the most on
long-distance phone calls,'' Luquis said.
</P>
<P>
   Another area where Luquis predicts Latinos will find value in
the Internet is online language study, both for immigrants who want
to learn English and for American-born Latinos who want to discover
their roots by studying Spanish or Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   Luquis' goals sound altruistic, but she is confident that her
strategy will be profitable someday _ or at least allow her to
break even by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester's Walsh says she likes Latino.com's chances of
financial success but warns that the site has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to find a very strong peg that goes much farther
than just being a Latino site,'' Walsh said. To differentiate
itself from its competitors, Latino.com must find a niche within
the ethnic niche. That could mean picking an age group to cater to,
or focusing just on Latino sports or having the most up-to-date
news _ and this is something that she has not yet seen any of the
Latino portals doing, Walsh said.

OPPORTUNITY FOR LATINO WEB SITES IS MUY GRANDE  &HT;     BY CARRIE KIRBY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. _ Blame it on Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez or
just the mushrooming Latino population in the United States, but
one thing is clear: Web sites catering to Latinos _ once rare _ are
now all over the place.
<P>
   At QuePasa.com, you can buy a copy of ``The Matrix'' with
Spanish subtitles or pick up a recipe for Guatemalan cucumber soup.
At Yupi.com, browse 150 million links to Spanish-language Web sites
or make your own home page in the Ciudad Futura, or Future City.
Yahoo launched a site for Spanish speakers worldwide in 1998, then
added individual sites for Mexico, Spain and several South American
countries. Hit a tab on Prodigy's Web page to visit the
Spanish-language version.
</P>
<P>
   The 32 million Latinos in this country represent the
fastest-growing ethnic group. ``This is by far the largest
opportunity in the United States, and one that is underserved,''
said Roberto Ruiz, director of multicultural marketing for Internet
service provider Prodigy. Prodigy provides versions of its software
in both Spanish and English, and has bilingual customer support
available through a toll-free number.
</P>
<P>
   Online companies are beginning to wake up to the potential of
the Latino market, said Ekaterina Walsh, an analyst at Forrester
Research. One reason that Latinos are a valuable demographic is
their tendency to keep close ties with friends and family living
far away _ the reason the telecom industry has long targeted
advertising at Latino communities, she said. ``The No.1 reason for
using the Internet is keeping in touch,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   StarMedia Network and El Sitio are two companies with several
years of experience in Latin America that are now establishing a
presence in the United States. El Sitio Chief Executive Officer
Roberto Cibrian-Campoy, who works in the Buenos Aires headquarters,
said the move was natural once he noticed that 30 percent of the
traffic to his company's Latin American properties was coming from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cibrian-Campoy said the key to succeeding in the U.S. market
will be El Sitio's 38-member Miami team, which writes local news
for Miami, the Bay Area, Chicago and several other U.S. cities.
News in the Bay Area section includes a story on San Francisco's
First Festival of Rock in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Sitio is an alternative to the one-size-fits-all site,''
Cibrian-Campoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a different approach, QuePasa.com places an article about
an Argentine soccer star and a feature about the Latino CEO of a
U.S. company on a single page. That's not necessarily a bad idea,
said Eva May, a partner at Espa &LR; n &LR; ol Marketing and Communications,
a Cary, N.C., advertising agency that targets Latinos. May said
plenty of features, from free e-mail to coverage of sports,
entertainment and world issues, would appeal to Latinos worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it's relevant, people don't care if a site is made
for the general market, or just for Argentines, or what,'' May
said. She predicted that the sites that will come out on top will
depend more on ``who can talk the loudest'' than anything else.

RICHTER'S EFFORTS GO FOR NAUGHT AGAINST THE HURRICANES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ Mike Richter deserved something better than a
1-0 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Ranger goaltender stopped pucks with his pads,
skates, stick and gloves. Richter stopped shots from all angles, on
power plays, odd-man rushes, at even strength. He stopped a shot
that had somehow climbed over his body and rolled down his back.
</P>
<P>
   He even stopped Jeff O'Neill on a breakaway with less than three
minutes remaining to give the Rangers a chance to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one shot that Richter could not stop out of the 28
he faced: an Andrei Kovalenko backhander in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Rangers, who were playing their second game in less
than 24 hours, could not find a way to beat Arturs Irbe, that was
one shot too many, as the Hurricanes (42 points) were able to pull
4 points ahead of the Rangers in the Eastern Conference standing.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rangers' 5-3 victory in Toronto on Saturday, Coach
John Muckler was asked if he felt his team could continue to play
the wide-open hockey, which it displayed in back-to-back victories
over the Maple Leafs, against defense-oriented teams like the
Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to,'' Muckler said, before catching himself.
``We're going to try to.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Rangers did Sunday night. They created numerous chances
for themselves. But the Rangers nevertheless trailed by a goal
after two periods.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly the fault of Richter, who was brilliant again. He
was acrobatic while stopping 20 of the 21 shots he faced through
the first 40 minutes. A post stopped another shot by Sami Kapanen.
A power-play blast from the Rangers' Mathieu Schneider, too, found
the post.
</P>
<P>
   The only shot that eluded Richter through two periods was
Kovalenko's. He sent a backhander into the top right corner of the
net 6 minutes 38 seconds into the second period. Kovalenko, who had
Eric Lacroix trying to shadow him, curled counterclockwise from
behind the net and through the slot before shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandre Daigle was also on the ice for the goal. Daigle came
to the Rangers with an astonishing plus-minus rating of minus-151
over the first six seasons of his National Hockey League career.
</P>
<P>
   In his first nine games with the Rangers, Daigle was a plus-8.
Since then, his rating has plummeted. Sunday night's game was
Daigle's 21st with the Rangers. With Kovalenko's goal, Daigle's
rating dropped to minus-9 over his last 12 games and minus-1 this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, things could have been much worse for the Rangers. Irbe
was just a little bit better at the other end for Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Petr Nedved's line did not create chance after chance.
The line of Nedved at center with his Czech countrymen Jan Hlavac
and Radek Dvorak on the wings had six shots on goal through two
periods, with five of them coming in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Irbe made the save of the game on Nedved with five minutes
remaining in the second period when Nedved skated in alone from the
right point.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved, who had scored four goals in two games against Toronto
after going 12 games without a goal, went backhand to forehand with
the puck. But Irbe made a pad save to keep Carolina's one-goal lead
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the period, the Czech line turned up the heat on Irbe
again. But he turned aside good chances by Hlavac and Dvorak, who
is still looking for his first goal as a Ranger.

A PLAYOFF GROUNDSWELL OF THE VINTAGE KIND
</HEADLINE>
   (With FBN-COWBOYS-VIKINGS) 
(nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington quarterback Brad Johnson watched his teammate,
running back Stephen Davis, closely in practice before the Redskins
played Detroit in their wild-card playoff game on Saturday. Johnson
saw how Davis was limping, as if stepping on hot coals, all because
of a still-healing ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson suddenly felt sick to his stomach. There was no way
Davis was going to be ready for the game, he thought. Without their
star runner, Johnson had to know that the Redskins could still beat
the sorry Lions. But any chance of a Super Bowl victory rested on
the tender ankles of Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him at practice on Wednesday, I really didn't think
he would play,'' Johnson said. ``Then Thursday he got better and
Friday he got better. Then he was full speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said later, ``And when he is full speed, there aren't
many who are better.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was any one theme from the opening playoff weekend, it
was the dominance of the running backs. Maybe it was
playoff-opening jitters, with coaches generally not wanting to take
inordinate risks by passing, but backs found their numbers being
called often.
</P>
<P>
   In Nashville, the Titans-Bills game was decided by what may have
been the trick play of all time _ a kickoff return for a touchdown
off a cross-field lateral. But Tennessee's Eddie George had 29
carries for 106 yards, with Buffalo players admitting that the
muscular George began wearing the Bills down late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington, Davis played about one and a half quarters before
leaving with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right
knee. His early trip to the trainer's room did not stop him from
crushing Detroit with 119 yards and 2 touchdowns on 15 carries. His
58-yard run, in which he outran three defensive backs who had
surrounded him, was one of the more exciting plays of the first
round. The Redskins finished with 233 yards rushing, third best in
the team's playoff history.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the long run that he made, the play was really designed to
go inside, and Stephen started to take it inside, then at the last
second bounced it outside,'' Washington Coach Norv Turner said. ``I
don't know how to describe what allows the guy to do it, other than
the great vision he has.''
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, there are Randy Moss and Cris Carter and Jeff
George in an offense full of passing and receiving stars, but it
was the ground game that truly pushed Minnesota past Dallas, 27-10,
on Sunday. The Cowboys, with their smallish linemen and
linebackers, were sometimes nailed into the ground like fence posts
by the Vikings' massive front. Holes opened the size of parking
lots, and Robert Smith trotted through them 28 times for 140 yards,
breaking his team's playoff rushing record.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Seattle, where no back on either the Seahawks or the
Miami Dolphins had the big day that Eddie George, Davis or Smith
enjoyed, Ricky Watters did have several key runs to keep Seattle
drives alive.
</P>
<P>
   And while quarterback Dan Marino played one of his best games
this year, J.J. Johnson gave the Dolphins the go-ahead touchdown
with his 2-yard run in Miami's 20-17 upset victory. The Seahawks
began blitzing Marino constantly, but had to slow their advances,
mainly because Johnson busted several key runs up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for coaches to be conservative when it comes
to the wild-card games. Coaches playing on the road take few risks
in hostile territory and those playing at home don't want to do
anything to blow the game or turn the crowd. There is also the fact
that offensive linemen love to run block more than pass protect.
</P>
<P>
   The running game really helped the Vikings by insuring that Jeff
George, their quarterback, did not have to win the game by himself.
The Vikings' staff wanted to give Smith plenty of carries as a
means of insulating George. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   The running will definitely continue in the second round of the
playoffs next weekend. Running back Edgerrin James and
Indianapolis, which had a bye in the first round, play at home
against Eddie George and the Titans. Smith and the Vikings travel
to St. Louis to play Marshall Faulk and the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Those two games alone probably mean lots of fireworks on the
ground.

 &HT;    Marino performs old magic
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dan Marino's not done yet. A 38-year-old quarterback
who holds every major NFL passing record, he led Miami to a 20-17
victory Sunday and the Dolphins shut down Seattle as well as the
Kingdome, before a hostile crowd of 66,170.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins will play at Jacksonville on Saturday, their Super
Bowl hopes alive. But the AFC West champion Seahawks, who made the
playoffs for the first time in 12 years, have only a new stadium to
look forward to in the future.
</P>
<P>
   With a pared-down offense, Miami focused on establishing its
running game early. However, for the team to win its first road
playoff game in 27 years, Marino had to direct the kind of 85-yard
fourth-quarter drive that was his specialty before critics began
caling for his retirement. The key play was a 23-yard pass to Tony
Martin on third-and-17 from the Dolphins' 8-yard line, with the
Seahawks in a zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worth a shot and he made a great catch,'' said Marino,
who threw no interceptions Sunday while completing 17 of 30 passes
for 196 yards and one touchdown. ``The important thing was him
making the catch because the throw was a little high.''
</P>
<P>
   Six plays later, again on third down but this time from the
shotgun formation, Marino found Oronde Gadsden for 24 yards to the
Seattle 5. J.J. Johnson rushed twice, scoring from the 2 to give
Miami its first lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami defense then held firm, sacking quarterback Jon Kitna
twice before allowing him a single yard. The Seahawks got one more
chance with 1:05 remaining, but Kitna threw three incomplete passes
before a 17-yard pass. On 3rd-and-10, Terrell Buckley's intercepted
a pass with 23 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was such a great team win for us,'' said defensive end
Trace Armstrong. ``To play soundly in all three phases, it's just
good to get back on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jimmy Johnson, whose team lost five of their last six
regular-season games to back into the playoffs with a 9-7 record,
told his team all week that they would win -- and in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy was very upbeat this week,'' Martin said of the
embattled coach. ``He said, 'Just hang in there and be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   They had to be, since Seattle jumped out to a 7-0 lead on its
second possession with Kitna throwing a 9-yard pass to Sean
Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
   After Olindo Mare kicked a 32-yard field goal for the Dolphins,
Todd Peterson kicked a 50-yarder to give the Seahawks a 10-3
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, which had managed only 69 yards total offense, roared out
in the third quarter. The Dolphins tied the game after a 60-yard
drive, with Marino throwing a 1-yard TD pass to Oronde Gadsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving the length of the field to tie it up showed we can
move the ball and we can score points,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Charlie Rogers ran the ensuing kickoff back 85 yards
to put Seattle back in front 17-10. But Miami cut into the lead
with a 51-yard Mare field goal and recovered an onsides kick to
hold the ball at 13:05 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle gained just 32 yards in the second half, and had just
three snaps in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no clue as to how they were able to push us around like
they did,'' said Ricky Watters, who had 40 yards on 19 carries.
``They made us look pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   First-year Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren said his team was ``in a
bind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had difficulty running the football against this team,'' he
said. ``I had hoped for better there. When we couldn't do that, the
pass protection, we struggled there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his team's lack of playoff experience was a factor, as
the Seahawks were not accustomed to the intensity level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you experience something like that,'' said the former
Green Bay coach, ``you don't believe it or know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna had 114 yards passing in the first half, but just 48 in
the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played OK,'' said Holmgren. ``It was his first of many big
games.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Marino, it wasn't his last.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: THEY DIDN'T TAKE AWAY THE HALL'S LOVELY SOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The sigh of relief at Severance Hall on Saturday
night was palpable, if not necessarily audible.
</P>
<P>
   Built for the Cleveland Orchestra and completed in 1931,
Severance has long been considered one of the best-sounding concert
halls in the United States. But it has just undergone an ambitious
22-month, $36.7 million restoration and expansion that included a
complete reconfiguring of the stage. It was the kind of exercise
guaranteed to have an orchestra's musicians, administrators and
listeners praying that the acoustics would come through intact.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 20 minutes into the program it was evident that there
was no cause for worry. By then, Christoph von Dohnanyi, the
orchestra's music director, had led his musicians in the world
premiere of Sir Harrison Birtwistle's ``Sonance Severance 2000'' _
a three-minute showpiece that offered rumbling basses, bright
brass, high-pitched string writing and varied percussion _ as well
as Wagner's ``Meistersinger'' Prelude, with its rich brass choirs
and lush, high-energy string writing.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, one wanted more power in the bass, a quality that
had been present earlier in the day, during a rehearsal of
Berlioz's ``Damnation of Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   Dohnanyi's reopening program went on to offer more detailed
tests. In Vaughan Williams' ``Lark Ascending,'' William Preucil,
the concertmaster, demonstrated the ease with which a melting
pianissimo floats through the hall. Prokofiev's ``Classical''
Symphony was one of several works in which Dohnanyi demonstrated
the crispness and transparency of the orchestra's sound.
</P>
<P>
   The eerie string clusters and strange percussion textures of
Gyorgy Ligeti's 1961 ``Atmospheres'' let Dohnanyi demonstrate the
hall's comfort with both delicacy and heft. And in Ravel's
``Daphnis and Chloe,'' the fast oboe and flute figuration, usually
heard as an impressionistic blur, was entirely distinct, and one
could hear the percussive edge of the harp strings being plucked.
</P>
<P>
   As an encore Dohnanyi led a trim, vigorous account of Mozart's
``Nozze di Figaro'' Overture.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who listens closely to the way orchestras sound in
their halls, the refurbishing of Severance Hall was cause for
anxiety, since changes can easily be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   A cautionary tale, though one with a good outcome, was provided
by the renovation of Carnegie Hall. When Carnegie reopened in 1986,
it looked fabulous, but a layer of concrete placed under the stage
floor had robbed the sound of its visceral punch. When the concrete
was removed, the Carnegie sound returned.
</P>
<P>
   That was clearly on the mind of Christopher Jaffe, whose firm,
Jaffe Holden Scarbrough, oversaw the acoustics of the Severance
Hall renovation. At a panel discussion at the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame and Museum on Friday, he joked that he didn't have to warn
David Schwarz, the project architect, not to put concrete under the
stage. As it turned out, concrete that been there since 1931, as a
support for a stage element that is no longer used, was removed.
</P>
<P>
   Severance has had a more checkered acoustical history than its
reputation suggests. When the 2,000-seat hall opened in 1931, the
lack of a stage ceiling (there was a fly space instead) kept the
sound from projecting, and heavy curtains and carpeting absorbed
the sound that made it into the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Minor modifications were made during the hall's first 25 years,
but it took the forceful personality of George Szell to persuade
the board to undertake radical surgery in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   At Szell's suggestion, a wooden stage shell was built. It solved
the hall's acoustical problems, and since then the sound has
figured prominently in explanations of why the Cleveland Orchestra
is considered one of the world's best ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   But it also created problems that lay unexplored until 1993,
when the orchestra celebrated its 75th anniversary and appointed a
committee to study the state of the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the committee's proposals were entirely practical:
insufficient office space, inadequate locker rooms for musicians,
problems in the flow of audience traffic, and deficiencies in the
restaurant, parking and restrooms were all noted in the report and
were addressed in the renovation, which included an addition to the
rear of the building.
</P>
<P>
   The aesthetic concerns raised in the report were trickier.
Although it was apparently of little concern in 1958 that Szell's
modern, angular shell did not match the ornamental art-deco and
classical design of the 1931 hall, the mismatch seemed jarring in
the preservation-conscious 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It was also decided, at Dohnanyi's insistence, that the
6,025-pipe E.M. Skinner organ _ part of the original hall, but
buried behind the Sell shell _ should be refurbished and made an
element of the stage.
</P>
<P>
   What was required was less a restoration than an idealized
completion of the hall: The stage had to look like an extension of
the ornate audience chamber, as Schwarz and Jaffe call it, but the
acoustical properties of the 1958 shell had to be retained.
</P>
<P>
   The original intention was to preserve rather than improve the
acoustics, but Jaffe persuaded Dohnanyi and the orchestra's board
that a slight increase in reverberation was desirable. The new
reverberation time, 1.8 seconds (up from 1.6) matches that of
Carnegie Hall and of Symphony Hall in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A series of room-size resonance chambers at the sides of the
stage can be either closed or left open; Dohnanyi will experiment
with them in the coming weeks. His designated successor, Franz
Welser-Moest, may have his own ideas when he takes over the podium
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Visually the new stage is stunning. The musicians are seated on
risers, with convex maple and aluminum leaf panels (matching those
in the house) at the sides and back. Above the panels is grillwork
through which the sound enters and leaves the resonating chambers.
The organ pipes at the back of the stage provide both a gleaming
visual focus and another sound-reflecting surface. The organ itself
will be reinstalled in the summer and rededicated next January.
</P>
<P>
   The stage is brightly lighted; lighting within the translucent
proscenium gives the arch an unusual glow. The hall sounds as
seductive as it looks.

MCCAIN TAX PLAN STRESSES THOSE IN LOWEST BRACKET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fighting to build on his popularity among New
Hampshire's Republican voters, Senator John McCain will unveil an
expanded tax plan Tuesday that would increase the number of
taxpayers in the lowest, or 15 percent, tax bracket if there is
additional economic growth and a larger-than-projected budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tax policy address at the Concord Chamber of Commerce
comes as he and Texas Governor George W. Bush have clashed
repeatedly in recent days over who has the better economic
prescription for the nation. While Bush has proposed the larger tax
cut _ $473 billion compared to McCain's $250 billion over five
years _ McCain would put more of the nation's budget surplus toward
shoring up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, the subject of taxes has long been a
touchstone for many voters. The state has no income tax, and even
the governor, a Democrat, has spent the last few years staving off
some members of her own party who would like to institute one.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the New Hampshire Republican Party, I think there's a
pretty strong sentiment that the government that governs least,
governs best,'' said Will Abbott of Holderness, N.H., who served as
political director to Bush's father in 1988. ``And that means that
the lower the taxes, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides arguing over the amount of money that should be set
aside for Social Security, McCain and Bush have also taken opposite
approaches toward flattening the current tax structure. McCain
focuses on vastly increasing the number of people paying the lowest
tax rate by reducing the numbers now in the 28 percent bracket;
Bush, on the other hand, would eliminate the top tax bracket of
39.6 percent for the wealthiest earners, and he would cut the 15
percent bracket to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters like tax cuts and they always will and they always
should,'' said Dan Schnur, a spokesman for McCain. ``But long-term
economic security is just as important. We're providing both.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, however, views the Arizona senator's tax
proposal as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how you cut it, people will pay more in taxes under
Senator McCain's plan than they will under Governor Bush's plan,''
said Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman. ``Like Al Gore, Senator
McCain has said Governor Bush's tax plan is too big, which means
people will pay more in taxes under Senator McCain than Governor
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's latest tax proposal would increase the tax deduction
for children from $500 to $1,000, the same as Bush's plan; create a
new tax deduction for the cost of long-term health care insurance;
and provide a package of new savings incentives and plans similar
to the existing 401k plan.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, McCain would expand his tax cut beyond $250
billion, assuming the Congressional Budget Office produces a more
favorable economic forecast. Bush has already used rosier economic
assumptions in his plan.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, McCain first proposed allowing 25 million more people
to qualify for the lowest tax bracket. Couples earning $70,000 a
year would qualify, compared to the current $43,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said he would eliminate the tax penalty for married
couples; eliminate the inheritance tax on estates valued under $5
million; and eliminate the earnings test for senior citizens who
lose some Social Security payments when they begin to earn more
than $20,000 annually. All of these positions are similar to
Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of taxes will probably define the continued debate
between Bush and McCain during the last three weeks before the
primary. Bush is already broadcasting television commercials about
his plan, and McCain is set to begin doing so shortly. He is
running ads about protecting Social Security for seniors in the
coming years as the number of people drawing on the trust fund
exceeds the number paying into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxes are the eternal issue in Republican primaries,'' said
Darryl West, a political science professor at Brown University.
``There's hardly been an election over the last 20 years where
taxes have not figured prominently.''
</P>
<P>
   But West said there is no survey evidence from the last year to
show that voters care about the size of a tax cut. Instead, he
said, national polling data show voters care more about Social
Security, health care and education than a massive tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of Social Security, it is McCain who would devote
62 percent of the non-Social Security surplus to shoring up the
program. That comes to about $700 billion over 10 years, according
to his aides. Bush, on the other hand, would set aside the existing
payroll taxes already tagged for Social Security, but not any of
the non-Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush uses most of the non-Social Security surplus for
his tax cut. McCain, on the other hand, would use just 23 percent
for reducing taxes. He would also take 10 percent of the surplus
for reinforcing the Medicare program, and 5 percent for lowering
the national debt, which now totals more than $5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign officials insisted Sunday that the senator's
expanded tax proposal is not a reaction to Bush's focus on tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laid out a schedule for a series of policy speeches early
this fall,'' said Schnur. ``Our original intention from the
beginning was to schedule those speeches for December and January
when the largest possible number of voters would be paying
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Dec. 1, McCain has delivered policy addresses on
foreign policy, defense, health care and the environment. His
education address will be given Jan. 17 in New Hampshire.

NEW HAMPSHIRE'S GOP ESTABLISHMENT HAS HEART SET ON BUSH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ There were no interruptions. No uncomfortable
questions posed by intrusive moderators. No bickering over the
finer points of tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, each of the six Republican candidates for the
presidential nomination got equal time to plead their cases before
more than 1,000 of the party's faithful at a Republican National
Committee fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Seated on the covered ice at the Whittemore Center at the
University of New Hampshire, bathed in red and blue light, GOP
activists gave each candidate a warm reception, though most of
their hearts were already committed to Texas Governor George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Senator John McCain, who has placed second to Bush in
national polls but is leading among likely Republican voters in
this first primary state, used the occasion to condemn both Vice
President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley for their stances
on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in the last few days, the two Democratic candidates
proved they are not qualified to be commander-in-chief of the armed
forces of the United States,'' he said. Who aspires to be the
commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the United States and
says they will only choose a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
who will support and pursue a social agenda does not qualify?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain vowed to continue the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy if
elected.
</P>
<P>
   He also lamented the lack of discussion on foreign policy in
Republican debates so far. He called the Clinton administration's
policy ``feckless,'' and condemned possible plans to return
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be driven by polls,'' McCain said. ``I am
completely experienced and prepared to be president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain steered clear of campaign finance reform, a topic which
he has hammered in other forums to date, but which has made some in
the Republican Party angry with him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been criticized in New Hampshire for paying too
little attention to voters until recently, opened his speech by
recalling his fond memories of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``My trips to your state have always reminded me that the great
strength of our country lies in hearts and minds of our citizens,
not in the halls of government,'' Bush said, to loud applause.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also criticized the Democrats for their policies on the
military, telling the audience, ``I'll be a commander-in-chief who
respects the military and a commander-in-chief who will earn the
respect of the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also discussed his tax-cut plan, which one of his rivals,
Steve Forbes, has attacked in recent days. While Bush spoke, a
Forbes aide delivered a detailed rebuttal to reporters, arguing
that Bush had broken a no-new-taxes pledge in Texas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates also hit familiar themes: their opposition to
abortion and to big government, the decline of religion and
morality in American life, the failure of the Clinton-Gore
administration to safeguard national secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But while all six candidates may have gotten equal time, the
evening belonged to Bush. This was a gathering of the Republican
establishment, and, as supporters of other candidates hastened to
explain, the establishment is squarely with the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his demeanor,'' said Audrey Murphy, a party activist
from Marlborough, Mass. ``He has a feeling of sincerity and
honesty, and warmth.''
</P>
<P>
   And at least one guest was won over to Bush Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. Bill
Kerrigan, who was seated at a Gary Bauer table, had privately
decided to change camps before Bush had even stepped up to the
podium. He picked up a Bush sticker as he walked in, but decided
not to use it until after the dinner, out of respect for Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his switch? Bush, Kerrigan said, can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to lose with a thoroughbred,'' Kerrigan said. ``I
want to win with a solid conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're behind enemy lines tonight,'' said Dan Robertson, New
Hampshire press secretary for Steve Forbes. ``Most of the people
here are the establishment. To a man, they're supporting Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But the night was also about money, raising $200,000 for the
party, a state record. Forbes bought 20 tables, at $2,000 each, to
reward his supporters.

STARS AND STRIPES LOSES ON LAND BUT WINS BY SEA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ A winner on the water on Sunday against
Nippon Challenge, Stars and Stripes fared more poorly against the
Japanese on paper, being penalized one potentially precious point
for using an illegal rudder against them earlier in the America's
Cup challenger semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty dropped Stars and Stripes into third place in this
round, from which only two of the six boats will advance to the
challenger final.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the America's Cup; it is not without drama or a few
potholes, and you have to negotiate them,'' said the Stars and
Stripes skipper Dennis Conner, who has helped cement this event's
reputation for that in his 25 years of sailing in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a very crucial point taken away, but we can't think
about that now,'' he said in an interview with New Zealand
television. ``We still have our destiny in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars and Stripes, which is sailing without Conner on board, had
a chance to help itself in a hurry on Monday, when it was scheduled
to face second-place Prada on the Hauraki Gulf. A victory would put
Conner's crew back in a tie for second behind America One, the
syndicate headed by Paul Cayard that represents the St. Francis
Yacht Club in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   America One, now 5-1, is the only team to have beaten Stars and
Stripes in this round, if you choose not to count Nippon, whose
only victory against the Americans came in the jury room on Sunday.
Nippon had protested to the international jury that Stars and
Stripes had breached Article 19 of the America's Cup protocol by
using a rudder that was not made in its home country (the United
States) or in the host country (New Zealand).
</P>
<P>
   The rudder was designed by Americans but manufactured in
Australia at McConaghy Boats in Sydney with materials shipped from
the United States. The rudder _ shorter than the one used by Stars
and Stripes in the preliminary rounds _ was intended for use in the
third round robin but did not arrive in Auckland in time and was
installed for the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   But after Stars and Stripes beat Nippon with it on Jan. 2 in its
opening race, the Americans, concerned about possible
repercussions, removed the rudder and replaced it with a modified
version of the original.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon protested four days later, and the America's Cup
arbitration panel ruled on Sunday that the rudder was illegal.
Stars and Stripes then went out and won the closest race of these
challenger semifinals, beating Nippon by 10 seconds, by taking
advantage of miscommunication at the start between Nippon's
Australian skipper, Peter Gilmour, and his largely Japanese crew.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after the race had been completed that the
international jury imposed the 1-point penalty. But the jury did
not choose to award a point to Nippon, which did not sit well with
the Japanese and could lead them to request a reopening of the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Willis, the chairman of the jury, termed the breach of the
protocol ``a very serious matter'' and said ``that's why we imposed
a full point'' on Stars and Stripes. But he said that Nippon had
not been rewarded, because ``the use of the rudder had no
significant effect on the outcome of the match.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury made that judgment because Nippon lost the race by 55
seconds and experienced problems with a steering device on its keel
and because Stars and Stripes' boat performed just as well with its
original rudder in its next two races.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, we're very surprised about this decision,'' said
Emili Miura, a Nippon spokeswoman who called for syndicates to
respect the protocol and said her syndicate would decide later
Monday whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Nippon was 2-4 and in fourth place after losing its third
straight race on Sunday. That disappointing record certainly helps
explain some of its disappointment with the jury's decision. In
fifth is America True at 1-4 and in last place is Le Defi Francais,
which is 1-5 and mathematically eliminated from contention.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that unless Nippon can get a point back from the
jury, this semifinal is now a three-boat race among America One,
Prada and Stars and Stripes, which all won on Sunday in light wind
conditions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such conditions are far from ideal for Stars and Stripes'
USA-55, a boat conceived and constructed to prosper in moderate to
heavy winds, but Conner's crew has proved its resourcefulness here
on the water if not its sound judgment on land. ``We screwed up, so
we were at their mercy,'' said the tactician Tom Whidden, who made
Stars and Stripes' case to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ken Read, the helmsman of Stars and Stripes, the
decision to build the rudder in Australia was made because it
``cost less money and required a shorter period of time'' than
building it elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how we do things,'' Read said of his syndicate, which
has a $12 million budget that pales in comparison with Prada's $50
million and America One's $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stars and Stripes has paid a price for its error, but
Conner's crew may not have seen the last of the jury. If Stars and
Stripes wins the challenger series and earns the right to face Team
New Zealand in the America's Cup match, it could still be deemed
ineligible. Cup rules require a challenger to sign a document
assuring that it has broken no rules before racing the defenders,
and Stars and Stripes has undeniably broken a rule.
</P>
<P>
   But Willis said that the arbitration panel could determine that
this requirement be waived in light of the penalty already assessed
against Stars and Stripes. He said another option would be for the
defender, New Zealand, to accept the challenge despite the breach
on the grounds that a penalty had been paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess all these things will be cleared up near the end,''
Willis said rather hopefully.

GADZURIC IS THE GOOD NEWS FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Locker-room leftovers from the first of what
should be nine wild weeks of league play for UCLA ...
</P>
<P>
   The good: Sophomore center Dan Gadzuric had the most productive
Pacific-10 weekend of his career with 25 points and 20 rebounds. He
grabbed 13 rebounds Thursday at Washington and scored 16 points
Saturday at Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   But Gadzuric's low-post offense is raw. He relies on
athleticism, not skill. That works against the Washington schools,
but not against Arizona and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I do wrong,'' he said, ``is that when I get the ball
in the post, I go right away. I need to take my time.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad: While Gadzuric sparkled, forward Jerome Moiso and guard
Ray Young struggled.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso shot 37 percent from the field, 50 percent from the line,
averaged 9.5 points and committed nine turnovers. He seemed
distracted in both games and had a long talk with coach Steve Lavin
on the bench in the final minutes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Young's nemesis was foul trouble. He had four in both games,
spent prolonged periods on the bench and never found his groove. He
scored eight points in Seattle and one in Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of growing into being able to play with sustained
intensity with an expanded role (this season),'' Lavin said. ``He's
a rhythm player. When he gets into a rhythm offensively, that tends
to pick his energy up at both ends.''
</P>
<P>
   The ugly: The Bruins made 21 of 40 free throws this weekend and
are shooting 60.2 percent for the season. They lost the Washington
game because of it, making 9 of 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been shooting 100 every day,'' Lavin said. ``There's no
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is: poor concentration.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre: The weekend's most surprising development was the
ease with which UCLA dismantled Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Bruins (9-3, 1-1) had won their previous three
games in Pullman by a total of seven points, no one expected a
rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd never think it would be this weekend, especially because
of how we played at Washington,'' guard Earl Watson said. ``But
there was no way we were coming out of here 0-2.''
</P>
<P>
   The comeback: Ten days after deciding to transfer _ and one week
after returning _ sophomore guard Billy Knight proved his value.
</P>
<P>
   Knight made 4 of 7 shots from 3-point range and scored 14 points
in 16 minutes against Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's done is buy into what we've asked,'' Lavin said.
``That is to play solid defense and understand our (offensive)
sets. That will allow him to be a threat and keep him on the floor
for more sustained time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the week: The 22-point victory at Washington State was
UCLA's largest Pac-10 road win in 11 years _ since a 31-point win
at Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Comment: After the one-point loss to Washington, Lavin said:
``The good news is, as poorly as we're playing, every game, even
Gonzaga, we've contested. Colorado State, we were in the game
(until the buzzer). Same with Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction: Since when was ``contesting'' a game against Colorado
State an issue for UCLA?
</P>
<P>
   How the standards have dropped.

IRAN'S FIRST VISIT TO THE U.S. BEGINS WITH A NARROW LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GREGG BELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Javad Zarinche was an 11-year-old Iranian
soccer neophyte in 1978, when a student-led takeover of the United
States Embassy in Tehran became a 444-day holding of American
hostages. The siege remains the Western world's most disturbing
memory of Iran's Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But the thoughts that Zarinche and the 34,289 fans at Network
Associates Coliseum may have had Sunday of such history drowned in
a sea of red-white-and-green good will. Zarinche led an Iranian
soccer team onto an American field for the first time, and it was
greeted by the horns, cheers and flag-waving of an estimated 20,000
cheering countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Zarinche, Iran's captain, may not have been happy with his
team's 2-1 loss to Mexico to open a three-match friendly series
that ends next Sunday at the Rose Bowl against the United States.
But he is proud of what he sees as progress through sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy that after 21 years, the sport of football, or
soccer as you call it here, brought us here to the United States,''
Zarinche said through an interpreter before Sunday's match. ``I'm
hoping sports can be a bond to bring people of the world
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The match, between two national teams playing without many of
their stars, brought out the second-largest crowd in the limited
history of soccer in Oakland and a live Iranian national television
audience (1 a.m. Monday in Tehran) to witness a wide-open,
entertaining match that included three first-half goals and plenty
of scoring chances throughout.
</P>
<P>
   The match ended after a frantic final push from Iran, which
controlled most of action in the final 45 minutes. Before that, the
Mexican forward Luis Hernandez dazzled the crowd with both his
long, flowing blond hair and his fleet offensive rushes.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez headed in Juan Pablo Rodriguez's perfectly arched free
kick from 10 yards out to open the scoring in the third minute. By
the time the crowd completed its first wave around the stadium in
the 24th minute, Rodriguez had helped Mexico take a 2-0 lead with
another accurate free kick. Cuauhtemoc Blanco headed Rodriguez's
line drive over Iran goalkeeper Hadi Tabatabei's reach.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's only score came in the 26th minute. Forward Esmaeil
Halali broke free into Mexico's penalty area and was tackled from
behind by Mexican defender Ramon Ramirez. Ali Daei grounded the
subsequent penalty kick past Christian Martinez for Iran's only
goal, despite its late-game offensive dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very good experience for us,'' said Iran Coach
Mansour Pourhaidari, who brought players from the team that beat
the United States, 2-1, in the 1998 World Cup. ``We made costly
mistakes early in the game, but I was proud of the way we fought
back and played hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparations for the groundbreaking tour included the State
Department's granting the Iranian players exceptions to the
fingerprinting that is required for visa applicants from nations it
determines to be a ``high threat,'' Iranians joyously greeting the
players at the Oakland Airport upon their arrival Wednesday and a
Western news media buildup that stressed the political significance
of playing in the United States over the matches themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Pourhaidari played down the importance of the
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results are not important,'' he said through an
interpreter. ``These matches are used to identify strengths and
weaknesses for the Asian championships. There has been too much
emphasis and importance placed on these matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Iran's players who play professionally outside the
country did not join the team until after New Year's Day.
Pourhaidari said five or six players who will play in the Asian
Games this fall did not make the trip. Sunday's loss was Iran's
first in international play since the 1998 Asian Games, a span of
11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Iran has a match against Ecuador on Wednesday in Los
Angeles before its Rose Bowl meeting against the United States, its
players have their sights on the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came back well,'' forward Emilio Mora said of his team's
effort Sunday. ``We are looking forward to playing the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's match, no one was looking back. &QL;

THE REV. CARL ELKANAH BATES, 85, FORMER SOUTHERN BAPTIST LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Carl Elkanah Bates, a former president of the Southern
Baptist Convention, the country's largest Protestant denomination,
died on Dec. 21 at his home in Hendersonville, N.C. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, who led the convention from 1970 to 1972, had previously
been president of the Baptist General Convention of Texas and the
Baptist State Convention of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   He was considered a moderate who deplored the infighting between
opposite wings of the church that, after his presidency, led to the
ascendancy of the conservative wing of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Bates was born in Liberty, Miss., and became what is known
as a Gideon convert. As Bates told it, he was in a New Orleans
hotel room in 1934, standing by an open window and feeling
despondent enough to contemplate suicide. Just then he noticed the
Gideon Bible that is present in all hotel rooms and opened it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a self-styled agnostic,'' he once testified, ``but as I
read that Bible, it dawned on me that I had cut myself off from
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates graduated from Mississippi College in Clinton in 1937 and
was ordained a minister in 1938. He earned a master's degree at
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., in 1941,
and a doctorate of divinity at Baylor University in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   His ministry took him to Southern churches in several states. He
became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Charlotte, N.C., in
1959.
</P>
<P>
   For five years he was a senior professor of preaching and
pastoral ministries at Southern Baptist Seminary, which created a
Carl E. Bates Chair of Preaching in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Bates is survived by his wife of 60 years, Myra Mae Gray Bates,
who was a convention vice president in the 1970s; a daughter,
Judith Stoneham of Hendersonville; a brother, Eugene Bates of Baton
Rouge, La.; a sister, Mildred Day of Baton Rouge; and two
grandsons.

EACH COMPETITION HAS ITS CHARM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By KATIE PETTIBONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ I have made the transition from
around-the-world ocean sailor to around-the-marks America's Cup
sailor. I am now sailing with America True, a coed team backed by
the San Francisco Yacht Club, and we are currently in the
challenger semifinals with five other syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   I can hardly believe that it was almost two years ago that I
wrote from EF Education in the 1997-98 Whitbread Round the World
race about feeling as if we were moving ``furniture from side to
side in a house on jacks.'' Then, the friendliest thing we would
see for days might be a lonely albatross circling endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it has been interesting to go from racing around the
world with a 10-boat fleet for nine months of nonstop action to
competing one-on-one for an intense three-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   These two events _ the Whitbread, now called the Volvo Ocean
Race to recognize the event's new sponsor, and the America's Cup _
are definitely the premier international big-boat events today.
Although the two events have slowly evolved to have more
similarities, their backgrounds and purpose could hardly be more
different.
</P>
<P>
   The Volvo Race covers more than 32,000 miles over a nine-month
period. The history of the race is considered young; the first
Whitbread took place in the early 1970s. Initially, Whitbread
sailors were more pirates than bluebloods.
</P>
<P>
   The race was _ and still is _ considered extreme, before extreme
sports came into vogue. The yachts that took these adventure
seekers out into the ocean were not necessarily built for speed.
Rather, they had to get their sailors through some of the toughest
conditions on the planet and get them back to port in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the America's Cup is not only one of the
oldest events in sports history (the first trophy was awarded in
1870), but it has also been the symbol of the tired old stereotype
of yacht racing as a wealthy and privileged boys' club. While the
cup has a four-month buildup of races to determine the challenger
fit to battle the defender, the competition's finals are decided by
a five-of-nine series of races.
</P>
<P>
   Modernization in the ocean race and the cup has brought a level
of professionalism and sponsorship dollars that would dazzle the
founders.
</P>
<P>
   Recent performance in both has also put the age-old superstition
regarding women as bad luck in sailboat racing into the fairy-tale
books, where it belongs. Women's teams made an appearance in the
Whitbread first, but now have also made strong appearances in the
cup.
</P>
<P>
   You need look no further than America True's record in this
America's Cup for proof: We qualified for the challenger semifinals
_ five teams did not make it. We currently stand 1-4 in this
series. The ultimate victor among the challengers will meet New
Zealand in the finals in February.
</P>
<P>
   This campaign with America True is my first experience on the
professional level with a coed team. While my two previous
all-female projects _ the 1995 America's Cup with America3 and EF
Education in the 1997-98 Whitbread _ had men involved in coaching
or leadership positions, the crew members on each boat were women.
</P>
<P>
   On America True, there are three to five women racing a day; we
all grew up competing with and against men, so none of this is new
to us. I happen to be the only woman in a trimmer's position, but I
really don't even notice it. Among our competitors, however, there
are men who turned down spots on America True in favor of offers
from all-male teams. They thought that a coed effort wouldn't be
competitive. They, incidentally, have not made the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   As for the racing conditions in the two events, out on the
Hauraki Gulf we are crashing about in 75-foot carbon-fiber racing
machines in conditions that are marginal for these yachts.
</P>
<P>
   I have to chuckle: This is when a Whitbread 60 just started to
cook! America's Cup boats are technical prototypes designed to push
the design envelope; they are like Formula One race cars _
technically challenging, very sensitive and requiring the best to
drive and care for them. They aren't meant to be taken off-roading
into the wilds. That is for the Volvo boats _ the Range Rovers of
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   However, here in Auckland, when the winds are howling up to 28
knots with large waves, my Whitbread experience has come in handy
in controlling the boat.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity on board the boat during a Volvo race has to be
paced. Although the level of competition has meant that the teams
push themselves harder for longer, it is not physically possible to
maintain the extreme level of mental concentration demanded by a
cup race. In a cup race, every nerve is firing, every fiber of your
being is straining to hear, see or react.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the intensity of the races themselves, the keys to
success are two-boat testing along with time, practice and the
money to develop your boat design. This is becoming the case in the
Volvo race as well, with more teams preparing and testing in the
years leading up to the event.
</P>
<P>
   So if the professionalism, preparation, technology and intensity
are all similar, what stands to differentiate the events? Pretty
simple: You have to be a little insane to do the Volvo race. During
a Volvo leg, you don't go home at night to a nice, comfy bed, eat a
fresh meal or cuddle up with a significant other. When I go into
work on America True, I am on _ working, sailing, sweating. But
when I leave the compound at night, I am off. I've even been known
to read a book.
</P>
<P>
   Having competed in both events, I find each stimulating and
challenging in its own way. The cup gives results in a day and
allows you to become specialized, hence extremely good, at one
thing. In my case, for America True I am trimming the forward
sails. In the Whitbread, the results of your efforts may not be
seen for weeks, even months, and you have to be good at a lot of
things, including sail changes, trimming all sails and driving.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how close the two events become, the one thing the cup
will never be able to teach its participants is the appreciation
for hot showers and dry, warm beds that don't move up and down. I
still thank God for my hot baths and showers to this day. Just
don't remind me of this when I get ready for the next Volvo.

NORTHRIDGE ROUTS IDAHO STATE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On paper, Cal State Northridge should have had a
big advantage, but it wasn't until the second half that the
Matadors proved that fact.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho State dropped nine consecutive games after starting the
season 2-0. The Bengals (3-10, 1-1) recently beat Eastern
Washington for their third win, but their record doesn't accurately
indicate how aggressively they can play.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors had trouble getting the ball into the post, but
found success outside to pull away for an 82-53 victory at home
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the third time CSUN (8-4, 2-0) has beaten the
Bengals, and the important factors in the win didn't all show up on
the stat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intangible things, that's me,'' said Northridge guard
Jamilah Jones, who scored all of her 10 points in the second half,
including eight in the first four minutes as CSUN expanded a 36-28
halftime lead to a 24-point advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Jones' defense and hustle that mattered most. Her
tenacity as a defender helped create turnovers and break up plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to go at them inside, that's where their
strength lies, in the post game,'' Northridge coach Frozena Jerro
said. ``They did a pretty good job in the post getting some blocked
shots. Jamilah did a great job of coming in and lighting it up in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what was key for us is that we got off to a good
start. Everybody got into the flow. We want to focus on playing a
solid 40 minutes of basketball and understand that if we do that,
wins are going to come.''
</P>
<P>
   More of the Matadors offense came from Keisha Harris. Harris was
7 of 8 from the field and finished with her second double-double of
the season with 14 points and 10 rebounds. Harris also had three
blocks and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Edneisha Curry had 17 points, Neda Milic scored 12 and Lynda
Amari had 11 points, five steals and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Jerro said another key was the 33 turnovers Northridge forced,
including 19 from steals. CSUN had 19 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho State was led by Chris Urbanski, who scored 18 points and
Mandi Carvers who had 13 points.

FROM LOWLY PIGEON, LESSON IN BIRDS (AND BEES) 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was not the most auspicious spot for studying the
mating habits of wild animals. A woman pushed a baby carriage
through the observation area. Another woman barged past, talking on
a cell phone, as traffic roared on Greenwich Street. Behold, the
wild kingdom of TriBeCa.
</P>
<P>
   The species under scrutiny was not particularly exotic, either _
Columba livia, better known as the rock dove, or pigeon. And the
researchers, part of a Cornell University ornithology project
spanning nine countries, were mostly under 4 feet tall and still in
the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   In front of Public School 234, Patricia Sanabria's 26 students
had spread some multigrain crackers on the sidewalk. They waited,
clipboards in hand, as a flock of pigeons descended, bird by bird.
For the next 45 minutes, they would count the pigeons and take
notes about how the birds paired off.
</P>
<P>
   The students are part of Project PigeonWatch, a program run by
the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, which has 400 other groups
of observers _ mostly schoolchildren _ around the world. They are
trying to answer two riddles about pigeons: why do they come in so
many colors, and how do they choose their mates?
</P>
<P>
   While they are helping science, the pigeon watchers learn that
the birds are monogamous, are used by rescuers to help find people
lost at sea, and are not, at least anatomically, rats with wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pigeons pose very interesting, genuinely unsolved evolutionary
questions,'' said John Fitzpatrick, director of the laboratory, a
research and education center in Ithaca, N.Y., affiliated with
Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how or why federal pigeons, once domesticated and
bred for particular traits, have maintained their diversity of
colors and patterns back in the wild. Students of the pigeon can
identify 28 color morphs, or feather patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, after several generations, Fitzpatrick said, wild
pigeons would be expected to revert to the standard look, known as
the blue bar, of pigeons found on Old World cliffs. But even a
cursory look around a city sidewalk or under a bridge reveals a
mosaic of pigeon morphs. So citizen observers have been recruited
to figure out why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they stable across big metropolitan areas?'' Fitzpatrick
asked. ``Are they constant across the country? Do pigeons of
different colors mate assortatively?'' _ that is, do they mate with
birds like them?
</P>
<P>
   It is within the power of 8-year-olds to help answer such
questions, and learn the skills of nature-watching at the same
time. Eleven schools in New York City are participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we run and chase them?'' Mrs. Sanabria asked her students
on a chilly morning. They knew the answer was no. ``How do we have
to sit?'' she asked. One student, Edyth Florio, replied: ``Very,
very quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sanabria defined four courtship behaviors that the children
would be looking for: bowing, when the male bows and puffs out his
neck feathers; tailing, when he drags his tail feathers while
pursuing a female; driving, when he attempts to chase her; and
cooing, when the birds make sounds of approval.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing these behaviors, Mrs. Sanabria left out anything
that could kick a class from a PG to an X rating. Even so, the
students know enough to make accurate observations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've seen eggs laid here, and the hermit crabs have had
babies,'' she said inside her classroom, which has a flock of
finches and a tank of crabs. ``It's sort of like they know about
the basics, as far as 8-year-olds should know about the basics.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some students noted that the birds were ``getting it
on,'' a term that was not on their clipboards.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Rendano also used decidedly unscientific terms to describe
what she had observed: ``We saw two in love, then the girl flew
away.''
</P>
<P>
   One student, Granville Gittens, remained engaged in the study
even after a pigeon relieved itself on his coat. ``I didn't know
who did it,'' he said. ``It was natural. I'm surprised it doesn't
happen all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview from Ithaca, Fitzpatrick said that instead of
reading books, answering questions at the end of chapters and
running experiments with predictable results, PigeonWatch students
were forging into the unknown, with the help of a most familiar
bird. The multiyear project is financed by the National Science
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What science is, in its basic form, is solving the mysteries
of nature, and what we want kids to do is see how fun it is to
solve these mysteries,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hans Schwerte, an authority on literary history who admitted in
1995 that under another name he had been an SS officer, died on
Dec. 18 in a retirement home in Marquartstein, Germany. He was 90.
His death was announced by the Aachen Technical University.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that he acknowledged his SS role under his original
name, Hans-Ernst Schneider, Schwerte had retired as a professor at
the university, where he was rector from 1970 to 1973, and had
received a high German decoration for his postwar contributions to
German scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   He described his role in a letter to academic authorities in
Aachen after anonymous phone calls and letters had threatened to
reveal his identity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the disclosure was that Dutch television was
about to broadcast an investigation of Schwerte's SS activities in
the Netherlands. His rank was the equivalent of army captain.
</P>
<P>
   Schwerte, who had a reputation as a liberal in politics, denied
having taken part in atrocities that involved experiments on
inmates of concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he gave an interview to a reporter for The New York
Times at a time when he had been accused of having helped to
procure medical equipment _ microscopes, centrifuges and crucibles
_ used for so-called scientific experiments in the Dachau camp. As
Hans-Ernst Schneider, records indicated, he was also on the
personal staff of Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS and the
Gestapo.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, he said the order to obtain the equipment
``probably came across my desk as an administrative matter,''
adding: ``But I never took part in any medical matters. I never
went to a concentration camp. I had nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Schwerte had acknowledged his SS role, Simon Wiesenthal,
the Nazi hunter who had made fruitless inquiries about his past,
said in an interview, ``There are many Schwertes in other fields,
but the fact that he could become the rector of a university is
unique.''
</P>
<P>
   After the confession, Schwerte was stripped of his Federal
Service Cross and title of professor.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing his hidden years, Schwerte depicted himself as a
victim of persecution and circumstance. He said he had taken a new
identity to obtain employment, not to hide wartime misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   When he was interviewed in 1995, he denied having committed war
crimes while in the SS. ``I wore that uniform,'' he said. ``But I
never committed a crime in that uniform. My work was purely
academic.''
</P>
<P>
   No charges were ever brought against him.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Schwerte was born in
Konigsberg, the German city that is now Kaliningrad, Russia. A
Munich newspaper, The Suddeutsche Zeitung, said that five months
after World War II had ended in Europe, Schwerte's wife reported
that he had died. The newspaper said she had remarried him under
the name Hans Schwerte, saying he was her brother-in-law. Other
painstaking steps were taken to establish the new identity.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Annemarie, survives him.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Richards, an American academic who identified Schwerte
as Hans-Ernst Schneider in a letter to Wiesenthal in 1992, said
wartime records at the Berlin Document Center showed that Schneider
had been sent on SS ``special missions'' to Poland, Latvia and the
Netherlands before becoming editor of an SS propaganda publication
in Berlin.

DAVID BRYSON, 58, HOUSING ADVOCATE FOR THE POOR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David B. Bryson, a lawyer and advocate of the housing rights of
poor people, died on Dec. 25 at a hospital in Berkeley, Calif. He
was 58 and lived in Piedmont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, The Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson ``was a central figure in the advocacy for public housing
residents and residents of all subsidized housing developments,''
recalled another housing expert, professor Florence W. Roisman of
the Indiana University School of Law in Indianapolis. ``He played a
crucial role in developing housing legislation and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryson had been a staff lawyer, temporary director and deputy
director for the National Housing Law Project in Oakland, Calif.,
and had worked with other similar groups for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   An authority on the complexities of federal housing programs, he
taught many lawyers and other advocates about ways to provide legal
support tailored to the needs of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in September, he said, ``My job has really been
about studying up on federal laws and conveying those ideas to the
local legal services' attorneys and helping them understand what
can be done for the very poorest people.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also involved in significant legal cases in his field,
and he won honors from the National Legal Aide and Defender
Association and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   David B. Bryson was born in Philadelphia and grew up in
Westminster, Md. He received a bachelor's degree from Princeton
University and a law degree from Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Anita; a daughter, Hallie Ness, of San
Francisco; two sons, Paul, of Piedmont, and Ethan, of Bridgewater,
N.J.; his parents, Mary and Brady, of Westminster; a sister, Linda
Lucatorto of Washington; and two brothers, John, of Washington, and
Tim, of Westminster.

NEW YORK CITY BOARD OF EDUCATION SELECTS INTERIM CHANCELLOR 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City Board of Education defied Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani on Sunday by rejecting his candidate for interim
schools chancellor and choosing Harold Levy, a banking executive
and member of the state Board of Regents, for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Levy's appointment is not yet assured, because he lacks formal
credentials as a school administrator and must receive a waiver
from Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted, 4-3, Sunday to request the waiver, and Mills
said through a spokesman that he would decide quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani said after the vote that Levy was not qualified for
the job and complained that the teachers' union had pressured board
members to appoint him. The mayor said his candidate, Robert Kiley,
executive director of the New York City Partnership and a former
chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, was much
better equipped to run the nation's largest school system because
he had more managerial experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have selected the least qualified of the two,'' Giuliani
told reporters at City Hall. ``I have to say to myself, there must
be some other influence involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy, 47, is director of global compliance for Citigroup and has
served on several commissions studying the condition of school
buildings in New York City, including one that issued a scathing
report on the deteriorating conditions of city schools in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic majority in the state Assembly appointed him to
the state Board of Regents in 1997, and he has used that platform
to push for more state aid for city schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education's surprise decision to support Levy came
at the end of a week fraught with political tension as the seven
board members scrambled to find a temporary replacement for Rudy
Crew, whom the board ousted as chancellor just two weeks ago, and
as mayoral allies pressured them to choose a candidate acceptable
to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, Terri Thomson, who sided with the mayor's
three allies on the board in voting against Crew last month, cast
her vote for Levy on Sunday, saying that he could do a better job
of carrying out Crew's policies than Kiley.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, she said, Levy could help the board carry out its
ambitious plan to end the automatic promotion of failing students.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the strong business management background as well as
the educational background, serving as a New York State Regent,''
she said. ``I made my decision based on what I think is right for
the kids.'''

VICTOR SEREBRIAKOFF, 87, DIES; OVERSAW THE GROWTH OF MENSA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Victor Serebriakoff, who helped Mensa, the organization for
self-conscious but intensely convivial intelligentsia, grow from
four eggheads around a London dinner table to a worldwide
intellectual omelet of more than 100,000, died on Jan. 1 at his
home in Blackheath, a London suburb. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Mensa (the name means table in Latin) began in 1946 as an
organization for people with IQs in the top 2 percent of the
population. But by 1954, just four members attended the annual
meeting; two were Serebriakoff and his wife, Winifred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why pretend?'' said the society's secretary, Joe Wilson.
``We're really just a group of friends who like to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems a shame,'' Serebriakoff said.
</P>
<P>
   The short, bearded man with twinkling eyes was immediately named
secretary. He invigorated what had been a flagging black-tie dinner
club by sending out brochures, appearing on television, approaching
universities and introducing supervised testing as an entry
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, he decided that Mensa must be completely
uncommitted and impartial, with no corporate views, and that
nothing said by any member should be considered anything other than
his or her personal view. He played down Mensa's original mission
of providing advice to governments, not least because no government
had expressed any interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of a way to package this club and develop it,'' he
said. ``Sometimes I felt like the Sorcerer's Apprentice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London suggested in 1992 that Serebriakoff purveyed
``a fictional air, as though he were the invention of an Edwardian
novelist.'' The paper went so far as to suggest that his name could
have been a play on the word cerebral.
</P>
<P>
   The truth was that he was born in the slums of East London, the
son of a Russian father and a cockney mother. His brains caused
trouble early on. ``I was chased home from school every day because
I was the kid who put his hand up at every question,'' he told The
Chicago Tribune in 1986. ``The teachers liked me all right, but the
other kids didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He dropped out and got a job as an office clerk at a lumber
company, but he was soon dismissed for lack of attention to detail.
He then worked as a manual laborer, with periods of unemployment
during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   He was late getting into World War II. On the standardized Army
intelligence test, he learned that he had an IQ of at least 161, as
high as the scale went. The Army assigned him to train recruits in
its teaching corps.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he refused a commission and went back to the
timber business, inventing a machine for grading timber and
introducing metric measurements. He became the manager of a
sawmill, and under the pen name Victor Serry wrote ``British
Sawmilling Practice,'' among other timber-related tomes.
</P>
<P>
   Serebriakoff joined Mensa in 1950 after his first wife, Mary,
cut an advertisement out of a newspaper and encouraged him to join.
She died soon afterward, and he married Winifred Rouse, whom he had
met at Mensa meetings. Though the marriage lasted until her death
in 1995, it led to a not entirely pleasant philosophical
revelation, as he told The New York Times Magazine in 1960:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I joined Mensa I thought, `Now I am joining a bunch of
very bright people; therefore everyone will agree with me.' Alas,
this turned out not to be so. Then I married a member and began to
learn the full extent, breadth and profundity of human
disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Serebriakoff never denied being an elitist but remained calm and
courteous throughout the spirited discussions at think-ins, as
meeting are called. He addressed the issue of smart people breeding
with smart people on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say bright people should marry other bright
people to produce bright children, but then you have to realize
you're also saying dim people will be left only with other dim
people to marry _ and is that desirable?'' he told Look magazine in
1964. ``Of course, nobody can think straight on the subject because
sooner or later Hitler's name comes up, and then all thinking
stops.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, he was named Mensa's honorary international president
and in the next decade campaigned for educational improvements for
gifted children.
</P>
<P>
   Serebriakoff wrote and lectured widely about the brain,
intelligence and educating gifted children. He also wrote humorous
poetry, including ``Vile Verse,'' published in 1997. He is survived
by a son, Mark, of London and a daughter, Judith, of Anglesey, a
small island off northwest Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Mensa colleagues said that by living past the midnight that
ended the millennium, Serebriakoff achieved his final ambition.
They noted that his apartment in Blackheath lies almost exactly on
the prime meridian.

LEON RADZINOWICZ, 93, LEADER IN CRIMINOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leon Radzinowicz, a scholar of criminology who played a major
role in the development of the field, died on Dec. 29 at his home
in Haverford, Pa. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his career, Radzinowicz, who was knighted by Queen
Elizabeth II in 1970, taught law at Cambridge University, where he
also founded the Institute of Criminology in 1959; he retired in
1973 after serving as its first director.
</P>
<P>
   Radzinowicz was born into an affluent family in Lodz, Poland. He
was educated at several universities in Europe, and, after teaching
himself Italian, he earned a law degree at the Law School and
Institute of Criminology in Rome at age 22.
</P>
<P>
   He then earned a doctorate from the University of Cracow and
later did postdoctoral work in Belgium. He went to England in 1938
on behalf of the Polish Ministry of Justice to study the English
penal system.
</P>
<P>
   When World War II began, he stayed in England and joined
Cambridge's faculty, helping establish a department of criminal
science in 1941. The department largely attracts students pursuing
academic careers in the social sciences.
</P>
<P>
   In his long career, Sir Leon's philosophical view of crime
evolved from Italian positivism, which emphasized psychological and
sociological explanations of criminals and crime, to English
pragmatism, emphasizing the social and political context, said
Roger G. Hood, a former student of Sir Leon's who became a
professor of criminology and a colleague at Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Leon was an opponent of the death penalty and later of
open-ended sentences, like 20 years to life. He believed, Hood
said, that these punishments gave too much power to the authorities
and could be abused.
</P>
<P>
   He opposed the privatization of prisons, too. ``He thought that
if it was the state that punished, then the state should carry out
the punishment,'' Hood said. ``He was also concerned that an
incentive and profit for punishment would undermine the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also a critic of the American justice system, at least in
recent years. ``He felt that it had turned its back on a reformist
agenda and was becoming repressive _ with the enormous prison
population and the standards of the jails,'' Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Leon wrote many books, including ``Ideology and Crime,''
``In Search of Criminology'' and, with Hood, the five-volume
``History of the English Criminal Law and Its Administration.'' His
latest book, ``Adventures in Criminology,'' was published by
Routledge of London in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He served as a consultant to several nations and, in the United
States, to President Lyndon Johnson's Commission on Violence. He
was also a visiting lecturer at scores of universities, including
Columbia, Yale and the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Isolde; a daughter, Ann Stacey Prior
of Nutbourne, West Sussex, England; a son, William H.F. Radzinowicz
of London; and three grandchildren.

`SENSATION' EXHIBITION CLOSES AS IT OPENED, TO APPLAUSE AND
CONDEMNATION
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It ended much as it began, with long lines out the
doors and Catholic protesters praying on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sensation,'' an exhibition of contemporary British art culled
from the collection of the advertising magnate Charles Saatchi,
concluded its tumultuous three-month run Sunday at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope with our prayers we may send this picture back to hell
whence it came,'' called out one protester, Michael Mangan,
referring to ``The Holy Virgin Mary,'' the Chris Ofili painting
that prompted Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to try to cut off city
financing to the museum in September.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and several Catholic leaders, including Cardinal John
O'Connor, denounced the Ofili painting as blasphemous for depicting
the Madonna with a breast fashioned from elephant dung and with a
halo of close-ups snipped from pornographic magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also condemned as ``sick stuff'' several other works in
``Sensation,'' particularly the dissected corpses of cows and pigs,
a specialty of the British artist Damien Hirst.
</P>
<P>
   But under tight security Sunday, thousands of New Yorkers again
ignored Giuliani's imprecations, packing the exhibition halls for a
last glimpse at a show that resulted in an important First
Amendment victory for the museum, but that also raised questions
about the symbiotic financial relationships between museums and
wealthy private collectors like Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Williams, a spokeswoman for the museum, estimated that as
many as 180,000 people had seen ``Sensation'' in New York, although
she said the museum would have to sort through group ticket sales
before arriving at an exact figure.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although the attendance far exceeded the museum's internal
estimates before the opening of ``Sensation,'' it did not come
close to matching the 250,000 people who attended a recent Monet
exhibition at the museum. On the other hand, Impressionist
paintings tend to draw larger crowds than contemporary art, Ms.
Williams said, and museum officials were especially pleased by the
diverse and youthful demographics of the ``Sensation'' audience.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Art is freedom,'' said Ivaylo Gueorgiev, one of hundreds of
people in their 20s who waited patiently in line Sunday. Gueorgiev,
an artist from Manhattan who had never before visited the Brooklyn
Museum, is exactly the sort of patron that the museum's director,
Arnold L. Lehman, said he had hoped to attract with ``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is evidence that some of those new visitors intend to
return; the museum, which has suffered from low attendance in
recent years, sold thousands of new memberships during
``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I joined the day that it opened,'' Peter S. Hogness, 44, a
writer and editor of a public health newsletter, said Sunday. ``But
part of that was I felt like, `Hey, that's my museum. Mayor, take
your hands off of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Weeks after Giuliani cut financing to the museum, Judge Nina
Gershon of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn ruled that his actions
were a flagrant violation of the museum's rights under the First
Amendment. She ordered the mayor to restore city payments and end
his effort to evict the museum from its city-owned building
overlooking Prospect Park. The city's appeal is scheduled to be
heard Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the legal victory and healthy attendance,
``Sensation'' also exacted a price. It bitterly divided New York
City's cultural institutions, with some signing a letter of protest
to Giuliani and others declining. It also raised questions about
the conflicts of interest museum professionals often face in
financing expensive exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   To help pay for ``Sensation,'' Lehman solicited hundreds of
thousands of dollars from individuals and companies that have a
direct commercial stake in the ``Sensation'' art. He also concealed
Saatchi's $160,000 donation from the public while giving him a
central role in shaping the show's artistic content.
</P>
<P>
   And while the attention on ``Sensation'' may or may not increase
the value of Saatchi's collection, the museum has also promised him
a refund of $60,000 if the show is a financial success. Ms.
Williams said Sunday that she did not know whether the museum had
made or lost money with ``Sensation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Newspaper accounts of these and similar arrangements at other
major museums helped prompt the Association of Art Museum
Directors, which represents 170 museums in the United States,
Canada and Mexico, to review its professional guidelines on
exhibition finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arnold Lehman, you're going to pay the price,'' Mangan, the
Catholic protester from Queens, shouted into a megaphone Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Lehman, Lehman's wife, watched Mangan from a distance.
Then she turned and looked at the line of people waiting to get
into the museum. The line stretched for more than 100 yards. Mrs.
Lehman smiled.

EDITORIAL: TURN FOR THE WORSE IN BURUNDI 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Jan. 10:
</P>
<P>
   Burundi's smoldering civil war has taken a sinister turn in
recent weeks with the forced relocation of a third of a million
Hutu into disease-ridden internment camps outside Bujumbura, the
Burundian capital. This ruthless counterinsurgency tactic presents
yet another agonizing dilemma for humanitarian relief groups and
adds fresh urgency to a stalled but still indispensable peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 150,000 Burundians have died in five years of
fighting _ a staggering figure by any standard save that of
Burundi's kindred neighbor, Rwanda, where a comparably combustible
mix of Hutu and Tutsi yielded outright genocide in 1994. The bulk
of Burundi's casualties occurred in 1993, when the country's first
democratically elected leader, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was
assassinated in a coup by officers in Burundi's notorious
Tutsi-dominated army. Burundi's long-subjugated Hutu majority rose
up in revenge, killing tens of thousands of Tutsi. The army, in
turn, carried out massive reprisal killings.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three months Burundi's military-led government has
herded more than 300,000 impoverished Hutu into grimy
``regroupment'' camps, where 300 a week are dying of cholera,
dysentery and malnutrition. The move is intended to deprive Hutu
rebels of their main source of food and shelter, thereby blunting
their ability to attack the capital. The camps present a difficult
quandary for international relief agencies, which risk
unintentionally colluding with an inhumane practice by stepping in
to ameliorate its worst symptoms. But pulling out of the camps
would mean abandoning destitute victims in desperate need of
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   A humanitarian decision to stay and help can only be made in the
context of a stepped-up political engagement of regional and
international powers _ including the United States _ to bring
Burundi's war to a just and secure resolution. The Clinton
administration should redouble its support for the negotiating
process underway in Arusha, Tanzania, that includes all the major
factions and leading regional states. The yearlong Arusha talks
have achieved few concrete results thus far, but they gained fresh
momentum last month when Nelson Mandela, South Africa's former
president, agreed to serve as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   A solution will have to include a new social and political
contract for a more equitable distribution of power. Burundi's war,
like Rwanda's, is rooted in a history of Tutsi domination dating
back to the Belgian colonial era. In the classic pattern of
indirect rule, the Belgians elevated Tutsi, who make up barely 15
percent of Burundi's population of six million, to a position of
privilege, using them as instruments of colonial domination.
</P>
<P>
   Armed groups have overwhelmingly attacked civilians rather than
each other in this conflict. The killers have been abetted by an
entrenched culture of impunity for those who commit politically
motivated attacks on civilians. There will be no lasting peace that
does not address the problem of justice. Compromises may be
necessary, but a sustainable settlement will have to include a
process of accountability that establishes at long last that the
massive killing of civilians has consequences.

EDITORIAL: CLINTON'S LAND LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Jan. 10:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having lost to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 elections, Jimmy Carter
was more or less on his way out the door when, on Dec. 2 of that
year, he signed the Alaska Lands Act, protecting 100 million acres
of Alaskan wilderness from commercial development. The act remains
one of Carter's proudest achievements. Like Carter, President
Clinton now finds himself headed for the exit, with one more year
as a lame-duck president burdened by a hostile Congress. Yet he may
find the legacy he seeks and needs just where Carter found it _ in
the preservation of the American landscape.
</P>
<P>
   This would be an unexpected outcome for a man who ranked
environmental concerns near the bottom of his agenda when he came
to office seven years ago. But the truth is that Clinton has a
fighting chance to create more new protected open space than anyone
since Carter and, before that, Theodore Roosevelt. Between 1901 and
1909, Roosevelt, one of Clinton's heroes, created five national
parks, 50 wildlife reserves and 99 million acres of national
forests. Bruce Babbitt, the secretary of the interior, believes
that the beginning of the 21st century presents a similarly
promising moment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's opportunities lie in three areas. The first is his
plan to prohibit the building of new roads in at least 40 million
acres of national forests, in effect putting them off limits to
logging and other commercial activities. The president can do this
administratively and without congressional approval. But the
rule-making process, which includes extensive public hearings, will
require nearly a year to complete, giving the plan's congressional
enemies plenty of time for mischief. Clinton must therefore be
ready to fight legislative amendments and other devices aimed at
extending the process into the next administration, when a
president less hospitable to conservation could occupy the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The second opportunity lies in the Antiquities Act of 1906, a
little-known statute that allows presidents, by executive order, to
protect public lands by designating them as national monuments.
Clinton, who has already set aside nearly two million acres in
Utah, is now considering four new monument designations, and is
expected to act on at least one of these _ a million-acre monument
near the Grand Canyon _ on Tuesday. Every president except Richard
Nixon, Reagan and George Bush has used this device in the last 94
years, and not once have the designations been revoked by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The third opportunity lies, oddly enough, in Congress itself.
This Congress has been largely unsympathetic to adding to the
federal estate since the conservatives swept to power in 1994. But
last year, two House members who rarely agree on anything co-wrote
a bill that could dramatically strengthen the protection of
America's natural resources. In one of the oddest congressional
couplings in years, George Miller, a liberal conservationist from
California, and Don Young, a conservative property rights advocate
from Alaska, cobbled together a measure that would provide a
guaranteed financing stream of $2.8 billion annually for the
federal Land and Water Conservation Fund and other undernourished
conservation programs. The bill has flaws, and Senate support is
far from certain. But it is something on which the administration,
which also wants a permanent financing stream for conservation, can
build.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has other environmental obligations this year
besides land acquisition. The Environmental Protection Agency, for
example, needs to strengthen its regulations governing water
pollution originating on factory farms. It would be heartening _
astounding, actually _ if Clinton and Vice President Al Gore could
persuade Congress to pass one meaningful piece of legislation on
global warming. But a land legacy is clearly Clinton's best shot at
environmental posterity.

FRANCIS' BIGGEST FEAT IS GETTING A SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No one in his right mind expects British
heavyweight champion Julius Francis to beat Mike Tyson when they
meet on Jan. 29 in Manchester, England.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, 36, has lost to fighters who aren't good enough to spar
with the former two-time world champion and decent heavyweights,
such as John Ruiz, Zeljko Mavrovic and Vitali Klitschko, have torn
him apart.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fact he'll be climbing into the ring with boxing's
biggest name and make $500,000-plus for doing it is a remarkable
feat in itself for Francis.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years ago, he was a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tyson in Brooklyn, Francis grew up in a rough London
neighborhood and was reared from the age of 10 by foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   And, also like his opponent, he couldn't cope. He ended up a
street thug and spent half his adult life in prison, ``mostly for
fight-related things, confrontations with police.''
</P>
<P>
   He also could barely read and write, which didn't help his
prospects for a productive life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose that not everybody grows up having people they look
up to or aspire to be,'' he said during a recent telephone
conference call from England. ``I just went down a road that I
thought was good for me at the time. It landed me in a lot of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It landed me in the hospital. I've been shot, stabbed, in the
hospital, in prison. That was then, this is now. People may say
that I've turned my life around. It's part of growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis did grow up.
</P>
<P>
   He was last in prison in 1989, by which time he became
functionally literate and, he says, learned his lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, at 25, he walked into a gym for the first
time. He won a London amateur championship and then turned
professional at the relatively advanced age of 28.
</P>
<P>
   He evolved into a decent fighter. He moves fairly well for a man
his size _ 6-foot-2, about 240 pounds _ and has decent power,
although he's not exceptional in either regard.
</P>
<P>
   His record is solid: He's 21-7, with 11 knockouts. He's won
three in a row after back-to-back losses to Axel Schulz and
Klitschko.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he appears to be in over his head with Tyson _ which is
what the former champ's handlers had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has fought less than six full rounds in two fights since
he bit the ears of Evander Holyfield and lost his boxing license in
June of 1997. His handlers want to ease him into a big-money fight,
which means Francis is considered, and probably will be, an easy
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Francis promises one thing: He'll come to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one person in life to be afraid of, and that is
God. ...'' he said. ``I have seen guys that have crumbled against
Tyson. He has, or had, an aura of invincibility, but it has been
broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``... Whatever they say about Tyson, he's human.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, it's likely Francis' life will never be quite
the same.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, he's become an overnight star at home. He's
been bombarded with attention since the fight was announced, so
much so that he's had to train at a secluded military base in
suburban London.
</P>
<P>
   The fight, at MEN Stadium in Manchester, is sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demands of the British public and media were so intense we
had to get him away from it,'' said Frank Maloney, Francis'
manager. ``The most secure place we could find was a military base.
He's under lock and key.''
</P>
<P>
   An entirely different type of lock and key from that of a decade
ago, which is a testament to how far Francis has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in prison the last time in 1989,'' he said. ``I said
then that I would use my abilities as a fighter to make something
of myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where it got me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumb move, again: The only thing dumber than Felix Trinidad's
decision to forsake a rematch with Oscar De La Hoya was to do it
again.
</P>
<P>
   It was announced after negotiations broke down initially that
Trinidad would move up to 154 pounds and face David Reid in lieu of
a more lucrative rematch with De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   After that fight fell through, Trinidad had another chance to
make the rematch, but promoters Don King (Trinidad) and Bob Arum
(De La Hoya) again couldn't come to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Trinidad-Reid is back on for March 4 and who knows when _
or if _ a second Trinidad-De La Hoya fight will take place.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad would've earned an estimated $20 million against De La
Hoya. Against Reid, speculation is he'll make about $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   So why go with Reid?
</P>
<P>
   Because Arum, who believes rightly that his fighter remains the
bigger draw, refused to reverse terms of the first Trinidad-De La
Hoya fight, in which De La Hoya made an estimated $23 million to
Trinidad's $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   So, for the few million in dispute, Trinidad is willing to give
up a monster payday and the spotlight of a major rematch.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logic is not one of the strong suits in the boxing business,''
Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   Applause: Well, no one can accuse Lennox Lewis of ducking the
best contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The undisputed heavyweight champ is near a deal to defend his
titles against Michael Grant in a battle of giants on April 29 at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Some consider Grant the best heavyweight in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only want to fight the best, and out of all the people out
there, Grant is the most credible,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Grant isn't the !ital!only!off! credible opponent out
there.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was off base when he said: ``I want to fight Grant to give
the other organizations a chance to find a worthy man for me to
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   David Tua, the IBF's No. 1 contender and perhaps the most
fearsome fighter in the world, is plenty worthy and just might've
been deemed by Lewis and Co. to be too much of a threat.
</P>
<P>
   To keep his IBF belt, Lewis must face that organization's top
contender by November.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Police say they are still investigating an
accusation that Oscar De La Hoya raped a woman last month....
</P>
<P>
   Former lightweight champion Rafael Ruelas of Studio City could
face fast-rising Hector Camacho Jr. in March, according to his
promoter, Dan Goossen.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen was considering the bout for the Tyson-Francis card....
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Cedric Kushner announced he will stage his monthly
all-heavyweight series, ``Heavyweight Explosion,'' solely at New
York City's Manhattan Center.
</P>
<P>
   The next card, on Jan. 27, features a bout between Kirk Johnson
and Monte Barrett on Jan. 27....
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight Lawrence Clay-Bey, a 1996 Olympian, has recovered
from a hand injury and will fight Terrence Lewis on Jan. 23 in
Venice, Fla. on Fox Sports Net.

<P>
   Clay-Bey (10-0, 8 KOs) has fought only once since April of 1998
because of injuries. In his last fight, last August, he outpointed
Dale Crowe....
</P>
<P>
   Undefeated welterweight contender Vernon Forrest will face
veteran Vince Phillips in a 12-round bout on Jan. 22 in Las Vegas.
In the main event, Shane Mosley of Pomona will face Willy Wise.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Forrest's first appearance on HBO.

THE GENERAL, THE RIVER, THE FAMOUS BOAT RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM McDONALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A&AMP;E and Columbia TriStar Television recreate George Washington's
crossing of the Delaware Monday night, and the first thing you
should know about the movie ``The Crossing'' is whether it has the
father of our country standing in his boat or sitting.
</P>
<P>
   This is no small matter. The moment is a hallowed one in the
American saga, after all, and in reimagining it the difference
between standing and sitting is the difference between myth and
history. It's the difference between the iconography of the
19th-century artist Emanuel Leutze, who gave us the famously
fanciful image of Washington standing resolutely and a bit
precariously at the prow, and the scholarship of 20th-century
historians who have tried to paint a truer picture of Washington as
``a fallible human being made of flesh and blood and spirit _ not a
statue of marble and wood,'' as the biographer James Thomas Flexner
put it.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two camps, the one in which this movie falls is made
pretty clear long before it gets to the title scene; and when it
does, the treatment is happily restrained. In the dead of night,
launching a desperate expedition to surprise a Hessian garrison in
Trenton on Christmas Day 1776 and salvage the Revolution in its
darkest hour, Washington, played implacably by Jeff Daniels, climbs
into his boat and, for the rest of trip, sits. Ramrod straight, to
be sure, but he sits.
</P>
<P>
   That still leaves the question of how to breath life into him,
statue or not. And the film, directed by Robert Harmon (who also
directed ``Gotti''), would seem as if it should be up to the
challenge, for this is an intelligent, handsome and sometimes
bracing production. But try as it might to chip away at the marble
image of Washington, it only scratches the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels is a likable actor, probably no more so than when he
enlists his hangdog look in the service of deadpan, goofball
comedy, as he did as the smarter half of ``Dumb and Dumber.'' (Or
was he the other one?) There was also something agreeable about him
in his rousing turn as Col. Joshua Chamberlain in the Civil War
epic ``Gettysburg.''
</P>
<P>
   But in ``The Crossing,'' whatever anguish this Washington is
going through _ and we're asked to believe it's considerable _ is
more hinted at than shown. Daniels offers a sympathetic portrait,
but his expression generally remains as impenetrable as the one on
the dollar bill.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Fast, who wrote the novel on which the film is based, may
have understood the problem of Washington as leading man when he
decided to tell the story as much through the colorful figure of
Col. John Glover. He was the flinty commander of the Marblehead
Fishermen, the Massachusetts unit that piloted the boats across the
Delaware. And here, cast in the part, Sebastian Roche is suitably
scrappy. Indeed, the supporting players are the most convincing, in
particular John Henry Canavan as Gen. Henry Knox, a withering
skeptic on the American side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your troops always go in one direction,'' he haughtily tells
Washington at an officers' dinner. ``To attack requires the other
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is built, of course, on a foregone conclusion, but it
manages to maintain tension to such a degree that you begin to
wonder if Washington really will pull off what the history books
say happened. And the crossing itself is vividly depicted and
evocatively photographed _ the boats ferrying their huddled cargo
cut across the screen in silhouette through a blue mist _ without
the patriotic bombast that a schmaltzier film would drum up.
</P>
<P>
   The scene's understatement underlines the movie's faithfulness
to the facts. Minimizing the sort of expository dialogue common to
historical dramas, the film quickly sketches the Continental Army's
predicament. Defeated by the British at every turn, Washington's
army of 20,000 has been reduced to fewer than 2,000 and driven from
New York into Pennsylvania. Food, clothing and munitions are just
about gone. The men are freezing. The Continental Congress is
threatening to cut off money.
</P>
<P>
   Washington decides to go for broke and attack and turn the tide.
A man of stone? Not likely. In the end, it is in his boldness and
resolve, amply displayed here, that the truest picture of the man
emerges, even if the inner fire isn't visible on the screen.  &QL;

ART REVIEW: THE MAN WHO HELPED MODERNISM TAKE ROOT
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One way to ease happily into the new era is to
peruse ``Renoir to Rothko: The Eye of Duncan Phillips,'' a survey
of art mostly from the past century. The Phillips Collection, the
country's first museum of modern art, on the corner of 21st and Q
Streets here, is paying its founder lavish posthumous tribute with
this museumwide exhibition of 350 works, which remains on view
through Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Hurry, before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone who loves modern art already knows at least
something about the beloved Phillips Collection, but the show comes
at a useful moment, reminding people of Phillips' contribution at a
time when ``Sensation'' at the Brooklyn Museum of Art reignited the
usual antagonisms toward collectors of new art. Charles Saatchi's
extravaganza encouraged the suspicion that contemporary art
collecting is just a form of insider trading buoyed by hype, which
it can be, of course. But ``Renoir to Rothko'' nicely modifies this
perception by stressing that our national cultural heritage also
depends on rare patrons like Phillips (1886-1966). His evangelical
involvement with new art during the first half of the 20th century,
combined with his generosity, created what has become through
several generations an indispensable American institution.
</P>
<P>
   It has been indispensable partly because it has remained
intimate. Intimacy is an increasingly rare commodity in this age of
expanding museums and megacrowds, but even after a few expansions
of its own the Phillips Collection has managed to retain the
ambience of a home, which it was when Phillips founded it in 1921
in several rooms of the neo-Georgian pile where he grew up.
``Instead of the academic grandeur of marble halls and stairways
and miles of chairless spaces, with low standards and popular
attractions to draw the crowds,'' he wrote, ``we plan to try the
effect of domestic architecture, of rooms small or at least
livable.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of us are fortunate enough to live in places the size of
Phillips' house, so small and livable are relative terms. But the
idea of spaces at least cozier than most museum galleries was
crucial to the notion of a museum that would be a ``joy-giving,
life-enhancing influence, assisting people to see beautifully as
true artists see'': the sort of phrase that sounds fatuous coming
from other culturati but in Phillips' case has the ring of truth.
</P>
<P>
   Art was truly joy-giving to Phillips, or, to be precise, the art
he loved was joyous, meaning that he embraced painters like Renoir,
Cezanne, Matisse and Bonnard (at a time when Bonnard was
unfashionable, by the way), and he kept a distance from artists
whose works were dark, ironic, subversive or dry.
</P>
<P>
   Dada, Surrealism and Pop were out for him. So he didn't collect
Duchamp or Warhol, although it happened that Duchamp arranged the
donation to Phillips of works by Mondrian and Kandinsky that were
part of the legacy of the great American modern art collector
Katherine Dreier, and Phillips did want one work by Duchamp that
ended up going to the Museum of Modern Art. Reflecting both his
inclination toward pleasure over anxiety and the integrity of his
taste, Phillips also preferred Braque to Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   There is a difference, Phillips understood, between pleasure and
mindless amusement: Art can be both complicated and pleasing to
look at, as is the case with artists like Cezanne. Phillips was
clearly not looking for escapist entertainment when he bought
difficult pictures like Matisse's ``Studio, Quai St.-Michel.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was rejecting the idea that modern art had to be
rebarbative to be serious, a point that many young artists today,
looking to move beyond the preachifying and prickly styles of the
earlier 1990s in favor of more visual pleasure, would certainly
agree with. ``Renoir to Rothko'' is a timely show in that sense: It
dovetails with a gradual shift in contemporary art toward visual
satisfaction, however peculiarly expressed it may sometimes be.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, which fills every corner of the rambling museum,
begins with Giorgione, El Greco, Chardin, Constable and Ingres,
historical soil from which sprung the modernists Phillips admired.
Born into old money, Yale educated, he clearly had enough social
standing and confidence not to worry about what other people
thought.
</P>
<P>
   He believed that modernism did not break definitively with the
past but was on a continuum that included American artists. So,
ignoring standard opinion, he not only bought underappreciated
Europeans like Bonnard but also embraced living Americans while
they were still considered provincial.
</P>
<P>
   As a result his collection rivaled Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney's
in terms of artists like Albert Pinkham Ryder, Rockwell Kent,
Arthur Dove, John Sloan, Charles Burchfield, John Marin, Arthur B.
Davies, Marsden Hartley and Stuart Davis, leading Americans of the
first half of the century who in turn established the historical
framework for later Americans in the collection like Mark Rothko,
Morris Graves and Richard Diebenkorn.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips established his own history of art. The essential
linking principles were classicism, lyricism, spirituality and
color. Spirituality connected Kandinsky and Klee with Georges
Rouault, Rothko and Graves. Classicism tied Chardin to Cezanne and
Cezanne to Matisse and Matisse to Diebenkorn. A quality of humane
decency also linked other artists, including painters like Joseph
Solman and Karl Knaths and Horace Pippin and Jacob Lawrence.
Phillips was the first major collector to endorse Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious throughout the exhibition that Phillips loved
painters who loved painting as much as he did. Craft, the finesse
of pigment on canvas, was the crux of art to him, and it was
irrelevant to him that his collection was not comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   The famous story is that as a young art critic seeing Matisse,
Cezanne and van Gogh for the first time at the 1913 Armory Show he
expressed total revulsion. His conversion to modernism and his
eventual endorsement of these artists therefore demonstrated a
gradual, independent and authentic evolution of thought.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' genius during the years immediately after the Armory
Show, the realization that still should mean the most to people who
look at new art, was to keep his eyes open. He belonged to the
extraordinary generation of American patron-missionaries that
included Dreier, Whitney, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller and Albert
Barnes. They established a foothold for modernist art. Phillips was
a prince among them.
</P>
<P>
   We are still learning to see through his eyes.

QUESTIONS CAN'T BE OVERLOOKED; MCCAIN RAISES DOUBTS BUT NOT FATAL
ONES

<P>
   PHOENIX _ For months, conventional-thinking campaign theorists
have wondered when _ not if _ the laws of presidential-aspirant
averages would fall on John McCain's head.
</P>
<P>
   They wondered when his delirious spate of ``positive'' profiles
churned by the national media would turn a corner and ``go
negative,'' as they say in the biz. It always does, they say.
</P>
<P>
   They wondered when the famous temper would do him in. Or when
the inevitability of George W. Bush's $70 million would cause
reality to set in and bring McCain's giddy ride to an end.
</P>
<P>
   They're still waiting. In the meantime, though, the Arizona
senator's presidential aspirations have hit a serious bump that's
arisen from a seemingly unlikely source: questionable campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's most ardent _ indeed, most righteous _ advocate for
campaign finance reform now must defend himself against charges of
having browbeaten a federal agency on behalf of corporations whose
employees gave thousands of dollars to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence surfacing against McCain are letters he wrote
as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to the Federal
Communications Commission arguing for action on a case involving
Paxson Communications Corp., whose president, Lowell Paxson, is a
major donor to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Also under scrutiny now are McCain's actions on behalf of some
of the regional ``Bell'' telephone companies, whose employees were
among the senator's top contributors for his 1998 re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has deemed his conduct ``entirely appropriate,'' and
contends he was just trying to prod into action one of Washington's
most notoriously pokey bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's semi-religious advocacy for reform of campaign
finance has made it inevitable that such actions would be weighed
against such contributions. John McCain has created an expectation
that his standards should be higher than those of others.
</P>
<P>
   The people raising the ugly spectre of the Charles Keating
Affair are not entirely off the mark. McCain was the least culpable
of the five senators. But his family flew in Charlie Keating's
plane to Charlie Keating's island after he took Charlie Keating's
campaign money. Now he is under the gun for using the corporate
jets of campaign contributors after arguing their cases before
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Even the comments from the FCC bureaucrats are reminiscent of
the Keating mess. Despite McCain's insistence that he was
interested only in prodding the process to a conclusion, FCC
officials told the ``Boston Globe'' last week that they got the
chairman's message and acceded to Paxson's wishes. Federal Home
Loan Bank Board officials expressed a similar sense of intimidation
to the Senate Ethics Committee in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Even McCain's reaction to this electoral crisis - throwing open
his correspondence files for all to see - is reminiscent of his
extraordinary Keating-era press conference at which he vowed to
respond to reporters' questions till they ran dry.
</P>
<P>
   That given, this is not Keating Redux. It is, in fact, McCain's
duty as chairman of the Commerce Committee to occasionally kick
agency butt. The FCC had delayed the Paxson decision for more than
700 days. And, in all, it received more than 25,000 letters from
members of Congress over the past three years, many no doubt
sternly worded.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the broader question of whether it is reasonable
to hold McCain to some mystical higher standard of ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions affecting virtually all of American industry are
weighed before McCain's Commerce Committee. It was inevitable that
determined researchers would unearth evidence of ``hypocrisy'' by
McCain, known in some circles as ``Senator Sanctimony.'' Left
untilled, however, is evidence of McCain actions and decisions that
run contrary to the wishes of his campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's life, public and military, is one marked by
astonishing resiliency. In view of what has come before, it is hard
to envision this event _ by itself _ as the one that done him in. &QL;

RICHARDS-GEBAUR STANDS AS MONUMENT TO COLD WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At Richards-Gebaur Memorial Airport stands a
reasonable facsimile of a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps four stories tall, the massive cube of concrete was
Kansas City's version of Cheyenne Mountain, the Colorado Springs
headquarters of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or
NORAD. Full of computer equipment, the structure housed the early
warning systems for much of the United States and Canada during the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Today the building houses BTM Inc., or Belton Tool and Machine,
a manufacturing business.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains a relic from the Cold War of what once was
Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:59 p.m. Sunday, Richards-Gebaur closed as an airport. It
is to become an intermodal freight hub, where the Kansas City
Southern Railway will transfer cargo between trains and trucks for
shipment elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The airport and surrounding property, however, will always
represent a monument to the tension between the Soviet Union and
the United States in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cold War was the only reason for the base being there,''
said Dick McMahon, an Air Force veteran who flew out of the base
for years and was the Air Force's civilian airfield manager there
from 1984 through 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the year after the Cuban Missile crisis, the base was
home to 3,500 active duty military personnel. About 800 civilians
also worked there.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way.
</P>
<P>
   When Kansas City began buying land on the site in the early
1940s, the original idea was to build an auxiliary municipal
airport. It was there, in 1951, that many commercial airliners came
to land after the Downtown Airport was closed during that year's
ruinous flood.
</P>
<P>
   Given the times, however, military needs generally dictated.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1944, the Army air force began using what was then
known as Grandview Airport. But the fate of the site changed after
the summer of 1950, when North Korean troops crossed the 38th
parallel and invaded South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Some six months later, the Air Force announced plans to
establish the Central Air Defense at the airfield. The growth of
Soviet long-range aviation in the late 1940s, along with the test
of a Soviet atomic device in 1949, united Canada and the United
States under the threat of nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest officers of the Kansas City command, which then
served as the eyes and ears for about 20 states, worked from a
downtown office building.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1954, the command had moved to the airfield and added a
unit of fighter jet pilots trained in rapid deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Soon surrounding residents learned about sonic booms. The threat
of foreign attack and the need for jet interceptor aircraft that
could achieve supersonic speed was still a novelty to many.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Stuart Symington of Missouri, during a November 1955
ceremony dedicating the airfield as a permanent Air Force base,
sought to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``No longer is it the musket over the fireplace,'' said
Symington, a former Air Force secretary. ``Rather it is the roar of
the modern jet which symbolizes our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 the field received its current name, in honor of two
area pilots who died in combat _ one in World War I, the other
during the Korean War. About 600 units of nearby base housing were
completed by 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 the base began flying the Canadian flag, in observance
of those members of the Canadian military who helped staff the
local NORAD contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Richards-Gebaur wasn't all dedicated to early warning and
fighter interceptors. Many associate the base with the long history
of the 442nd, a reserve troop carrier wing which for years operated
out of the base.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961 President John F. Kennedy activated the 442nd, calling
approximately 1,500 members to regular duty. The act was
precipitated by the construction of the Berlin Wall, which
prevented residents of Communist East Berlin from fleeing to the
western part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The 442nd, many of its members from the Kansas City area, spent
much of the next 10 months ferrying men and equipment. At
demobilization ceremonies the following August, an officer told the
442nd that its active service had ``vastly increased our deterrent
power in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   And though they served half a world away from Berlin, the 442nd
still suffered losses. Seven men died in the December 1961 crash of
a C-124 Globemaster, a troop and cargo carrier which experienced
engine trouble soon after taking off from Richards-Gebaur.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Grubaugh of Ozark, Mo., who commanded the seven men and
visited family members that night, still considers the men Cold War
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those men were very special,'' said Grubaugh. ``I still feel
they are part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorial bearing the names of the seven stands at
Richards-Gebaur. For several years the 442nd Air Force Reserve
Association has organized a ceremony remembering them; the most
recent was held last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll keep doing this until no more of us are left,'' said Joe
Blair, association president.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the base's history, the military prided itself on
being a good neighbor to the nearby civilian communities. The
Richards-Gebaur Base Community Council formed in 1960 with members
from many surrounding cities.
</P>
<P>
   Another act of civilian outreach was the organization of air
shows, which continued into the 1990s. The first air shows date to
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Once the federal government began its gradual pullout from the
property, Kansas City tried to return to its original idea of
operating an auxiliary municipal airport. However, in recent years
the city lost an estimated $1.3 million annually doing so, and city
leaders soon grew enamored of the idea of a freight hub at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   Last August Kansas City voters approved the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, some area residents with longtime ties to the
base are defiant in regard to the pending change in the facility's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, opponents of the freight hub went to federal
court in an attempt to stop the project.
</P>
<P>
   The intermodal facility won't chase out the Richards-Gebaur
Composite Squadron of the Civil Air Patrol. Chartered in 1964, the
squadron has spent most of its years on the base. Despite the
apparent transition of Richards-Gebaur from airport to freight hub,
its members will continue to meet in a building near the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be keeping the name,'' said Gary Gregory, squadron
commander. ``We will not let it die.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the site should retain its current names is
questionable for relatives of Lt. Col. Arthur W. Gebaur, a pilot
who died during the Korean War. That's especially so if the
facility becomes a freight hub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine why they would want to leave the name on that
facility,'' said Linda Manichia, a Kansas City niece of Gebaur.
``My family feels that would be inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Gebaur and Lt. John F. Richards, she said, ``were
aviators and war heroes. That really doesn't correspond with a
train-truck hub.''

TALE OF TWO BUDGETS: KANSAS, MISSOURI FACE SEPARATE REALITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK AND WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Out in front of business executive Barry
Seward's home, State Line Road resembles any busy metropolitan
thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant suburban houses dot both sides of the street.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, which side of the street those houses stand on is
significant, the result of goings-on at the Missouri and Kansas
state Capitols.
</P>
<P>
   It's an issue of money in your pocket, an example of how things
can operate so differently in adjacent states.
</P>
<P>
   Seward lives and works east of State Line, in Missouri. He can
expect a special tax refund from the state this year, thanks to the
Hancock Amendment. He may also benefit from proposed new tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   If he lived and worked west of State Line, in Kansas, he could
forget about treats. No special tax refund. No new tax cuts either.
Kansas will reduce planned spending and consider a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   What in the name of politics is going on here?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Missouri phenomenon,'' said Seward, who lives near
Rockhurst High School and follows the vagaries of state government
in his job with a health-care company.
</P>
<P>
   One such phenomenon is the Hancock Amendment, approved by voters
in 1980, which requires refunds to Missouri taxpayers if government
revenue grows too fast. Kansas has no such law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the economy in both states has performed well. Seward,
despite his knowledge of government, can't fully explain the
financial variations across State Line Road. He's hardly alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the heck can they be out of money?'' asked Missouri Rep.
Tom Hoppe, a Kansas City Democrat whose district borders Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Kansas share the same question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are befuddled,'' said Kansas Rep. David Adkins of
Leawood, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, whose
district borders Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   His nutshell response: ``The Legislature has not exercised
sufficient discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   A fuller explanation begins in the 1990s, when the economy in
both states boomed. Missouri basked in an unprecedented wave of
prosperity for six years. Kansas saw tax money flow in beyond all
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri expects $6.9 billion of general revenue for the year
ending June 30, up from $4.4 billion in 1993. Kansas expects $4.2
billion, up from $2.9 billion in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   With so much money available, legislators and governors of both
states distributed the riches. State programs won more dollars. Tax
cut after tax cut won approval.
</P>
<P>
   There, Kansas and Missouri diverged.
</P>
<P>
   In Jefferson City, Mo., state government prosperity continues.
</P>
<P>
   Tax reductions totaling $650 million have been approved for
three consecutive years. Last year, Missouri taxpayers received a
$200 million tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock Amendment refunds totaled $874 million the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the good times stem from growth in the stock market,
said Mark Ward, state budget director. Capital gains revenue for
the state doubled in one year, he said. Unemployment is at a record
low.
</P>
<P>
   Excess revenue remains. A $98 million Hancock Amendment refund
is planned for late this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some lawmakers are pushing for a new tax cut. Numerous
bills already have been filed by Democrats and Republicans alike to
trim property, income and other taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In Topeka, Kan., state government finds itself in a bind.
</P>
<P>
   The state budget has been soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on programs financed by general tax revenue jumped 7.4
percent in 1998 and 10.5 percent in 1999. Under the original budget
for this year, spending would have risen an additional 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy, though still healthy and growing moderately,
isn't booming like a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Projections of future state tax revenue proved overly
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Tax reductions will leave residents and businesses with roughly
$600 million more than they otherwise would have had this year.
That's money no longer available to the state budget. Also, the
reductions returned a little more money to taxpayers than
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1999, it was clear that trouble lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spending more than we're taking in,'' said budget
director Duane Goossen.
</P>
<P>
   Without action, a year-end reserve fund, which needs to be at
least $300 million to keep the budget operating smoothly, wouldn't
be large enough, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state doesn't face catastrophe. Spending this year still may
exceed last year's.
</P>
<P>
   But budget reductions will top the agenda when the Legislature
convenes today. A few lawmakers have proposed tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   How all this happened sparks disagreement among legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Rep. Phill Kline, a Shawnee, Kan., Republican who was a
leading advocate of tax cuts in the 1990s: ``The revenue
projections were off.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Senate President Dick Bond of Overland Park, Kan., a
moderate Republican: ``We cut taxes too much.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Tim Huelskamp of Fowler, Kan., a leader of conservative
Republicans: ``Some legislators and bureaucrats have been blaming
tax cuts for the state's fiscal difficulties. The real culprit,
though, is the enormous spending increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Missouri, legislators want to avoid the same pitfalls.
Warnings about the good times slowing down can be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope,'' said Senate President Pro Tem Ed Quick of Liberty,
Mo., ``we don't put ourselves in the same position as Kansas.''
