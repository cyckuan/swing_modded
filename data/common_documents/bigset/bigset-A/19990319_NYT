EDITORIAL: OLYMPIC MINIMALISTS

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 19:
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Olympic movement should create an event for those
who excel at just getting by. If it did, Juan Antonio Samaranch,
president of the International Olympic Committee, surely would have
won a gold medal this week. Despite his declaration of victory over
bribery and corruption at the close of the organization's meeting
Thursday, the actions and reforms ratified were quite meager.
</P>
<P>
   True, there was some progress. Six IOC members who had taken
bribes were defrocked, and site selection for the 2006 Olympics was
insulated from corruption by creating an impartial panel to pick
two finalists for the full IOC to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   But Samaranch, who has presided over the mess, declined to
resign and instead orchestrated an overwhelming vote of confidence
from the committee he has largely assembled. His minions punted
when the IOC agenda turned to lasting reform that can prevent
another outbreak like the $1 million bribery machine that helped
Salt Lake City win the 2002 Winter Games. The meeting merely
approved plans to create an ethics commission, to be appointed by
Samaranch, and a structural reform body, to be headed by Samaranch,
raising doubts about how vigorously and independently either body
will perform. Only a few members of either body have been named,
suggesting no great haste to get started.
</P>
<P>
   Crafting measures that bring transparency in business dealings,
accountability and democracy in decision-making should not be an
arduous task. These bodies ought to have their recommendations
ready for the IOC's June meeting in Seoul. This meeting will also
provide an appropriate moment for Samaranch, long a coddler of the
ethically impaired, to make a graceful exit.

area, laced together with bridges and freeways. On the road maps,

COUNTY ATTORNEY QUITS JAILHOUSE DEATH INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 and RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley on Thursday
removed himself from the investigation of the jailhouse death of
Scott Norberg, saying he faced a conflict of interest because of
reports that he was targeted by a Sheriff's Office surveillance
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Romley also claimed that misconduct by a former aide who now
works for the sheriff had compromised his work on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who long has called for his bitter political
rival to withdraw from the Norberg case, welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``My employees and I are thrilled that the county attorney will
not oversee this investigation,'' Arpaio said. ``Finally, we will
be treated fairly by a professional and impartial investigative
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jack McIntyre, the former deputy county attorney
cited by Romley, denied Romley's claim that he had acted improperly
by advising the Sheriff's Office in the aftermath of Norberg's
death.
</P>
<P>
   In a hastily called news conference, Romley added fuel to
published reports that Arpaio had a squad of investigators conduct
surveillance on important figures in the Norberg probe, including
Romley.
</P>
<P>
   Romley noted that those reports in ``The Arizona Republic''
``have put me in the position of being the victim of potentially
criminal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that in recent days, ``A significant amount of
information has been provided to my office possibly corroborating
these allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Romley refused to elaborate, turning aside reporters' questions
and saying he would turn the information over to the federal
investigators who have agreed to take over the Norberg
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic'' reported March 6 that federal investigators are
probing whether Arpaio ordered surveillance on foes in the Norberg
case, including Romley.
</P>
<P>
   The story was based on information from Steve Barnes, president
of the Deputy Law Enforcement Association, who said several
sheriff's deputies told him they were assigned to investigate
Arpaio enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio initially called the report ``a product of a vile and
bizarre imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Thursday's developments, federal
investigators now will have complete responsibility for the
investigation into allegations that the Sheriff's Office and the
county medical examiner cov ered up jailers' brutality in Norberg's
1996 death.
</P>
<P>
   Norberg died in a restraint chair after battling with detention
officers.
</P>
<P>
   One officer, Kimberly Walsh, said under oath that two officers
ignored her warnings that Norberg could not breathe and continued
to force his chin into his chest until he turned blue, kicked
spasmodically and died.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner determined that the death was the
accidental result of ``positional asphyxia.'' An internal
investigation by the Sheriff's Office exonerated the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio has consistently defended his detention officers, even in
the face of January's $8.25 million settlement of the Norberg
family's federal lawsuit against the county, Arpaio and the
detention officers.
</P>
<P>
   Romley said many questions about Norberg's death remain
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common sense would tell you that when the county pays out
$8.25 million dollars in a wrongful-death suit, there must have
been some problems surrounding the death of Scott Norberg,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the $8.25 million was paid by the insurer for the
county. Taxpayers, however, picked up a $1 million lawyers' tab in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Romley had resisted Arpaio's demands that he
withdraw from the investigation. Arpaio claimed that because the
county attorney has represented the Sheriff's Office in more than
150 lawsuits, personnel matters and business dealings, Romley
should declare a conflict of interest in the Norberg case.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio on Thursday bitterly complained that Romley had ``held my
detention officers hostage for three years'' after Norberg's death.
</P>
<P>
   Romley said a major factor in his decision to withdraw was
information he received last week about the conduct of MacIntyre,
the former deputy county attorney, in the aftermath of Norberg's
death in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Romley said that shortly after Norberg died, he directed that
his office would not represent Arpaio in the civil suit they were
expecting in the case. But MacIntyre disobeyed that order and
``continued to communicate with representatives of the Sheriff's
Office about the Norberg case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. MacIntyre's conduct has created an appearance of conflict
of interest which has the potential of undermining public
confidence in the investigation,'' Romley said.
</P>
<P>
   At a rebuttal news conference late Thursday, McIntyre said he
did give broad legal advice to deputies, who came to him terrified
about the prospect of criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent they would ask how the trial would progress,
what was possible, what was feasible, they had no other place to
turn,'' McIntyre said. ``Rick Romley was fully aware of that.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre said senior staffers knew that he was still being
peppered with questions from deputies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was recognized . . . that members of the county Sheriff's
Office were being left out to dry and needed some legal advice in
this arena,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Norberg death must be investigated,'' said Romley, whose
personal feud with Arpaio has been sharpened by the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``No investigation can be effective, however, if it is conducted
under a cloud of doubt and suspicion. Personalities and animosities
must not be permitted to interfere with the only appropriate
objective _ a fair and thorough investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Romley's withdrawal from the investigation makes it unlikely
that it will be wrapped up by the end-of-May deadline he
established two months ago. But Romley complained Arpaio had
continuously sought to frustrate his his investigators with
``obstacles and roadblocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the U.S. Attorney's Office said Thursday that
they would not respond to questions about the resources that would
be dedicated to the investigation and a possible timetable for its
completion.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, U.S. Attorney Jose de Jesus Rivera issued a prepared
statement that had more sentiment than substance:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long-standing tradition of cooperative law enforcement
in this district, and in order to serve the best interests of the
public, the U.S. Attorney's Office has agreed to assume full
responsibility for the civil rights investigation into the death of
Scott Norberg.'' &QL;

GONZAGA NIPS FLORIDA, 73-72 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ To make the final eight of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament, a team's origin matters little.
And it certainly isn't in the name.
</P>
<P>
   What is required is size in the low post and quickness on the
perimeter. A hot hand helps, and multiple defenses will have an
impact. Riding the wave of emotion is crucial, and seizing the
moment matters. And then there is luck. A nice, game-ending dose
will do.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga has got it.
</P>
<P>
   The team zigged and zagged its way into the final eight on
Thursday night at America West Arena, combining an array of
ingredients into a 73-72 victory over Florida. Gonzaga (28-6) will
play Saturday against the Connecticut-Iowa winner to determine the
West Regional champion and entrant into the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular finish won it for Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs took a 69-69 game with 1 minute 12 seconds
remaining and rode the wave. Guard Matt Santangelo had made 1 of 2
free throws to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   Then Greg Stolt of Florida made a searing 3-pointer with 45.7
seconds left to give Florida a 72-69 lead. With 42.5 seconds left,
Gonzaga called a timeout. The Bulldogs tried to run a play, were
trapped, and called another timeout. There were 27.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga center Jeremy Eaton made a layup out of that timeout,
cutting Florida's lead to 72-71. As Florida inbounded the ball to
center Ben Wright, there was luck for Gonzaga, a nice, game-ending
dose. Wright traveled, and the ball went back to Gonzaga with 15.4
seconds left. Gonzaga guard Quentin Hall drove toward the basket
and missed a shot from inside the lane. The sophomore forward Casey
Calvary leapt into the air, stretching and tapping and scoring a
putback basket. Gonzaga, 73-72.
</P>
<P>
   In the final, frantic four seconds, Florida tried a desperation
shot, but no luck there. This game was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga has got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable,'' Calvary said. ``We've dreamed about
this since we were little, and now that we're there, we have to
take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvary finished with 12 points. Forward Richie Frahm scored 17,
14 in a second-half shooting spree. Stolt scored 16 for Florida and
Wright 15 as the Gators' season ended with a 22-9 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just hurts inside that I let the team down,'' Wright said,
referring to his travel. ``It's just real sad. I thought the ref
gave me a timeout, but it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga shot 45.4 percent in the game and Florida shot 43.3
percent. Gonzaga scored 12 3-pointers, doubling Florida's total.
The second half ended in a 38-38 tie. Gonzaga squeaked by in points
in the first half and that helped provide the winning margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has great character and they are great kids,'' Coach
Dan Monson of Gonzaga said. ``There are a lot of teams at home with
better basketball ability, but we get through that with chemistry
and character.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga opened hot and Florida began cold.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the half, the roles were reversed. Little
wonder that Gonzaga led by only 35-34 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening tip, it was apparent that Gonzaga possessed the
bigger front line. Gonzaga built leads of 11-8, 21-13 and 26-13.
Gonzaga missed a few layups and short jumpers along the way that
could have pushed its lead further. The team compensated, however,
by exhibiting crisp, sure passing (10 assists) and by cutting,
slicing and passing its way for enough shots that found their way
into the basket.
</P>
<P>
   It was a 26-13 game with 6:46 left in the half. Gonzaga made it
that score when center Jeremy Eaton grabbed a blocked shot and
scored on a put-back. A second center, Axel Dench (7 points), and
Santangelo (6 points) led Gonzaga in scoring in the first half.
Santagelo, along with guard Quentin Hall, despite his five
turnovers, kept pushing the ball up the floor for the Bulldogs and
running the offense, assuring their team open looks.
</P>
<P>
   Florida appeared in trouble, down by 13 and reeling in floor
shooting. The team had scored its 13th point with 9:07 remaining in
the half and did not score again until 5:13 remained on a Eddie
Shannon layup. From that point, Florida changed the game in two
ways: it opted for a zone defense and forced Gonzaga to miss a
flurry of jumpers, and then the Gators began, finally, to sink a
few of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Stolt scorched a 16-footer. A steal, a layup, more misses from
Gonzaga against the zone and more Florida scores. A string of
baskets for Florida. More misses for Gonzaga. The roles were
reversing.
</P>
<P>
   There was 3:52 left in the half when center Ben Wright broke
free on a fast break, pulled up inside the free-throw line and
tossed in a jump shot. That quickly, Florida was within 26-22.
There was 3:11 left when Wright made two free throws. That tied it
at 27-27. Florida had climbed back, with Wright leading all scorers
in the half with 9 points. &QL;

GONZAGA CONTINUES MAGICAL RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ They have no McDonald's All-Americans. They have one
player taller than 6-foot-8. They come from a small conference,
play in a small arena and, before last week, had never won an NCAA
Tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no more doubts about the Gonzaga Bulldogs, not
anymore, because Thursday night they moved one step from the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Casey Calvary's last-second tip-in gave the Bulldogs a
73-72 Sweet 16 victory over Florida in front of 17,975 at America
West Arena, the largest crowd ever to watch a college basketball
game in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who play Connecticut on Saturday for the West
Regional title, could join No. 11 Louisiana State (1986) as the
only double-digit seed to make the Final Four. Win or lose,
however, they've accomplished their year-long mission to prove the
NCAA selection committee wrong for rejecting their at-large bid
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been calling us a Cinderella team,'' Calvary said.
``And to the media and the rest of the nation, it looks that way.
But in our eyes, it doesn't mean a thing. We just won another game.
That's the way we look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   After easily dispatching No. 7 Minnesota, stunning No. 2
Stanford and rallying to beat No. 6 Florida, the Bulldogs have left
no doubt about their qualifications as an Elite Eight entry. They
are skilled, unselfish, quietly confident and immaculately coached
by Dan Monson, whose father, Don, guided Idaho to the West Regional
semifinals 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No surviving team, including Duke, runs its offense with more
patience and precision than the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of teams at home with better basketball
ability,'' Monson said. ``We got through with great chemistry and
character. All of these kids have two parents in their homes.
They're all stable. They're good kids with great character.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida took a 72-69 lead with 46 seconds left on Greg Stolt's
3-pointer from the right wing. The Bulldogs countered with Jeremy
Eaton's layup with 15 seconds left, setting up the decisive
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   It began when Gonzaga guard Quentin Hall's harassing defense
forced Florida center Brent Wright into a backcourt traveling
violation. After a timeout, Hall missed a 14-foot leaner from the
right side. Calvary charged from the foul line, jumped over Wright
and converted a two-handed tip with 4.4 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous to get that shot off, but the ball just came my
way,'' Calvary said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida guard Eddie Shannon dribbled downcourt and launched a
23-footer as the buzzer sounded. It hit the rim and bounced away as
the Bulldogs swarmed Calvary near midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   A tournament with myriad upsets but few close finishes finally
had a game to hang its buzzer on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what March Madness is all about,'' Monson said.

ALL SIGNS POINT TO SOUTHWEST MISSOURI-DUKE MATCH-UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BLAIR KERKHOFF  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ There's this guy, Marty Prather. Everybody in
town knows him. He's the pizza guy because he co-owns the Domino's
franchises in town. And he's Southwest Missouri State University's
biggest fan because he doesn't miss an event.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, he's the sign guy.
</P>
<P>
   Every game at the Hammons Student Center, Prather is there with
his signs. He has a quip for every player and usually a jab at the
opponent. One of his favorite moments this season was when coach
Billy Tubbs brought Texas Christian to town just before Christmas.
Prather broke out a ``Tele-Tubby'' sign, with a Tubbs photograph
over Tinky Winky's face. The TCU players broke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was before all the Falwell stuff,'' Prather said of
the denouncement of the children's TV show character in a
publication of the Rev. Jerry Falwell. ``That might have made
SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a strange week in Springfield. A foot of snow dropped
on Sunday and by Tuesday it was 70 degrees. The women's basketball
team is out of the tournament and the men live on.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears are playing in the NCAA tournament regional
semifinals, better known as the Sweet 16, against Duke today. A
Southwest Missouri State victory against the Blue Devils is almost
out of the question. Duke is the tournament's prohibitive favorite.
</P>
<P>
   But getting this far was just as improbable for the Bears,
according to the men on the selection committee. As a No. 12 seed,
Southwest Missouri was one of the final teams invited, and from
their position on the bracket the Bears were given little chance to
defeat first-round opponent Wisconsin, the fifth seed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears won 43-32 in one of the great defensive performances
in tournament history. Next up was fourth-seeded Tennessee.
Southwest Missouri won in a romp, 81-51.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can say that the winner of this game has to be
favored to win it all,'' said Prather, who is planning a sign to
that effect. XXX
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Russo and her husband, Nick, own Ebbets Field, a
restaurant not far from campus. Russo, a Southwest Missouri State
grad who attended Park Hill High School in Kansas City, never much
liked sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really, not until this week,'' Russo said. ``Now I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears have that kind of appeal. Their coach is Steve Alford,
34, one of the youngest coaches in the game. He doesn't look much
older than he did as an Indiana University senior in 1987, when he
led the Hoosiers to the national championship. And, by the way,
those tournament highlights are playing on the television sets at
Ebbets Field. Not a tape. It just worked out that way. Amazing how
little Alford has changed in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth season, Alford has guided the Bears to their most
successful season as a Division I program. Southwest Missouri
didn't win the Missouri Valley Conference or the league tournament.
But success these days is measured in the NCAA tournament, and the
Sweet 16 is a first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do something no other Bears team had done,''
Alford said.
</P>
<P>
   They did. It made Jenny Russo a basketball fan. XXX
</P>
<P>
   Prather is on his cell phone. Turns out, he saw the perfect
cardboard cutout at a place in Charlotte, N.C., where Southwest
Missouri State played last weekend. It's the Statue of Liberty
spinning a basketball instead of holding the torch. Prather is
having it shipped from Charlotte to Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gonna paint an SMS on the basketball,'' Prather said.
</P>
<P>
   Other planned signs for the Meadowlands, site of the game with
Duke: scores of the some of the great NCAA tournament upsets like
North Carolina State over Houston and Villanova over Georgetown.
He'll take the ``Bring on Duke'' sign, but he probably won't get
much local publicity for that one. Prather and the sign made the
front sports page of Monday's New York Times. In color. XXX
</P>
<P>
   Lunchgoers Chuck Clark and Ken Kabonic are federal probation
officers and Jeff Maloney is a psychology professor at Southwest
Missouri. They're big fans and were about as sure as anybody else
in Springfield that the Bears would get this far in the tournament.
Which is to say, not sure at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all gravy,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Southwest Missouri State followers, Maloney wasn't
even counting on an invitation, not after the Bears got knocked out
in the semifinals of the Missouri Valley Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I didn't think they had lived up to
expectations,'' Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. Until the Bears received the tournament invitation
and pulled off the upsets in Charlotte, the season was falling
short of Alford's hopes. The Bears had lost many close games and a
couple of baskets had cost them the conference title.
</P>
<P>
   Alford sensed the pressure his team was feeling. So he told
players that after they beat Wisconsin and their next opponent,
they would spend the first day preparing for Duke by leaving the
basketballs on the rack.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Bears spent their first day of Duke week playing
Wiffle ball. XXX
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri students are gone for spring break, so
there's no extra help in the sports information office. Manager
Mark Stillwell has a cold. Nobody's slept for two days.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly 50 reporters and radio shows from around the country
have to talk to Alford.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the reporters are assembled on a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hectic, but it's a great hectic,'' Alford said as he
breaks from a coaches meeting into his office.
</P>
<P>
   He grabs a homemade chocolate chip cookie and an iced tea and
settles in for nearly 45 minutes worth of chatting about Southwest
Missouri State, Duke, Bob Knight, Mike Krzyzewski, Missouri Valley
pride and his future, which is looking pretty bright these days.
There may be a bigger job in Alford's immediate future. MORE

 &HT;    Buckeyes eliminate Auburn
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The sweetest ride in Auburn basketball
history is finally over. And Ohio State's turnaround, one of the
most remarkable in NCAA history, is one win away from the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by a point with less than three minutes left, Ohio
State scored 10 straight to upset the top-seeded Tigers 72-64
Thursday night in the NCAA South Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   With point guard Scoonie Penn overcoming foul trouble to score
19 of his 26 points in the second half, and Michael Redd adding 15,
the Buckeyes (26-8) advanced to Saturday night's regional final
against St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   In becoming the first top-seeded team in the tournament to fall,
Auburn (29-4) got 15 points from forward Chris Porter. But when he
fouled out with 1:57 left and Auburn down 62-61, Ohio State scored
eight more unanswered points.
</P>
<P>
   When the night began, the top four seeds in this region were
still alive and Cliff Ellis had likened the South Regional to a
Final Four. In the real thing, the Auburn coach knows, two
ingredients essential for success are good guard play and even
better rebounding. At least Ellis got one of those in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   En route to becoming the SEC Player of the Year, Porter had
terrorized the conference on the boards, particularly the offensive
glass. But he'd had just two offensive rebounds in the SEC
semifinal loss to Kentucky, none in an NCAA opening-round rout of
Winthrop. Although Porter grabbed 10 rebounds last Saturday in an
81-74 win over Oklahoma State, he had just nine points.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis knew he needed more production from Porter if Auburn was
to survive this mini-Final Four and reach the real one.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Porter pounded the glass for eight boards
(three offensive) and six points. Bryant Smith added six points,
too. But while Ohio State was getting outrebounded 26-17, the
Buckeyes were clearly winning the battle of the backcourts. Any
team might if it had Penn and Redd.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed Redd stuck a 3-pointer to open the game, then
scored seven of Ohio State's first nine points as the Buckeyes took
an early 9-5 lead. But Auburn got nicely balanced scoring,
including seven points off the bench by Daymeon Fishback, to grab a
24-21 lead. But then Ohio State, and Penn, closed with a rush.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out last season upon transferring from Boston
College when coach Jim O'Brien left BC for Ohio State, Penn led a
remarkable Buckeye turnaround and became the Big Ten Player of the
Year. How, and why, were evident Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State closed with a 10-3 rush to take a 31-26 halftime
lead. Ken Johnson started it with a tip-in. After Brian Brown
drilled a 3-pointer, Penn stuck a jumper from the right side. Then
he beat the buzzer with a 3-ball from the left of the key to make
it 31-26.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since landing on his butt late in the regular season,
Penn's shooting had suffered. He was just 7-for-27 in Ohio State's
first two NCAA games. But Thursday he was on, especially after
Redd's follow put the Buckeyes up 35-32. Penn stuck a jumper from
the top of the key, then a pull-up 3-pointer off a pick for a 40-35
advantage.

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ Alford's immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rowe, the school's athletic director since 1982, said
Southwest Missouri State had never ridden a publicity wave like
this. Not when the women's team went to the 1992 Final Four or the
men won their first NCAA tournament game in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember as a youngster when the Bears won back-to-back NAIA
titles (in Kansas City) and that was a monumental occasion,'' Rowe
said. ``We went to the Division II championship game four times.
Then we make the move to Division I (in 1982), and we play in the
NIT in 1986. All those were very special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another step up, a first time in the Sweet 16. It's a
luster we hadn't experienced. We're getting calls from all over the
country from people who want to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   As an ESPN reporter sticks her head in the sports information
department looking for, what else, more information, an advanced
copy of this week's Sports Illustrated story on the tournament
rolls off the fax. There's a big picture of Bears forward Ken
Stringer blocking a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers gather around, nod their approval, and somebody wonders
aloud if the Bears will make the cover after they win twice this
weekend. XXX
</P>
<P>
   Prather's signs date back to the 1985 World Series. An avid
Cardinals fan, he loaded up with ``Fat Lady singing'' signs for
game five. When the Royals won, he drove to Kansas City and will
never forget his meeting with one particular fan during the seventh
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fat lady came up to me and said, `I'm here to sing,' &UR; ''
Prather said.
</P>
<P>
   The series also inspired a favorite that he pulls out when an
official's call goes against the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denkinger Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the signs have kept coming. Hockey and baseball
games in St. Louis _ he's also chairman of a Mark McGwire fan club
that raised funds for abused children _ and basketball games in
Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Prather took time out from his signs to fill out his bracket and
had the Bears winning two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any other regional, if they were going against Auburn or
Michigan State, I'd have them winning at least one more,'' Prather
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Prather's packing for two games worth of signs. Then there's
that Statue of Liberty waiting for him. NCAA rules prohibit fans
from bringing signs into arenas, but the security folks at
Charlotte allowed it. Prather's taking no chances at the
Meadowlands. He won't be walking in with them, but he has a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see them,'' he said. ``I promise.''

THEY CALL IT MARCH MADNESS FOR GOOD REASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - America West Arena has seen its share of ``big''
games. &QL; 
Suns playoff games (including the '93 NBA Finals), Coyotes playoff
games _ the joint hasn't exactly lacked for drama.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night was different.
</P>
<P>
   This was the NCAA West Regional. Gonzaga's nail-biting 73-72
tip-in win over Florida. Connecticut's hard-fought 78-68 victory
over Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   This was madness, of the March variety.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, television has worked that phrase to death, but there is a
reason: because it fits. Sitting in an arena chopped up into
quarters _ one for each school _ you could feel it. Pep bands
blared school fight songs. Entire sections roared back and forth at
each other, seeming to live and die on every shot.
</P>
<P>
   You want proof? Look no further than Florida's Eddie Shannon,
sprawled on the floor after missing a shot that would have won the
first game. He was despondent.
</P>
<P>
   So were the Gator fans. Amy Howard, who attended Florida,
claimed not to be too down after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Her moist eyes said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset for them,'' she said of the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The college fever is at a higher pitch,'' said Eric Afrons, a
Florida native (and alumnus) who recently moved to Phoenix.
``There's just more emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. College basketball breathes a passion that doesn't
exist in the professional game. Pro basketball isn't on a
respirator (though the lockout knocked the wind out of it), but to
real fans, the NCAA Tournament is a blast of fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   And the Gonzaga fans were like an air-conditioner on a hot
August day. They stood and screamed the entire first game. They
cheered their team's introduction and faithfully ignored Florida's.
When the Gators' pep band came out onto the court, they booed
lustily. And when Casey Calvary tipped in the game-winner, they
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   They were, in a word, nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in another word, perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just drove 23 hours to come to this game,'' said Mike
Wenrick, a Gonzaga junior. ``I'm stoked!''
</P>
<P>
   Wenrick and the others in Section 115 were part of the portable
Kennel Club (Gonzaga's nickname is the Bulldogs).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're infamous,'' Wenrick said with considerable pride. He's
been to professional basketball games in Seattle, and felt the
difference in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't care if you make a fool of yourself'' at a
tournament game, he said. ``Everyone else is.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, his fellow Kennel Clubbers painted their faces,
their foreheads and their hair red and blue, the school's colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can paint a big Z on your chest and rip off your shirt in
the middle of the game and nobody cares,'' Wenrick continued. ``At
a pro game, they might look at you funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, his chest was Z-less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't have the paint,'' he sighed, then went looking for some.
</P>
<P>
   Might as well pull out all the stops. Phil Gilberto, a
Connecticut fan, knew the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think we're here?'' he asked. ``You think we'd
travel 3,000 miles for nothing? I wouldn't travel 120 miles to
watch the Mets play.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro sports offer plenty of excitement, Gilberto's view of the
Mets notwithstanding. But the NCAA Tournament offers no seven-game
series, no chances to learn a team's weakness over a few games and
exploit it a day later.
</P>
<P>
   You lose and you're gone.
</P>
<P>
   John Bruntz, an Iowa law school graduate who lives in West Des
Moines, noted another difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not the professional aspect of getting paid to play,''
he said, then chuckled. At least there's not ``supposed'' to be,
his laugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Something else you probably won't see in the pros: Before the
Gonzaga-Florida game, Stuart Evey and his wife, Mary, yelled down
to Richie Frahm, a Bulldogs player who was warming up. Frahm sought
out the source of the voices, spotted the Eveys, grinned and waved.
</P>
<P>
   Evey, the former chairman of ESPN, didn't go to Gonzaga. But he
retired to Spokane, Wash., and he and his wife take a few players
under their wing every season, he said. You don't see many Phoenix
families adopting homesick Suns players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose with 'em, and we win with 'em,'' Evey said. ``It's
unconditional.''
</P>
<P>
   Spread that around the arena in four different directions, and
you'll have the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a part of the team,'' Wenrick, the Kennel Club
resident, said. ``We ``are'' Gonzaga. We have something invested in
the school.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Connecticut dismisses Iowa
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Connecticut moved one step closer to its first-ever
Final Four berth Thursday by defeating Iowa 78-68 in the West
Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Huskies (31-2) will face surprising Gonzaga
Saturday for a trip to St. Petersburg and the Final Four. The loss
ended the Iowa coaching career of Tom Davis, who was forced to
resign early this season despite being the winningest coach in
school history.
</P>
<P>
   Khalid El-Amin had 21 points and five assists for Connecticut,
which advanced to the regional finals for the second time in the
last five years. In its previous appearance, also in the West
Regional, the Huskies lost to UCLA 102-96 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having few athletes the caliber of those in the
Connecticut lineup, Iowa kept it close in the second half, taking
one lead and creating five ties in the first 10 minutes. Every time
UConn appeared to gain some breathing room, one of the Hawkeyes'
cadre of raw-boned inside players would bang in close for a hoop.
Iowa also played much better defense at the 3-point arc in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup boiled down to UConn's blinding speed and Iowa's
undeniable spunk.
</P>
<P>
   That the Hawkeyes could even hang with UConn in the first half,
which ended with the Huskies leading 40-35, was a testament to
Iowa's muscle, moxie and manipulation. In the first seven minutes
alone, Davis used five different defenses: a box-and-one against
Connecticut star Richard Hamilton, a straight man-to-man, some 2-3
zone, a 1-3-1 zone and a halfcourt trap.
</P>
<P>
   While the Hawkeyes were able to control Hamilton most of the
half, they had no such success against UConn guard El-Amin, who
controlled the tempo the entire 20 minutes. The point guard scored
11 points and dished out five assists.
</P>
<P>
   When he wanted to get to the paint, El-Amin did so almost at
will. In the closing two minutes of the half, he twice exploded
past defenders to dump off to Hamilton for easy layups. Earlier in
the half, he took the ball nearly the length of the floor,
dribbling past three players to draw a foul off a drive.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to run at every opportunity, Connecticut hit 13 of its
first 17 shots, including all four 3-point attempts, and finished
the half with a 64.0 percentage. Iowa hit just 39.3 percent but
outmuscled Connecticut for second chances. That UConn managed 20
points in the paint was a result of penetration as Iowa stayed
tough inside and took advantage of some lapses by the Huskies to
stay close.
</P>
<P>
   If the Huskies have a weakness, it's that they simply don't live
up to their name on the boards, with little inside huskiness. Iowa
had a 15-13 rebounding edge at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The half ended with some ugliness, as Iowa center Jacob Jaacks
tossed a wicked elbow at UConn backup forward Souleymane Wane as
time expired. The two had to be pulled apart as the teams left the
floor.

BOEING BETS FAITH AND MONEY ON JETLINER EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many aerospace-industry analysts believe that the Boeing Co. is
banking its future on Alan R. Mulally, the newly appointed head of
its troubled commercial airplane division. And indeed it appears
that Boeing is willing to back up its faith with dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's latest proxy filing discloses that Mulally, who is 53,
received restricted stock and stock options last year worth between
$11.1 million and $19.6 million, depending on the future
performance of company stock. His salary and bonus for 1998 totaled
$778,601.
</P>
<P>
   The package was a significant jump from Mulally's 1997
compensation of $629,000 and makes him the third-highest-paid
executive at the company after Philip M. Condit, chairman and chief
executive, and Harry C. Stonecipher, the president.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally turned down an offer to become heir apparent at Raytheon
last year. A Boeing spokesman said the stock and options were given
to him as an incentive to stay at the company. ``Based on what Alan
was being offered by another company,'' he said, ``the board saw
this as an appropriate retention package and as an investment in
Boeing's future.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulally, who was not available for comment on Thursday, was
running Boeing's space and military businesses in September when he
was tapped to lead the commercial airplane division after Ronald B.
Woodard, the former president, was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Production foul-ups and other delays at the passenger-jet unit
forced Boeing in 1997 to post its first annual loss in 50 years.
Last year, the unit sold a record 559 planes worth $36 billion, but
made a $63 million profit.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming leader of the division, Mulally, who made his
reputation at Boeing working with Condit to develop the 777
wide-body passenger jet, has begun straightening out some of the
production difficulties and meeting delivery deadlines. But he
still must put a plan in place that will lead the unit to sustained
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally's incentive package includes $5.2 million worth of
restricted stock that becomes available to him over 10 years and
200,000 stock options with an exercise price of $45.0625 a share
that become vested over three years. Boeing stock, which has
underperformed the market in recent years, closed on Thursday at
$35.125, down 62.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the proxy filing showed that two Boeing directors _
Donald E. Petersen, the retired chairman of the Ford Motor Company,
and George H. Weyerhaeuser, the forest-products industrialist _
will leave the board after reaching the mandatory retirement age of
72.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis E. Platt, chairman and chief executive of the
Hewlett-Packard Co., was nominated to fill one of the vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy filing also indicated, as previously reported, that
Condit and Stonecipher did not receive bonuses last year and that
Woodard received $1.35 million from Boeing as part of a separation
package.

TO ERR IS HUMAN, TO SHOOT AIRBALLS IS STRICTLY NBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This week's sign that the apocalypse is NOT upon us:
</P>
<P>
   A partial exam of NBA attendance by Street &AMP; Smith's Sports
Business Journal shows that the no-show count at arenas is
estimated around 10 to 15 percent, even though the NBA refused to
provide any documentary help.
</P>
<P>
   The no-shows indicate at least some discerning fans understand
how inferior baggy-pants theater is this season. (The argument can
be made that these fans were silly to buy season tickets in the
first place, but they probably needed to hold their spots for next
season, should pro ball resume.)
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is smirking quietly to itself that overall attendance
(tickets sold) is down only slightly in the aftermath of the
lockout, indicating it guessed right in calculating the gullibility
of the American sports public.
</P>
<P>
   The increased number of no-shows means the clubs will be out
some money from concessions and parking, but the hit is minor
compared to how badly baseball wounded itself in its 1994 labor
debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is remarkable how many people are showing up to watch
millionaire athletes airball free throws, creating statistical lows
unseen since Flintstone basketball was played with real rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, many fans made the same assumption as Sonics coach
Paul Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a presumption that most of (the locked-out players)
were doing something,'' he said, barely smiling. ``The season's
more odd than I thought it would be. I thought after the lockout
was over it would be, `Oh, well, get a couple weeks of camp and
go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is apparent that too many players posted up at Royal
Fork's all-you-can-eat line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's hard enough to lose 10 pounds,'' Westphal said.
``If you're 40 pounds overweight, two months isn't much time to
lose that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's plain that the Ben &AMP; Jerry's poster children among the
Sonics are Vin Baker and Billy Owens, who packed enough extra
pounds between them to nearly have made the backup point guard for
which the Sonics have yearned.
</P>
<P>
   The recently improved play of Baker, whom the I-5 truck stations
gauged about 280 pounds at the start of the season, has a lot to do
with his slowly improving fitness. Only lately has Baker's
trademark quickness reappeared in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-9 Owens started out around 250, at least 15 over his best
weight, and since has been sidelined with a broken finger and a
sore knee, the latter a possible consequence of cheeseburger
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy is so much better than he's shown,'' Westphal said.
``But he was in almost the same boat as Vin. And he's been in and
out of good health.''
</P>
<P>
   The chubsters' lack of professionalism has been the primary
cause of the Sonics' worst start since the K.C. Jones era. But
since the problem is league-wide, the Sonics have not fallen off
the playoff map.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is physical sloppiness the only explanation for the
grimness. Hersey Hawkins (41.6 percent from the field), who might
be in the best shape of his career, has joined the rest of his
teammates in flirting with career lows in shotmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the benefit of summer league and exhibition season,
and with a new coach, new system and several new players, working
together has been a problem,'' said Sonics president Wally Walker.
``Normally, a new coach gets a chance in the offseason to get a
dialogue going with veteran players, and there's also a chance to
talk to free agents and see whether they will fit. We couldn't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   As Westphal put it, ``We have no ability to experiment without
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Two cases in point: The moves of longtime starters Hawkins and
Detlef Schrempf to the bench. Westphal wanted to talk to both about
the shift during the summer, but the lockout rules prohibited any
contact between management and union members. The moves were done
abruptly, with much resentment and little preparation, during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkins move was a bust, and reversed. Schrempf, after
lashing out, now seems accepting for the greater good.
</P>
<P>
   ``What brought the changes had nothing to do with Hersey or
Det,'' Westphal said. ``It had to do with no Sam Perkins, no Nate
McMillan, no Jerome Kersey, no Greg Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that made the Sonics so tough over the last several
years is the guys coming off the bench. How many games have those
guys won for the Sonics?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessor, George Karl, who wanted no part of
youngsters, Westphal finds himself with three rookies on his bench,
all with solid NBA potential. But they aren't ready this season.
Westphal figures if they must play, better to put them in the
starting lineup, as he did with Rashard Lewis, where the best
players can cover their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the years we would have loved to have a summer league
and a full preseason,'' Westphal said, ``this was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Westphal is getting a summer league. It's just that
fans are paying $250 courtside to watch it.

SHAQ TAKES HIS SHOTS AFTER LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Shaquille O'Neal had one of his vintage nights: 37
points, 19 rebounds and one thinly disguised flagrant foul on his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal slammed down a series of dunks on the Cleveland
Cavaliers, then slammed his Lakers for a shoddy defensive effort
that cost them a 100-93 loss at Gund Arena on Thursday, their
second loss in three games on this road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big man did his work, everybody else has to step up,''
O'Neal said. ``We've gotta be smart. I'm not gonna make excuses for
our loss, but we beat ourselves. And their guards just beat us
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they shredded the Lakers, one open jumper at a time.
Wesley Person scored 18 points, Brevin Knight 20 and Derek Anderson
came of the bench for another 12 as the Cavaliers shot 49.3 percent
overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' guards, helpless to stop it, couldn't answer it
either. Kobe Bryant finished with 14 points but was 4 of 12 from
the field, and Derek Harper scored just two points, both on free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make a 325-pound center lose his cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their guards just dominated our guards the whole game,
rebounding and shooting jumpers,'' he said. ``When I get
double-teamed and I kick it out, guys have to be confident about
what they want to do, not (mess) around with all that dribbling,
all that (bleeping) monkey (bleep).''
</P>
<P>
   The big man also seemed to take a shot at Bryant, saying, ``You
can't let Wesley Person get open for a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the defensive breakdown is anything new. The Lakers'
defense has been nonexistent for large stretches of this road trip,
leading to losses in Sacramento and Cleveland and a near-loss at
Minnesota, where only a late scoring burst saved them from being
0-3.
</P>
<P>
   No one will pinpoint the cause, but there are plenty of
candidates: Dennis Rodman's absence, the numerous changes to the
starting lineup and rotation, the loss of their best defender
(Eddie Jones, traded for Glen Rice).
</P>
<P>
   For the season, the Lakers are 8-8 in games without Rodman, 9-0
with him. But they're also 1-2 since the trade of Jones, which
arguably downgraded their defense at both small forward (from
Bryant to Rice) and shooting guard (from Jones to Bryant).
</P>
<P>
   After letting Person score a quick eight points in the first
quarter _ all in a run that gave the Cavaliers an early 18-10 lead
_ Bryant said he was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that was my fault. Wesley Person came off and got
them started with jump shots coming off screens,'' said Bryant, who
is adjusting to playing guard after spending the first 20 games at
forward. ``I was just trying different (defensive) techniques; this
is my first time chasing somebody off screens like that. But I'm a
quick learner.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll have to be. The road and the matchups get no easier when
the Lakers try to rebound against Allen Iverson and the
Philadelphia 76ers tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Their offense could use a boost as well. They shot 43.9 percent
against Cleveland, with Rice hitting just 9 of 21, Bryant 4 of 12
and Rick Fox 3 of 8. The bench was outscored 27-12. And the Lakers
never regained the lead, or even a tie, past the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken a step backward for us,'' Harper said. ``We were
sort of pushing the fast-forward button for a while, then stopping
and hitting rewind. . . . I don't think our approach is serious
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said lineup changes probably played a role in the Lakers'
regression, but he also dismissed that as a poor excuse for a team
that expects to contend for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we decide to return to a defensive mindset as a unit,
helping each other and putting the onus on yourself to stop your
man one-on-one, teams are gonna score with us. Right now we're
trying to feel our way through some new additions, and we're not in
the greatest offensive sync that we will be in. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's not enough defensive pride. Teams in this
league will kick your butt if you don't come to play both ends of
the floor.''

HENRY MAKES PITCH FOR STARTING ROTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ Beneath three large ice bags, accompanying
elastic bandages and a loosely draped warmup coat Thursday was a
likely Mariner starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Bluford ``Butch'' Henry was nearly hidden from sight,
obscured by his many layers of postgame wrappings, as he stood in a
darkened hallway replaying his four-inning stint in an 8-7 loss to
the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as Seattle's five-man rotation is concerned, the
30-year-old Texan is slowly coming into view. The lefty knows it.
Manager Lou Piniella knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, who missed last season after incurring a spring training
knee injury for the Boston Red Sox, wasn't perfect against the
Giants. He gave up runs in the second and third innings. But he
never lost his cool. That rates big points with the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our veteran pitchers have stayed away from the big inning this
spring,'' Piniella said. ``What did he give up? A couple of
singletons? You win with that with our lineup. I was pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry, his left elbow and both knees under ice, has removed
enough rust to post consecutive solid outings. More importantly for
him, he was physically tested Thursday _ and he passed.
</P>
<P>
   With two runners on, the Giants' Bill Mueller bunted left of the
mound. Henry grabbed the ball, slipped as he planted his surgically
repaired left knee and threw Mueller out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember thinking about my knee, which was
incredible,'' the pitcher said. ``I slipped on the bunt but I
didn't flinch, which is good. It's not even an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry has started twice since reminding management, through a
Post-Intelligencer story, that his contract has a stipulation
allowing him to walk away as a free agent if he doesn't make the
starting rotation. Until then, he had been used only in relief.
</P>
<P>
   The free-spirited pitcher said he wasn't trying to create
problems, just protect himself. He did the same thing last year
with Boston. The Red Sox wanted him to pitch with his injury. Henry
said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't complaining and I wasn't bitching at anybody,'' he
said. ``I spoke up for the second time in my career. I'm getting
innings now.''
</P>
<P>
   MISSING IN ACTION: For their 15th spring outing, the Mariners
got on the bus without regulars Ken Griffey Jr., Jay Buhner, Edgar
Martinez and David Segui. Griffey took a day off. Buhner, coming
off elbow surgery, rested before he plays consecutive games Friday
and Saturday. Martinez and Segui both suffered from unexplained
neck spasms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell is it?'' Piniella asked a trainer when told the
bleached-haired Segui was incapable of any activity. ``The (darn)
permanents he's been getting?''
</P>
<P>
   THE PLAN: Ken Cloude originally was scheduled to throw against
the Giants, but Piniella shuffled his pitchers to allow each to
start hitting the five-inning minimum he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Roster cuts will come before and after tomorrow's split-squad
games, paring the club from 42 to 36 players, and the mound staff
from 20 to 14 players.
</P>
<P>
   ``By (Monday), everyone in our rotation will have gone five
innings,'' Piniella said. ``Then we make up our minds. We can't
wait anymore. . . . The original plan was to get 27 innings from
our starters. We're going to do better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager said he normally has had to give two pitching spots
away each spring, with the recipients not necessarily earning them.
That won't be the case this time.
</P>
<P>
   Rattling off reasons, Piniella explained the club has two solid
prospects in Freddie Garcia and John Halama from the Randy Johnson
trade to Houston; players with major league experience outside the
organization; and mostly players with previous big league time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixteen of our 20 pitchers have major league experience,'' he
said. ``Last year, or the year before, we had eight or nine with
major league experience. . . . There is competition in earnest this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   SWIFT CURRENT: Among the pitching-staff candidates is
37-year-old Billy Swift, who is prepared for anything. He says his
arm feels great, but back problems have limited his mound time.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander is prepared to retire if the Mariners don't
keep him. He won't go elsewhere without a solid offer, and he won't
even consider starting the season in the minors. Idle time has been
a subject of converstion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to (retired Mariner first baseman) Alvin Davis the
other day and he said the first couple of years out of the game are
weird. You're retired, but you're still in your thirties,'' Swift
said. ``He said you're old for baseball, but young in real life,
and it's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   BATTER CHATTER: In the Peoria clubhouse, reliever Jose Paniagua
pulled outfielder Charles Gipson's jersey out of a box, got into a
baserunner's stance and then stumbled into the cardboard container,
drawing this comment from Griffey: ``Stay off the basepaths.'' . .
. Piniella, sizing up Sammy Sosa's new home-run ritual of bowing
after hitting home runs and the resulting criticism that has
emerged from players such as pitcher Todd Stottlemyre: ``The next
hitter will have to do a lot of bowing himself.''

tip-in win over Florida. Connecticut's hard-fought 78-68 victory
over Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   This was madness, of the March variety.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, television has worked that phrase to death, but there is a
reason: because it fits. Sitting in an arena chopped up into
quarters _ one for each school _ you could feel it. Pep bands
blared school fight songs. Entire sections roared back and forth at
each other, seeming to live and die on every shot.
</P>
<P>
   You want proof? Look no further than Florida's Eddie Shannon,
sprawled on the floor after missing a shot that would have won the
first game. He was despondent.
</P>
<P>
   So were the Gator fans. Amy Howard, who attended Florida,
claimed not to be too down after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Her moist eyes said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset for them,'' she said of the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The college fever is at a higher pitch,'' said Eric Afrons, a
Florida native (and alumnus) who recently moved to Phoenix.
``There's just more emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. College basketball breathes a passion that doesn't
exist in the professional game. Pro basketball isn't on a
respirator (though the lockout knocked the wind out of it), but to
real fans, the NCAA Tournament is a blast of fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   And the Gonzaga fans were like an air-conditioner on a hot
August day. They stood and screamed the entire first game. They
cheered their team's introduction and faithfully ignored Florida's.
When the Gators' pep band came out onto the court, they booed
lustily. And when Casey Calvary tipped in the game-winner, they
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   They were, in a word, nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in another word, perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just drove 23 hours to come to this game,'' said Mike
Wenrick, a Gonzaga junior. ``I'm stoked!''
</P>
<P>
   Wenrick and the others in Section 115 were part of the portable
Kennel Club (Gonzaga's nickname is the Bulldogs).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're infamous,'' Wenrick said with considerable pride. He's
been to professional basketball games in Seattle, and felt the
difference in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't care if you make a fool of yourself'' at a
tournament game, he said. ``Everyone else is.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, his fellow Kennel Clubbers painted their faces,
their foreheads and their hair red and blue, the school's colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can paint a big Z on your chest and rip off your shirt in
the middle of the game and nobody cares,'' Wenrick continued. ``At
a pro game, they might look at you funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, his chest was Z-less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't have the paint,'' he sighed, then went looking for some.
</P>
<P>
   Might as well pull out all the stops. Phil Gilberto, a
Connecticut fan, knew the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think we're here?'' he asked. ``You think we'd
travel 3,000 miles for nothing? I wouldn't travel 120 miles to
watch the Mets play.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro sports offer plenty of excitement, Gilberto's view of the
Mets notwithstanding. But the NCAA Tournament offers no seven-game
series, no chances to learn a team's weakness over a few games and
exploit it a day later.
</P>
<P>
   You lose and you're gone.
</P>
<P>
   John Bruntz, an Iowa law school graduate who lives in West Des
Moines, noted another difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not the professional aspect of getting paid to play,''
he said, then chuckled. At least there's not ``supposed'' to be,
his laugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Something else you probably won't see in the pros: Before the
Gonzaga-Florida game, Stuart Evey and his wife, Mary, yelled down
to Richie Frahm, a Bulldogs player who was warming up. Frahm sought
out the source of the voices, spotted the Eveys, grinned and waved.
</P>
<P>
   Evey, the former chairman of ESPN, didn't go to Gonzaga. But he
retired to Spokane, Wash., and he and his wife take a few players
under their wing every season, he said. You don't see many Phoenix
families adopting homesick Suns players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose with 'em, and we win with 'em,'' Evey said. ``It's
unconditional.''
</P>
<P>
   Spread that around the arena in four different directions, and
you'll have the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a part of the team,'' Wenrick, the Kennel Club
resident, said. ``We ``are'' Gonzaga. We have something invested in
the school.''
</P>
<P>
   For the members of the Kennel Club, that investment paid off big
Thursday night. &QL;

HUSKIES END DAVIS' IOWA CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Like most Iowans who visit Arizona in the cool months,
Tom Davis was hoping to stay here as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut cut Davis' visit, and coaching career at Iowa,
short Thursday night, beating the Hawkeyes, 78-68, in the NCAA West
Regional semifinal game at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last game at Iowa for Davis, who spent 13 years at
the school and was forced out when school officials decided not to
renew his contract after this season.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended an heartwarming final run for the 60-year-old
Davis, who has already cleaned his office out back home, but has
yet to pack away his hopes for coaching elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   For Connecticut (31-2), it was another step closer to its goal
of reaching the Final Four for the first time in school history, a
fact that Coach Jim Calhoun has been reminded of only a few hundred
times since the tournament started.
</P>
<P>
   UConn, the region's No. 1 seed, was supposed to breeze through
the West Regional after the second through fourth seeds were
eliminated in the first two rounds. Iowa (20-10) proved to be much
tougher than expected. The Hawkeyes fought the Huskies, literally,
and UConn didn't pull away until the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, led Thursday by forward Richard `Rip` Hamilton's 20
points, play another tournament darling Saturday afternoon in
10th-seed Gonzaga. The winner advances to the Final Four next week
in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa trailed UConn by five at halftime, but opened the second
half with an 8-2 to take a one point lead with 17:08 remaining.
UConn quickly countered, but the Hawkeyes run served notice that
the Huskies were not going to breeze through this regional.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, Iowa had answers for everything. Khalid El-Amin hit
a three-pointer to put UConn ahead by 3 with 13:22 left. About a
minute later, Iowa guard Kent McCausland tied it with a three
pointer. Then Hamilton made a short jumper, which Range countered
with a little lay-in of his own to tie the score with 11:17 left.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut then threatened to pull away. The Huskies scored six
straight points, their longest run of the night at that point, to
take a six-point lead with 7:01 left. Iowa, however, refused to
wilt, even when they trailed by 7 with five minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   But a missed layup by guard Ryan Luehrsman a minute later, a
traveling ca ll on forward Jess Settles and a missed shot by
Settles effectively ended Iowa's glorious run in this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were testy in the first half, and Iowa served notice
early that it wasn't going to be intimidated by the Huskies.
Calhoun argued several calls, and Davis was screaming at the
officials to call UConn for illegal screens.
</P>
<P>
   UConn led, 40-35, as the first half ended, but the excitement
wasn't over. As the teams started to leave the court, Iowa guard
Joey Range bopped El-Amin with a forearm. Iowa center Jacob Jaacks
stepped in to separate the two and became embroiled in the fracas
when he wrapped up El-Amin and pulled him away.
</P>
<P>
   But no punches were thrown, and after the officials spent a
couple of minutes looking at the replay, no one was penalized. The
incident did earn the team's captains a lecture from official Joe
Silvester.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team let up much in the second half. Connecticut center
Jake Voskuhl and Iowa forward Jess Settles traded bumps, and fouls,
underneath early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa stayed in the game until the last five minutes by not
allowing UConn to make one of its trademark runs, which it has used
all season to bury teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies had no trouble breaking Iowa's fullcourt pressure,
but they did have problems scoring in the halfcourt. The Hawkeyes
used a 3-2 zone and a box-and-one in the first half, putting guard
Kent McCausland on forward Richard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have struggled this season against zone defenses and
had difficulty finding any consistent offensive success Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   UConn was solid on defense, however, and Iowa had difficulty
finding open shots. Center J.R. Koch stepped out and hit a couple
three pointers in th first half as did McCausland.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa made just 11 of 28 shots in the first half, but the
Hawkeyes gathered seven offensive rebounds to make up for it. &QL;

INTERNATIONAL SOCCER TRIO LIFTS TEXAS TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ One is Bosnian, one is Brazilian and one
hails from Africa's Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a love for soccer _ the world's game _ they have
little in common. They bring three distinct styles of play to a
soccer field _ European, South American and African.
</P>
<P>
   But Liman Becirovic, Jiuliano Teixeira and Ibrahim Doukoure are
all Arlington Heights High School Yellow Jackets, regardless of how
the paths of their lives led them here.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Heights ``U.N. Coalition'' helped the 'Jackets
win their 13th district championship in 17 years and first playoff
game since 1994 against Carroll on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Heights (18-4-1) is scheduled to face Fossil Ridge (22-1-1) at 7
p.m. Friday in the Class 4A Region II quarterfinals at Fossil
Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say that Heights had plenty of domestic talent
before enlisting its three internationals. Senior goalkeeper Mike
Lahoud and his brother, freshman forward Chris Lahoud _ both
half-Lebanese _ are top select players in their age groups.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeper Charles Ivory, defender Phillip Lockwood and forward
Tino Castillo could have easily led Heights to another district
title and maybe postseason success.
</P>
<P>
   Adding three players from three soccer-rich regions could only
enhance a program that had gotten along fine on local talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already knew about Jiuliano,'' Heights coach Jack Warren
said about the Brazilian exchange student who played on the
junior-varsity team in 1998. ``Liman and Ibrahim were surprises. I
saw their names on a list of 50 or so kids signed up for soccer and
didn't think much of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A week of running drills and scrimmages unveiled the mystery
players. Warren surmised that Becirovic, the Bosnian, and Doukoure,
the Ivory Coast native, would make the varsity.
</P>
<P>
   If only they had been as confident upon arriving in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   While senior midfielder Teixeira came as part of a
soccer-academy exchange program in January 1998, the stories of
Becirovic and Doukoure are more complicated. Teixeira, who has
lived with the Lahouds, played on last year's JV team because the
University Interscholastic League wouldn't grant him varsity
clearance.
</P>
<P>
   In his exchange program, top youth players from Brazil such as
Teixeira, a native of Sao Paulo, were brought to the United States
to help tutor American players. The UIL viewed the program as
``non-traditional,'' thus ruling Teixeira ineligible for varsity
competition for one season.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said Teixeira's skills compared with those of his
junior-varsity teammates were ``night and day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was definitely out of his element,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   Teixeira played club soccer last year with Michael Lahoud for
Fort Worth United, and now both suit up for Dallas Inter. Knowing
he was ready for the high school varsity a year ago gnaws at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I thought, man, I lost all this time on the JV,''
Teixeira said. ``I missed the higher level. The soccer here is very
good. It's more physical than in Brazil. They use a lot of the
body, but they're getting better at picking up the skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Becirovic, a sophomore forward, has had only five months to size
up the American game. He arrived last fall with his parents from
Germany, where they lived for six years after leaving Bosnia and
Herzegovina in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Former Yugoslav republics Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina
declared independence in 1991 and touched off a four-year war
between Bosnian Serb Orthodox Christians, Catholic Croats and
Bosnian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   A former professional player in Germany, Mirhat Becirovic moved
his family to Munich from their hometown of Zenica, a city outlying
the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, German immigration officials told the Bosnians to
return home or adopt another homeland. An international relocation
agency landed the Becirovic family in Fort Worth after it chose to
come to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Liman honed his soccer skills in Germany starting at age 10. In
five years, he made the junior team affiliated with 860 Munich, a
local professional club.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here, I thought nobody could play soccer (in
the United States),'' Becirovic said. ``I saw them in the World
Cup, and I was worried. Then I saw that there was good soccer here,
and even that some are good enough to play professionally in
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Liman said Mirhat ``almost gets a heart attack'' while watching
his high school and club games, and that the elder Becirovic thinks
American soccer is too heavily influenced by its rougher cousin,
football.
</P>
<P>
   Doukoure's impression of the American game is the exact
opposite. Rough play, he said, is a trademark of Ivory Coast
soccer. There, referees who call matches too tightly get roughed up
themselves later on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't even touch a player here,'' said Doukoure, a
freshman forward. ``You try to play physical, the referee stops
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Doukoure came to the United States in 1997 to live with his
father, who left Ivory Coast in 1986. Between those years, Doukoure
said he saw his father only once, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``His tenacity in going after the ball caught my eye,'' Warren
said. ``Even with a larger defender, he more often than not comes
up with it.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything toughened Doukoure, it was playing soccer barefoot
as a youth in the streets of his hometown, Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the most determined Ivory Coast player we've ever had,''
Warren said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Far from home and starting over, Doukoure, Becirovic and
Teixeira had little other choice.

COLLEYVILLE HERITAGE CONTINUES SUCCESS DESPITE INJURY SETBACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEIDI PEDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEYVILLE, Texas _ It's surprising that members of the
Colleyville Heritage girls soccer team haven't grown tired of
repeating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   After all, haven't they already proved they aren't a one-player
show?
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers clearly survived the early February injury loss of
then-leading scorer Amy Van Zandt. Later in the month they got
along without Van Zandt's replacement at forward, Krystal Pfluger,
who went down to an ankle injury. Then they triumphed while playing
without yet another injured starter, Staci Everett, in the team's
last three district games.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Panthers are undefeated, with a 21-0-1 record
heading into Friday night's Class 4A Region II quarterfinals
matchup with Carroll. The Panthers survived a tough District 11-4A
race to win their first district title and now have their eye on
the state tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody else was saying our season was over when Amy got
hurt, but we didn't feel that way,'' starter Jessi Moore explained
patiently to yet another inquirer. ``I think it motivated us. If
one person hasn't had it, others have stepped up and done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, helped by the addition of Midlothian transfer Van
Zandt, have been stepping up all season. Ranked sixth among state
4A teams in one preseason poll, early on the Panthers knocked off
Richland, Lamar and defending Class 5A state champion Martin, and
earned a tie with Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been in 11-4A play, however, that Colleyville
Heritage proved what it was really made of. In the fourth district
game, against Grapevine, the Panthers were faced with potential
disaster when Van Zandt tore knee ligaments early in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine scored shortly after to go up 2-1, but then the
Panthers tied the score on a Moore goal with about 12 minutes
remaining. They won, 3-2, when Pfluger, who had moved from
midfielder to forward to replace Van Zandt, scored in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adjustment is what this team is about,'' coach Angie Moss
said. ``In clutch games it would be so great to have Amy back, but
the girls know they can't rely on one person to do the work.
Everybody's had to take an extra step.''
</P>
<P>
   With the injury to Van Zandt, who at the time had scored 24
goals, Colleyville Heritage shuffled. Moore, like Van Zandt a
sophomore, now leads the team with 32 goals and 24 assists. Pfluger
has scored eight goals while playing her new position, and junior
Sarah Jensen replaced Pfluger at midfield.
</P>
<P>
   But Colleyville Heritage is hardly all offense. With a midfield
that includes senior Bethany Williams, defenders Kathy Nichols,
Julie Stevens and Kelly Christoffer, and goalkeeper Michele
Vaughan, the Panthers have 17 shutouts in 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   That play earned Colleyville Heritage the No. 2 spot among high
school girls teams in the latest National Soccer Coaches
Association of America poll. Martin is ranked fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our secret is just that we play so well together,''
Christoffer said. ``We just seem to know what each other is
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, after a 10-day layoff from competition, Colleyville
Heritage defeated Hewitt Midway, 5-0. With that victory, the
Panthers advanced further in the playoffs than they did last season
in their first postseason experience. The Panthers, who finished
second in District 9-4A last season, lost in the 1998 bi-district
round to Class 5A Richardson Berkner.
</P>
<P>
   This season, with separate Class 4A and 5A playoffs, Colleyville
Heritage players think they have what it takes to challenge for a
state title. But don't think they are taking anything for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls have kept everything in perspective. We're a new
program and we remember what it's like to be at the bottom,'' Moss
said. ``In the playoffs, you start each game from scratch.''

GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS TAKE TURNS DOMINATING TEXAS BASKETBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STACY FEDUCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Six high school boys basketball teams from
the Fort Worth/Dallas area spent parts of last weekend in Austin. A
week before, Mansfield represented the area when it claimed the
girls Class 5A title against Dallas Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that this area is a hotbed of basketball champions?
More likely, it is a hotbed of high schools. Having multiple
state-tournament participants from a geographic area is often,
alas, a function of the number of schools in that area and
University Interscholastic League realignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year there were quite a few teams from our area,'' said
Crowley coach Gary Surratt, whose Eagles defeated Port Arthur
Lincoln for the Class 4A boys title. ``I was looking at a Texas
basketball Web site and a lot of people were writing in saying it's
a D/FW thing; but really, it just kind of runs in cycles. For a
long time it was the Houston area, then I can remember when it was
deep Northeast Texas. It just so happens this was the year for the
D/FW area.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was at the boys state tournament: Representing Region
I, Duncanville defeated Region II Dallas Kimball for the Class 5A
title, and Crowley gave Region I the Class 4A title. Coppell
represented Region II in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Peaster, eight miles north of Weatherford, won the Class 2A
title. Ponder, near Denton, bowed out in the Class A semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the concentration of schools in this area, the UIL
almost always divides it in half, typically sending Tarrant County
west and Dallas County east for regional competitions. This season,
after years of playing the Plainviews and Canyons, Fort Worth
schools went east, while the Johnson County schools went west.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tough region,'' Surratt said of Region I. ``We came
from a tough district and a tough region. We nearly didn't make it
out of regionals because of Plainview, and Peaster's in the same
region as Godley and Krum. That's pretty tough. You just can't ever
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   So before you start crowing about how Fort Worth/Dallas area
ball is better than San Antonio, Austin, Panhandle or even Houston
ball, consider these past geographically dominant state tournament
matchups:
</P>
<P>
   Bryan and Houston Memorial in the 1994 Class 5A final with Port
Arthur Lincoln in the 4A final and Sour Lake Hardin-Jefferson in
the 3A final; Houston Madison and Conroe in the 1985 Class 5A final
with Bay City in the 4A final and Sweeny in the 3A final; San
Antonio Jay in the 1991 5A final with San Antonio Alamo Heights in
the 4A final. Then there was the North Texas quinella in 1993 when
Dunbar won the 5A title, Dallas Lincoln won the 4A title, Carroll
won the 3A title and Brock lost in the Class A finals to Laneville.
</P>
<P>
   Championship city? Not really, simply a high cycle for North
Texas.

UPSTART GONZAGA KEEPS DREAM ALIVE

<P>
   PHOENIX - Let Gonzaga Coach Dan Monson speak for the rest of the
college basketball world after his Bulldogs beat Florida, 73-72, on
Thursday night in the West Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' Monson said.
</P>
<P>
   Say it, feel it, but don't dream it, because it's true: Gonzaga
is within one game of the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Let the players express the universal reaction to that unlikely
piece of news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said sophomore forward Casey Calvary,
whose tip-in of Quentin Hall's missed shot with 4.4 seconds
remaining was the winning basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is awesome,'' said junior guard Richie Frahm, who scored
17 points, making five three-point baskets in eight attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Bing Crosby is crooning a victory tune. John Stockton
might decide to play 10 more years for the Utah Jazz. Suddenly,
Gonzaga is known for more than its famous alumni. The Bulldogs,
representing a university whose enrollment weighs in at less than
5,000, who before last week never had won an NCAA Tournament game,
are the little team that did.
</P>
<P>
   The only ones not surprised at how this fabulous tale is turning
out are the ones who are writing it.
</P>
<P>
   But after leading for virtually the entire game, it looked as if
the Zags would be regarded as just another feisty bunch of
overachievers whose reach barely exceeded their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving deficits of 13 points in the first half and seven with
9:41 to go, and missing 16 of their first 17 three-point attempts,
Florida battled back to take a 72-69 lead on Greg Stolt's
three-pointer with 45.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   After three timeouts, two by Gonzaga, the Bulldogs passed up the
trey for a better shot, albeit a two-pointer. Frahm hit Jeremy
Eaton inside, and Eaton's layup made it 72-71, Florida, with 19.7
seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Florida inbounded to forward Brent Wright, who heretofore had a
nice game with 15 points and seven rebounds. Gonzaga's players were
yelling for Hall, a senior guard, to foul Wright. But Hall didn't
hear it. Instead of getting fouled, Wright traveled in the
backcourt with 15.4 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless his (Hall's) ears for not letting him hear us,''
senior guard Matt Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga (28-6) was down by one with one possession left to win,
and also down to one timeout, and Monson used it. After the Zags
in-bounded, Florida's Kenyan Weeks poked a pass out of bounds. With
10.6 seconds to go, Gonzaga brought it in again, Frahm to Calvary
to Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, the quickest of the Zags, drove to the basket from the top
of the key. He got into the lane, took off, seemed to hang for a
second or two, and let the ball go. The plan for Gonzaga at that
point was pretty simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a rebound or foul if we didn't score,'' Monson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's shot bounced off the rim. Calvary, who stands 6-foot-8,
was blocked out by the 6-8 Wright. But the rebound bounced over
Wright and Calvary was there, going up with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   Or trying to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had both hands on the ball, and my right arm kind of got
pulled down a little bit, and I batted it off the glass with my
left hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove to the hoop, and I figured it would hit glass and go
in, or hit rim and go off. Coach told us to get the rebound or get
a foul doing it, and I like fouling. So I went in there figuring if
I didn't get it, I was gonna foul somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Now trailing by a point, sixth-seeded Florida (22-9) had one
more chance. Senior guard Eddie Shannon raced upcourt with the ball
and launched a three-pointer from the right that bounced off the
rim at the buzzer. As Gonzaga's players mobbed each other, Shannon
lay face down for several seconds before being helped to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, somebody had to lose,'' Shannon said later.
``And it was us.'' &QL;

OHIO STATE DEFEAT AUBURN, 72-64

<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The only team standing between St. John's and
the Final Four is one that finished 8-22 last season and was dead
last in the Big 10 with just one victory in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   That team is Ohio State and that scenario unfolded on Thursday
night when the Buckeyes, led by Boston College's former coach Jim
O'Brien and former point guard Scoonie Penn, eliminated Auburn,
72-64, setting up a match with St. John's for the South Regional
title on Saturday at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the continuation of a stunning resurgence for
the Buckeyes (26-8) in their second season under O'Brien. They were
second in the Big 10 this season, behind only Michigan State, the
top-seeded team in the Midwest Regional, and they were seeded
fourth in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Playing against top-seeded Auburn (29-4), Ohio State led at the
half by 31-26 behind 11 points from their other outstanding guard,
Michael Redd. But Ohio State's lead was just 62-61 with 1 minute 57
seconds left when Redd drew the fifth foul from Auburn's star
forward and leading scorer Chris Porter.
</P>
<P>
   Porter departed with 15 points and 11 rebounds and Redd hit both
free throws to extend the lead to 64-61. Then Penn, who transferred
to Ohio State to follow O'Brien, hit a 15-foot baseline jumper, 2
of his 24 points on 9-of-16 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   After a blocked shot by Ohio State forward Brian Brown on a
3-point attempt by Auburn, Brown led the fast break and sent a
behind-the-back bounce pass to a trailing Jason Singleton for a
dunk that gave Ohio State a 68-61 lead with 58.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that keeps hitting me between the eyes,'' said
O'Brien of his team, ``is how these guys have constantly come back
to accomplish a little bit more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when I ask, `Are they capable of going on and doing
more?,' they somehow surprise me.'' &QL;

CONNECTICUT OUTLASTS IOWA 78-68 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Connecticut and Iowa decided from the start that their
Round of 16 matchup in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament would boil down to this: One team was going down.
Literally. On the deck. With a push and a shove. No gentle nudge.
</P>
<P>
   This game got nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut took its blows and made sure its shots lasted
longer.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a game of survival and a game light on
artistry. There was a confrontational air to Connecticut and Iowa
on Thursday night, and the Huskies proved better at bump-and-grind
basketball, winning, 78-68, before 17,975 fans at America West
Arena. It was the largest crowd to watch a college basketball game
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Was it basketball, or football? The crowd must have wondered at
times. But it was basketball, elbow-in-your-back style, and a
rugged tussle for the final eight. Include Connecticut (31-2) in
that group. The Huskies withstood the Hawkeyes (20-10), who were
inspired by the emotion surrounding the forced departure of Coach
Tom Davis after 13 seasons at the school. The Huskies advanced and
will meet Gonzaga (28-6), a 73-72 winner over Florida on Thursday,
here on Saturday for the West Regional title and a trip to the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Richard Hamilton led Connecticut with 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 44-44 with 15 minutes 29 seconds to play,
and Connecticut led by only 59-55 with 6:15 left. But Iowa wilted
in the stretch _ tired, bruised and unable to match the punch of
Connecticut. It was the Huskies' insistence on running every
fast-break chance and their interior defense that also frustrated
Iowa. Connecticut handled Iowa's full-court pressure, responded to
each Hawkeye rally and simply was the more talented team with
stronger staying power.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minutes, Connecticut broke the game open, making
its free throws while Iowa kept missing its shots and fouling.
Talent and composure. Connecticut offered a convincing display.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut won the first half, 40-35, and, obviously, it was a
bit much for Joey Range, Iowa's freshman guard. Range is big for a
guard, 6 feet 5 inches and 200 pounds, and on Thursday night he
liked throwing that weight around. As the teams walked off the
floor at the half, Range, in a casual yet calculating fashion,
lifted an arm and nearly clotheslined Khalid El-Amin. It looked
more like Big Ten football move than a basketball one.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin ran after Range, and the two were separated by
teammates. A cheap shot by Range, no doubt, but would it work?
Would El-Amin be flustered? Would Connecticut? Both teams were
pushing and shoving and jawing throughout the first half.
Connecticut hoped that kind of play would be kept in check. Iowa
hoped the sideshow could be an equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, however, had no such luck in the first half. Iowa started
strong and shot the ball with vigor, displaying a nice touch. It
cooled as the half wore on, while Connecticut was steadier in
ball-handling, shot selection, defense and in its insistence on
playing the game at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut pushed.
</P>
<P>
   It took its rebounds and ran. It took its inbounds passes and
ran. It ran off Iowa's missed shots. It pushed and forced the
issue, forcing Iowa to keep up. The Hawkeyes could not, despite the
fact that that style is usually their game. In the half,
Connecticut led in fast-break points by 10-2. In order to fast
break, a team must rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton scored 12 points in the first half and El-Amin scored
11. No Iowa player reached double figures. El-Amin added five
assists and Ricky Moore four. Iowa remained close in the half
despite shooting 39.3 percent compared with Connecticut's 64
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's biggest lead in the half was 7 points. Four times
in the final six minutes it produced that lead, and on three of
those occasions the margin was supplied by baskets by Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is a team of size, shooters and determination. Those traits
helped it topple Alabama-Birmingham by 13 points and Arkansas by 10
points to reach this game. Tonight Iowa did not blink. Connecticut
is built the same way, inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   That is what made this game such a physical bout.

MAGIC DEFEAT KNICKS, 86-78 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once it ended, the Knicks began to hand out tired
excuses like pamphlets on a street corner. To many of them,
particularly Coach Jeff Van Gundy, New York screeched to a halt
against the Orlando Magic with an 86-78 loss because of sluggish
pulses and blank looks on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   But confronted with a Magic team that had forced the Knicks into
disarray for the season opener, and chest-to-chest with an opponent
ahead of them in the Atlantic Division, it was hard to fathom how
the Knicks could have been anything but jazzed to play on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   So it was hard to tell what was the bigger indictment of the
team: the thought that the Knicks were uninspired to play the
Magic, or the real possibility that, right now, they just aren't as
good as the top two teams in their division.
</P>
<P>
   The latter theory isn't popular in the Knicks' locker room. Only
a few entertain the idea. But the premise seems to be gaining
momentum after the Knicks ended their three-game winning streak
with the loss to the Magic as Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell
vanished into the dull air of Madison Square Garden. The Knicks
(14-10), now 0-4 against Miami and Orlando, finished out the fourth
quarter hitting just 5 of 21 shots after opening it with a horrid
1-for-10 stretch. That span allowed the Magic to make up a 10-point
third-quarter deficit and pass the confused Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this team was going to be tough,'' said Sprewell, who
was 0 for 7 in the second half after scoring 12 points to help give
the Knicks a 48-43 lead at halftime. ``It was a good challenge for
us to let us know where we're at. Obviously, we have some work to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not on par with the Magic, yet. The undermanned Magic
(18-7), missing the injured Charles (Bo) Outlaw and a flu-bitten
Nick Anderson, scrambled and scurried to cover the tandem of
Houston and Sprewell, both so deadly in the first half. With Coach
Chuck Daly using everyone, including 39-year-old Dominique Wilkins,
the Magic began to shut down and frustrate Sprewell and Houston in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was able to find easy post-up opportunities against the
rookie Matt Harpring in the second quarter, scoring 10 consecutive
points. Those disappeared once the bigger Wilkins began guarding
him. Houston's troubles were more self-inflicted. One minute he was
aggressively shaking free of Anfernee Hardaway for 11 first-half
points, the next half he was aimless as he hit 3 of his last 8
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got sucked into lazy basketball,'' Houston said. ``We just
couldn't pick up and get ourselves out of it. We just had no
energy, especially on offense. We just fell into a trap and never
got out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Armstrong made sure of it. The Magic's bolt of lightning
off the bench hit a 3-pointer with 47 seconds left to give his team
an 80-72 lead. Armstrong, who had 10 assists, finished with 18
points and Hardaway had 19, while the Knicks were led by Houston
(18 points) and Kurt Thomas (17 points). Under the shadow of Horace
Grant, Larry Johnson scored 4 points on a 1-for-7 night. The Knicks
lost the rebounding, 39-33.
</P>
<P>
   Once Sprewell began to struggle, so did the Knicks. The Magic
closed on the Knicks' 10-point lead in the third quarter and went
ahead, 72-70, in the fourth on a jumper off a pick-and-roll play by
the rookie Michael Doleac with 4:02 left in the game. Doleac had 10
points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Magic personnel, the Knicks were no match. They
turned the ball over three consecutive times and buckled under the
talented Magic. But Van Gundy, trying to explain the defeat, leaned
more toward his team's own energy level, not the matchup problems
the Magic caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seemed like we were a step slow,'' Van Gundy said. ``We're
a team that right now, without Patrick Ewing, if we're going to
win, we're going to have to play at our highest energy level. I
don't think we had that energy level that was good enough through
the game. And it was only masked in the first half by great
shooting.''

UCONN ENDS RUN FOR IOWA, DAVIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Connecticut won the game, but Tom Davis took the night
_ his last night, and his last game, as coach of the Iowa Hawkeyes.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to resign by athletic director Bob Bowlsby, Davis walked
out of America West Arena on Thursday night after a 78-68 Sweet 16
defeat and into Hawkeyes history. He departs with 269 wins in 13
years at Iowa. He never reached the Final Four and made the Elite
Eight once.
</P>
<P>
   He won, but not enough, and because of it endured a season
unlike any other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just sorting things out,'' Davis said. ``You could imagine
how draining it is. I don't know that I've ever put more into a
team. Emotionally as well as physically, I'm drained. I've got to
step away for a bit and see what's what.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he has coached his final game anywhere, Davis hedged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' he said. ``Honestly, I've tried to put
thoughts of that out of my mind. Before I make an intelligent
decision, I've got to get away for a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis coached to the end, directing his substitutes with 1.9
seconds and a 10-point deficit. Afterward, he hugged his players,
embraced Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun, then appeared to brush back
tears when Huskies All-American Richard Hamilton tracked him down
from behind to offer congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I hope I have a chance to try to beat you again,' ''
Calhoun said. ``He's a credit to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkeyes seemed ready to extend Davis' career by at least
one game when they rallied from a 40-35 halftime deficit to tie the
game several times midway through the second half _ the last coming
at 53-53 with 10 minutes left. But Iowa never got the lead and
never got control, as Hamilton scored six of his game-high 24
points to repel each Hawkeyes spurt.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut secured the victory during a 3:26-minute span late
in the second half in which Iowa failed to convert several chances
to keep the margin close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get a break, a basket or a defensive stop,'' Iowa
center J.R. Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Mouring's 3-pointer gave Connecticut a 64-57 lead with
5:10 remaining, and Iowa responded with four scoreless possessions.
The Hawkeyes committed one turnover and missed a layup, a tip-in,
two short jumpers and a wild 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jess Settles converted a rebound with two minutes
remaining, Connecticut had a double-digit lead and its second Elite
Eight appearance in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies are a No. 10 seed (Gonzaga) away from their first
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gonzaga's a better team than Iowa,'' Huskies guard Ricky Moore
said. ``They play quicker, and they're going to give us a good
game.''

BULLS BEAT NETS, 104-95 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ _ Stephon Marbury, who shot 47 percent in his first
three games with the New Jersey Nets, could not find the rim in his
fourth. Missing 17 of 24 shots on Thursday night, Marbury fell into
that dark shooting hole that has engulfed the Nets all season. The
result was another embarrassing loss, 104-95, to the no-name
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   After Chicago broke away for a 15-point lead in the third
quarter, the only suspense that remained was whether the Bulls
(7-16) would reach triple digits for the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of the United Center's sellout crowd, they did
when Toni Kukoc scored the final 2 of his 21 points on two free
throws with 1 minute 1 second remaining. Not since whipping the
Nets by 103-87 on March 9 had the Bulls' offense been so prolific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ball is too big and the rim is too small,'' said
Jayson Williams, who had 15 points and 10 rebounds. ``I think we
need to be playing with hard balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kittles was the only Net to display any touch, making 8 of
14 shots in scoring 20 points. New Jersey was pleased to see its
third-year shooting guard find the range since he entered the game
shooting a career-low 33.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately for the Nets, Kittles's teammates were not as
accurate. Keith Van Horn shot 6 for 17 in scoring 15 points.
Kendall Gill was 2 for 8 in scoring 7, and Marbury, his jump shot
having deserted him, was obviously just as bad. He still finished
with a deceiving stat line of 24 points and 10 assists, but anyone
who saw the game knows that his performance was poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the ball in his hands a lot because we're groping,''
said Don Casey, now 1-2 as the interim coach. ``So statistically,
his numbers are a little misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury said the inaccuracy was due to fatigue, since the Nets
were playing their third game in three nights. ``They all felt
good,'' he said. ``They all felt like they were going in. But I
don't think I had the lift that I usually have on my jump shot.''
</P>
<P>
   What was a close game at halftime got out of hand in the third
quarter, when Chicago outscored the Nets by 30-19 to go ahead,
80-65. Harper, who blitzed the Nets for a season-high 25 points
last week, scored 10 points in the period to lead the Bulls.
Looking almost Jordanesque, the 35-year-old guard flew through the
air and the Nets' defense for a couple of stylish slam dunks.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, who made most of their third-quarter run with an
unsung lineup of Harper, Rusty LaRue, Kornel David, Mark Bryant and
Cory Carr, were not always so dominant.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets got off to a blistering start, making 7 of 13 shots to
take an 18-14 lead. Marbury, who averaged 24 points in his first
three games with the Nets, was more the playmaker in the early
going, assisting teammates on six of the team's seven baskets. But
the chemistry seemed to disappear over the next four minutes, as
Chicago ran off 16 straight points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets missed eight consecutive shots during the Bulls' run,
but righted themselves with a 15-3 spurt that began in the last
minute of the first quarter and continued into the second. The run
was truly a team effort as five Nets contributed points to tie the
game at 33.
</P>
<P>
   The United Center, of course, was the site of the last three of
the six National Basketball Association championships the Bulls won
under Phil Jackson. With the coach having stepped down after last
season, speculation is rampant about where his next coaching stop
will be.
</P>
<P>
   Six clubs, including the Nets, have been in contact with
Jackson, who has been intrigued by New Jersey's tremendous young
talent pool, but interests outside of basketball might keep him
away from the game for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Already a speaker at fund-raisers and corporate gatherings for
the former Senator Bill Bradley's Presidential campaign, Jackson
might become more active in promoting the Presidential bid of his
former Knicks teammate, which would keep him out of coaching until
the 2000-2001 season.

DUCKS HAVE KINGS' NUMBER AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Kings finally managed to find some holes
in Guy Hebert late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   But they found them too late.
</P>
<P>
   Down three goals to the Mighty Ducks on home ice in a crucial
game, the Kings suddenly awoke in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   First, Donald Audette scored on a power play with 8:23 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Then, capitalizing on his speed, Russ Courtnall beat two Ducks
defensemen and goalie Hebert, drawing the Kings to within one with
4:42 to play.
</P>
<P>
   It was as close as the Kings would get, however, as the Ducks
held on for a 4-2 victory before a crowd of 12,037 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne's second goal of the game, with 3:09 to play,
ended the Kings' comeback hopes. Jason Marshall and Paul Kariya
also scored for the Ducks. Selanne has 39 goals, tying him for the
league lead with Ottawa's Alexei Yashin.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have won all five meetings with the Kings this season,
by a 15-5 margin. On the year, Hebert has stopped 166 of 171 shots
by the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by the Ducks (31-27-11) snapped a four-game winless
streak and moved them to within five points of the Phoenix Coyotes
in the battle for the fourth playoff spot in the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The loss by the Kings (26-37-5) ended their three-game winning
streak and kept them from gaining ground on the idle Calgary
Flames, who they trail by five points in the race for the final
playoff spot in the West. Making matters worse for the Kings, they
lost checking center Sean Pronger indefinitely to a sprained left
knee after a first-period collision with the Mighty Ducks' Travis
Green.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had numerous scoring chances during a first period, in
which they outshot the Ducks 16-9. But at 14:24, with a delayed
penalty on Olli Jokinen being signaled by referee Don Koharski for
checking Marshall from behind, Marshall arose, drove to the net and
banged in the rebound of a shot by Kariya, giving the Mighty Ducks
a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minute of the first period, the Kings almost tied
the score when a 75-footer by Rob Blake beat Hebert to the glove
side but clanked off the right goal post.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 12 seconds into the second period, Blake pulled down
Kariya on a breakaway, and Koharski awarded Kariya a penalty shot.
Kariya handled the penalty shot in fairly straightforward fashion,
firing a point-blank forehand shot that hit goalie Stephane Fiset
on the left shoulder and caromed over the net.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed, perhaps, to be the break the Kings needed, especially
less than two minutes later, when Glen Murray broke in alone on
Hebert. But his shot hit the crossbar and bounded over the net.
Before the period was through, another Blake shot would catch the
post.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert made some key saves in the game, too, particularly a kick
save late in the first period on a Luc Robitaille breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   While Hebert and the goal posts were shutting down the Kings,
the Ducks were putting the game away with two power-play goals.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second period, Selanne got behind Sean
O'Donnell and scored off a pass from Marty McInnis for a 2-0 lead.
The goal snapped a streak of 15 consecutive Mighty Ducks power
plays without a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the third period, Kariya maneuvered around
O'Donnell and fired a 30-footer past Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   Audette scored on a similar shot to snap Hebert's shutout bid,
and Courtnall then drew the Kings within one when he beat Kevin
Haller, then Marshall, then Hebert. But 1:33 later, Selanne scored
off a Kariya pass on a 2-on-1. Kariya had four points in the game
and Selanne three.

THIS CINDERELLA HAS AN ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
BICKLEY Bickley: Gonzaga an underdog, but not intimidated 
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - They are a bunch of guys you'd find at the YMCA.
Calling their own fouls, arguing over shirts and skins, running
lunch-hour contenders off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Guys you'd expect to show up at a pizza parlor, order a few
pitchers of beer and plop their recreational league trophy on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly the kind of outfit you expect to show up in March and
tug at your underdog loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   They are Gonzaga. They are hot. Off to the Elite Eight, destined
for a night with Letterman, representing a school experiencing a
mad rush in merchandise sales.
</P>
<P>
   The flavor of the month, if not a legitimate fad.
</P>
<P>
   But this is where you check yourselves. For starters, Gonzaga is
no fluke. They are 28-6, well-rounded and well-coached. They are
not the least bit warm or fuzzy. And they are not checking the
clock for midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a saying we have,'' forward Richie Frahm said. ``If we
get a glass slipper offered to us, we're going to crack it over
your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they have no shot Saturday against Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll need a lot of luck,'' Frahm conceded. ``They're a great
team.''
</P>
<P>
   True, and sentiment had no shot against the Huskies on Thursday.
Connecticut ended the run of Iowa and the cornfield career of Tom
Davis in workmanlike fashion, plowing through the emotion and a
plethora of cheap shots. And now Dr. Feel Good will walk off into
the sunset, pushed out of his job by a callous administration,
rumored to be replaced by Steve Alford.
</P>
<P>
   And the only thing separating Connecticut from the Final Four is
this quirky school from Spokane, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 40 minutes against a great Gonzaga team,'' Connecticut
coach Jim Calhoun said. ``That stuff about Cinderella . . . the
slipper broke a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, sometimes the better team doesn't win, and there was
certainly a sense of destiny apparent on Thursday. As Gonzaga
stared at defeat, down by one with 19 seconds left against Florida,
the players were screaming at point guard Quentin Hall to foul
somebody. Hall heard the desperate pleas, but . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Something just held me back,'' Hall said, laughing
uncontrollably. ``I guess it was the man upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, the guy Hall was supposed to foul inexplicably
traveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you,'' Hall said. ``Something just blocked me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga is named for a Jesuit priest who died trying to comfort
the sick during a 16th-century plague in Rome. Divine intervention
for a basketball game?
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, it was hunger,'' said Father Tony Lehmann, a
man who has been behind the bench for every Gonzaga game since
1982. ``Just a decision they made not to let it slip through their
fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the ending, a wild tip-in from Casey Calvary, which somehow
made sense.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of every Gonzaga practice, they run a drill. A coach
throws the ball off the basket and 15 guys fight for the rebound.
When you get three rebounds, you're excused from the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my favorite drill,'' Calvary said. ``I have an anger
management problem. Sometimes, I want to turn it into a boxing
match out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga is a smart team. They pass the ball wonderfully well,
and they pass with passion and trust. They know how to pick apart
defenses. They're content to play as a team. But more than
anything, they have nasty. And lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   No shortage of attitude with this group, a team that won't back
down from the Huskies, no matter what the spread says on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just goes along with playing for a small school that
doesn't get a lot of notoriety or press,'' Santangelo said. ``So
we're always out to prove something. By all means, there's a chip
on our shoulder. There are people who can't pronounce our name, let
alone know where we're from. So, yeah, that adds to the
motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough bunch, but no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people think of Gonzaga as an un-athletic team just because
we have a bunch of White guys, they're wrong,'' Calvary said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they're wrong and Gonzaga is right. The perfect symbol for
a tournament that never lets you down. &QL;

GATORS WILL RELIVE 1 THAT GOT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Brent Wright sat on the floor Thursday night, his
jersey pulled over his head. In a matter of seconds, Gonzaga
snatched victory away from Florida, and the 6-foot-8 sophomore felt
at fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it got away,'' he said. ``It was right there.
We had it. Then, everything . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The final seconds ticking down, his team hanging on to a
one-point lead, Wright, under the Gonzaga basket, thought about
passing to Major Parker. Then he thought about calling a timeout
when he saw Parker covered and point guard Quentin Hall suddenly in
his face. Then he traveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he gave me the timeout, but the ref said I
traveled,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen seconds remained, with the West Regional final at
America West Arena still in sight for the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators had the perimeter covered. Hall drove and pulled up
for a jumper. The Gators didn't block out Casey Calvary. Wright
said he felt Calvary come over his back for the tip with four
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to jump and he was already up in the air and he got
the ball,'' Wright said. ``We had a chance to win the game. All we
had to do was rebound. But we didn't block out.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior guard Eddie Shannon couldn't get his rushed shot from
behind the arc to fall at the end, and the Gators, who after
falling behind by 13, after making only 1 of 11 three-pointers in
the first half, were left with a sick feeling to take into next
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators never led until guard Kenyan Weaks' three-point play
gave them a 39-37 lead in the first minute of the second half. They
lost the lead on Gonzaga's next possession, a Richie Frahm
three-pointer, and the Gators, falling behind by eight, didn't lead
again until senior Greg Stolt's three-pointer gave them a 59-58
edge with 6:45 left.
</P>
<P>
   Stolt, ending his Florida career, nailed his third three-pointer
of the half with 45 seconds left for a 72-69 lead. But it was for
naught.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough way to lose,'' Weaks said. ``I'd rather lose by
50 than the way that game ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Billy Donovan called it frustrating, having the season end
``on a freak play.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon couldn't get up after missing as the buzzer sound. He
sat in agony, not far from where Wright was in tears, his face
covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was the last game I would ever play for Florida,''
said Shannon, who led the comeback with seven assists and two
steals. ``I knew it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   But not for most of the Gators. All but Shannon and Stolt
return.
</P>
<P>
   And they'll have a long off-season to recover, the surreal 73-72
ending playing endlessly in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the game of basketball, but life has got to go on,''
Parker said. ``It would have been great to be on the other end of
the stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we've got to do is eliminate the taste we've got in our
mouths tonight, and, a week from now, get back into the gym and
work harder.'' &QL;

NCAA IS STRICTLY BY THE BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's as if someone hired an interior decorator.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA flounced into America West Arena, rolled its eyes at
the furnishings and immediately began changing everything.
</P>
<P>
   ````That's'' got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   What?
</P>
<P>
   ``That ``laundry'' up there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' Western Conference banners. The Rattlers' championship
banner. And the Suns' retired jersey numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beer sign, too. And get rid of that gaudy orange thing
painted on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The makeover began early Tuesday morning. Workers covered the
Suns' midcourt logo with a huge blue circle that reads ``NCAA.''
They erased the NBA three-point line. They blacked out all
advertising signs in the lower third of the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Then they hung blue drapes, acres of them, throughout the
building. Within 48 hours, the home of the Suns, Coyotes, Rattlers
and Mercury was so completely transformed that America West Arena
looked just like Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford,
N.J., and the Trans World Dome in St. Louis and Thompson-Boling
Arena in Knoxville, Tenn., the other regional sites of the NCAA
Division I men's basketball championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want every site to look exactly the same,'' said Bill
Hancock, who runs the Big Dance. ``We want it to be a ``college''
arena.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to organization and a commitment to uniformity,
Hancock literally wrote the book. The NCAA's 2-inch-thick
tournament operations manual determined everything that happened
under the arena roof Thursday night except the outcome of the
semifinal games, won by 10th-seeded Gonzaga and top-seeded
Connecticut. The Bulldogs and Huskies will play Saturday, with the
champion advancing to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's pledge is to treat every team in the tournament
equally. College athletics' governing body bends over backward not
to play favorites, and if you've tried bending over backward and
aren't a gymnast, you know how hard that is.
</P>
<P>
   Each tournament team may play its alma mater and fight song, but
NCAA rules limit the size of the pep band to 30 members. Big
schools with large bands have to make hard decisions. Do they cut a
flutist or the clarinet player? Gonzaga, a small school, has only
20 in its pep band. To reach the maximum number of musicians, the
NCAA allowed Gonzaga to recruit 10 trumpets and trombones from its
jazz program.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has a 12-cheerleaders limit. According to the
tournament manual, a school may ``rent'' cheerleaders _ seriously _
but ``only'' if the school doesn't have any. Can you really rent
cheerleaders? If so, what's the deposit?
</P>
<P>
   According to NCAA rules, only one (1) costumed mascot may
represent the school during tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   The night Arizona won the national championship, Wilma Wildcat _
or was it Wilbur? _ stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   None of the four teams here was assigned to the Suns' locker
room, which is spacious and carpeted and has a whirlpool bath and
big-screen TV. Careful not to favor one school over another,
Connecticut was assigned the more modest NBA visitors' locker room,
Florida the NHL visitors' locker room. Gonzaga and Iowa dressed in
multipurpose rooms that have about the same square footage.
</P>
<P>
   While it tasted better, Gonzaga's post-game box dinner was the
same as Florida's last meal.
</P>
<P>
   One sandwich. One bag of chips. One orange. Two cookies.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA provided the media the same meal at all four regional
sites. Hot dogs and turkey sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to serve gumbo,'' Hancock said, and it was
difficult to tell by his straight face whether Bill, a longtime
friend, was serious. OK, so why didn't you? Hancock said, ``People
who got to New Orleans would have an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock picked up his leather-bound manual and smiled at its
weight. The guidebook is not as big as the Valley Yellow Pages but
it's every bit as comprehensive. Every rule imaginable is written
there. Here's one, for example:
</P>
<P>
   ``Spirit squads may use megaphones for voice amplification but
not as a'' ``distraction''.``''
</P>
<P>
   The manual then defines what the NCAA considers a distraction.
Pounding them on the floor. Striking them with your hands or waving
them ``in any way''.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know the punishment for such a violation, or if a
cheerleader ever has been caught. But if the day should come when a
school is given a technical foul for improper use of a megaphone
and the other team ends up shooting a free throw to win the
national championship, it would be a crying shame, not to mention
the cause for a student riot, and probably one whiz-bang lawsuit. &QL;

FAME, AND HIGH PRICE TAGS, CLING TO STARS' OSCAR GOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First there was the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
auction with the $574,500 humidor and the $442,500 rocking chair.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Diana auction with the $222,500 blue velvet
dress, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor auction with the
$415,000 mahogany table.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, in the latest manifestation of celebrity
auction mania, the dress that Elizabeth Taylor wore to the Academy
Awards 30 years ago _ a periwinkle blue and violet gown with a
V-shaped front that plunged to approximately there _ went for
$150,000. It was bought by a toy maker that outbid a
cable-television network by $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five thousand over budget,'' said the losing bidder,
Kate McEnroe, the head of American Movie Classics.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel Inc., the toy maker that is the couturier to millions of
Barbies and Chatty Cathys, did not send anyone to Christie's Park
Avenue auction room, where a standing-room crowd oohed and aahed as
the price climbed past five figures and into six. A Mattel
executive was at the other end of an open telephone line, matching
Ms. McEnroe bid for bid in $5,000 jumps.
</P>
<P>
   Listening in on another line was Miss Taylor, who has been
closely identified with raising money for AIDS charities. Proceeds
from the sale of 56 dresses worn to Academy Awards ceremonies over
four decades _ a total of $786,120, including buyers' premiums that
added 15 percent to the bids _ went to the American Foundation for
AIDS Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with the results,'' said Mathilde Krim,
chairwoman of the foundation's board. ``A lot of research can be
done with this kind of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The price for Miss Taylor's gown was the highest ever paid for a
dress at auction after the Diana dress, according to Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   The second-most-expensive dress sold on Thursday night went to
another cable network. The Home Shopping Network bid $70,000 for
the robe-like black outer garment and the dove-gray ball skirt that
Madonna wore to the 1997 Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   But while a handful of dresses sold in the $20,000 range, the
prices overall were less stratospheric than at the Onassis or Diana
sales. The crowd was younger and less moneyed than at the Onassis
auction, and the Oscar-night fashions lacked the historical
resonance of some of the Kennedy memorabilia. The dresses were not
even the costumes from the films that made the actresses famous,
just what they wore to a certain ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Some auctiongoers sounded almost like bargain-hunters. ``I think
that this auction was a good buy,'' said Troy Segal, who paid
$5,000 for Barbara Hershey's emerald-green evening dress from the
1996 Academy Awards, when she was nominated for best supporting
actress for ``Portrait of a Lady.'' ``In the grand scheme of
things, it's a Versace,'' said Ms. Segal. ``Of course, if I can't
wear it at all, it will turn out to be a horrible buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Clehane, a freelance entertainment reporter from
Scarsdale, N.Y., sounded more certain. ``I got one of the best
dresses for three grand,'' she said after landing the aqua
silk-satin and cashmere dress that Claire Danes wore to the 1996
Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a long history of spending a lot on clothes, but not
that much this time _ and this was the first auction I'd ever been
to,'' Ms. Clehane said. ``It's amazing how your heart gets
racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering how much attention is paid to who wears what at the
Academy Awards, it was not surprising that the auction seemed to
draw more fashion followers than film fans. There were those with
crystal-clear memories of the dresses they were bidding on.
</P>
<P>
   Some bidders tried for a number of dresses, raising their hands
again and again and hoping the other bidders would drop out before
their budgets ran out. Others, like Jaime Rodriguez, a Bronx
restaurateur, waited for that one and only dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jennifer dress, for me, that's excitement,'' said
Rodriguez, whose $5,500 bid got him the sleeveless, asymmetrical
Badgley Mischka dress that Jennifer Lopez wore to the 1996
ceremony. ``I figure, it's a great cause, bringing Jennifer back to
the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Korb, who said she was Uma Thurman's real estate agent,
concentrated on the lavender silk chiffon evening dress that Ms.
Thurman wore to the 1994 Academy Awards, when she was nominated for
best supporting actress in ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Korb started bidding when the dress was in the $1,000 range
and the bids were rising by $100 each time. She dropped out when
the price topped $3,000 and each jump was $500. It eventually sold
for $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came to see her dress the other night and was having sad
thoughts about it,'' Ms. Korb said. ``If I'd gotten it, I think
she'd have wanted me to give it back. I earned a big commission
when she bought her house, and if she buys a more expensive house,
I could do it next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Oscar get-ups got more down-to-earth bids. Mark Canno, a
real-estate developer whose wife bid $5,500 for the butterscotch
evening dress that Elizabeth Shue wore last year, said that he was
surprised that gowns that had belonged to better-known actresses
went for less money than some that had come from the closets of
younger, lesser-known stars. A Raquel Welch dress sold for $5,500,
while a black jersey evening dress that Rita Wilson wore to the
1994 ceremony went for $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, spousal star power may have had something to do with
the price of Ms. Wilson's dress. As Canno noted, Ms. Wilson was
accompanied by her husband, Tom Hanks, when she wore the dress, and
it was the night he won the Oscar for best actor in ``Forrest
Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's officials said that Mattel made two other purchases
on Thursday night. One _ an all-black creation that combined a
velvet dressmaker's coat by Giorgio Armani, a skirt by Valentino
and a T-shirt from the Gap _ was the ensemble that Sharon Stone
wore in 1995, when she was nominated for best actress for
``Casino'' and was the presenter in the best dramatic score.
Mattel's winning bid was $8,500.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel also bid $10,000 for a Richard Tyler ivory gabardine
tuxedo that Diane Keaton wore to the 1992 Oscars, when she was a
presenter. For its bid, Mattel got a suit vest with silk-covered
buttons, a pair of matching trousers, a tuxedo jacket with
silk-satin peaked lapels and an ivory silk-satin tie.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McKendall said the company bought Miss Taylor's dress
``because we have a relationship with her'' _ the company created a
``one-of-a-kind Elizabeth Taylor doll'' for an AIDS charity in Los
Angeles whose founders include Mattel's chief executive, Jill
Barad, she said. The dress showed off Miss Taylor's tiny waist and
violet eyes, but was really designed to call attention to a
69.42-carat diamond necklace, a present from Richard Burton, her
husband at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Ms. McEnroe leave empty-handed. After a long round of
back-and-forth bidding, her $50,000 got the forest green ensemble
that Kate Winslet wore to the 1997 Academy Awards when she was
nominated for best supporting actress. She also bid $8,500 for the
Christian Lacroix dress that Kristin Scott-Thomas wore to the 1996
Academy Awards, when she was nominated for best actress for ``The
English Patient.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in her other role as the head of Romance Classics, Ms.
McEnroe spent $40,000 on the silver-beaded Edith Head evening dress
that Janet Leigh wore to the 1959 Oscars and $8,000 on a cocktail
dress that was designed for Marlene Dietrich and was worn to the
1983 Academy Awards by Jamie Lee Curtis, when she was escorted by
Dietrich's grandson, Michael Riva.

behind the bench and chucked it onto the ice like a javelin.
</P>

   That decision Tuesday by Roger Nielson cost the Flyers' bench
boss a two-game suspension and a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   During portions of Thursday's game here between the Coyotes and
the St. Louis Blues, both Jim Schoenfeld and Joel Quenneville had
moments when they probably wanted to do the same thing _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But when it was over, both coaches managed to find something
positive out of a series of negatives during a seesaw 2-2 draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a tired team,'' Schoenfeld said. ``We were on our third
game in four nights, and with the travel . . . So to have the
energy to mount a comeback I think again is a real good statement
from our men. I was pleased how they hung in there for each other
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of one St. Louis goal that was whistled dead
and another Blues' score disallowed due to a crease violation, the
Coyotes scored twice in the third period to take the lead, despite
being thoroughly outshot up to that point.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Adams redirected a slap shot from Jeremy Roenick for the
first one at the 8:05 mark, and Mike Stapleton found the net for
the third time in four games with nine minutes left on a skipping
shot he ripped from just inside the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   But Pavol Demitra sent it into overtime on his team-leading 32nd
goal with 7:42 remaining on a mad three-man dash into the Coyotes'
zone with defenseman Jeff Finley and Al MacInnis.
</P>
<P>
   Newly acquired goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov, making his second
start in as many days, came up with 29 saves to preserve the point
for Phoenix. The Coyotes put 22 on veteran Grant Fuhr, but only
eight in the first 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The tie left the Coyotes (33-24-12) undefeated in their last
four games (2-0-2) after dropping 11 of their previous 13 to come
dangerously close to losing their grip on the fourth playoff seed
in the Western Conference. Thanks to their recent wake-up call,
however, home ice in the first round of the postseason now looks
reasonably safe.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was safe Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite outgunning the Coyotes with an aircraft-carrier amount
of sorties on Shtalenkov _ they outshot Phoenix, 16-3, in the first
period alone _ the Blues only had a 1-0 lead entering the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Shtalenkov gave us a chance to win the hockey
game,'' Schoenfeld said. ``He made a couple point-blank saves
there.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the officials, according to the Blues. After former
Coyote Mike Eastwood scored on a breakaway due partly to a slow
Phoenix line change, Michel Picard had a goal turned down because
of a quick whistle by referee Richard Trottier.
</P>
<P>
   Then Demitra had one called back in the second period when
Picard was nailed for being in the crease before the puck arrived.
But what really made St. Louis feel like Arch Madness was a refuted
``no call'' by Trottier on Adams, whom Fuhr animatedly complained
had knocked him down as Stapleton's shot came in front the point.
</P>
<P>
   Did he?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Adams said, adding, ``I don't remember. I don't know
what he was upset about.''
</P>
<P>
   Quenneville said Adams had delivered an elbow toward the
goalie's head and screamed, along with Fuhr, for an interference
penalty, which would have nullified the score. Not so, according to
Trottier.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Adams) was already there, facing the shot. He's not in the
goal crease. He's allowed to stand there,'' the referee explained.
``Grant came out of the goal crease to stop the puck, and they ran
into each other. There was no intent to interfere with the
goaltender. That was my explanation to Grant.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr, still hopping mad, was not immediately available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter anyway,'' quipped Blues enforcer Tony Twist.
``He was screaming so much, he lost his voice, and he can't talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes now have had four apparent goals against them
disallowed or waved off in the past three games. &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - When it comes to the Standard Register PING, Dawn
Coe-Jones has a history of showing early speed. She led this
tournament after the first round in 1997 and was among the leaders
in Round 1 of the '96 and '93 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   But Coe-Jones never ran faster than she did during Thursday's
opening round, when a swarm of bees flew into view as she
approached the 11th hole at Moon Valley Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I heard someone yell `Bees!' I turned around and
bolted for cover and started hiding in some lady's driveway,'' said
the Canadian, who is allergic to the insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Playing partner) Betsy (King) was tugging on the door of a
house, trying to get in there. She was as terrified as I was. Being
allergic to them, and having gone through all the shots to build up
all the immunities, well, I don't want to test that by getting
stung.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like they could make a movie out of all the bees,
but there was a lot of them. It was a brutal-looking group.
Scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Coe-Jones said she made a ``shaky'' 5-foot par at the 11th, then
went on to finish off her day with a bogey-free, 7-under 65 that
had the galleries buzzing. That left her 1 shot in front of Tracy
Hanson and Lori Kane, as scores were better than some had predicted
because of the substandard condition of the greens.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Coe-Jones said she benefited by Moon Valley's
problematic putting surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been struggling,'' said Coe-Jones, whose best finish in
five starts this season has been a tie for 31st. ``When the greens
are perfect and you don't make a birdie, you feel like the world
passed you by. But when they're not that good, it helps you because
you know it's not going to be a putting match.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the greens aren't that bad. You can make a putt on them.
Obviously, they're not what the superintendent would have liked.''
</P>
<P>
   That Coe-Jones led was not the biggest surprise of the day. She
has three top-10 finishes here, including a runner-up in '93 and a
tie for third in '92.
</P>
<P>
   No, the biggest shocker was defending champ Liselotte Neumann,
who was stung by an 82, which tied her for the high round of the
day. The Swede, who has a reputation as a rock-solid player,
suffered two double bogeys and closed out her day with four
straight bogeys. She was unavailable for comment, but her caddie,
Mark Scott, summed up the disaster well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad day at the office,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other players of note fared better. Last week's winner,
Juli Inkster, was in a star-studded group at 4 under. She was
joined by Karrie Webb, a two-time winner this year, and Laura
Davies, the four-time Standard Register PING champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not making any mistakes. When I miss, I'm not getting
hurt,'' said Inkster, who made just one bogey and closed with
back-to-back birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, who is averaging an incredible 68.42 strokes per round
this season and is 41 under through her last nine rounds,
highlighted her day with a chip-in eagle at No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running on a lot of confidence,'' said the Australian, who
credits her improved play this year to a switch she made to
cross-handed putting.
</P>
<P>
   Davies also is feeling extremely good about her game and her
return to Moon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood on the first tee, and I felt comfortable,'' said
Davies, who made a 15-foot eagle putt at the eighth hole. ``Last
week in Tucson, I stood on the first tee and thought, `God, I hope
I don't miss the cut.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Alfredsson, who has five top-10 finishes in as many
events, also was among the red-numbered brigade, opening with a 69.
Scottsdale's Tina Barrett also carded that score.
</P>
<P>
   The shot of the day was recorded by Hanson, who holed out a
5-wood from 185 yards to eagle the par-4 sixth hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't particularly like the shot because it was fading,''
Hanson said. ``But two bounces and it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the pre-tournament favorites got out of the blocks on
a warm, sunny day. Annika Sorenstam, the two-time Player of the
Year, was at 72, along with Kelly Robbins and Scottsdale's Meg
Mallon. Hall of Famer Nancy Lopez also shot 72.
</P>
<P>
   There were others, such as LPGA Rookie of the Year Se Ri Pak,
who could no better than 74.
</P>
<P>
   And, obviously, the bees affected King much more than they did
Coe-Jones. The Hall of Famer from Scottsdale ended up with a 77.
Ouch!

HUMILIATION, HUMOR AT HEART OF ROOKIE-VET ERAN RELATION SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX It drove Dante Powell to cross-dressing and Rod Beck to
singing Eddie Rabbitt hits.
</P>
<P>
   It's the rookie-veteran relationship, one of baseball's best
subplots because of the humor, drama and friendships that evolve.
The roots often can be traced to the spring training clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Seattle pitcher Ryan Anderson, who made the mistake
last season of feeling a little too confident after facing Mariners
veterans in batting practice for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dominated them,'' he told a reporter. ``I don't want to say
it, but I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the newspaper article was posted in the Peoria
Stadium clubhouse, with this note: ``I am the greatest. Just ask
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. circulated a phony letter on
Mariners stationery and put it in Anderson's locker, along with a
case of baseballs. The letter read, ``From all the players. Would
you sign this case of baseballs? . . . We would be honored and
cherish it forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulp.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson should have sought advice from Chicago Cubs infielders
Mark Grace and Jeff Blauser.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old adage: Rookies are to be seen and not heard,''
said Grace, who broke in with the Cubs in 1988. ``I made sure I was
as quiet as a church mouse and minding my own business. I still got
my share of (expletive), but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Of his debut with Atlanta in 1987, Blauser said, ``My first
spring training, I had a corner locker in the clubhouse. And that's
where I stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the changing face of the game has altered the
relationships between veterans and newcomers _ some rookies make
more money than their experienced peers _ it's still a given that
humiliation will be a part of a young player's career.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it comes at the team party. Beck was required to stand
up and sing Rabbitt's ``Driving My Life Away'' for his San
Francisco peers in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Was it difficult?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, after a few drinks, it's like karaoke,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates made him sing again in '92, a season in which he
posted 17 saves and a 1.76 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I ain't singing. If I were a rookie this season, I'd
be Rookie of the Year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates didn't forget his bravado and, at the end of the
season, gave him ``this big . . . trophy to carry home on the
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks rookie Powell, whose major league debut came with
San Francisco in 1997, returned to his clubhouse locker one day and
found that his suit had been replaced by a rather unattractive
dress. His Giants teammates insisted he wear it home, a journey
that included a stroll through San Francisco International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``People stared, but I tried to have fun with it,'' he said.
``It was this wool thing, with a big disco collar and happy faces
all over it. I tried to take it as a way of the team saying, `Yeah,
we like you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I haven't had it too bad. For the most part, you just
try to keep quiet and do your own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace had the same philosophy, but it didn't keep him from being
the target of periodic verbal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it was good-natured, some wasn't,'' he said. ``A lot
of guys were rough. There were a few times I was like, `Man, if
this is the way it is in the big leagues, I'd like to go back to
Triple-A.' They berate you. You get absolutely no respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Blauser, ``You'd get treated like dirt. (The veterans) let
you know that you don't know very much about how to play the game
at this particular level. More than anything, they just let you
know that you're low man on the totem pole. The second you seem to
forget that, they're right there to put you back in your place.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all rookie-veteran relationships are based on humiliation.
Several rookies say they are benefiting from the experienced
players' guidance, from how to hit a changeup to how to conduct
yourself properly off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Most veterans recall players who took them under their wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave Righetti and Jeff Brantley really took care of me and
showed me how things were supposed to be,'' Beck said. ``I really
appreciated that. I feel now like it's my turn to take care of the
younger guys. You pass it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Monetary benefits could be in store for rookies, especially when
it's time to go out to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't touch my wallet for four or five years,'' Beck said.
``I'd go to reach for it and get slapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Giants outfielder Stan Javier, ``When you're with a rookie,
you usually pay. It's not so much about salaries, though _ it's
about time spent in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   A rookie's first spring training and season is often memorable.
San Francisco pitcher Mark Gardner, who debuted with Montreal,
remembers the thrill of sharing space with players such as Hubie
Brooks, Bryn Smith and Tim Raines.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were guys I used to watch play, wanting to be in their
shoes, and now my locker is next to them,'' he said. ``It took a
while to get over the awe.''
</P>
<P>
   The awe factor seems less prominent these days. Maybe it's the
rookies' big signing bonuses, or a reflection of societal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, veterans have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed,'' Beck said. ``Some of the younger guys don't
necessarily respect the opinion of a player that's been around as
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Grace, ``Some of these first-round picks that come up for
the first time, they're being paid $2 million to sign and probably
make more money than half the veterans, so their attitude is, `Why
do I have to listen to these guys?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the reason is because they're older than you, and
they're wiser than you, and you can learn a lot from them, no
matter how much money you make. Unfortunately, everybody seems to
think that money is the status symbol. I've got news for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening, rookies?

SUPERBIKE SCORING UNDER FIRE  
 WINNING NOT WORTH ENOUGH, RACERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Mat Mladin believes the American Motorcyclist
Association Superbike scoring system is a joke. He calls the format
antiquated and says it rewards consistency more than winning.
</P>
<P>
   Mladin isn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   Defending series champion Ben Bostrom, who greatly benefited
from the system Mladin is knocking, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mat's right,'' said Bostrom, who won the title on a Honda
without winning a single race. ``I was trying to win races last
year, but as soon as I saw the opportunity to win the championship,
I just sort of cruised.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bostrom said he didn't think he deserved an asterisk
for capturing the crown without a trip into victory lane, he also
thought Mladin made a valid argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about who's winning each race,'' said Bostrom, who is
riding for Vance &AMP; Hines Ducati this season, which continues Sunday
with the AMA Cruise America Arizona Superbike Challenge at Phoenix
International Raceway. ``It's kind of who's winning the war in the
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great example is Doug Chandler. He's a three-time champion
because he's a smart rider. He's riding to finish every race. He
always tries to finish in the top five. That's why he's won so many
championships. You can't take anything away from the guy for that.
. . . But I also believe that the top three finishers should be
awarded a substantial amount of points because they rode hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bostrom won't get any arguments from Mladin, who narrowly missed
winning the season-opening Daytona 200 two weeks ago, finishing
second to winner Miguel Duhamel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system doesn't promote 100 percent hard racing,'' Mladin
said. ``And I don't think fans are getting everything they should
be getting. We want to put on good shows, but we also have to hold
back a little bit to try and win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see more of a point system where you win a bunch
of races, have a couple of bad races and still be there at the end,
rather than something that promotes finishing fourth and fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, riders receive 35 points for a win and 32 for
runner-up. Third through 10th place awards 30, 28, 26, 25, 24, 23,
22 and 21 points respectively. Mladin and Bostrom think the point
differential is slight, meaning it's more difficult to make up a
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, however, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the system is fine the way it is,'' Chandler said.
``Ben kind of did what I've done, which is just take the finishes
and go on to next week. He didn't win a thing, but he was there all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bostrom's worst race last season was at PIR, where he finished
ninth and never mounted a threat against Ducati's Anthony Gobert.
</P>
<P>
   Bostrom and Gobert are teammates this season. Bostrom, however,
won't gain a huge advantage with Gobert sharing the same pit stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our riding styles are so different, we can't even share
information,'' Bostrom said.
</P>
<P>
   Bostrom appears to be on a dominating bike. Although Ducati's
best finish at Daytona was Bostrom's fourth place, all four
previous winners at PIR have ridden Ducati's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a weird deal how I ended up at Ducati and not
with Honda this year,'' said Bostrom, 24, who lives in Granada
Hills, Calif. ``There were negotiating troubles with the (Honda)
management, and some people got upset. They ended up closing the
door on me there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no hard feelings. I like both bikes. And my
brother (Eric) ended up getting my Honda ride, which is beneficial
for him, and it makes me happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I ended up getting Thomas Stevens' (Ducati) ride because
he retired and there just happened to be an opening for me.
Everything worked out.'' &QL; 
Note &QL; 
Bostrom and Gobert will sign autographs tonight from 7 to 9 at
Cycle-Moto Ducati, at 330 E. Southern in Mesa. &QL;

UCLA'S FLANNIGAN MAKES THE GRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the end, McDonald's didn't appeal to LaCresha
Flannigan.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the choice of dropping out of UCLA and possibly
taking a job at the fast-food outlet, Flannigan chose to stay. She
took her studies seriously, got out of academic probation and
improved on the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   She won a starting position earlier this season and has helped
her team into the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1992. The
Bruins (25-7) meet Colorado State (33-2) in the West Regional at
the Sports Arena on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There never has been a kid who's come so far as a sophomore _
athletically, academically, socially,'' UCLA associate head coach
Willette White said. ``She could've gone back to San Bernardino,
but she made the choice to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``School was a big adjustment,'' Flannigan said. ``It was very
different from high school.''
</P>
<P>
   At San Bernardino, Flannigan was the star, both on and off the
court. Off the court, she was the oldest in her family of one
sister and five half-brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Since her father, Darryl Flannigan, raised her as a single
father, LaCresha took on the role of principal caregiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always there for their needs,'' Darryl said. ``If they
wanted time, she'd comfort them. 'Cresha's a real sweet person.
She's so nice. I work with a lot of teen-age kids. 'Cresha's
different. She lives life and doesn't let it affect her.''
</P>
<P>
   As for LaCresha's needs, Darryl took care of those. He taught
her basketball, listened to and held her when she needed
comforting, helped her with homework and choosing a college.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, she scored the points, led San Bernardino into the
playoffs and attracted UCLA's interest. This was a big deal to
Darryl, for no Flannigan had ever gone to a major university
before.
</P>
<P>
   But LaCresha had some academic problems. She needed to pass the
Scholastic Achievement Test and graduate with at least a 2.5 GPA.
With her dad's prodding, LaCresha accomplished it.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Flannigan was the only freshman on the basketball team, so she
had no one going through the rough times with her. Plus, her family
wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   People offered help. White, in particular, sent her to tutors,
academic coordinators and counselors. Nothing worked because
Flannigan didn't let them.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, she played about 10 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   At home, things were getting worse. One brother was seriously
injured in a car accident. Flannigan's father also had difficulty
adjusting to her absence. He wanted her to come home, but she
refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was always there to fix things,'' she said. ``Now, he
couldn't. He was treating me like a kid. I needed to grow up. In
some ways, I shut him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Her grades slipped and she went onacademic probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were trying to help me, even though half the
time I didn't care,'' Flannigan said. ``In some ways, I'm going
through all this stuff for what? I love basketball, but I wasn't
playing. I wasn't working hard anyway. What was I here for?
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up on myself. I didn't want to deal with it. I didn't
know if I was willing to. I sat around and wasted a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, White came to her and told her if she didn't
improve academically, she would be kicked out of school. She went
home and saw some of her former teammates. They were working at
McDonald's. Some already were parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like everybody at UCLA, they put everything on the line
to get me here,'' Flannigan said, ``and they were doing everything
to keep me here. I should do the effort. I didn't want to end up
like that. It had to smack me in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Since she already was on probation, Flannigan had to maintain a
B average in summer school, then have a strong fall quarter to get
off probation. She did it. Now, she happily bounds into practice,
telling White how excited she is at her latest A or B.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I came with the attitude of taking care of
business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Flannigan won a starting spot after Thanksgiving and has become
the second-leading scorer, averaging 14.1 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the highs and lows,'' White said. ``She is very
talented and very intelligent. Once you've seen her use (her
talents), you get a sense of joy.''

SUNS' ROBINSON REWARDED FOR `D' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He has guarded Houston center Hakeem Olajuwon, checked
Milwaukee small forward Glenn Robinson and defended a host of power
forwards from Denver's Antonio McDyess to Utah's Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   He's even taken a turn on the Los Angeles Lakers' 21-year-old
swingman, Kobe Bryant. Then there was the time Suns Coach Danny
Ainge assigned him to shut down Seattle point guard Gary Payton in
the fourth quarter of a game in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That's an opponent for each of the five positions at least once
this season.
</P>
<P>
   So don't be surprised to see the Suns' 6-foot-10 forward,
Clifford Robinson, hounding anybody from playmaker Mookie Blaylock
to shooter Steve Smith to the towering Dikembe Mutombo tonight when
the Suns make their third stop on a four-game trip and play the
Atlanta Hawks at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where we'd be without him,'' Ainge said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   In deep trouble, that's where.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Robinson, who re-signed with the club this season for
a pro-rated portion of $3 million, the Suns are struggling at a
game above the .500 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge brought Robinson off the bench early in abbreviated season
because he wanted depth behind starting power forward Tom Gugliotta
and center Luc Longley.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first month of the season, Robinson emerged as one
of the top candidates for the annual Sixth Man Award, which goes to
the NBA's top reserve. Phoenix forward Danny Manning won it a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Robinson's candidacy may lose steam. Not because of his
play but because Ainge finally decided after the Suns had lost four
of six games that he could not afford to keep Robinson _ and the
athleticism and intensity he brings _ out of the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 32, has started the last four games, scoring 20 points
or more in three.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixth Man Award requires that a player come off the bench in
the majority of his team's games, and so far Robinson would
qualify, with only eight starts in the first 23 games. But the more
effective is he starting, the less chance he'll have of going back
to the sixth-man role.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Robinson doesn't return to the bench, he might wind up
as a candidate for another top award _ Defensive Player of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the award goes to a player such as Mutombo who blocks a
lot of shots, or a small player such as Payton who racks up a lot
of steals. But a case can be made for Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have overwhelming statistics in either category, but
his versatility as a defender is unmatched. Unfortunately, he can
only play one man at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had him on Kobe when we played the Lakers,'' Ainge said.
``He was doing a great job on him, and then I had to put him on
Shaq (O'Neal), and all of a sudden Kobe went off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cliff has guarded Gary Payton, Hakeem, Scottie (Pippen), he
held (Cleveland's) Shawn Kemp to two points in the second half.
Whoever needs to be guarded, he can guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's defense against Houston's Olajuwon was a key to a
Phoenix victory right before this trip started, limiting him to
5-of-14 shooting. In the first game on the road, he shut down
Milwaukee's Robinson, limiting him to 12 points on 4-of-11
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In the Seattle victory, Ainge put Robinson on Payton to take
away one of Seattle's favorite ploys _ running its offense through
Payton on the low post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense is always going to be part of my game,'' Robinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   He is the Suns' top shot blocker with 21 in 23 games, and he's
second to Jason Kidd with 34 steals. But Robinson also has been a
key piece of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   He's averaging 14.7 points a game, behind only Gugliotta and
Kidd. His 50.8 field-goal percentage and 19-of-43 shooting from
three-point range rank him among the league's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been huge for us,'' Ainge said. ``Without him, we'd have
no chance.'' &QL;

BRIERE MOVED TO MINORS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The way things had been going,  &UR; Daniel Briere
figured it was simply a matter of time before the Coyotes benched
him. Coach  &UR; Jim
 &UR; Schoenfeld did the honors Thursday night, making the rookie center
a healthy scratch for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Skating instead against the St. Louis Blue were wingers  &UR; Louie
 &UR; DeBrusk (a healthy scratch the previous night in Detroit),  &UR; Shane
Doan (returning from a forearm injury) and newly acquired  &UR; Brian
Noonan, who signed with the club Wednesday as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Briere? He was sent back to Springfield of the American Hockey
League after the game along with teammate Tavis Hanson. Apparently,
Briere grabbed his luggage off the team bus and did not accompany
the Coyotes back to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   His name has been linked to various trade rumors. One, in fact,
has him as Montreal's No. 1 choice in return for the Canadiens'
 &UR; Vincent Damphousse, whom the Coyotes reportedly have been coveting
for several days now leading up to Tuesday's NHL trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Montreal, so I know how it works,'' Briere said
earlier Thursday. ``Ninety-five percent of the rumors aren't true
anyway, and a lot of them start there. It's the first time I've
heard them about me, but I'm sure it won't be the last time.'' &QL; 
Briere's ice time has melted in recent games. Wednesday against the
Red Wings, he had only six shifts totaling 4 minutes and 27
seconds. He saw the benching coming well before he got to St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of room in the lineup right now, and some
other guys are playing well,'' Briere said. ``That's one of the
reasons why I lost my job on the second line earlier. But there's
nothing I can do about it. I can't change the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'll have another chance to get out there, and when
I do, I'll give the team a spark like I have before.''
</P>
<P>
   After the All-Star break, that's exactly what Briere did
following a reduction in ice time. He racked up two goals and eight
assists in a 13-game span, only to fall into a slump the past month
and lose more shifts. &QL; 
Thanks, no thanks
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise move making the rounds around the league Thursday,
the Chicago Blackhawks decided to waive a handful of veteran
players, including heavyweight  &UR; Bob Probert and defensemen  &UR; Doug
Zmolek and  &UR; Dave
 &UR; Manson, a former Coyote.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager  &UR; Bob Murray clearly is trying to send a message
to his underachieving club _ and to other teams as well, because he
wants to force a series of trades.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith said he wasn't particularly
interested, but he did say he'd been busy talking to several teams
about potential deals before Tuesday's 1 p.m. deadline. ``I've done
a lot of talking, but I don't know if we'll get anything out of
it,'' Smith said. &QL; 
JR staying put
</P>
<P>
   Responding to an ESPN report that star center  &UR; Jeremy Roenick
won't be back in a Coyotes uniform next season, Smith said he had
no plans whatsoever to move the talented and popular assistant
captain.
</P>
<P>
   He made it clear Roenick wasn't going anywhere ``before'' the
end of the season, but his answer was just a tad vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not spoken to a single team about Jeremy Roenick,''
Smith said. ``Every year these rumors come up and start out East.
But whatever we do in the next four days, Jeremy Roenick won't be
involved.'' &QL;

NEED FOR RELIEF COSTS CUBS' WOOD $90 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood earned a visit from
police and a date in court for recently urinating in public.
</P>
<P>
   Police spotted Wood, 21, and his friend, Kevin Walker, 22, a
pitcher in the San Diego Padres organization, about 1:10 a.m. on
Feb. 13 in the 7300 block of East Stetson Drive.
</P>
<P>
   When the bicycle officers approached, Wood told Officer Brian
Brown, ``I can't stop now, I have to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood then asked about the amount of the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Brown described Wood as cooperative, but Officer Jennifer Clair
had harsher words for Walker, who also was cited for urinating in
public.
</P>
<P>
   Clair said Walker was cooperative but sarcastic. She also
described him as intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Clair said Wood seemed to offer an apology at one point by
saying, ``We weren't very secretive.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker then reportedly added, ``I would have done it, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wood appeared in Scottsdale Municipal Court last Friday and
pleaded no contest to urinating in public, said Pat Dunn, deputy
court administrator.
</P>
<P>
   She said he was found guilty and fined $90.
</P>
<P>
   Walker missed his court appearance, leading officials to issue a
warrant for his arrest, Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Dirren, a Scottsdale police spokesman, said the officers
found Wood and Walker in a popular area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the hub of the city's entertainment district,'' he
said. ``Nightclubs. Restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirren did not know where the two had been before being spotted
by officers.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, the 1998 National League Rookie of the Year, won't play
for the Cubs this year. He suffered a full ligament tear in his
right elbow on Saturday during his first spring appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Wood nor Walker could be reached for comment. &QL;

GILKEY SHOWS AGILITY, SPEED IN RETURN FROM CALF INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ So far, so good was  &UR; Bernard Gilkey's assessment of his
first day back in the Diamondbacks' outfield since March 7, when he
left a game because of a cramp in his left calf muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey started in right field, walked once and doubled in three
other plate appearances and scored twice in Arizona's 11-6 victory
over Oakland on Thursday at Tucson Electric Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went well,'' Gilkey said. ``I try not to focus on it (the
leg).''
</P>
<P>
   The leg was tested early when Gilkey walked with two outs and
then scored from first base on a double to right-center by  &UR; Dale
Sveum.
</P>
<P>
   He felt his agility was high as he pursued fly balls along the
foul line.
</P>
<P>
   And considering he had been sidelined for almost two weeks,
Gilkey was satisfied with his day at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about timing and rhythm and I'm getting there,
particularly on the change-ups,'' he said. ``I'm trying to take it
one day at a time.'' &QL; 
Benes wins second &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Andy Benes made his fourth start and said it was
his best, despite giving up a two-run homer to  &UR; Olmedo Saenz in the
first inning. After the home run, Benes, who won his second game,
retired seven men in a row and 10 of the last 11 he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had pretty good command after the first inning. I'm making
good progress, stretching it out,'' increasing the amount of
innings, Benes said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter: ``That's as sharp as he's been all
spring.'' &QL; 
There he goes again &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Versatility,  &UR; Andy Fox, was in top form, starting at
shortstop for the first time, moving to second base and finishing
the day at third.
</P>
<P>
   He started at six positions in 1998 but not at short, although
he did play briefly there on a couple of occasions late in games.
</P>
<P>
   While in the New York Yankees' organization, Fox played quite a
bit at short, and some of the Diamondbacks' officials believe that
it is his best position.
</P>
<P>
   He said it doesn't matter to him where he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more things to worry about at short, but I feel
comfortable there. I've been working there off and on during
camp,'' Fox said. ``I just try to make it as simple as I can _
catch the ball and throw the ball.'' &QL; 
Olson returns &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closer  &UR; Gregg Olson returned to game action for the first time
in about a week after battling tendinitis in his right wrist. He
pitched two-thirds of an inning, walking two, giving up a hit and a
run. He had thrown on the side on three occasions since receiving a
cortisone shot Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wrist was fine, but it was a bit of a struggle out
there,'' said Olson, who recorded 30 saves in 1998. ``I've never
been able to get into a decent game mode in the spring. I made a
few good pitches and I'm getting better. I still have 2{ weeks to
improve.'' &QL; 
Short stops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed reliever  &UR; Brian Shouse was hit on the ear flap of
his batting helmet by a pitch from Oakland left-hander  &UR; Mark
Holzemer, but remained in the game. What helped Shouse was that the
pitch was a curveball and not a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Amaury Telemaco, sidelined because of tendinitis
in his right shoulder, will resume throwing on the side today, but
only long toss. If all goes well, he will graduate to a stint or
two in the bullpen, then a game.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander  &UR; Omar Daal will start this afternoon's (1:05)
split-squad game against the Chicago White Sox at TEP, and
left-hander  &UR; Brian Anderson will take the mound for the 7:05
nightcap against Colorado. &QL;

UNAFRAID TO SPEAK HER MIND  
 ALFREDSSON OFTEN CRITICAL BUT LIKES U.S. GOLF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Frankness. Bald truth. Opinion. Sometimes, she even
talks about her round of golf. ``Golfweek's'' Brian Hewitt wrote
last year, ``She's fluent in four languages: Swedish, English, Body
and Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's Helen Alfredsson is anything but boring.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting a 3-under 69 in the opening round of the Standard
Register PING at Moon Valley Country Club on Thursday, she was
asked who should captain the European squad in the 2000 Solheim Cup
at Loch Lomond Golf Club in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, myself, of course,'' the 34-year-old from Goteborg said,
standing and throwing her hand behind her head in a pose. ``We'd be
rockin' and rollin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she was on the selection board, she said, ``No,
I'm never on boards. I just give opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Welch's Circle K Championship last week in Tucson,
she criticized former LPGA Commissioner Jim Ritts in a column for
``Golf'' ``World'' for passing through with misguided enthusiasm
and using the tour as a steppingstone.
</P>
<P>
   She also took issue with Ritts for calling the new tournament in
Naples, Fla., one of the tour's better events, when the
infrastructure encircling the course was a sea of construction and
not event-ready.
</P>
<P>
   A reader wrote that she's lucky to be allowed in the country.
</P>
<P>
   To which she said, ``I'm lucky Jim Ritts is not in the
immigration office.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she added, ``It may not have served any purpose to write
it. But I had had it. I love what I do. I see the LPGA as an
organization that does so many things for so many people. I'm not
vicious. I'm honest.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to comment Thursday on hard greens filled with ``poa
annua'' and patchwork at Moon Valley, she threw another curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little bumpy, but I don't know why people made out
they're terrible,'' she said. ``On four- to five-footers, I had a
couple high jump. But it's the case for everybody. There's no
reason to get upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``You become more spoiled when you come over here (from Europe).
Everything is so great. The courses are so much better. When we go
back home, we kind of laugh at the difference. I get tired of
complaining. You don't get a lot out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfredsson, fellow Swedes Anika Sorenstam and defending
tournament champion Lisolette Neumann, England's Laura Davies and
Australia's Karrie Webb have led a growing foreign invasion that
truly makes weekly LPGA events international.
</P>
<P>
   The European tour, which Alfredsson led in money earnings last
year while competing in just five events, is viewed as a poor
stepsister.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wish is we were more together,'' said Alfredsson, who won
two events and enjoyed her most productive LPGA season with
$471,859 in winnings. ``It's a great steppingstone for here. The
new LPGA Futures Tour, with the top three finishers getting tour
cards, is also a good steppingstone for European players. But it
also takes away from the ELPGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the good of women's golf, we need to nurture the European
tour. But we need to protect (tournament fields) here, too. It's a
dilemma. We need to find a way where everybody wins. This tour has
been great to us foreigners. And European events would love to have
more Americans come over.''
</P>
<P>
   She also holds opinions as to why the growth of the LPGA Tour
has outdistanced its European counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Europe. It's my home. But it hasn't had the same pace
as here. You have all the top players in the world here at any
given event. In Europe, you haven't had that,'' she said. ``Being
an athlete is a big thing here. In Europe, you played amateur golf
and then went home and had families. It's still that way more than
it is here.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, she said, is that it's hard anywhere for female
athletes to be taken as seriously as men.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are too rough, you're wrong. If you're not, then you're
wishy-washy. Even for us _ and we're much bigger than Europe _
we're still fighting it. Hopefully, the perception will change
through you guys (the media). You'll see there is great golf being
played, and it's not just bumping it 200 yards out there and then
another shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hitting great shots out here. Last year's Solheim Cup
helped because we played at Muirfield Village, an established
course. We were hitting the shots necessary for the certain pin
placements. It surprised a lot of people, even some people who
follow us.'' &QL;

BRADLEY NAMED CAPTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Two major announcements concerning the 2000 Solheim
Cup were made Thursday at Moon Valley Country Club, just a wedge
shot away from the home owned by  &UR; Karsten Solheim, for whom the
biennial matches are named.
</P>
<P>
   The first involved  &UR; Pat Bradley, who was selected to succeed
 &UR; Judy
 &UR; Rankin as team captain when the Americans defend the Cup against
the Europeans on Oct. 6-8 at Loch Lomond Golf Club in Glasgow,
Scotland. Bradley had been reported as a strong candidate for
captain, as was another Hall of Famer,  &UR; Patty Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
   The second involved a change in format, which now will feature
eight foursome matches, six football matches and 12 singles.
Effectively, that change reduces the total points from 28 to 26.
The format change was developed to ensure that each day's
competition is concluded in available daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to continue the standard of excellence and winning
tradition set by Judy,  &UR; JoAnne (Carner) and  &UR; Kathy (Whitworth),''
Bradley said of her predecessors. ``I am looking forward to the
coming 19 months as we prepare for Scotland.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley played on three Solheim Cup teams, whereas Sheehan
competed on four. Bradley, however, has senior ranking, as she is
47. Sheehan is 42. Bradley's record in the Solheim Cup was 2-5-1,
although she played a pivotal role in the U.S victory in 1990,
going 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it came down to the two of us,'' Sheehan said. ``They
had to pick one of us gray hairs or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't disappointed by the selection. It's time for Pat to
do it, and I know my time will come.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States leads the trans-Atlantic matches, 4-1. One
European praised the selection of Bradley, who is known as a fierce
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She deserves it,'' said  &UR; Laura Davies, the four-time Standard
Register PING champ. ``She will be a great captain; she's still a
great player.'' &QL; 
How Swede she is &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Swedish Coach  &UR; Pia Nilsson, who once played golf for Arizona
State, was at Moon Valley meeting with her troops. Her visit will
last through next week's Dinah Shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be here helping the team work on their games,'' Nilsson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Told the Swedes don't need any help, Nilsson laughed and said,
``Maybe they can teach me something.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 12 Swedes who have LPGA cards are among the top 30
money winners this season, including  &UR; Helen Alfredsson (No. 4),
 &UR; Catrin
 &UR; Nilsmark (No. 7),  &UR; Liselotte Neumann (No. 11),  &UR; Annika Sorenstam
(No. 12),  &UR; Maria Hjorth (No. 24) and  &UR; Charlotta Sorenstam (No.
30). &QL; 
Warding off disaster &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wendy Ward, the former ASU All-American, stumbled out of the
gate but made a fantastic finish for a 70 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was blocking everything right with my driver, but I finally
got it figured out and started hitting some good shots,'' Ward
said. ``But it was a tough start, being 3 over after five holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward, who finished third in this tournament as an amateur in
1995, got on track for six birdies to offset one more bogey. She
was especially on target going down the stretch, with birdies at
Nos. 12, 13, 14 and 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little birdie run saved me,'' she said, sighing. &QL; 
All the way from Italy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Silvia Cavalleri came all the way from Milano, Italy, to
attempt to qualify on Monday for the Standard Register PING. And as
it worked out, her 73 was good enough to get one of two spots in
the 144-player field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels so good to finally get in (an LPGA event),'' said
Cavalleri, who had competed unsuccessfully in three other Monday
qualifiers. ``It's been hard on me, to not have a card and come all
the way from Italy just to do all this traveling.''

   But she was feeling pretty good after shooting a 71 in the
opening round. Despite her failures in qualifying school, Cavalleri
can play. She won the U.S. Amateur in 1997, beating  &UR; Robin Burke _
 &UR; Jackie Burke's wife _ in the final. She has played in one other
LPGA tournament, the 1998 Australian Ladies Open, where she
finished 24th.

IOWA GOES OUT SWINGING IN LOSS  
 EMOTION HIGH IN COACH'S LAST GAME

   PHOENIX - His players went down fighting, at least at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Davis' team threw its best punch at Connecticut with no time
remaining in the first half, not the way he wants to remember his
last game as coach of the Iowa Hawkeyes.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's 78-68 victory Thursday night in an NCAA Midwest
Regional semifinal game at America West Arena was the end of the
Davis era after 13 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   You have to feel for a guy who has been forced out after 269
victories and nine NCAA Tournament appearances, including reaching
the Sweet 16 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the game started, Iowa Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby
was again having to explain why he wasn't renewing the contract of
the winningest basketball coach in the school's history and why he
didn't congratulate the team after its 82-72 victory over Arkansas
in the second round of the regional.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlsby said he stayed away because he had been ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no intention of snubbing Tom or the team,'' Bowlsby
said. ``I couldn't be prouder. Tom and I communicated through the
season. Considering the circumstances, I thought we got along very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   They got along better than the Huskies and Hawkeyes did late in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   First, with seven seconds left, Iowa senior forward Jess Settles
threw down Edmund Saunders under the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Jacob Jaacks hit two free throws with six seconds
left to pull the Hawkeyes within 40-35 at halftime, guard Joey
Range threw a forearm at Khalid El-Amin as the Connecticut point
guard ran off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Players from both teams had words at the center of the floor as
they were leaving the court. Then, Jaacks and El-Amin had to be
restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Joe Silvester and his crew watched several replays of
the incident at the end of the half but decided not to take any
action.
</P>
<P>
   That had to upset Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun, who didn't seem
to find a call against the Huskies he agreed with.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, it was obvious Iowa wasn't finished.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkeyes rallied to tie the score at 53 on Guy Rucker's
5-foot jumper with 10:08 remaining. Then, they watched Connecticut
All-America forward Richard Hamilton show why Suns executives Jerry
Colangelo, Brian Colangelo and Dick Van Arsdale were glued to his
every move.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, a 6-6 junior, is expected to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, meanwhile, would like to coach again, with the Marquette
job being his first choice.
</P>
<P>
   He better clean out his office in a hurry. Iowa fans think
Bowlsby has offered the job to Southwest Missouri State's Steve
Alford, who also has taken his team to the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to do better than that at Iowa or might not have a
fighting chance.

BUCKS CONTAIN CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Rick Pitino is not a happy man. His team lost
Thursday night, but that's the least of his problems. He's getting
tired of telling his players to do one thing and watching them do
something quite different.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics unraveled in the second half Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, coming
unglued, undone, and unwrapped in every way, shape, and form. The
result was a 99-83 setback to the Bucks, a score and outcome you'd
have a hard time believing if you watched the first half and then
took the dog on a very long walk.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Celtics borrowed a page from the Clipper
playbook. They scored 25 points, 9 in the fourth quarter. They made
only eight baskets and missed all eight of their 3-pointers. They
had 14 turnovers and _ are you ready? _ two assists, neatly
parceled out in one per quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw what happened,'' said Kenny Anderson. ``We just broke
down.''
</P>
<P>
   All four tires and the engine.
</P>
<P>
   But what bothered Pitino was the reason for the breakdown. The
players, he said, did not follow the game plan, which called for
them to reverse the ball and dump it inside. Instead, in the second
half, they tried to dribble into double- and triple-teams, most
often with unfortunate results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our listening capabilities,'' Pitino said, ``are pathetic.
They really are and it's so disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't identify the tuners-out, but didn't single any one out
as a good listener, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a good listening team,'' he said. ``That's probably
my greatest disappointment. I know with young guys, that's part of
their repertoire. They don't listen at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Pitino's remarks, Dana Barros said, ``I'm sure
that's true. But it's a lot more than that. This is something we do
on the road, all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have now lost seven straight on the road and the
last few have been because of unsightly efforts down the stretch.
This one was no exception. It was very winnable.
</P>
<P>
   Boston played an excellent first half, building a 16-point lead
and taking a 58-51 lead into the locker room. Already there had
been signs of slippage, however. The Bucks had run off 12 straight
just before the half to make a game of it. They then outscored
Boston, 26-16, in the third and led by 3 entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team had it going in the fourth. The Bucks, who snapped
a four-game skid, shot 39 percent. The Celtics were 4 for 17, or
23.5 percent. But, with 6:58 left, Walter McCarty drove the
baseline for a layup that brought Boston within 80-79. The Celtics
then went four minutes without scoring, by which time the game had
slipped away as Milwaukee went on a 12-0 run to send the underflow
crowd of 13,724 happy into the Wisconsin night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got frustrated at that point,'' said the Bucks' Glenn
Robinson, who led all scorers with 23. ``That was our job, to get
them frustrated. If they were at home, it might have been a
different story.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, they weren't. Which these days is the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the road,'' said Anderson, who had 12 of his 14 points in
the first half and all of his 4 assists. ``It's a psychological
thing. We've got to get one and stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   At the aforementioned 80-79 juncture, Ray Allen, who had a quiet
first half (5 points on only three shots) started the pivotal run
with a short jumper. A blocked shot by Robert Traylor (14 points, 7
rebounds in 24 minutes) led to an Allen dunk and the Bucks were
off.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ron Mercer (13) ended the drought, the Bucks led,
92-79, with 2:45 to play. And no sooner had Mercer connected, then
the Bucks ripped off 5 more, making the total run 17-2 and 19-4
over the final 6:20.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker led Boston with 16, but it was a tough 16. He
clanged 5 of 8 free throws and he missed 9 of 15 shots. He saw
things exactly as they were: the Celtics played two quarters of
basketball and, unless you're playing the Clippers, that's not
going to be enough to win in the NBA.

NOTES FROM THE WEST REGIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; OLD FRIENDS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One notable Gonzaga fan celebrating at America West Arena was
former Michigan State Coach &UR; Jud Heathcote.
</P>
<P>
   Heathcote, whose Magic Johnson-led Spartans won the national
championship in 1979, goes back a long way with Bulldogs Coach  &UR; Dan
 &UR; Monson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Dan when he was born,'' Heathcote said after Gonzaga's
73-73 victory over Florida to advance to Saturday's West Region
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Monson's dad, &UR; Don, was Heathcote's assistant and the two
have remained the best of friends. Both live in Spokane, Wash.,
home to Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to all the games,'' Heathcote said. ``When you live in
Spokane, they're the only Division I team there.''
</P>
<P>
   Heathcote wasn't going bonkers like those seated around him, but
he looked just as happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's just fantastic,'' he said. ``I guess you can call
'em Cinderella, but it's a good basketball team. Has been all
year.'' &QL; 
 &UR; LET THE BIDDING BEGIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Arizona State bid to host the 2002 or 2003 West Regional at
America West Arena, Sun Devils officials were turned down because
they and arena officials refused to guarantee that all of the
signage at the arena would be covered during the event.
</P>
<P>
   They have reversed that policy, and as a result, plan to bid in
two years for the West Regional in 2004 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The signage rule wasn't in effect when Phoenix was awarded the
1999 West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bill Hancock, NCAA director of men's championships and a member
of the basketball committee, said he was impressed by the job
Phoenix has done in hosting its first West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a great job,'' Hancock said. ``They ought to be a
(West Regional) site in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Herman Frazier, senior associate athletic director at ASU, said
the school and the arena definitely will bid again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aggressive around here at going after events and it's
the thing we should do,'' Frazier said.
</P>
<P>
   The wait for the next NCAA tournament games to be held in
Arizona won't be long. First- and second-round West subregional
games will be played at McKale Center in Tucson next March. &QL; 
 &UR; GOING DEEP &QL; 
Just a few weeks ago, Connecticut Coach  &UR; Jim Calhoun committed
himself to using his bench more. ``We said, `We had to get back to
who we are,' '' he said. ``We've made a concerted effort to make
sure we keep (Khalid) El-Amin and Rip (Richard Hamilton) to about
28 to 30 minutes.'' &QL; 
 &UR; GLASS SLIPPER &QL; 
Gonzaga is the first West Coast Conference team to reach the Elite
Eight since Loyola Marymount did so in 1990. That's where Loyola's
journey ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs aren't looking for midnight. Actually, they're
getting tired of all the Cinderella references.
</P>
<P>
   After Casey Calvary tipped in the game-winning basket, he told a
national television audience: ``Richie Frahm had the best quote:
`Whoever hands us the glass slipper, we're going to bash them over
the head with it.' '' &QL; 
 &UR; GRACE UNDER PRESSURE &QL; 
Gonzaga guard Matt Santangelo, who had the hot hand in the first
two rounds of the regional, had a subpar shooting night Thursday.
He made 3 of 13 shots, 2 of 6 from three-point range, and finished
with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida guard Teddy Dupay said he thought Santangelo's poise
under the Gators' full-court pressure was the main reason Gonzaga
won.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo had seven assists and three turnovers. Point guard
Quentin Hall had six turnovers and four assists for the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santangelo pretty much saved them, I think,'' Dupay said. ``He
did a great job. The other guy (Hall) didn't look too good.
Santangelo is probably going to be a pro, I think. The other guy
talks good ball, but he wasn't too sure out there. He was giving it
up every chance he could out there.'' &QL; 
 &UR; GRACIOUS HOSTS &QL; 
Arizona State didn't get into the NCAA Tournament, much less the
Sweet 16, but the Sun Devils were represented at the West Regional
at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rob Evans was there, watching, and so were two of his
players, working. Senior guard Ron DuBois and freshman forward Chad
Prewitt volunteered to help out, running statistics to the media
and the official scorer's table.
</P>
<P>
   Evans noted Prewitt's wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time he's worn a tie,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``With tennis shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt, a graduate of Greenway High School, was taking his
knocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad worked real hard,'' associate sports information director
Doug Tammaro said. ``As a matter of fact, I had him running harder
than Rob Evans did all year,''
</P>
<P>
   Tammaro wanted it made clear he was kidding. &QL; 
 &UR; DISCREETLY MISSING &QL; 
Florida freshman forward Mike Miller had 11 rebounds, eight on the
defensive end, but was not in the game at the end when Gonzaga
forward Casey Calvary leaped in for the offensive board and game
winner with four seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said it hurt to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take a more hurting way,'' he said. ``But as bad as
we played and as good as they shot, to be in that situation was a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't get the clutch rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOME COURT 'DOGS? &QL; 
Gonzaga clearly had the crowd advantage against Florida. Bulldogs
Coach Dan Monson said it was reminiscent of last week's games in
Seattle, which isn't far from the school's campus in Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Said guard Matt Santangelo, ``I think everybody roots for the
underdog. We have a lot of Gonzaga fans down here. I guess a
busload of students came in before the game and they were hassling
the Florida guys. . . . We have a lot of people down here
supporting us, and we are thankful.'' &QL; 
 &UR; BIG CROWD &QL; 
The attendance at America West Arena was 17,975 on Thursday. That
would make it the largest crowd ever to watch a college basketball
game in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRIVIA &QL; 
In 1987, Florida Coach &UR; Billy Donovan led unknown Providence to the
Final Four. Who knocked off the Friars in the semifinals? &QL; 
 &UR; NO UPS AND DOWNS &QL; 
One of Calhoun's biggest goals at Connecticut is keeping the
Huskies at the top of the Big East Conference standings each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our league is a funny league when you think about it,'' he
said. ``Seton Hall has been to the Final Four and been last place
in our league. Our league has a lot of elevators that go up and
down. You had better make sure that your elevator is always going
up.'' &QL; 
 &UR; TRIVIA ANSWER &QL;

UCONN DOWNS IOWA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ All season, critics of the University of Connecticut
basketball team said the one weakness the Huskies had was a
vulnerability against strong, physical teams that like to bang
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In as tough a battle as they have had all season, the Huskies
needed all of their skill, all of their depth, and all of their
heart before pulling away in the final three minutes and recording
a 78-68 victory over Iowa Thursday &UR;  &LR; night in the West Regional
semifinals before a sellout crowd at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Although coach Jim Calhoun's team came into the tournament out
of the physical Big East, the No. 1-seeded Huskies had seldom seen
teams with the bulk and temperament of fifth-seeded Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies (31-2) will now face 10th-seeded Gonzaga in
Saturday's regional final in an attempt to gain their first Final
Four appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The game was physical from the start with the Hawkeyes (20-10)
fighting to not only continue their season, but to extend the
coaching career of Tom Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the former Boston College and Stanford coach, was told at
the start of the season by Iowa officials that his contract would
not be extended.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with the passion of a team fighting for their coach, the
Hawkeyes did not flinch under the relentless pressure of UConn,
which was led by Richard Hamilton's 24 points and Khalid-El Amin's
21.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as physical a game as we have had all year,'' said
Calhoun, now 40 minutes away from his first Final Four. ``Our
football team is going (Division) 1A, but I think we started
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkeyes (20-10), coming into Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's game as
12-point underdogs, didn't back down.
</P>
<P>
   Not at the start when they began firing away from long range,
matching the Huskies shove for shove and basket for basket.
</P>
<P>
   Not at the end of the first half when Iowa's Joey Range let an
elbow fly at El-Amin's head that precipitated a shoving and staring
contest as the half ended, with the three game officials studying
tapes to see if any punches were thrown (which would have meant
automatic ejections).
</P>
<P>
   None were, but the tone of the game was set for the final 20
minutes. ``We were playing a little sporadic,'' said El-Amin, who
was the key factor in UConn forging a 40-35 halftime lead. ``We
weren't running the plays we should have been running, but they
forced us into doing some things.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun and the players also talked at halftime about keeping
their composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going to do any talking,'' said Hamilton, who
scored 6 straight points in a two-minute stretch in the second half
that allowed the Huskies to break from a 53-53 tie to a 59-53 lead
they never relinquished. ``We said we would let the scoreboard do
the talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't until the final minute, with Iowa out of
timeouts and running out of time, that the Hawkeyes finally
conceded the end of their season and the end of Davis's career in
Iowa City.
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, Hamilton, who had been physically punished
much of the evening, walked over and had a few words with Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him I admired the way he coached,'' said Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck in the tournament,'' Davis replied. ``Keep it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, in a pressure-filled, physical confrontation,
the Huskies answered the question about their toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that takes care of that question,'' said Calhoun with
a laugh.

   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Jim O'Brien didn't even need to look at the
scoreboard to know the gravity of the situation. He knew he had
just seen the first ripples of a large wave that had the capability
of turning into a patented Auburn tsunami.
</P>
<P>
   Scoonie Penn had four personal fouls and there was still more
than 10 minutes to play. Too bad. A man has to do what a man has to
do. Auburn had just scored 7 straight points to take a 52-46 lead.
It looked like the start of something very big.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel the game slipping away, and I wasn't going to
lose with Scoonie sitting on the bench,'' said O'Brien, whose
decision to reinsert the team's physical and spiritual leader will
probably go down in Ohio State hoop history as the smartest Buckeye
coaching decision since Fred Taylor decided to recruit Jerry Lucas
and John Havlicek more than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What Scoonie Penn did in those final 10 minutes was make sure
his team would not lose. He started off with an immediate three and
he kept making big play after big play, scoring 13 points after his
return as the Buckeyes advanced to a date in the Final Eight with a
72-64 victory over the No. 1-seeded Tigers Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 23,898 fans at Thompson-Boling Arena saw why the
5-foot-9-inch guard from Salem, Mass., and Boston College was the
media choice as the Big Ten Player of the Year. Penn scored 19 of
his game-high 26 points in the second half while playing 36
turnover-less minutes against a pressing team of magnificent
athletes. He was ably abetted by the slithery Michael Redd, who
scored 22 and who battled the rebounding maniacs of Auburn all
night, finishing with 10 very hard-earned boards, but there was
little doubt that the key man for the Buckeyes was Penn.
</P>
<P>
   He numbered four 3-pointers among his nine baskets. It was the
best he has shot since taking a scary fall against Penn State Feb.
27. He had only shot 7 for 27 last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best I've felt since the Penn State game,'' he
said. ``In the second half, I felt that when I put it up it was
going in.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the four personals, Penn said he didn't have time to
worry about that. ``I have a lot of faith in myself,'' he said. ``I
didn't think I'd do anything stupid. I thought I played pretty
loose out there.'
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State is living out a fairy tale that keeps adding new
chapters. This is a team that was 1-15 in the Big Ten last season
and which has had only one primary addition _ a certain 5-9 point
guard. ``I watched this team last year and I thought what they
needed most was leadership,'' Penn pointed out. A few more points
were a nice bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The fearsome Tigers are a renowned offensive rebounding team,
but the Buckeyes kept themselves from annihilation in that
category. This required a tremendous effort from all concerned, but
O'Brien has come to expect that kind of performance as a given.
Redd and Penn are the stars, but the others are not afraid to get
their hands dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State led it by 5 (31-26) at the half in a fast-paced
opening 20 minutes. But when forward Jason Singleton joined center
Ken Johnson and Penn on the bench with 12:26 left, O'Brien was down
three starters and Auburn was ready to capitalize. When Doc
Robinson hit a jumper in the lane to make it 52-46, O'Brien made
his fateful decision to bring back Scoonie, four fouls or no four
fouls.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied as late as 61-all on a Scott Pohlman
3-pointer, but a foul shot by Brian Brown and two by master slasher
Redd put the Buckeyes up by 3. When Robinson air-balled a three,
Scoonie made him pay with a 14-foot right baseline swisher. The
coup came when Brown came up with a steal and hit a streaking
Singleton with a behind-the-back pass and the forward jammed it
home for a 68-61 lead with 1:01 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, of course, that no one really gets to celebrate.
The Final Eight is nice, but the Final Four is the real goal, and
so both O'Brien and St. John's mentor Mike Jarvis were planning
late-night tape sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The tape of this one can wait. But when O'Brien does look at it,
he will appreciate his point guard even more. Scoonie Penn put on
one amazing show here Thursday night.

GONZAGA SAGA CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ OK. So it's not quite midnight for Cinderella and
Gonzaga still has its magic slippers on in the Big Dance.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs, who have made March Madness and the NCAA
Tournament their mission, took another step Thursday &UR;  &LR; night with a
pulsating 73-72 win over sixth-seeded Florida in a West Regional
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga is the first 10th-seeded team to reach the Regional
final since Providence lost to Arizona in the South Regional in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The hero for Gonzaga (28-6) was sophomore forward Casey Calvary,
whose tip-in of a missed shot by Quentin Hall with 4.4 seconds left
sent his team into Saturday's final against No. 1 seed UConn, a
78-68 winner Thursday &UR;  &LR; night over No. 5 seed Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had called the play for either Matt (Santangelo) or Richie
(Frahm),'' said Calvary, who scored 12 points and was one of three
Bulldogs in double figures. ``But when I saw Hall go to the basket
I just tried to get near to the boards. I just stuck my hand up. It
happened to hit it. I had no idea it was going in.''
</P>
<P>
   After a series of power surges for most of the evening, the
final minutes turned into an exchange of baskets _ and of leads.
</P>
<P>
   With Gonzaga ahead, 68-67, Florida freshman Mike Miller drove to
the basket to give the Gators a 69-68 lead with 1:38 left.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo then countered with a drive, drawing the fifth foul
on Gators center Udonis Haslem with 1:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, Santangelo missed the first free throw and made
the second to again tie the score at 69.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stolt then hit a 3-pointer from the top of the left key to
give the Gators a 72-69 lead with 45.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga then called a timeout to set up its strategy, and Jeremy
Eaton put in a layup with 19.7 seconds left to cut the Gators' lead
to 72-71.
</P>
<P>
   Then on the inbounds play, Florida's Brent Wright was called for
traveling as he attempted to call a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   With 15.4 seconds left, Gonzaga had its last chance to continue
its dream season.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of false starts, Hall, the Bulldogs' 5-foot-8
inch senior guard, drove the lane and threw up a shot that rolled
off the rim, but then Calvary tipped it in for the winner.
</P>
<P>
   For Florida (22-9) it was a bitter ending to a semisweet season
that had seen the young Gators and coach Billy Donovan advance to
the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of false starts in which they fell behind by as
many as 13 points in the first half and 10 in the second half, the
Gators cut into Gonzaga's lead with their speciality _ an onslaught
of 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators, who led the Southeastern Conference in 3-point
shots, seemed to make a final statement when Stolt, a 6-9 senior
forward (16 points, 4 for 7 on 3-pointers), popped in his trifecta
with 45.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But destiny was not wearing a Gator uniform on this evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year when we beat Tulsa, Mississippi State, and Clemson
up in Alaska, I knew this was possible,'' said Gonzaga coach Dan
Monson, who earlier this week had said that while his team
appreciated its Cinderella tag, it was not ready to give up its
magic slippers and stop dancing. ``This far? I don't know. But
we're certainly good enough to be here.''

ZAGS' THRILL OF VICTORY EQUAL TO STORY LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ From the bench, from all over the court, they were
yelling at Quentin Hall to commit the foul.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen seconds left in the game, Gonzaga down 72-71 to Florida,
the Zags' point guard was smothering the Gators' Brent Wright and
Hall's teammates were screaming at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foul him!'' guard Matt Santangelo shouted.
</P>
<P>
   This Sweet 16 game was ticking down to red-alert status. It
looked like Gonzaga's wild ride in the NCAA tournament might be
coming to an end too fast, too soon.
</P>
<P>
   All night, the Zags had looked like they were going to win this
thing, the way they shot their threes and beat the Florida press.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, it was time to stop the clock. It was time to put
Wright on the line because, even if he makes both free throws, the
bull's-eye-shooting Zags had confidence their 3-point shooters
could win this thing.
</P>
<P>
   But funny things happen in March, which is why this is the
maddest of months if you are college basketball hoopaholic.
</P>
<P>
   Hall never did foul Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something just possessed my body and I just didn't do it,''
Hall would say later.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless his ears that he didn't hear it,'' Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gonzaga's pressure got to Wright, which is funny since
it was the Gators whose pressure was supposed to finally wear down
the Zags and knock them out of this increasingly surreal NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But Wright was in trouble. The Zags had the passing lanes shut
down as tight as the state highway patrol. There was no pass he
could make, nowhere to turn.
</P>
<P>
   So, just as Wright tried to call a time out, he picked up his
pivot foot and the referee's whistle blew loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked terrified,'' Gonzaga's Casey Calvary said afterward
about the poor kid from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags had pressured the Gators into a turnover with 15.4
seconds left. They had beat them at their own game. The door had
opened. And Gonzaga was more than happy to come marching through.
</P>
<P>
   On the inbounds play, Hall got the ball on the perimeter,
dribbled left and right and finally launched a shot toward the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   The ball skittered across the rim, no good, but just then, up
from behind, Calvary was there to push the ball back through the
hole and give Gonzaga a 73-72 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Four seconds later, after Florida's last-chance heave clanged
off the rim, the Zags were rolling on the America West Arena
hardwood at center court.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstacy.
</P>
<P>
   Exclamation point.
</P>
<P>
   Another public service announcement from the fellas from Gonzaga
U.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people keep wanting to call us a Cinderella story, but
we feel we can win every game we play,'' said Richie Frahm, who
drilled three consecutive 3-pointers to keep Gonzaga a step ahead
of Florida through critical minutes late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an ugly game but we'll take it. This is awesome. This
reflects our dream.''
</P>
<P>
   This wild NCAA ride also reflects the Zags' will, their
confidence, their chemistry and determination.
</P>
<P>
   And most importantly, at least from a basketball strategy point
of view, it also reflects Gonzaga's impressive ability to take its
opponent's best weapon and turn it against them _ with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags beat Minnesota in an uneven first-round game. They then
completely dominated the West's No. 2 seed, Stanford, in a
second-round victory.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, with Florida trying to trap Gonzaga with its
fullcourt pressure, the Zags just shrugged it off, using a pair of
point guards in Hall and Santangelo to beat the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just try and beat the press, you have to punish the
press,'' Santangelo said. ``We were able to do that. You blow by
people, you get into the seams. You have to punish the press and
punish it early and often.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga did, and in doing so the Zags find themselves in the
Elite 8. They believe they can play with anyone, anywhere, anytime.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone say UConn?
</P>
<P>
   It is a tall order, but the Zags refuse to accept the idea they
are underdogs or Cinderellas to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   As his players were rolling on the court in a giant swarm of Zag
humanity, celebrating with the same abandon they have shown during
these past three victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I was thinking at the time? I was thinking we've
got to get up, get into the locker (room), we've got another game
on Saturday. We can celebrate on Saturday, not here,'' Monson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's the coach in you, but at that moment I'm like, we
need to get organized, we've got more work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   More work. More fun. The Zags are alive and the Zag-nuts are
growing ever faithful.

ST. JOHN'S RUNS OVER MARYLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ They've got to play these games and not
merely dissect and analyze them before they unfold. Exhibit A: St.
John's 76, Maryland 62 in the first game of an NCAA South Regional
doubleheader at massive Thompson-Boling Arena Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone but everyone said this was an even game. Might go three
OTs. Might last a week. What no one forecast was St. John's being
up by 26 (56-30) with 10:58 left. What no one forecast was St.
John's scoring the final 20 points of the first half, or a 21-2
Maryland second-half run getting them no closer than 9 (58-49).
</P>
<P>
   With dynamic freshman Erick Barkley (24 points, 9 assists) at
the controls, with the frontcourt of Ron Artest, Tyrone Grant, and
Lavor Postell controlling the inside and with Bootsy Thornton (17
points) doing a little bit of everything, the pride of Jamaica
(L.I.) took apart Maryland with a scintillating first half and did
what was necessary to preserve a victory that sends coach Mike
Jarvis into the Elite Eight for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not normally lost for words,'' said Jarvis, ``but this was
a great, great effort. The first half was just incredible,
especially on the defensive end. Until they told me coming off the
floor, I didn't know we had a 20-point run. I had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   This is unlike any St. John's team you've ever seen. After a
half-century of treating the fast break like the bubonic plague,
Jarvis has a thoroughly entertaining transition-oriented team. It
wasn't an entertaining night for Maryland mentor Gary Williams,
however. He had to watch as his team, after a decent start, lost
complete control of the game in the final nine minutes of the half.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Maryland awoke from a stupor that had stretched to a
23-0 St. John run over the span of 10:42, it was too late. And when
things did threaten to get interesting, poised young Mr. Barkley
drilled his third 3-pointer to give the Red Storm a necessary blood
transfusion (63-51 at 4:55), and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's is now 28-8. Maryland finishes at 27-6 and Williams
is still looking for his own visit to the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   When Maryland's Laron Profit connected on a right-corner jumper
to give the Terps a 19-18 lead with 8:40 remaining in the half, no
one on either side got overly excited. After all, Mr. Profit has
scored nearly 1,500 points during his distinguished college career.
</P>
<P>
   What no one knew was that this would be the final 2 Maryland
points of the half.
</P>
<P>
   After starting off 7 for 13 and on equal terms with a very
aggressive St. John's team, Maryland then assumed the role of
Florida A&AMP;M to St. John's Duke. In as shocking a display as you
could expect to see in a tournament game of this magnitude, the Red
Storm maniacally destructed their opponent with a run of 20
unanswered points to take a startling 38-19 lead into the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the tough St. John's defense that forced Maryland
into missing its last 10 shots. It wasn't just the
one-shot-and-one-shot-only control of the glass. It wasn't just the
fact that St. John's was thinking fast break with every Maryland
turnover (and there were 13 of them) and missed shot. It wasn't
just the fact that St. John's was combining transition expertise
with half-court prowess. It wasn't any one thing _ it was
everything. A 20-0 run sort of speaks for itself, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a team deal, this was it. St. John's had no
men in double figures. But this is a team with five double-figure
scorers, so it really was just another evening at the office. If
anyone deserved to take a slight bow, it might have been Barkley,
who had seven assists and a pair of 3-pointers. But was he more
important than Artest, who had four rebounds and three blocks? Or
Postell, who had five rebounds? Or Thornton, who had 9 points? Nah.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was a particular nightmare for touted Maryland
star Steve Francis. The high-flying guard was limited to one field
goal, and he supplied the final exclamation point to the Terrapin
downfall by committing an offensive foul on his team's final
possession of the fiendish final 8:40.

KAZAN AWARD REVIVES OLD HURTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Bitter passions lingering from the Cold
War and McCarthyism flared anew Thursday when victims of
blacklisting denounced awarding a lifetime achievement Oscar to
film director Elia Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   Writers, actors and their families protested honoring a
filmmaking legend who identified eight people as communist
sympathizers during the 1952 congressional hearings, bolstering a
witch hunt that ruined hundreds of careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of film excellence can diminish that truth,'' said
actor John Randolph, 89, who was unable to find work for years
after being blacklisted for his political activities.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences of
``profound disrespect,'' Randolph said Kazan at the least should
apologize to the people whose careers he ruined. ``He named names
before. It would be courageous if he would name them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan made such acclaimed movies as ``A Streetcar Named
Desire,'' ``East of Eden'' and ``On the Waterfront,'' but the
prospect of him receiving a lifetime achievement award at the
Oscars opened old wounds in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying the passion for a period they fear the academy is
whitewashing, some 10 blacklisted men and women in their 70s and
80s said they plan to protest outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion
on Oscar night Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference Thursday in the lobby of the academy's office
building on Wilshire Boulevard was disrupted by a heckler shouting
``Communism is evil'' through a bullhorn outside.
</P>
<P>
   A counterdemonstration also planned Sunday by an institute named
in honor of anti-communist author Ayn Rand will add heat to the
controversy as the academy prepares to celebrate the film
industry's latest stars.
</P>
<P>
   That Kazan contributed greatness to Hollywood was not disputed
by the blacklisted. But they contend Kazan has won his Oscars _ for
``Gentleman's Agreement'' in 1947 and ``On the Waterfront'' in 1954
_ and his lifetime achievement is tainted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became a maitre d','' recalled Bob Lees, a writer who
couldn't find work in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't explain to my kids what McCarthyism was all about,
but they knew there were a lot of tensions,'' Lees explained. ``My
wife and I were married 39 years, but we nearly divorced.''
</P>
<P>
   At a separate news conference, academy President Robert Rehme
said the award was solely for Kazan's ``body of work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a good side to the protest, it is that it has made
people aware of that terrible period of our history and the impact
of that,'' Rehme said. ``But we stand by our award to Mr. Kazan.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy's stand angers those who contend Kazan was in a
position, given his prestige and wealth, to stay silent in hearings
before the House Un-American Activities Committee prompted by
often-slanderous accusations made by Sen. Joseph McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan, a member of the Communist Party in the 1930s, was the
highest-profile liberal to name names. The eight he named were
colleagues in the Group Theater in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Those accused of having ever been members of the American
Communist Party could either name colleagues and friends who had
been party members or, by not informing, be blacklisted from future
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Norma Barzman said the award celebrates a man who ``cares
more about himself and his career than human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Barzman, 78, was blacklisted with her late husband and fellow
writer, Ben, while they worked on a film in England in 1949. The
couple moved to France and didn't return to the United States for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of that period poured back last week when she finally
received writing credit for the 1953 film ``Luxury Girls.'' It was
bittersweet because her husband couldn't share the satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he were here,'' she said after Thursday's
demonstration. ``This morning, when I tried to rehearse my speech,
I broke into tears.''
</P>

   A book soon to be released includes Kazan's views on the
controversy. Kazan said he was disturbed to report on his
colleagues, but was concerned that communists threatened the
nation, according to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   That Kazan's career continued while other talents were silenced
still angers many.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Oscar that my father never got to hold,'' Becca
Wilson said, holding the statuette her family received from the
academy in 1985, seven years after her father, Michael Wilson,
died.
</P>
<P>
   That Oscar _ for co-writing the screenplay for ``Bridge on the
River Kwai'' _ was Wilson's second. At the time, though, it was
given to French author Pierre Boule, who wrote the novel of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was lucky because he won an Oscar when he was
blacklisted. For a lot of younger writers, your career was
virtually finished,'' his daughter recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's first Oscar was for the 1951 film ``A Place in the
Sun.'' He was blacklisted for refusing to testify that year.
</P>
<P>
   Sustained by his initial success, Wilson provided for his family
living in Studio City. He was paid but didn't get credit for
writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was disgusted and angered by the hypocrisy,'' Becca Wilson
said. ``It caused an awful lot of strain in our family. My dad
drank an awful lot and died young.''

   ``The McCarthy period cannot be swept under the rug,'' Lees
said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Ayn Rand Institute plan to demonstrate
support for Kazan outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as an issue of justice. People like Kazan took the
right stand in telling the public about what communism was all
about,'' said Chris Wolski, a spokesman. ``It would have been very
easy to sit on his hands and say, I don't know. He stood up and did
the just thing.''

TO ERR IS HUMAN, TO SHOOT AIRBALLS IS STRICTLY NBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This week's sign that the apocalypse is NOT upon us:
</P>
<P>
   A partial exam of NBA attendance by Street &AMP; Smith's Sports
Business Journal shows that the no-show count at arenas is
estimated around 10 to 15 percent, even though the NBA refused to
provide any documentary help.
</P>
<P>
   The no-shows indicate at least some discerning fans understand
how inferior baggy-pants theater is this season. (The argument can
be made that these fans were silly to buy season tickets in the
first place, but they probably needed to hold their spots for next
season, should pro ball resume.)
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is smirking quietly to itself that overall attendance
(tickets sold) is down only slightly in the aftermath of the
lockout, indicating it guessed right in calculating the gullibility
of the American sports public.
</P>
<P>
   The increased number of no-shows means the clubs will be out
some money from concessions and parking, but the hit is minor
compared to how badly baseball wounded itself in its 1994 labor
debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is remarkable how many people are showing up to watch
millionaire athletes airball free throws, creating statistical lows
unseen since Flintstone basketball was played with real rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, many fans made the same assumption as Sonics coach
Paul Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a presumption that most of (the locked-out players)
were doing something,'' he said, barely smiling. ``The season's
more odd than I thought it would be. I thought after the lockout
was over it would be, `Oh, well, get a couple weeks of camp and
go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is apparent that too many players posted up at Royal
Fork's all-you-can-eat line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's hard enough to lose 10 pounds,'' Westphal said.
``If you're 40 pounds overweight, two months isn't much time to
lose that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's plain that the Ben &AMP; Jerry's poster children among the
Sonics are Vin Baker and Billy Owens, who packed enough extra
pounds between them to nearly have made the backup point guard for
which the Sonics have yearned.
</P>
<P>
   The recently improved play of Baker, whom the I-5 truck stations
gauged about 280 pounds at the start of the season, has a lot to do
with his slowly improving fitness. Only lately has Baker's
trademark quickness reappeared in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-9 Owens started out around 250, at least 15 over his best
weight, and since has been sidelined with a broken finger and a
sore knee, the latter a possible consequence of cheeseburger
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy is so much better than he's shown,'' Westphal said.
``But he was in almost the same boat as Vin. And he's been in and
out of good health.''
</P>
<P>
   The chubsters' lack of professionalism has been the primary
cause of the Sonics' worst start since the K.C. Jones era. But
since the problem is league-wide, the Sonics have not fallen off
the playoff map.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is physical sloppiness the only explanation for the
grimness. Hersey Hawkins (41.6 percent from the field), who might
be in the best shape of his career, has joined the rest of his
teammates in flirting with career lows in shotmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the benefit of summer league and exhibition season,
and with a new coach, new system and several new players, working
together has been a problem,'' said Sonics president Wally Walker.
``Normally, a new coach gets a chance in the offseason to get a
dialogue going with veteran players, and there's also a chance to
talk to free agents and see whether they will fit. We couldn't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   As Westphal put it, ``We have no ability to experiment without
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Two cases in point: The moves of longtime starters Hawkins and
Detlef Schrempf to the bench. Westphal wanted to talk to both about
the shift during the summer, but the lockout rules prohibited any
contact between management and union members. The moves were done
abruptly, with much resentment and little preparation, during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkins move was a bust, and reversed. Schrempf, after
lashing out, now seems accepting for the greater good.
</P>
<P>
   ``What brought the changes had nothing to do with Hersey or
Det,'' Westphal said. ``It had to do with no Sam Perkins, no Nate
McMillan, no Jerome Kersey, no Greg Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that made the Sonics so tough over the last several
years is the guys coming off the bench. How many games have those
guys won for the Sonics?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessor, George Karl, who wanted no part of
youngsters, Westphal finds himself with three rookies on his bench,
all with solid NBA potential. But they aren't ready this season.
Westphal figures if they must play, better to put them in the
starting lineup, as he did with Rashard Lewis, where the best
players can cover their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the years we would have loved to have a summer league
and a full preseason,'' Westphal said, ``this was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Westphal is getting a summer league. It's just that
fans are paying $250 courtside to watch it.

KAZAN AWARD REVIVES OLD HURTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Bitter passions lingering from the Cold
War and McCarthyism flared anew Thursday when victims of
blacklisting denounced awarding a lifetime achievement Oscar to
film director Elia Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   Writers, actors and their families protested honoring a
filmmaking legend who identified eight people as communist
sympathizers during the 1952 congressional hearings, bolstering a
witch hunt that ruined hundreds of careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of film excellence can diminish that truth,'' said
actor John Randolph, 89, who was unable to find work for years
after being blacklisted for his political activities.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences of
``profound disrespect,'' Randolph said Kazan at the least should
apologize to the people whose careers he ruined. ``He named names
before. It would be courageous if he would name them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan made such acclaimed movies as ``A Streetcar Named
Desire,'' ``East of Eden'' and ``On the Waterfront,'' but the
prospect of him receiving a lifetime achievement award at the
Oscars opened old wounds in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying the passion for a period they fear the academy is
whitewashing, some 10 blacklisted men and women in their 70s and
80s said they plan to protest outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion
on Oscar night Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference Thursday in the lobby of the academy's office
building on Wilshire Boulevard was disrupted by a heckler shouting
``Communism is evil'' through a bullhorn outside.
</P>
<P>
   A counterdemonstration also planned Sunday by an institute named
in honor of anti-communist author Ayn Rand will add heat to the
controversy as the academy prepares to celebrate the film
industry's latest stars.
</P>
<P>
   That Kazan contributed greatness to Hollywood was not disputed
by the blacklisted. But they contend Kazan has won his Oscars _ for
``Gentleman's Agreement'' in 1947 and ``On the Waterfront'' in 1954
_ and his lifetime achievement is tainted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became a maitre d','' recalled Bob Lees, a writer who
couldn't find work in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't explain to my kids what McCarthyism was all about,
but they knew there were a lot of tensions,'' Lees explained. ``My
wife and I were married 39 years, but we nearly divorced.''
</P>
<P>
   At a separate news conference, academy President Robert Rehme
said the award was solely for Kazan's ``body of work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a good side to the protest, it is that it has made
people aware of that terrible period of our history and the impact
of that,'' Rehme said. ``But we stand by our award to Mr. Kazan.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy's stand angers those who contend Kazan was in a
position, given his prestige and wealth, to stay silent in hearings
before the House Un-American Activities Committee prompted by
often-slanderous accusations made by Sen. Joseph McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan, a member of the Communist Party in the 1930s, was the
highest-profile liberal to name names. The eight he named were
colleagues in the Group Theater in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Those accused of having ever been members of the American
Communist Party could either name colleagues and friends who had
been party members or, by not informing, be blacklisted from future
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Norma Barzman said the award celebrates a man who ``cares
more about himself and his career than human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Barzman, 78, was blacklisted with her late husband and fellow
writer, Ben, while they worked on a film in England in 1949. The
couple moved to France and didn't return to the United States for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of that period poured back last week when she finally
received writing credit for the 1953 film ``Luxury Girls.'' It was
bittersweet because her husband couldn't share the satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he were here,'' she said after Thursday's
demonstration. ``This morning, when I tried to rehearse my speech,
I broke into tears.''
</P>
<P>
   A book soon to be released includes Kazan's views on the
controversy. Kazan said he was disturbed to report on his
colleagues, but was concerned that communists threatened the
nation, according to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   That Kazan's career continued while other talents were silenced
still angers many.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Oscar that my father never got to hold,'' Becca
Wilson said, holding the statuette her family received from the
academy in 1985, seven years after her father, Michael Wilson,
died.
</P>
<P>

HENRY MAKES PITCH FOR STARTING ROTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ Beneath three large ice bags, accompanying
elastic bandages and a loosely draped warmup coat Thursday was a
likely Mariner starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Bluford ``Butch'' Henry was nearly hidden from sight,
obscured by his many layers of postgame wrappings, as he stood in a
darkened hallway replaying his four-inning stint in an 8-7 loss to
the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as Seattle's five-man rotation is concerned, the
30-year-old Texan is slowly coming into view. The lefty knows it.
Manager Lou Piniella knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, who missed last season after incurring a spring training
knee injury for the Boston Red Sox, wasn't perfect against the
Giants. He gave up runs in the second and third innings. But he
never lost his cool. That rates big points with the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our veteran pitchers have stayed away from the big inning this
spring,'' Piniella said. ``What did he give up? A couple of
singletons? You win with that with our lineup. I was pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry, his left elbow and both knees under ice, has removed
enough rust to post consecutive solid outings. More importantly for
him, he was physically tested Thursday _ and he passed.
</P>
<P>
   With two runners on, the Giants' Bill Mueller bunted left of the
mound. Henry grabbed the ball, slipped as he planted his surgically
repaired left knee and threw Mueller out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember thinking about my knee, which was
incredible,'' the pitcher said. ``I slipped on the bunt but I
didn't flinch, which is good. It's not even an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry has started twice since reminding management, through a
Post-Intelligencer story, that his contract has a stipulation
allowing him to walk away as a free agent if he doesn't make the
starting rotation. Until then, he had been used only in relief.
</P>
<P>
   The free-spirited pitcher said he wasn't trying to create
problems, just protect himself. He did the same thing last year
with Boston. The Red Sox wanted him to pitch with his injury. Henry
said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't complaining and I wasn't bitching at anybody,'' he
said. ``I spoke up for the second time in my career. I'm getting
innings now.''
</P>
<P>
   MISSING IN ACTION: For their 15th spring outing, the Mariners
got on the bus without regulars Ken Griffey Jr., Jay Buhner, Edgar
Martinez and David Segui. Griffey took a day off. Buhner, coming
off elbow surgery, rested before he plays consecutive games Friday
and Saturday. Martinez and Segui both suffered from unexplained
neck spasms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell is it?'' Piniella asked a trainer when told the
bleached-haired Segui was incapable of any activity. ``The (darn)
permanents he's been getting?''
</P>
<P>
   THE PLAN: Ken Cloude originally was scheduled to throw against
the Giants, but Piniella shuffled his pitchers to allow each to
start hitting the five-inning minimum he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Roster cuts will come before and after tomorrow's split-squad
games, paring the club from 42 to 36 players, and the mound staff
from 20 to 14 players.
</P>
<P>
   ``By (Monday), everyone in our rotation will have gone five
innings,'' Piniella said. ``Then we make up our minds. We can't
wait anymore. . . . The original plan was to get 27 innings from
our starters. We're going to do better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager said he normally has had to give two pitching spots
away each spring, with the recipients not necessarily earning them.
That won't be the case this time.
</P>
<P>
   Rattling off reasons, Piniella explained the club has two solid
prospects in Freddie Garcia and John Halama from the Randy Johnson
trade to Houston; players with major league experience outside the
organization; and mostly players with previous big league time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixteen of our 20 pitchers have major league experience,'' he
said. ``Last year, or the year before, we had eight or nine with
major league experience. . . . There is competition in earnest this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   SWIFT CURRENT: Among the pitching-staff candidates is
37-year-old Billy Swift, who is prepared for anything. He says his
arm feels great, but back problems have limited his mound time.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander is prepared to retire if the Mariners don't
keep him. He won't go elsewhere without a solid offer, and he won't
even consider starting the season in the minors. Idle time has been
a subject of converstion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to (retired Mariner first baseman) Alvin Davis the
other day and he said the first couple of years out of the game are
weird. You're retired, but you're still in your thirties,'' Swift
said. ``He said you're old for baseball, but young in real life,
and it's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   BATTER CHATTER: In the Peoria clubhouse, reliever Jose Paniagua
pulled outfielder Charles Gipson's jersey out of a box, got into a
baserunner's stance and then stumbled into the cardboard container,
drawing this comment from Griffey: ``Stay off the basepaths.'' . .
. Piniella, sizing up Sammy Sosa's new home-run ritual of bowing
after hitting home runs and the resulting criticism that has
emerged from players such as pitcher Todd Stottlemyre: ``The next
hitter will have to do a lot of bowing himself.''

ZAGS' THRILL OF VICTORY EQUAL TO STORY LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ From the bench, from all over the court, they were
yelling at Quentin Hall to commit the foul.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen seconds left in the game, Gonzaga down 72-71 to Florida,
the Zags' point guard was smothering the Gators' Brent Wright and
Hall's teammates were screaming at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foul him!'' guard Matt Santangelo shouted.
</P>
<P>
   This Sweet 16 game was ticking down to red-alert status. It
looked like Gonzaga's wild ride in the NCAA tournament might be
coming to an end too fast, too soon.
</P>
<P>
   All night, the Zags had looked like they were going to win this
thing, the way they shot their threes and beat the Florida press.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, it was time to stop the clock. It was time to put
Wright on the line because, even if he makes both free throws, the
bull's-eye-shooting Zags had confidence their 3-point shooters
could win this thing.
</P>
<P>
   But funny things happen in March, which is why this is the
maddest of months if you are college basketball hoopaholic.
</P>
<P>
   Hall never did foul Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something just possessed my body and I just didn't do it,''
Hall would say later.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless his ears that he didn't hear it,'' Santangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gonzaga's pressure got to Wright, which is funny since
it was the Gators whose pressure was supposed to finally wear down
the Zags and knock them out of this increasingly surreal NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But Wright was in trouble. The Zags had the passing lanes shut
down as tight as the state highway patrol. There was no pass he
could make, nowhere to turn.
</P>
<P>
   So, just as Wright tried to call a time out, he picked up his
pivot foot and the referee's whistle blew loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked terrified,'' Gonzaga's Casey Calvary said afterward
about the poor kid from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags had pressured the Gators into a turnover with 15.4
seconds left. They had beat them at their own game. The door had
opened. And Gonzaga was more than happy to come marching through.
</P>
<P>
   On the inbounds play, Hall got the ball on the perimeter,
dribbled left and right and finally launched a shot toward the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   The ball skittered across the rim, no good, but just then, up
from behind, Calvary was there to push the ball back through the
hole and give Gonzaga a 73-72 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Four seconds later, after Florida's last-chance heave clanged
off the rim, the Zags were rolling on the America West Arena
hardwood at center court.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstacy.
</P>
<P>
   Exclamation point.
</P>
<P>
   Another public service announcement from the fellas from Gonzaga
U.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people keep wanting to call us a Cinderella story, but
we feel we can win every game we play,'' said Richie Frahm, who
drilled three consecutive 3-pointers to keep Gonzaga a step ahead
of Florida through critical minutes late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an ugly game but we'll take it. This is awesome. This
reflects our dream.''
</P>
<P>
   This wild NCAA ride also reflects the Zags' will, their
confidence, their chemistry and determination.
</P>
<P>
   And most importantly, at least from a basketball strategy point
of view, it also reflects Gonzaga's impressive ability to take its
opponent's best weapon and turn it against them _ with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The Zags beat Minnesota in an uneven first-round game. They then
completely dominated the West's No. 2 seed, Stanford, in a
second-round victory.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, with Florida trying to trap Gonzaga with its
fullcourt pressure, the Zags just shrugged it off, using a pair of
point guards in Hall and Santangelo to beat the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just try and beat the press, you have to punish the
press,'' Santangelo said. ``We were able to do that. You blow by
people, you get into the seams. You have to punish the press and
punish it early and often.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga did, and in doing so the Zags find themselves in the
Elite 8. They believe they can play with anyone, anywhere, anytime.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone say UConn?
</P>
<P>
   It is a tall order, but the Zags refuse to accept the idea they
are underdogs or Cinderellas to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   As his players were rolling on the court in a giant swarm of Zag
humanity, celebrating with the same abandon they have shown during
these past three victories.
</P>
<P>

DUCKS STOP KINGS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ There is no such thing as a little mistake when Paul
Kariya and Teemu Selanne are on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they capitalize even when there was no mistake at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the play of Kariya and Selanne illustrated
repeatedly the difference between the Mighty Ducks and the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had more good scoring opportunities than the Ducks,
but couldn't convert often enough.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Kariya and Selanne, the Ducks got more goals on less
chances, winning 4-2 before a Forum crowd of 12,037.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks also got plenty of help from the goal posts, the
crossbar and goalie Guy Hebert. But the story of the night was the
Ducks' explosive duo, which combined for seven points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' Kings coach Larry Robinson said, ``is that you
can't make any mistakes when those two guys are on the ice.
Otherwise, it's in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Kings (26-37-5) is that their three-game
winning streak ended, and that with 14 games left they remained
five points behind Calgary, which holds the eighth and final
Western Conference playoff berth. The problem for the Ducks
(31-27-11) is minor by comparison, a five-point deficit in their
race with Phoenix for fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks built a 3-0 lead on goals by Jason Marshall, Selanne
and Kariya before the Kings finally found some holes in Hebert, who
has stopped 166 of 171 shots while posting a 5-0 record this season
against his team's area rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the bounces,'' Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said, ``and
we got great goaltending.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings fired 39 shots at Hebert, and hit two posts (by Rob
Blake) and one crossbar (by Glen Murray). Blake's first post came
in the final minute of the first period when his 75-footer curved,
fooling Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a center fielder on the play,'' Hebert said.
</P>
<P>
   With 8:23 left in the game, the Kings' drought ended when Donald
Audette drew them within two on a power play. Then, with 4:42 left,
Russ Courtnall cut the deficit to one with a rink-length rush on
which he beat Ducks defensemen Kevin Haller and Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes later, however, Selanne put the game away
when he scored on a 2-on-1 off a pass from Kariya, who had four
points in the game. Selanne's goals give him 39, tying him for the
NHL lead with Alexei Yashin of Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hitting (Kariya) all night,'' Hebert said. ``He took
what they gave him and showed what a great competitor he is. It's
incredible fortitude, not wanting to be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only time Kariya was stopped all night was on a
penalty shot 12 seconds into the second period, after he was pulled
down by Blake.
</P>
<P>
   And Kariya and Selanne weren't the only Ducks the Kings had
trouble slowing down. During one shift midway through the second
period, the Kings were hemmed in their zone for a solid minute by
the line of Antti Aalto, Johan Davidsson and Jim McKenzie, until an
exhausted Blake finally took a holding penalty. Selanne scored on
the subsequent power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shift may have won the game for us,'' Hartsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will have to hope this loss didn't end the momentum
they'd recently gained.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the effort is there, the momentum will be there,''
Blake said. ``It's a disappointing loss, but not for lack of
effort. They've got two of the best players in the league. When
they get a chance, they score.''

BIG GAIN HAS FIRM AT A LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Golden Systems Inc., a previously little-known
producer of computer power converters, said Thursday it could not
explain a recent surge in its shares that pushed the penny stock up
more than 500 percent in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 10, Golden shares have gone from 2 cents to a
Thursday close of 10 cents. On Thursday alone, the stock rose 4
cents, or 66 percent, with volume of 627,000 shares, or 47 times
its 30-day average volume.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Golden warned investors about the recent
trading, reminding them that the company is about a year behind in
its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and has
made no public statements since October.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Chief Financial Officer Harvey Marsh said the company was
not encouraging the run-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt obligated to notify shareholders that we can't explain
it,'' Marsh said. The only unusual activity at Golden itself is
that the firm recently put up a Web site to advertise its products,
Marsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said the company does not know whether establishing the
site has led to the stock surge. ``Whether people are speculating
that because of that the company is doing better than it had been,
we don't know,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The CFO also speculated that discussions in Internet chat rooms
about the stock could be spreading misinformation about the firm's
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Golden makes AC-to-DC power converters used in laptop and
desktop computers. The firm has about 15 local employees, mostly
engineers, and about 500 employees in India, where its products are
manufactured. In its fiscal year ended March 31, 1997, the most
recent complete year for which it filed with the SEC, the company
reported sales of $2 million. It has not filed a financial report
for a period later than its third quarter ended Dec. 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Golden has struggled since 1995 when Compaq Computers returned a
large order of converters, claiming the devices were defective.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just about did the company in,'' Marsh said. ``We're a
year behind in filings because we haven't had the money to pay
attorneys and audit the accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden announced in October that it had hired new auditors after
Arthur Andersen resigned from the job due to lack of payment. Marsh
said he hopes to report earnings for fiscal 1998 within the next 30
days.

SURPRISING PROFITS HEAT UP FOUR MEDIA SHARES

<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. -- Shares of post-production specialist Four
Media Co. shot up more than 14 percent Thursday after the company
posted profits that were well above Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Shares rose 87.5 cents to $7 for their highest close in more
than a month. Volume of 420,000 shares was more than 10 times the
30-day average.
</P>
<P>
   Four Media reported earnings of $2.3 million, 19 cents a share,
for its second quarter that ended Jan. 31, more than triple its
earnings of $693,000, 7 cents a share, in the 1998 period. The
profits were 4 cents higher than the consensus estimate of five
analysts surveyed by First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Four Media, which has been aggressively buying smaller rivals in
recent years, also reported that revenues increased 67.5 percent to
$47.5 million, highlighted by a gain of 138 percent in the
television division. Citing efficiencies from consolidating
acquisitions, Robert Waltson, chairman and chief executive officer,
noted that gross profit margins rose to 42.3 percent from 34.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Walston, whose strategy has been to make Four Media a one-stop
shop for all post-production services, remained bullish. ``We
continue to see favorable opportunities for growth, both
domestically and internationally, and look forward to expanding the
range of out-sourcing solutions and the creative and technical
services we provide,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A previously announced three-part deal to give 51 percent
ownership to Wall Street investment firm Warburg Pincus, in
exchange for an $80 million investment worth about $7.85 a share,
was approved Thursday by shareholders in Four Media, which went
public in 1996 at $10 a share. A spokeswoman said the deal should
close by May 1, pending approval by regulators.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every weekday morning at around 11 o'clock, a middle-aged
stockbroker named Irvin Rosenfeld gets up from his desk and walks
to a breezeway outside his office in Boca Raton, Fla. There,
alongside the potted palms and smokers taking their breaks, he
lights up a cigarette of his own _ not tobacco, but marijuana, sent
to him by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is 16 years old and perfectly legal. Rosenfeld,
who suffers from a rare bone disorder and smokes to relieve his
pain, is part of an exclusive club of Americans who receive a free
can of marijuana cigarettes each month under a ``compassionate
use'' program sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration and
the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   There are only eight participants in the program. ``I'm one of
the fortunate people,'' Rosenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least, blessed with good timing. Since 1992 the door has
been shut on the little-known program, which began in 1978 and at
its height had no more than about 20 patients. Now, however, the
question of whether the government should be providing an illegal
drug to a chosen few has been thrust into the spotlight by a new
study showing that marijuana is beneficial for certain conditions,
including pain, nausea and the severe weight loss associated with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the most comprehensive review of the literature about
medical marijuana to date, was commissioned by the White House and
conducted by a committee of 11 scientists appointed by the
Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of
Sciences. A report on the study concluded that the benefits of
smoking marijuana were limited by the toxic effects of the smoke,
but nonetheless recommended that the drug be given under close
supervision to patients who do not respond to other therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it does not appear likely that the list of
government-approved marijuana smokers will grow any time soon.
Indeed, that the program continues to exist at all is testimony to
the government's schizophrenic approach to one of the thorniest
questions in law and medicine: whether doctors should be able to
write prescriptions for marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the National Institute on Drug Abuse pays the
University of Mississippi to grow what a spokeswoman called a
``consistent, reliable source of research-grade cannabis'' for
Rosenfeld and the seven other patients. A North Carolina
manufacturing plant receives $62,000 a year from the government to
roll the cigarettes and ship them in sealed tins of 300 each, to
the patients' doctors and pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld, 46, carries a folded-up letter in his wallet, dated
March 17, 1983, from the Food and Drug Administration, authorizing
him to use a substance that might otherwise bring a federal prison
term of up to five years. Most days, he smokes in his car while
driving to work; ``I get no euphoric effect,'' he said. The FDA
letter, he added, has been helpful on those rare occasions that the
police have pulled him over.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Congress has prevented the District of
Columbia from releasing the results of a recent ballot question
that asked voters to decide if marijuana should be made legal for
medical purposes. And the Clinton administration has moved to shut
down marijuana buyers' clubs in California and has threatened to
prosecute doctors who write prescriptions for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why allow eight patients to have legal access to marijuana but
criminalize thousands of other patients in very similar
circumstances who have the same conditions, virtually identical
medical histories?'' asked Chuck Thomas, spokesman for the
Marijuana Policy Project, a nonprofit group in Washington that
lobbies to make the drug legal for medical use. ``Why deny them
legal access?''
</P>
<P>
   That question is now before a federal judge in Philadelphia,
where 165 patients have filed a lawsuit seeking to force the FDA to
grant wider access to the drug. The case is scheduled for trial in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compassionate access program is an acknowledgment by the
government of the United States that marijuana has medicinal
value,'' said Lawrence Hirsch, the lawyer for the patients. ``It is
fundamentally unfair for the government to supply marijuana for
medical necessity to eight people in the United States, when the
rest of the potential candidates for therapeutic cannabis are
excluded.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Department of Justice argues the government is
simply upholding the law. Congress has made the possession and
distribution of marijuana illegal, a spokesman for the department
said, and the FDA has no obligation to make exceptions to the law
for anyone other than those who had legal access to marijuana
before the legislation was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have the precious exceptions owe them to a 51-year-old
glaucoma patient, Robert Randall of Sarasota, Fla. While the
Institute of Medicine has found marijuana is not particularly
useful for glaucoma, Randall begs to differ. In 1973, when he was a
college student in Washington, Randall said, he found that smoking
marijuana helped ease the pressure on his eyes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``So I grew four little marijuana plants on my sun deck on
Capitol Hill, to make up for those times that I couldn't afford to
buy it,'' he said. ``Then I got arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   As his case worked its way through the legal system, Randall
sued the federal government, contending that his smoking was a
``medical necessity.'' In 1976 a judge agreed, he said, and he
began receiving marijuana under the supervision of a doctor at
Howard University.
</P>
<P>
   But that arrangement unraveled in 1978, and he sued again. The
government settled the case through the compassionate use program,
under which the FDA gives patients access to unapproved drugs if no
other therapies will help them.
</P>
<P>
   Randall, who was the first enrollee, said the marijuana ``has
proved to be an astonishingly durable therapy.'' In the years after
the program began he helped others apply, among them Rosenfeld and
two Iowa patients, Barbara Douglass and Ladd Huffman, whose
experiences illustrate the arbitrary nature of the government's
decision to cut off access to the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Douglass and Huffman have multiple sclerosis, a
condition for which the Institute of Medicine found marijuana
beneficial. They met in 1990 after a local newspaper published an
article about Huffman, who had been arrested for growing the drug
in a shed behind his home. In 1991 they applied for federal
marijuana together.
</P>
<P>
   Both received FDA approval. Ms. Douglass began receiving the
drug shortly therafter. ``It relaxes the muscle spasms,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the program was shut down before the final paperwork was
finished for Huffman. A spokesman for the Department of Health and
Human Services said on Thursday that the department determined that
the marijuana was no longer necessary because of the advent of the
drug Marinol, a capsule containing marijuana's active ingredient
that was approved by the FDA in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Huffman says Marinol does not work. ``With these capsules, you
take them and about an hour later you get so stoned you can hardly
function,'' he said. But, having been sentenced to two years'
probation for his marijuana offense, he is afraid to smoke the drug
again.
</P>
<P>
   As for Rosenfeld, he has pangs of conscience, knowing that
people like Huffman have been prosecuted for buying a drug he gets
courtesy of the taxpayers. And he worries that his supply could be
cut off at any time, particularly if the government loses the
lawsuit in Philadelphia. ``I'm not against the government,'' he
said. ``I appreciate what they do for me.''

   SIEM REAP, Cambodia _ Here is the historical timeline of the
Angkor kingdom:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  800 AD. -1432 AD. -- The Angkor Kingdom emerges as the
dominant empire in Southeast Asia, ruled by a succession of
temple-building Khmer kings from their capital near present-day
Siem Reap. Each king tried to outdo his predecessor by building
bigger and more magnificent stone temples to the gods.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1112-1152 AD. -- King Suryavarman II builds the Hindu temple
of Angkor Wat. Its central tower symbolizes the mythical Mount
Meru, supposedly located at the center of the universe. Its outer
walls stand for the mountains at the edge of the earth. Beyond the
walls is a surrounding moat representing the oceans beyond the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1177 AD. -- The Angkor capital is sacked by the Chams,
invading tribesmen from southern Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1181-1201 AD. -- The new Khmer king Jayavarman VII introduces
Buddhism and mobilizes the million inhabitants of his capital on a
crash program to build more than a dozen major new temples and
scores of schools and hospitals. Like his predecessors, he relies
on slave laborers to finish the building spree in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1220-1431 AD .-- Khmer Empire in decline. Angkor is sacked in
1351 and 1431 by Thai invaders.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1431 AD. -- Khmer kings abandon Angkor and move their capital
southward to Phnom Penh. The temples, increasingly engulfed by
jungle, remain inhabited by Buddhist monks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1860 -- French explorer-naturalist Henri Mouhot stumbles onto
Angkor Wat, then all-but-forgotten. His detailed notes and
pen-and-ink drawings become a sensation in the West when they are
published in 1868, seven years after his death.

city in the jungles. This ``city of monasteries'' had been
uncovered a decade earlier by a French explorer-naturalist named
Henri Mouhot. Malheureusement, the Frenchman had died of a jungle
fever before he could make it back to Paris to publish his
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by mosquitoes, tigers and cobras, Vincent set off
eastward from Bangkok into the Kingdom of Cambodia. He traveled in
river boats, on foot, on horseback and in bullock-carts. Seventeen
days later, he reached the little Cambodian fishing town of Siem
Reap.
</P>
<P>
   Here he persuaded a local bureaucrat to supply him and his
companions with three elephants. ``Rather impatient'' as they
neared their imagined goal, they left behind their baggage and took
off through the luxuriant forest.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later Vincent emerged at a clearing next to an ancient
moat 600 meters wide filled with lotus plants. Behind the moat and
nearly overrun by giant fig trees rose the outlines of the colossal
sandstone temple.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent was one of the first American travelers to see the great
temple of Angkor Wat, a monument to the four-armed Hindu god Vishnu
the Preserver. Covering nearly one square mile and cresting in a
central tower taller than the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, the
temple of Angkor Wat is the largest and one of the most haunting
religious edifices in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart almost bounded into my mouth,'' wrote Vincent. ``The
general appearance of the wonder of the temple is beautiful and
romantic as well as impressive and grand ... It must be seen to be
understood and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next 98 years, an ever-growing stream of sophisticated
travelers from around the world journeyed to Angkor Wat and the
ruins of the nearby royal city of Angkor Thom.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tutelage of French colonial conservators, trees and
giant roots were peeled away and the stone blocks of Angkor Wat's
five great pine-cone-shaped towers were reassembled, starting in
1908.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jacqueline Kennedy visited Angkor Wat in 1967 with
her then escort Lord Harlech, the 800-year-old relics of the Angkor
Kingdom had achieved an almost universal cachet. Angkor ranked
among the classic archaeological sites that every educated person
aspired to visit once in a lifetime, along with Egypt's Great
Pyramid of Giza, the Parthenon in Athens and the Machu Pichu ruins
in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   But then in 1969, a curtain dropped on Angkor.
</P>
<P>
   With the spread of communist insurgency, Cambodia's central
government lost control over the jungle, then the country, to Khmer
Rouge guerrillas. One of the ``wonders of the world'' would become
inaccessible to Westerners for nearly a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   By 1972, the Khmer Rouge had set up an ammunition depot inside
the walls of Angkor Wat. Pro-government troops trying to evict them
nicked the main stone doorway with machine gun bullets.
</P>
<P>
   When the Vietnam War brought secret U.S. bombing of Cambodia,
American bombers flew close enough to Angkor to drop a few bombs
within a mile of the temple complex. Local guides and some
guidebooks insist that in the early 1970s, one American bomb
exploded inside the walls of Angkor Wat.
</P>
<P>
   By happenstance, the bomb caused no damage. Even more
miraculously, Angkor Wat and the main surrounding temples survived
Cambodia's 20 years of darkness with almost no signs of harm. The
worst desecration was caused by off-duty soldiers and other temple
robbers who chiseled off a small number of carvings and smuggled
their loot to black market antique shops in Thailand. Despite a few
painful losses, almost everything at Angkor has survived intact.
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1991, after the United Nations extracted a peace
agreement that ended Cambodia's civil war, Western tourists started
trickling back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the next few years, visiting Angkor wasn't exactly
safe. In and around the dozen most important temples, a French-led
international task force cleared away 21,000 land mines. That job
was finished by 1995, but even today mine experts continue finding
land mines in more remote temple sites still off-limits to
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, roving guerrilla bands also posed a risk for
tourists, especially for those gung ho enough to stray from the
main cluster of Angkor temples. As recently as January 1995,
American Professor Susan Hadden from Austin, Texas, was killed in a
Khmer Rouge guerrilla ambush. Local guides say she disregarded
their warnings and tried to visit the exquisitely carved temple of
Banteay Srei, 20 miles down a lonely road from Angkor Wat.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it has become quite tame in the last year to visit
Angkor. At least that was our experience this February when we
toured Angkor Wat and eight other nearby temples, including Banteay
Srei.
</P>
<P>
   As Frank Vincent felt 128 years before us, we found that Angkor
is one of those rare sights that exceeds every expectation. The
sunrises are more majestic, the ruins are better preserved, the
stone carvings are more delicate, the history more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   We spent three and a half days walking the ruins and wished we
could have stayed longer. The stone carvings inside the temples are
so intricate and vast that connoisseurs can spend months here. Just
on the walls of the main Angkor Wat temple, the bas-reliefs stretch
on for a mile and contain thousands of carved figures depicting
such captivating scenes as ``the battle of the gods and the
demons,'' and the ``churning of the ocean of milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Angkor is humbling and yet addictive for a photographer, with
its mix of ever-changing light, elegant shapes, and exotic live
people who are sweeping or selling or simply visiting.
Saffron-robed Buddhist monks who come as tourists lounge on a step
and look quite at home.
</P>
<P>
   Nature's inexorable power is another integral element,
especially at the temple Ta Prohm that has been left largely to the
jungle's invasion. Trees hundreds of years old have twined massive
roots through roofs and around walls and columns, insinuating
themselves so thoroughly that today they help hold intact the
feeble works of men. Here the sense of antiquity is even more
tangible than at temples where jungle growth has been beaten back.
</P>
<P>
   Rising before the sun may seem beyond the vacation mode, but we
found the morning light magical at the temple Preah Khan.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 a.m. the stars were still bright when we walked down the
causeway entrance guarded by stone gods and demons and lit on each
side by a row of lanterns. Inside, the silent complex of galleries
and linked corridors began to loom in silhouette as the sky
lightened above the broken roofs. The experience was spectacular
enough that we were compelled to try it again the next day at the
main Angkor Wat temple, before we caught our airplane out. The
sight was totally different, yet equally absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   An early start makes sense for other reasons. Middays are steamy
hot. Four or five hours of touring followed by lunch and a long
recline by the hotel swimming pool comprise a normal schedule.
Emerging for more sight-seeing in the late afternoon gives the
advantage of more fabulous light effects as the sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Reading about Angkor Wat before you leave home will help you
narrow down the choices to fit your time. Even with the best
guidebooks, the traveler is well-advised to hire a local, trained
guide. Choup Lorn, our guide, added immeasurably to our trip,
giving the history, pointing out the best-preserved garudas
(statues of mythical creatures with birdlike wings and human
bodies), tipping us to good camera angles and sharing the local
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers averse to any kind of risks while on holiday, it
may still be too soon to visit Angkor. Perhaps this is why only
about 100 foreign tourists visit Angkor on an average day,
including only about a half-dozen Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, there are still terrifying incidents.
</P>
<P>
   On the road from the airport toward Angkor Wat, unknown
assassins last September set off a booby trap of rocket-propelled
grenades. They were trying to kill the visiting Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen, but he escaped when three of the four
remote-controlled rockets failed to ignite in the wet weather. Then
early this year, a gang of teenage Cambodian robbers knocked a
Belgian woman tourist on the head several hundred yards from Angkor
Wat, sending her to the hospital and running away with her wallet.
</P>
<P>
   That said, however, European tourists continue to visit South
Florida, even though some have met equally terrifying incidents in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For inveterate globe-trotters, fears of another security
incident must be balanced against a second risk: although Cambodia
is relatively stable now, the curtain of civil war could once again
descend on Angkor.
</P>
<P>
   Even should politics remain under control, in another few years
it probably will get far more crowded here. Now that all known
Khmer Rouge units have come out of hiding and accepted
``integration'' into the Cambodian Army, both Cambodian promoters
and foreign investors are planning for a tourist boom in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Already 10 big new hotels are under construction on the
outskirts of Siem Reap, adding to the one luxury-class hotel, three
moderately-priced hotels and scores of budget guesthouses already
operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have political stability in our country, we'll have a
big increase in tourism,'' said Kousoum Saroeuth, director of the
provincial tourism office. ``The numbers will be two or three times
higher than today, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you are a nervy traveler and you don't like crowds, you'd
better go to Angkor soon.

<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE:
</P>
<P>
   -- By air: For $55, you can fly to Siem Reap on Royal Air
Cambodge from the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh. If you want to
skip Phnom Penh, there are scheduled daily flights to and from
Bangkok on Bangkok Air and Royal Air Cambodge. Given the hazards of
armed robbery on some Cambodian roads, it is probably safest to
travel to Angkor Wat by air.
</P>
<P>
   -- By Boat: From Phnom Penh, you can travel up the Mekong River
and across Tonle Sap Lake on a ferry boat for a few dollars. But
the boats take about six hours and are prone to breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY:
</P>
<P>
   -- In great luxury: For $360 a night for a double, you can stay
at the renovated Grand Hotel d'Angkor, one of the most comfortable
hotels in Asia. One reason it's so pricey is that it is the only
first-class hotel in Siem Reap.
</P>
<P>
   -- Next best: If you like staying in the middle of town (within
walking distance of the outdoor marketplace and the honky-tonk
nightclubs) try the Ta Prohm Hotel ($70-a-night for a twin-bedded
room, or $100 for a suite). Two other pretty good second-class
hotels are further from the center of town: the Hotel Nokor Kok
Thlok and the Angkor Hotel. All three are clean and
air-conditioned, but the rooms are reminiscent of off-brand North
Carolina motel rooms along U.S. Interstate Highway 95.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cheap: For $2 a night, you can sleep under a mosquito net in
your own tiny room at the Naga Guesthouse, which many count as one
of the bargains of the Southeast Asian backtracking circuit. For $3
a night, you can even have a room with a bath of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   BEST BOOKS:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cambodia, a Lonely Planet Survival Kit'' (updated 1996)
</P>
<P>
   ``Angkor: An Introduction to the Temples,'' by Dawn Rooney
(1997)
</P>
<P>
   ``A History of Cambodia,'' by David P. Chandler (1993)
</P>
<P>
   CHANGING MONEY:
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't bother. Instead, bring along American dollars,
especially $1 and $5 bills. Greenbacks are the most widely accepted
coin of the realm in today's chaotic Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO SEE THE MONUMENTS:
</P>
<P>
   -- Cost of admission. An individual ticket costs $20 for one
day; or $40 for up to three days; or $60 for up to one week.
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting around. You'll need wheels because the temples are
all spread out, and the nearest one is five miles from Siem Reap.
If you can afford the Grand Hotel, you will probably also want to
rent a car or minibus and driver, for up to $40 a day. If you're
staying at Naga Guesthouse, you'll probably hire a motorcycle-taxi
with driver, for about $8 a day.
</P>
<P>
   -- Guides. You'll get far more out of the trip if you pay for a
guide. We think our guide cost us about $30 a day. But we aren't
sure because our guide was included in the price of our tour
package.

 &HT;    A SPACE AWAITS AN EMBASSY, BUT JERUSALEM IS STILL A
CONTROVERSIAL CAPITAL

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Someday, the U.S. embassy to Israel could be moved
from Tel Aviv to an awaiting vacant lot on a busy Jerusalem street.
But, before that happens, the diplomats will have to clear away a
lot more than the pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   Like so much other land here, the Israelis gained control of the
rocky slope after Arab states attacked them in 1948. But, a
Palestinian still holds the old deeds and his old dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that it might be forever lost to a U.S. embassy, he says
he leased it three years ago for just $1 to a famous tenant _
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot keep it and protect it like he can,'' said Ali
Fitiani, a wealthy Palestinian businessman. ``If the Americans
build an embassy there, they will be getting the land from the
Israelis, but (the Israelis) do not own it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitiani's deeds have little practical value, as the land is
firmly under Israeli control. But, they are a pointed reminder of
the underlying dispute over the 5,000-year-old city. The dispute
has made this the only place on earth where the United States,
along with most other countries, keeps its embassy outside the
declared capital of the host country.
</P>
<P>
   That policy is now coming under increased scrutiny and faces a
deadline soon. Back in 1995, a pro-Israel U.S. Congress passed the
``Jerusalem Embassy Act,'' which recognized Jerusalem as Israel's
capital and ordered that, by June 1999, the U.S. Embassy be moved
there from Tel Aviv, about 35 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton will likely fend off the mandate,
exercising a ``national security'' waiver that would delay the
embassy move but face congressional criticism.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials often meet Israeli leaders in Jerusalem,
treating it as a de facto capital, administration officials see an
embassy move as too inflammatory a gesture. Amid the troubled
Palestinian-Israeli Oslo peace process, such matters of real estate
quickly become battles over sacred homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Riots against Israeli troops erupted in the Palestinian West
Bank in 1997 when the U.S. Congress earmarked $100 million for an
embassy move. Faisal Husseini, Palestine Liberation Organization
leader for Jerusalem, said riots would break out again ``for sure''
if the embassy were moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not in the United States' interests to take a step that
would have clear negative repercussions for the negotiations on
peace and security between the Israelis and Palestinians,'' said
U.S. Embassy Spokesman Larry Schwartz. As of last week,
administration officials said they had not decided whether to
exercise the waiver allowed in the embassy law.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., sponsored the Jerusalem Embassy
Act and wants Clinton to make the move. He notes that the land is
in predominantly Jewish West Jerusalem -- albeit on the very edge
-- and not in the more controversial Arab areas captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels that this is land that no one can argue will fall
under Palestinian jurisdiction and the (peace) negotiations, to
that extent, are irrelevant,'' said Lieberman's press secretary Dan
Gerstein. He adds that threats of violence should not control U.S.
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But, as administration officials point out, the Oslo accords
make no distinction between east and west. They just state that
Jerusalem is at issue and an embassy move would therefore
short-circuit the agreement, which was signed by Israel, the
Palestinians and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, U.S. policy toward Jerusalem is often
contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   One one hand, Congress recognized it as the capital.
Administration officials routinely meet Israeli leaders there.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, official policy leaves the city's status
pending.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the child of an American is born in Tel Aviv,
the baby's U.S. passport lists the birthplace as ``Tel Aviv,
Israel.'' But, an American baby born in Jerusalem will get a U.S.
passport that states just ``Jerusalem,'' followed by a blank space
-- as if the city belongs to no country at all.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Such ambivalence is nearly worldwide. To the consternation of
the Israelis, who base their government in Jerusalem, only Costa
Rica and El Salvador keep embassies here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this rather absurd situation in which all the
government activity is in Jerusalem but all the embassies are in
Tel Aviv,'' says David Bar-Illan, adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. ``This is discriminatory, and an absurd and
politically loaded snubbing of our capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel solidified it's hold on the western portion of the city
in the 1948 war. In 1967, it captured the rest of the city,
including the Arab areas and Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy
sites in the walled Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli leaders -- especially at election time -- frequently
pledge to keep Jerusalem their ``eternal, undivided, capital.''
</P>
<P>
   After a row with European officials last week over the status of
the city -- the European Union considers Jerusalem an international
city -- Israeli officials angrily called for a world-wide public
relations campaign to explain why Jerusalem is their capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis with Europe made us realize that many things we
take for granted here are not taken for granted elsewhere,''
Bar-Illan said.

   SIEM REAP, Cambodia _ Here is the historical timeline of the
Angkor kingdom:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  800 AD. -1432 AD. -- The Angkor Kingdom emerges as the
dominant empire in Southeast Asia, ruled by a succession of
temple-building Khmer kings from their capital near present-day
Siem Reap. Each king tried to outdo his predecessor by building
bigger and more magnificent stone temples to the gods.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1112-1152 AD. -- King Suryavarman II builds the Hindu temple
of Angkor Wat. Its central tower symbolizes the mythical Mount
Meru, supposedly located at the center of the universe. Its outer
walls stand for the mountains at the edge of the earth. Beyond the
walls is a surrounding moat representing the oceans beyond the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1177 AD. -- The Angkor capital is sacked by the Chams,
invading tribesmen from southern Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1181-1201 AD. -- The new Khmer king Jayavarman VII introduces
Buddhism and mobilizes the million inhabitants of his capital on a
crash program to build more than a dozen major new temples and
scores of schools and hospitals. Like his predecessors, he relies
on slave laborers to finish the building spree in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1220-1431 AD .-- Khmer Empire in decline. Angkor is sacked in
1351 and 1431 by Thai invaders.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1431 AD. -- Khmer kings abandon Angkor and move their capital
southward to Phnom Penh. The temples, increasingly engulfed by
jungle, remain inhabited by Buddhist monks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1860 -- French explorer-naturalist Henri Mouhot stumbles onto
Angkor Wat, then all-but-forgotten. His detailed notes and
pen-and-ink drawings become a sensation in the West when they are
published in 1868, seven years after his death.

   SIEM REAP, Cambodia _ Talk about a trip to write home about . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1871 Frank Vincent Jr. dropped out of Yale University,
and despite frail health, the 17-year-old embarked on ``a
systematic tour of the most interesting parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   After reaching Bangkok in the Kingdom of Siam, the Brooklyn,
N.Y.-born Vincent decided to pursue a fantastic tale about a lost
city in the jungles. This ``city of monasteries'' had been
uncovered a decade earlier by a French explorer-naturalist named
Henri Mouhot. Malheureusement, the Frenchman had died of a jungle
fever before he could make it back to Paris to publish his
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by mosquitoes, tigers and cobras, Vincent set off
eastward from Bangkok into the Kingdom of Cambodia. He traveled in
river boats, on foot, on horseback and in bullock-carts. Seventeen
days later, he reached the little Cambodian fishing town of Siem
Reap.
</P>
<P>
   Here he persuaded a local bureaucrat to supply him and his
companions with three elephants. ``Rather impatient'' as they
neared their imagined goal, they left behind their baggage and took
off through the luxuriant forest.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later Vincent emerged at a clearing next to an ancient
moat 600 meters wide filled with lotus plants. Behind the moat and
nearly overrun by giant fig trees rose the outlines of the colossal
sandstone temple.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent was one of the first American travelers to see the great
temple of Angkor Wat, a monument to the four-armed Hindu god Vishnu
the Preserver. Covering nearly one square mile and cresting in a
central tower taller than the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, the
temple of Angkor Wat is the largest and one of the most haunting
religious edifices in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart almost bounded into my mouth,'' wrote Vincent. ``The
general appearance of the wonder of the temple is beautiful and
romantic as well as impressive and grand ... It must be seen to be
understood and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next 98 years, an ever-growing stream of sophisticated
travelers from around the world journeyed to Angkor Wat and the
ruins of the nearby royal city of Angkor Thom.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tutelage of French colonial conservators, trees and
giant roots were peeled away and the stone blocks of Angkor Wat's
five great pine-cone-shaped towers were reassembled, starting in
1908.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jacqueline Kennedy visited Angkor Wat in 1967 with
her then escort Lord Harlech, the 800-year-old relics of the Angkor
Kingdom had achieved an almost universal cachet. Angkor ranked
among the classic archaeological sites that every educated person
aspired to visit once in a lifetime, along with Egypt's Great
Pyramid of Giza, the Parthenon in Athens and the Machu Pichu ruins
in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   But then in 1969, a curtain dropped on Angkor.
</P>
<P>
   With the spread of communist insurgency, Cambodia's central
government lost control over the jungle, then the country, to Khmer
Rouge guerrillas. One of the ``wonders of the world'' would become
inaccessible to Westerners for nearly a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   By 1972, the Khmer Rouge had set up an ammunition depot inside
the walls of Angkor Wat. Pro-government troops trying to evict them
nicked the main stone doorway with machine gun bullets.
</P>
<P>
   When the Vietnam War brought secret U.S. bombing of Cambodia,
American bombers flew close enough to Angkor to drop a few bombs
within a mile of the temple complex. Local guides and some
guidebooks insist that in the early 1970s, one American bomb
exploded inside the walls of Angkor Wat.
</P>
<P>
   By happenstance, the bomb caused no damage. Even more
miraculously, Angkor Wat and the main surrounding temples survived
Cambodia's 20 years of darkness with almost no signs of harm. The
worst desecration was caused by off-duty soldiers and other temple
robbers who chiseled off a small number of carvings and smuggled
their loot to black market antique shops in Thailand. Despite a few
painful losses, almost everything at Angkor has survived intact.
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1991, after the United Nations extracted a peace
agreement that ended Cambodia's civil war, Western tourists started
trickling back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the next few years, visiting Angkor wasn't exactly
safe. In and around the dozen most important temples, a French-led
international task force cleared away 21,000 land mines. That job
was finished by 1995, but even today mine experts continue finding
land mines in more remote temple sites still off-limits to
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, roving guerrilla bands also posed a risk for
tourists, especially for those gung ho enough to stray from the
main cluster of Angkor temples. As recently as January 1995,
American Professor Susan Hadden from Austin, Texas, was killed in a
Khmer Rouge guerrilla ambush. Local guides say she disregarded
their warnings and tried to visit the exquisitely carved temple of
Banteay Srei, 20 miles down a lonely road from Angkor Wat.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it has become quite tame in the last year to visit
Angkor. At least that was our experience this February when we
toured Angkor Wat and eight other nearby temples, including Banteay
Srei.
</P>
<P>
   As Frank Vincent felt 128 years before us, we found that Angkor
is one of those rare sights that exceeds every expectation. The
sunrises are more majestic, the ruins are better preserved, the
stone carvings are more delicate, the history more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   We spent three and a half days walking the ruins and wished we
could have stayed longer. The stone carvings inside the temples are
so intricate and vast that connoisseurs can spend months here. Just
on the walls of the main Angkor Wat temple, the bas-reliefs stretch
on for a mile and contain thousands of carved figures depicting
such captivating scenes as ``the battle of the gods and the
demons,'' and the ``churning of the ocean of milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Angkor is humbling and yet addictive for a photographer, with
its mix of ever-changing light, elegant shapes, and exotic live
people who are sweeping or selling or simply visiting.
Saffron-robed Buddhist monks who come as tourists lounge on a step
and look quite at home.
</P>
<P>
   Nature's inexorable power is another integral element,
especially at the temple Ta Prohm that has been left largely to the
jungle's invasion. Trees hundreds of years old have twined massive
roots through roofs and around walls and columns, insinuating
themselves so thoroughly that today they help hold intact the
feeble works of men. Here the sense of antiquity is even more
tangible than at temples where jungle growth has been beaten back.
</P>
<P>
   Rising before the sun may seem beyond the vacation mode, but we
found the morning light magical at the temple Preah Khan.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 a.m. the stars were still bright when we walked down the
causeway entrance guarded by stone gods and demons and lit on each
side by a row of lanterns. Inside, the silent complex of galleries
and linked corridors began to loom in silhouette as the sky
lightened above the broken roofs. The experience was spectacular
enough that we were compelled to try it again the next day at the
main Angkor Wat temple, before we caught our airplane out. The
sight was totally different, yet equally absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   An early start makes sense for other reasons. Middays are steamy
hot. Four or five hours of touring followed by lunch and a long
recline by the hotel swimming pool comprise a normal schedule.
Emerging for more sight-seeing in the late afternoon gives the
advantage of more fabulous light effects as the sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Reading about Angkor Wat before you leave home will help you
narrow down the choices to fit your time. Even with the best
guidebooks, the traveler is well-advised to hire a local, trained
guide. Choup Lorn, our guide, added immeasurably to our trip,
giving the history, pointing out the best-preserved garudas
(statues of mythical creatures with birdlike wings and human
bodies), tipping us to good camera angles and sharing the local
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers averse to any kind of risks while on holiday, it
may still be too soon to visit Angkor. Perhaps this is why only
about 100 foreign tourists visit Angkor on an average day,
including only about a half-dozen Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, there are still terrifying incidents.
</P>
<P>
   On the road from the airport toward Angkor Wat, unknown
assassins last September set off a booby trap of rocket-propelled
grenades. They were trying to kill the visiting Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen, but he escaped when three of the four
remote-controlled rockets failed to ignite in the wet weather. Then
early this year, a gang of teenage Cambodian robbers knocked a
Belgian woman tourist on the head several hundred yards from Angkor
Wat, sending her to the hospital and running away with her wallet.
</P>
<P>
   That said, however, European tourists continue to visit South
Florida, even though some have met equally terrifying incidents in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For inveterate globe-trotters, fears of another security
incident must be balanced against a second risk: although Cambodia
is relatively stable now, the curtain of civil war could once again
descend on Angkor.
</P>
<P>
   Even should politics remain under control, in another few years
it probably will get far more crowded here. Now that all known
Khmer Rouge units have come out of hiding and accepted
``integration'' into the Cambodian Army, both Cambodian promoters
and foreign investors are planning for a tourist boom in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Already 10 big new hotels are under construction on the
outskirts of Siem Reap, adding to the one luxury-class hotel, three
moderately-priced hotels and scores of budget guesthouses already
operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have political stability in our country, we'll have a
big increase in tourism,'' said Kousoum Saroeuth, director of the
provincial tourism office. ``The numbers will be two or three times
higher than today, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you are a nervy traveler and you don't like crowds, you'd
better go to Angkor soon.

 &HT;    HEADING TO CAMBODIA? HERE ARE A FEW TIPS
 &HT;    With CAMBODIA-ANGKOR-$ADV20.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (t) Travel categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., March 20 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE:
</P>
<P>
   -- By air: For $55, you can fly to Siem Reap on Royal Air
Cambodge from the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh. If you want to
skip Phnom Penh, there are scheduled daily flights to and from
Bangkok on Bangkok Air and Royal Air Cambodge. Given the hazards of
armed robbery on some Cambodian roads, it is probably safest to
travel to Angkor Wat by air.
</P>
<P>
   -- By Boat: From Phnom Penh, you can travel up the Mekong River
and across Tonle Sap Lake on a ferry boat for a few dollars. But
the boats take about six hours and are prone to breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY:
</P>
<P>
   -- In great luxury: For $360 a night for a double, you can stay
at the renovated Grand Hotel d'Angkor, one of the most comfortable
hotels in Asia. One reason it's so pricey is that it is the only
first-class hotel in Siem Reap.
</P>
<P>
   -- Next best: If you like staying in the middle of town (within
walking distance of the outdoor marketplace and the honky-tonk
nightclubs) try the Ta Prohm Hotel ($70-a-night for a twin-bedded
room, or $100 for a suite). Two other pretty good second-class
hotels are further from the center of town: the Hotel Nokor Kok
Thlok and the Angkor Hotel. All three are clean and
air-conditioned, but the rooms are reminiscent of off-brand North
Carolina motel rooms along U.S. Interstate Highway 95.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cheap: For $2 a night, you can sleep under a mosquito net in
your own tiny room at the Naga Guesthouse, which many count as one
of the bargains of the Southeast Asian backtracking circuit. For $3
a night, you can even have a room with a bath of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   BEST BOOKS:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cambodia, a Lonely Planet Survival Kit'' (updated 1996)
</P>
<P>
   ``Angkor: An Introduction to the Temples,'' by Dawn Rooney
(1997)
</P>
<P>
   ``A History of Cambodia,'' by David P. Chandler (1993)
</P>
<P>
   CHANGING MONEY:
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't bother. Instead, bring along American dollars,
especially $1 and $5 bills. Greenbacks are the most widely accepted
coin of the realm in today's chaotic Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO SEE THE MONUMENTS:
</P>
<P>
   -- Cost of admission. An individual ticket costs $20 for one
day; or $40 for up to three days; or $60 for up to one week.
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting around. You'll need wheels because the temples are
all spread out, and the nearest one is five miles from Siem Reap.
If you can afford the Grand Hotel, you will probably also want to
rent a car or minibus and driver, for up to $40 a day. If you're
staying at Naga Guesthouse, you'll probably hire a motorcycle-taxi
with driver, for about $8 a day.
</P>
<P>
   -- Guides. You'll get far more out of the trip if you pay for a
guide. We think our guide cost us about $30 a day. But we aren't
sure because our guide was included in the price of our tour
package.

   WARNER-ON-WOOD - This column is not available this week. It will
resume shortly. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA-NEWMOTOWN - Through the rose colored glasses sitting low
on his nose, Bunmi Junadi is looking out for the rich and fabulous.
That's his job. The bald-headed Nigerian was hired by musical
millionaires Sean ``Puffy'' Combs and Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid as VIP
coordinator for Justin's, their newly opened Buckhead restaurant.
The objects of his pampering are metro Atlanta's black glitterati,
a growing cast of African-American celebrities who are putting down
roots, hanging out their shingles, and searching for the perfect
place to see, and be seen. Long known as a magnet for
nine-to-fivers of all races who move to the metro area from
everywhere, Atlanta has quietly developed a distinctive celebrity
scene as African-American entertainers are decamping from
established glam capitols like Los Angeles and New York. (Harris,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40. WITH PHOTOS. FOR SUNDAY.

   ARTS/ENTERTAINMENT
</P>
<P>
   The following stories are part of 4-part series on Lonnie
Holley, the Alabama folk artist who has endured nothing but trouble
since he was one of the stars of the Olympic Arts Festival in 1996.
Holley, one of the South's most important folk artists, has known a
world of trouble in his 49 years. But nothing has prepared him for
the random misfortunes that have bedeviled him like Job over the
past couple of years. This is a story about a man who has struggled
against great odds to make his art and to keep his family together.
</P>
<P>
   All stories MOVED Wednesday FOR SUNDAY. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   LONNIEHOLLEY-PART1 - COLUMBIANA, Ala. - We start with Holley's
arrest, then back up and tell the story of how he got there.
(Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 90.
</P>
<P>
   LONNIEHOLLEY-PART2 - HARPERSVILLE, Va. - We look at Holley and
his family and their current troubles. Holley has raised five
children by himself, and by all accounts did a great job against
the odds. But in recent years, his kids have had all manner of
problems. And it could get worse. (Auchmutey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 58.
</P>
<P>
   LONNIEH0LLEY-PART3 - BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - We look at Holley's
career in the context of the world of folk art. The reasons for
folk artists' struggles are complicated but the results are the
same: renowned, respected artists who wouldn't qualify for an auto
loan. We also look at the efforts of various dealers and do-gooders
to help him and his family. (Auchmutey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 50.
</P>
<P>
   LONNIEHOLLEY-PART4 - We sort out the endings, happy and
otherwise. The first good news, it seemed, Holley had gotten in
years was that juvenile authorities had been so impressed with
Holley's 16-year old son Kubra that they took it upon themselves to
nominate him for the Alabama School of Fine Arts, a magnet program
in Birmingham for gifted children from across the state. While
oldest son Ezekial appears headed for prison, and third son A.J.
for juvenile boot camp. And Holley? He'll probably plead guilty to
reduced charges and get probation, and he's finally painting again.
(Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 30.
</P>
<P>
   SXSW-CLUBS - AUSTIN - SXSW brings to showcase clubs 2 to 3 times
their usual monthly income, a huge difference considering the thin
operating margin of most local clubs. If only the clubs could pack
people in and sell as many drinks year round.... SXSW this year
should find big crowds at Liberty Lunch, likely the last time in
its present location, and the Electric Lounge, which is just trying
to keep its doors open through the festival after being hit with
rent increases. Austin Blues is an example of a new club trying to
get established during the festival. (McLeese, Austin
American-Statesman). 35. WITH PHOTOS.

   SCIENCE/MEDICINE
</P>
<P>
   EDs: Here is the budget for this week's Science-Medicine page:
</P>
<P>
   COXNET SCIHEALTH 0319 - A Brazilian doctor has created a new
procedure that involves an ``internal brassiere'' formed of mesh.
It's one of the hottest techniques in the plastic surgery business,
where breast reshaping, reduction and reconstruction take center
stage. (Lore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   BREAST LIST - A list of options for reshaping the breast. (Lore,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   SLEEP DISORDERS - There may be more to that wheezing, snorting,
rattling rat-tat-tat deep-within-the-throat snoring that awakes
you, your loved ones (and possibly even the neighbors) each night.
A sleep evaluation could reveal the condition of sleep apnea.
(Mays, Waco Tribune-Herald)
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH NOTES - A quarter of the nation's nursing homes have
severe health and safety infractions that often go unpunished,
although the conditions jeopardize residents, federal auditors said
in a recent study. (Malone, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: This is the CoxNet SCIHEALTH page for the current week.
This layout is now available.)PHYSICISTS - ATLANTA - The American
Physical Society, the world's largest organization of physicists,
pulls into town today for a scientific session marking its 100th
anniversary. Among the sessions planned: presentations by Stephen
Hawking, and seminars on such topics as the physics of dance, toys,
magic, beer and baseball - many of them open to the public. A
bulleted roundup of what's happening, where and when. (Seabrook,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-HEALTH - What can those on-line health surveys really
tell you about your current health and whether your lifestyle
habits will lead to an early grave? (Kim, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-MUSICIANS - Many musicians don't have health insurance,
but they do have health problems related to their jobs - hearing
loss, carpal tunnel syndrome for guitarists and drummers. Talking
to musicians with these health problems and also to physicians who
work with musicians and seeing what solutions there are. What can
they do aside from not playing so much, which would hurt their
career. (Santos, Austin American-Statesman). 20-25.
</P>
<P>
   ASSISTED-LIVING-CENTERS - WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - At the Palm
Beach Assisted Living Facility, there are younger people with
handicaps, and some former down-and-outers who qualify for state
aid to the elderly homeless. But most of the 165 residents are
``private pay'' retirees who don't need the constant care of a
nursing home but do need a watchful eye. It's a broad and forgiving
designation. The federal government considers them poor, but they
have some income: Social Security, veterans benefits. With luck,
they get a little help from family, and a little more from Joseph
Glucksman. (Kalajian, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   HOME &AMP; GARDEN
</P>
<P>
   HEIRLOOM-SEEDS - It's the first day of spring, and gardeners are
returning to their roots, experimenting with heirloom seeds to grow
vegetables. It's not just nostalgia but the growing tendency for
vegetable gardeners to want to save seeds from year to year. But
the hybrids do not necessarily produce the same fruit. So, with an
heirloom seed, if you have a really great tomato plant, you can
save the seeds and ensure one that is equally good the next year.
The drawback is that not all your plants from heirloom seeds will
be hearty. (MLongino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   SPRING-ARRIVES - Spring officially arrives at 8:46 p.m. today.
On the first day of spring, also referred to as the vernal equinox,
the sun rises due east and sets due west; day and night are of
essentially equal length. This season, spring will last 92 days, 18
hours and 3 minutes until summer begins on June 21, say Fernbank
Science Center astronomers. A look at some of the signs. (Seabrook,

   WHITECLERIC-BLACKCHURCH - The Church of the Atlanta Lighthouse
once had a congregation of whites and blacks. That all changed as
white members began moving to the suburbs years ago. Now the

African-American members, except for one key person - the pastor.
The Rev. Spiers, who is white, has remained. We try to find out why
and explore the daily challenges he faces as a white cleric
ministering to a black congregation. (Blake, Atlanta

 &HT;    Dream of a different kind across the great divide
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following is an excerpt from Jim Minter's book, ``Some
Things I Wish We Wouldn't Forget.''
</P>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ In the springtime, when the baseball
season is young and hope is fresh, I often think of my old friend
Junior Miles, and his great dream of seeing a major league baseball
game.
</P>
<P>
   On summer afternoons Junior and I, too young to be assigned a
mule and plowstock, worked together in the cotton fields, wielding
sharpened blades on long wood-handled hoes to chop and thin the
plants, always struggling to keep up with the women workers who
moved easily and rhythmically ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The work was tedious, made bearable by our talk of batting
averages and heroes whose pictures we had seen on the sports page
of the newspaper. On a flimsy excuse, we would slip away and catch
a few innings of the Game of the Day on radio. Fenway Park and
Yankee Stadium were magic places, far away in another world.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit was equally distant and magical, although Junior's older
brothers, Bo and James, had left the farm and gone there in search
of jobs becoming available in automobile plants gearing up for war
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Bo had not had much luck. He failed to find a job, and in the
cold Northern winter caught pneumonia. His mother, Miss Esther, got
on the train and went to nurse him. She was too late. Bo spent his
last lonely days in a spare room in a strange city.
</P>
<P>
   THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM
</P>
<P>
   James eventually landed a job working for the Ford Motor Co.,
and in his prosperity wrote home that he had been to Briggs Stadium
and had actually seen the Detroit Tigers play the Boston Red Sox in
a major league baseball game. Hank Greenberg, of course, hit a home
run.
</P>
<P>
   Next summer, James wrote, he would send money for a train ticket
and Junior could visit him, and together they would go and see the
Detroit Tigers play in a major league baseball game. It was an
impossible dream, and neither Junior nor I really believed it would
happen.
</P>
<P>
   It did not happen the next summer, or one following, because
James encountered expenses he had not expected. It was late July,
after the cotton had been laid by, when the money arrived. In his
12th year, Junior Miles caught the train in Atlanta and set off to
fulfill his dream.
</P>
<P>
   He was gone two weeks. On the afternoon of his return, as we sat
under a gum tree, I was anxious to hear about his great adventure.
I expected him to be excited, and to say he had actually seen Hank
Greenberg or Ted Williams hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   `NO BLACK, NO WHITE'
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was strangely silent and preoccupied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you really see a major league baseball game?'' I asked. He
said he and James had done that. But he didn't seem to have
baseball on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Detroit,'' he told me instead, ``There ain't no black, and
there ain't no white.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange statement. I was puzzled. I had to ask him what
he meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was riding up there on the train,'' he said, ``the
conductor came up to me and said: `Boy, get your things and move up
there to that other car.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `No sir, I can't do that. That's the white car.'
Then he asked me, `Boy, you remember when this train crossed that
big river? When you cross that river there ain't no black and there
ain't no white.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And sure enough,'' Junior Miles told me that afternoon under
the gum tree, ``there wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He said when he got to be 16 he was going to Detroit to live,
even if his brother Bo had died there with nobody to look after him
when he got sick. And he did. He became a preacher, eventually
pastoring a large church in Detroit before being called to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1996, Junior came back to Inman and preached
two nights in his old home church. He showed pictures of his big
church in Chicago, and of his expansive home.
</P>
<P>
   It was his last visit. Within a year, Rev. Son Jesus Miles, Jr.,
whose life was changed when he passed over the Ohio River, crossed
over the Jordan. His sons carry on his ministry at his church in
Chicago.

   WARNER-ON-WOOD - This column is not available this week. It will
resume shortly. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA-NEWMOTOWN - Through the rose colored glasses sitting low
on his nose, Bunmi Junadi is looking out for the rich and fabulous.
That's his job. The bald-headed Nigerian was hired by musical
millionaires Sean ``Puffy'' Combs and Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid as VIP
coordinator for Justin's, their newly opened Buckhead restaurant.
The objects of his pampering are metro Atlanta's black glitterati,
a growing cast of African-American celebrities who are putting down
roots, hanging out their shingles, and searching for the perfect
place to see, and be seen. Long known as a magnet for
nine-to-fivers of all races who move to the metro area from
everywhere, Atlanta has quietly developed a distinctive celebrity
scene as African-American entertainers are decamping from
established glam capitols like Los Angeles and New York. (Harris,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40. WITH PHOTOS. FOR SUNDAY.

   ARTS/ENTERTAINMENT
</P>
<P>
   The following stories are part of 4-part series on Lonnie
Holley, the Alabama folk artist who has endured nothing but trouble
since he was one of the stars of the Olympic Arts Festival in 1996.
Holley, one of the South's most important folk artists, has known a
world of trouble in his 49 years. But nothing has prepared him for
the random misfortunes that have bedeviled him like Job over the
past couple of years. This is a story about a man who has struggled
against great odds to make his art and to keep his family together.
</P>
<P>
   All stories MOVED Wednesday FOR SUNDAY. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   LONNIEHOLLEY-PART1 - COLUMBIANA, Ala. - We start with Holley's
arrest, then back up and tell the story of how he got there.
(Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 90.
</P>
<P>
   LONNIEHOLLEY-PART2 - HARPERSVILLE, Va. - We look at Holley and
his family and their current troubles. Holley has raised five
children by himself, and by all accounts did a great job against
the odds. But in recent years, his kids have had all manner of
problems. And it could get worse. (Auchmutey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 58.
</P>
<P>
   LONNIEH0LLEY-PART3 - BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - We look at Holley's
career in the context of the world of folk art. The reasons for
folk artists' struggles are complicated but the results are the
same: renowned, respected artists who wouldn't qualify for an auto
loan. We also look at the efforts of various dealers and do-gooders
to help him and his family. (Auchmutey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 50.
</P>
<P>
   LONNIEHOLLEY-PART4 - We sort out the endings, happy and
otherwise. The first good news, it seemed, Holley had gotten in
years was that juvenile authorities had been so impressed with
Holley's 16-year old son Kubra that they took it upon themselves to
nominate him for the Alabama School of Fine Arts, a magnet program
in Birmingham for gifted children from across the state. While
oldest son Ezekial appears headed for prison, and third son A.J.
for juvenile boot camp. And Holley? He'll probably plead guilty to
reduced charges and get probation, and he's finally painting again.
(Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 30.
</P>
<P>
   SXSW-CLUBS - AUSTIN - SXSW brings to showcase clubs 2 to 3 times
their usual monthly income, a huge difference considering the thin
operating margin of most local clubs. If only the clubs could pack
people in and sell as many drinks year round.... SXSW this year
should find big crowds at Liberty Lunch, likely the last time in
its present location, and the Electric Lounge, which is just trying
to keep its doors open through the festival after being hit with
rent increases. Austin Blues is an example of a new club trying to
get established during the festival. (McLeese, Austin
American-Statesman). 35. WITH PHOTOS.

   COXNET SCIHEALTH 0319 - A Brazilian doctor has created a new
procedure that involves an ``internal brassiere'' formed of mesh.
It's one of the hottest techniques in the plastic surgery business,
where breast reshaping, reduction and reconstruction take center
stage. (Lore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   SLEEP DISORDERS - There may be more to that wheezing, snorting,
rattling rat-tat-tat deep-within-the-throat snoring that awakes
you, your loved ones (and possibly even the neighbors) each night.
A sleep evaluation could reveal the condition of sleep apnea.
(Mays, Waco Tribune-Herald)
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH NOTES - A quarter of the nation's nursing homes have
severe health and safety infractions that often go unpunished,
although the conditions jeopardize residents, federal auditors said
in a recent study. (Malone, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: This is the CoxNet SCIHEALTH page for the current week.
This layout is now available.)PHYSICISTS - ATLANTA - The American
Physical Society, the world's largest organization of physicists,
pulls into town today for a scientific session marking its 100th
anniversary. Among the sessions planned: presentations by Stephen
Hawking, and seminars on such topics as the physics of dance, toys,
magic, beer and baseball - many of them open to the public. A
bulleted roundup of what's happening, where and when. (Seabrook,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-HEALTH - What can those on-line health surveys really
tell you about your current health and whether your lifestyle
habits will lead to an early grave? (Kim, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-MUSICIANS - Many musicians don't have health insurance,
but they do have health problems related to their jobs - hearing
loss, carpal tunnel syndrome for guitarists and drummers. Talking
to musicians with these health problems and also to physicians who
work with musicians and seeing what solutions there are. What can
they do aside from not playing so much, which would hurt their
career. (Santos, Austin American-Statesman). 20-25.
</P>
<P>
   ASSISTED-LIVING-CENTERS - WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - At the Palm
Beach Assisted Living Facility, there are younger people with
handicaps, and some former down-and-outers who qualify for state
aid to the elderly homeless. But most of the 165 residents are
``private pay'' retirees who don't need the constant care of a
nursing home but do need a watchful eye. It's a broad and forgiving
designation. The federal government considers them poor, but they
have some income: Social Security, veterans benefits. With luck,
they get a little help from family, and a little more from Joseph
Glucksman. (Kalajian, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   HOME &AMP; GARDEN
</P>
<P>
   HEIRLOOM-SEEDS - It's the first day of spring, and gardeners are
returning to their roots, experimenting with heirloom seeds to grow
vegetables. It's not just nostalgia but the growing tendency for
vegetable gardeners to want to save seeds from year to year. But
the hybrids do not necessarily produce the same fruit. So, with an
heirloom seed, if you have a really great tomato plant, you can
save the seeds and ensure one that is equally good the next year.
The drawback is that not all your plants from heirloom seeds will
be hearty. (MLongino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   SPRING-ARRIVES - Spring officially arrives at 8:46 p.m. today.
On the first day of spring, also referred to as the vernal equinox,

</P>
<P>
   It has been said that ``order is Heaven's first law.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesus acknowledged this when he said, ``The earth produces of
itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the
ear'' (Mark 4:28).
</P>
<P>
   If we are to succeed in life, it becomes necessary to bring our
methods of operation into an orderly process. And preparedness can
often be considered the first step in the order of success.
</P>
<P>
   Another adage is that ``chance favors the prepared.''
Opportunity knocks at the door many more times than people may
realize. If the moment of opportunity is not seized, it may be
because people don't recognize it or are unprepared to seize it.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Jeremy was ready and eager to seize the moment.
In preparing for a fishing trip to Canada with his father and some
of his father's friends, Jeremy insisted on buying a heavy-duty rod
and reel so he could catch a big fish. Not wanting to dampen the
boy's enthusiasm and knowing he could use the equipment for a
deep-sea excursion he was planning, the father purchased the
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   When the other men saw Jeremy's new fishing equipment they joked
with him. ``You planning on catching a whale, Jeremy?'' one of the
men asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna get me a big pike,'' he responded confidently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you could sure get a big pike with that rig,'' another
said, laughing. Jeremy was undaunted by what seemed to be the men's
lack of confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   Four days on the lake produced little for the men and the boy,
and Jeremy's fishing rig became the butt of many a friendly joke.
Then, suddenly one of the men shouted, ``I have something!'' His
pole arched and strained. A moment later the pole quickly
straightened and the line went limp. The line had broken! The
disappointed man muttered that he should have come prepared with
heavier equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As the fishing party was about to return to the cabin after
another day on the lake, Jeremy's line suddenly tightened. At first
he thought he had hooked a log beneath the surface of the water.
But then the line began to move with a force that almost frightened
him. He had hooked his big fish.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes later he hauled his pike in the boat -- a
thirty-two pounder! The men were flabbergasted, envious, and
respectful, because Jeremy taught them that if you want to catch a
big fish, then you had better come prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Far too often many people do not prepare themselves for success.
While they wish success would favor them, they may put just enough
effort into life to get by, thinking that if by chance something
big comes along, they'll grab it.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're not prepared for success, you may find it
difficult to hold on to the opportunities that come your way.
Success requires understanding, fortitude, and foresight to bring
the ``blade to the full grain in the ear.''
</P>
<P>
   As an exercise, ask yourself from time to time what you are
doing to prepare yourself for success. Have you established and
become fully committed to your goals? Are you willing not only to
cultivate the soil and plant the seed but also to nurture and care
for the tender blade and the young ear as it appears? Are you
willing to go the extra mile, and give the energy and attention
that the opportunity calls for? Are you willing to stand firm with
your convictions, your principles? Are you prepared to stand alone
if necessary? Have you trained yourself to recognize opportunity
when it knocks?
</P>
<P>
   And you never know when it may knock. Opportunity often presents
itself in an unexpected form. It could seem to require of you more
than you might presently be prepared to give. But if your desire is
to catch a big fish, you must prepare yourself as Jeremy did to
handle the fish when it strikes. Otherwise, it could be the big one
that got away!
</P>
<P>
   I appreciate the story of the young man who, a number of years
ago, was seeking a job as a Morse-code operator. He found an ad in
the paper and went to the office address that was listed. When he
arrived, it was a large and busy office, and there was a certain
amount of hustle, bustle, and noise, including the chatter of a
telegraph key in the background.
</P>
<P>
   A sign on the wall instructed applicants to take a seat and wait
until they were summoned to come into the inner office. More than a
half-dozen applicants were waiting ahead of the man in our story.
This could have been discouraging, but he figured he was prepared
for the job and had nothing to lose, so he sat down along with the
others to wait.
</P>
<P>
   After about two or three minutes, the young man stood up, walked
over to the door where the sign was hanging and walked right on in.
Naturally, the other applicants perked up and started looking at
each other and muttering. Within about five minutes the young man
came back out the door with the employer, who said, ``You gentlemen
may go now. The position has been filled.''
</P>
<P>
   At this, several of the applicants grumbled, and one spoke up
and said, ``I don't understand. He was the last person to come in,
and we never even got a chance to have an interview, and, yet, he
got the job. That's not fair!''
</P>
<P>
   The employer said, ``I'm sorry, gentlemen, but all the time
you've been sitting here the telegraph key has been ticking out the
message in Morse code, 'If you understand this message in Morse
code, come right in. The job is yours.' Apparently none of you
heard it or understood the message. He did. The job is his.''
</P>
<P>
   Continue to read, to learn, and experience new feelings and
ideas. Show initiative at an early stage in a situation. Observe
others. Listen carefully to others. Use whatever degree of
intelligence you possess to the fullest. Remember that to help
yourself is to help others.
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself if you are using your talents and abilities in the
most wise way. Do you live consciously the virtues of honesty,
bravery, humility, gentleness, loyalty, and hope? Learn more about
the virtues of life and what they mean in your life.
</P>
<P>
   These things are a part of ``being prepared'' and often lead to
success.

UNSOLVED MURDER FOLLOWS LAWSUIT OVER ROCKET BELT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: N.Y.) 
 
By ERIC HANSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In the movie ``The Rocketeer,'' Nazi spies, gangsters
and good guys fight over a rocket-powered backpack that allows a
man to soar like a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   A true story rivaling the movie's plot has unfolded here,
involving a real rocket-powered backpack, a nasty lawsuit and an
unsolved murder.
</P>
<P>
   First developed in the early 1960s, the backpack _ actually
called a rocket belt _ was last seen publicly in the summer of
1995, when pilot Bill Suitor flew it at a party celebrating the
Houston Rockets NBA championship series with the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   The murder victim is Joseph Wright, whose bludgeoned body was
found last July in his home in northwest Harris County. His head,
face and upper body had been beaten so badly that he had to be
identified through dental records.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, 37, and another man, Bradley W. Barker, 44, were being
sued by Thomas L. Stanley, 54, who claimed they had stolen the belt
from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a Harold Robbins novel,'' said Ronald Bass,
Wright's friend and attorney. ``This is an incredible story of a
bunch of very, very unusual people with a unique thing in the
middle of it, this rocket belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will not say what the motive was, but Harris
County Sheriff's Lt. Albert Diaz said Barker is the only suspect.
No charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   On July 19, when detectives arrived at Wright's patio home, Diaz
said, there were no signs of forced entry and nothing seemed to be
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever came there was let in by the victim,'' he said. ``And
it appeared to us that whoever the suspect was, he had time to tidy
up the crime scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, Diaz said, there was little physical evidence.
He said detectives are still trying to track down documents and
financial records in a search for clues.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley filed the suit in 1995, claiming that Barker, his
partner, and Wright had taken the rocket belt from him unlawfully.
</P>
<P>
   Bass said he was trying to negotiate an agreement with Stanley's
attorney on Wright's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling them that Joe Wright did not know where the
rocket belt was, but that he could maybe help them, that he would
be a better ally than an enemy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bass said he participated in a meeting the night of July 15,
1998, with Stanley and his attorney, and that Wright agreed, by
speaker phone, to help Stanley recover the belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cut a deal and a couple of days later Joe was killed,''
Bass said. ``That's the sad aspect of this case. Joe was a nice
man, a nice sweet man. Everybody liked Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley's attorney, Michael P. Von Blon, was out of town and
unavailable for comment. Stanley did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Barker, who investigators say no longer lives in Houston, could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bass said Stanley and Barker had formed a partnership, American
Rocket Belt Co., to market the belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had ever been done right, it could have possibly made a
lot of money,'' he said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But, he said, Barker and Stanley had a disagreement and the two
fought, with Stanley suffering head injuries that he claimed were
caused by Barker beating him with a ball-peen hammer.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents in the lawsuit, assault charges were
filed against both, but those against Stanley were dropped, while
Barker received probation.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket belt at the center of the lawsuit is an improved
version of a machine first developed in the early 1960s by Wendell
Moore, an engineer at Bell Aircraft in Buffalo, N.Y. Built for the
Department of Defense, its 20-second flight duration made it
impractical.
</P>
<P>
   California inventor Doug Malewicki said Barker contacted him
several years ago, after the original Bell patents had expired,
about building a new version.
</P>
<P>
   Malewicki said recent developments in space-age materials made
it possible to use lighter metals and thus carry more fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Malewicki said the principle is fairly simple. Two tanks are
filled with hydrogen peroxide and a third contains nitrogen under
high pressure. When the throttle is opened, the nitrogen pushes the
hydrogen peroxide into a catalyst pack, made up of tightly packed
samarium nitrate-coated silver screens.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the catalyst, the propellant turns into
high-pressure superheated steam that blasts out two nozzles,
providing the lifting thrust.
</P>
<P>
   Malewicki said he helped Barker design the belt, but Barker
built it. He said the new device, dubbed the RB2000, could fly for
about 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   He said Barker has phoned him occasionally over the years to
chat, but will not discuss the rocket belt or Wright's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime I bring it up, he immediately changes the subject,''
Malewicki said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell rocket belt, flown by Suitor, was featured in the 1965
James Bond movie, ``Thunderball.'' He made more than 1,200 flights
in it, including one over the Niagara Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Suitor, who lives near Buffalo, was a neighbor of Moore and was
the test pilot for the first rocket belt at the age of 19. He later
test-flew the improved version developed by Barker and Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted recently at his home, Suitor, now 54, declined to talk
about the rocket belt or Wright's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anything to do with any of it,'' he said curtly.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent interview with the Buffalo News, Suitor said he
was contacted in October 1994 by Barker and Stanley to do the test
flight.
</P>
<P>
   That was the first time he flew the device, which he calls
``Pretty Bird.'' The last was at the NBA party at the Houston Ship
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Buffalo News that he unstrapped the belt and handed
it to Barker, who put it in his trailer and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the last time I saw Barker or Pretty Bird,'' Suitor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Suitor said that he had hoped to make one more flight in the
RB2000 but that Wright's death changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never be involved with any of those people again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personal fights between the partners, the ongoing
violence, and now murder. It's not worth the grief, let alone your
life.''

APPLE MAKES A MAC FOR THE TRUE BELIEVER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple computer is the high-tech industry's latest comeback kid,
yanking itself out of the abyss on the strength of Steve Jobs'
dogged vision and sales of the cheap little computer dubbed iMac.
</P>
<P>
   But one consumer model isn't enough to keep a ship the size of
Apple afloat. The company needed to follow the iMac with a worthy
overhaul of its entire line, including its mainstream Macintosh
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The result is the Power Macintosh G3 line, which, like the iMac,
sports an eye-catching external redesign marked by turquoise
accents. But in this case, beauty is much more than skin deep.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Macintosh G3 should restore the faith of the
professional Mac faithful, particularly those who need a
full-powered system for graphics applications. However, whether it
will win over the hearts and minds of Windows users remains to be
seen. It is an excellent computer, but it doesn't have enough
benefits over Windows 98 or NT 4.0 to inspire those with
established software libraries and usage habits to switch.
</P>
<P>
   The system I tried came with a 350-megahertz PowerPC G3
processor, 64 megabytes of memory, a six-gigabyte hard drive, a
DVD-ROM drive, a 16-megabyte ATI Technologies Rage 128 video card
and a 17-inch Apple Studio Display monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The computer sells on Apple's Web site in this configuration for
$1,999; the monitor, which has a beautiful Sony Trinitron display,
is another $499.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT'S MISSING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, it did not ship with a modem, though it does come
with a built-in Ethernet connection capable of either 10- or
100-megabit-per-second speeds. At first, I was peeved that it came
without a modem, but later I was pleased. More later.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes without a floppy disk drive, part of Jobs' ongoing
quest to rid the world of the 1.44-megabyte disk. While I still
think these Macs should have floppies of some kind included, it is
getting easier to find removable storage devices that will plug
into its Universal Serial Bus ports.
</P>
<P>
   The G3 systems come with two USB ports, two FireWire (or IEEE
1394) ports for use with personal electronics, a single Apple
Desktop Bus port and three open PCI slots inside. A fourth slot
holds the video card.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the colored plastic, Apple has come up with a unique and
intelligent design for the case. At each corner is a rugged handle
that makes moving the relatively heavy computer a snap. And the
case opens up simply by pulling open a latch on the side.
</P>
<P>
   When you pull the latch, the panel lays down flat, and the
motherboard sits on the inside of the panel. This makes working on
the Mac's guts a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to my experience with the lack of a modem for
the G3. At first, I was appalled that Apple would even consider
shipping a computer sans modem in this day and age, and I
remembered when Mac bigots would snicker at PC users because their
early machines didn't come with sound built-in.
</P>
<P>
   I called Apple and got the company to send a modem. It was
unconventional, to say the least: A square, tube-shaped device that
connected to the motherboard via two small screws and a ribbon
cable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MODEM GOES TO WORK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's ever had to install a modem into a Windows-based
system _ even one of the newer Plug and Play models _ would have
stared in awe at what happened next. When I turned on the Mac, the
modem was ... simply there. No searching for drivers, no klunky
dialog boxes saying that the operating system was identifying the
hardware. The modem just worked.
</P>
<P>
   What a concept.
</P>
<P>
   And, the modem lacked a signature Apple trademark from the past
_ a high price. A 56K modem for the G3 only costs an extra $100 _
about what you'd expect to pay for a middling quality PC modem.
</P>
<P>
   The system was very fast, about what you'd expect from any
350-megahertz model. Apple has made lots of noise by bragging that
its PowerPC-based Macs are actually faster than Pentium systems at
the same speed, a claim that's been challenged by a series of tests
done by PC Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that, while some software may run faster on the Mac
than its Windows version will on a PC, there's more to a computer's
speed than just the processor. Hard drives, the motherboard's
speed, the graphics card, the speed of the memory chips _ all
affect system performance.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you need to know about the zippiness of the G3s: If
you need or want to use a Macintosh, you are going to be very happy
with the speed of this system. Don't worry about whether it
outraces your Windows-using neighbor's machine, or whether hers
outdoes yours.
</P>
<P>
   While it is an excellent computer, no system is perfect, which
may come as a shock to Apple zealots who express outrage that
anyone may actually find fault with a Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has made the big mistake of including the same lame,
one-button mouse that it introduced with the iMac. This mouse is
perfectly round and has no tactile cues to indicate its
orientation. After it is used awhile, the mouse has a tendency to
rotate under your hand, so the button is off to the left or right
instead of straight up.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for the keyboard, which also is the same as that found on
the iMac. It's much less sturdy than the keyboards that shipped
with earlier Macs. Veteran Macintosh users will be appalled.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, both of these devices connect via the USB ports, so
they can be replaced. And if you buy one of these computers, you
should replace at least the mouse _ preferably with one that has at
least two buttons.

IT MAY BE EASIER TO KEEP 401 FONTS THAN TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES
GO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: In a recent tip from CNet was the following: ``Delete any
unnecessary fonts, and you'll free up a bunch of disk space.'' From
``Windows 95 for Dummies'' comes a suggestion that one should not
remove any fonts that came with Windows. I have 401 fonts on my
machine, not any added intentionally by me, but rather added as I
installed programs. I will never use 401 fonts. How do I know which
ones I can safely remove?
</P>
<P>
   A: The problem here is your phrase, ``not any added
intentionally by me.''
</P>
<P>
   You didn't install any fonts, so that means the programs you use
_ possibly day to day _ installed them. And the fonts added may be
crucial to their operation, separate from any Windows requirements.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it difficult to figure out which ones you don't need.
If you remove something you know Windows didn't add, then some
program may have problems, or at the very least, it may look weird.
</P>
<P>
   Most fonts are relatively small files, averaging below 100
kilobytes. And in Windows 95/98, they don't all load with the
operating system, as they did with Windows 3.1 _ they are called
only as they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, you probably are better off leaving things as they are.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son recently found a description of a file called
SmartDrive in a book about Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0. Apparently, if you
put it in your configuration files when they load, your system runs
faster. I have MS-DOS 5.0 on disk _ how can I get SmartDrive
installed on my Windows 95 system?
</P>
<P>
   A: As is the case with the first question, this is not something
you really want to do.
</P>
<P>
   SmartDrive is a disk cache program that provides a buffer for
loading data from the hard drive. SmartDrive tries to anticipate
what data the computer will need next, then pulls it off the hard
drive and stores it in random access memory. Since RAM is faster
than a hard disk, this can boost the speed of your computer.
</P>
<P>
   SmartDrive is not loaded as a separate file in Windows 95/98
because it's built into the operating system. You don't need
SmartDrive. In fact, if you install it, it could slow down your
Windows 95/98 system.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the definition of a ``hit'' vs. a ``visit'' when
talking about World Wide Web sites?
</P>
<P>
   A: A ``hit'' occurs any time that a component of a Web page is
accessed by a computer from across the Internet. A ``visit''
happens any time a unique user calls up a specific page.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that you go to a Web site that has three graphics, a
block of text and perhaps a counter on it. That would constitute
five hits _ one for each component _ on that page.
</P>
<P>
   But your looking at that page in total is a visit. If you come
back to that page again, it should not be counted as a second
visit, because you are not considered unique for that day. You've
already been there and laid eyeballs on it.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Web site operators justifying their traffic,
visitors are a better measure of a site's popularity than hits. If
a page has 100 components and one visitor sees it, that's 100 hits,
but only one visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a PC I bought in early 1997 that has two USB ports on
it. I was excited about getting USB, but I have Windows 95 and all
the USB hardware that I want says it's for Windows 98. Do I really
have to upgrade to Windows 98 to use my USB?
</P>
<P>
   A: Only later versions of Windows 95 _ dubbed OSR2 _ support
USB, but it's dicey. USB support is much better in Windows 98, so
if you really want to use that feature, upgrading is a good idea.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most companies, especially the big ones, have long chanted the
mantra of fairness. Treat everyone the same, the theory goes, and
that will eliminate a lot of headaches.
</P>
<P>
   But David Ulrich, a University of Michigan business professor,
made an argument recently claiming that is a silly way to do
business.
</P>
<P>
   It's much better to treat high performers differently by giving
them more flexibility and more perks, said Ulrich, who recently had
a round-table discussion with human resource executives. After all,
that's what keeps them humming _ and makes them less likely to look
around at other companies that will provide the extras they're
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his crazy antics, Dennis Rodman added a lot of value to
the Chicago Bulls as a great rebounder, Ulrich said. So during the
playoffs against the Utah Jazz, a time when most players practice,
what did the coach say when Rodman wanted to go to Las Vegas
between games?
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy yourself, Ulrich recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Offering that kind of flexibility is easier for smaller
companies because they're more informal, said Ulrich, who discussed
his ideas during the Houston Human Resource Management
Association's annual conference. But it also should become a matter
of course at bigger companies.
</P>
<P>
   He said a grocery store chain in Michigan lets its top
performers pick their own schedules, which include an option to
work three, 13-hour days. The new shift proved to be popular and
reduced the turnover of the stars.
</P>
<P>
   A bank that ran a 24-hour call center was having a hard time
staffing weird hours, especially 6 to 9 a.m. and 6 to 10 p.m., and
offered to set up at-home operations for its top performers.
</P>
<P>
   The standards were clear _ the operators must answer by the
third ring and 95 percent of the customers had to be satisfied, he
said. Other than that, they could fix breakfast or tuck their kids
into bed.
</P>
<P>
   The results were great, he said, adding that customers were
happier and the employees didn't quit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IDEA LONG PUT IN PRACTICE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston human resource consultant Greg Nakanishi said many line
managers have long treated top performers differently, even though
that may have flown in the face of the policies set by their human
resource department.
</P>
<P>
   But it makes sense to show favoritism to stars, said Nakanishi,
who likened the idea to pay. You pay your top performers more, so
it's just logical to give them special flexibility too, said
Nakanishi, president of GN Resources in Kingwood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That makes perfect sense to Carol Nichols, manager of the
statewide corporate trust department for Chase Bank of Texas.
Nichols, a line manager, said she believes employers such as Chase
have become more conscious about taking better care of their top
performers.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't, someone else will give them what they want, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said one of her employees got married and was moving to
California to be with her new husband. Nichols said she worked out
an arrangement so the employee, a top performer, could work from
her home with a computer. She visits Houston about twice a month,
travel expenses that Chase is only too happy to pick up, Nichols
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another employee's husband was transferred to Laredo in South
Texas and Nichols set up a similar telecommuting arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said she is willing to make the concessions to keep her
top employees, the Dennis Rodmans of the bank.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DISSENSION IN THE GROUP &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While it may be great for the favored employee, a two-tiered
system can create a lot of dissension in a work group.
</P>
<P>
   A company would need an objective measure of value and
communicate that to employees, said Kathleen Fenninger, president
of the Houston Human Resource Management Association. The
performance measures can't be wishy-washy, touchy-feely concepts
that people can't get their arms around. And that's not easy: Many
companies have a hard enough time defining performance measures for
the annual review.
</P>
<P>
   Fairness is still important, she said. How do you communicate to
employees that one of them can take her sick children to the doctor
without using sick or vacation time because she is a ``good
performer,'' yet other employees have to use accrued leave? asked
Fenninger.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said she isn't too worried about dissension. If an
employee feels she is being treated unfairly, Nichols said she
would be happy to explain what is necessary to bring up her skill
set.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that it's easier to explain to an employee in sales
who rings up just middling sales, she said. It's indeed more
difficult to explain when the performance measures aren't as
quantifiable _ such as professionalism and initiative.

SINGING THE PRAISES OF A RESURGENT PEACE CORPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fairly widespread notion that America's young adults at
century's end are navel-gazing, latte-scarfing me-firsters is
bogus, says Mark Gearan.
</P>
<P>
   He should know. As director of the Peace Corps for 3 1/2 years,
he's shoveled thousands of Peace Corps volunteers off to the
backwaters of the planet. These are not plush Club Med vacations,
but two-year commitments, often in the Back of Beyond, to work with
folks at ground level who usually have little in the way of tools
but their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fall we'll have 7,400 volunteers abroad _ that's the
highest number in 25 years. Right now we have 6,700 in 80 different
countries. We're making a big push to get up to 10,000 volunteers.
So for those who paint the young people of `Gen X' or `Gen Y' as
slackers, we don't see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor, apparently, does the Congress, which two weeks ago approved
money to expand the Peace Corps, a rare show of bipartisan support
for a Clinton initiative. Flying to Boston first thing on the
morning after the White House St. Patrick's Day bash, Gearan, the
Gardner native who was deputy chief of staff and White House
communications director in Clinton's first term, clicked off his
agency's growth rings: ``Four years ago we had 100,000 inquiries a
year. Last year we had 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night in Symphony Hall, the Handel &AMP; Haydn Society of
Boston and New Heritage Music Foundation will present ``Celebrating
the Voice of Peace,'' to commemorate the Peace Corps's founding 38
years ago by President Kennedy. David McCullough, the author and
PBS broadcaster, will narrate from writings of JFK and his favorite
poets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm praying the pianist gets sick,'' cracked Gearan, a saloon
piano player of some note. The Handel &AMP; Haydn Society approached
him two years ago about celebrating Kennedy's Peace Corps scheme,
he said. The oratorio composed by Dan Welcher is the first work
commissioned by the Society in 20 years. There will be a 3 p.m.
Symphony Hall matinee performance Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   From its creation in 1961, the first year of JFK's 1,000-day
presidency, the Peace Corps was a beacon of optimism and
neighborliness that has served the country well. So far 152,000
Americans volunteered for short money and long hours in remote
spots which needed a school, a well, a Ground Zero health program.
There are 38 American volunteers who'll rendevous in Symphony Hall
and fly out Saturday to Senegal in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly the same sense of travel and adventure in
today's volunteers that we've had since '61,'' said Gearan, ``but
now they're getting their experience in the global economy.''
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala is a Peace Corps
alum, as are Senator Chris Dodd and five congressmen, three of them
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the $30,000 to $50,000 college bonuses the military uses
to lure high school-graduating recruits in this
almost-full-employment age, the Peace Corps's applicant pool is
average age 28, almost all of them recent college graduates. Once
selected, they get a get a modest monthly stipend to live on, plus
full health insurance, and deferments on college loans, if any. On
completing their two-year stint, they get a readjustment allowance
of $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gearan in the past month was in Africa and Latin America with
Clinton. ``In Tanzania I sat with Charlie Stith (the Boston
minister who is US ambassador there) and the Tanzanian prime
minister, who said the first American he ever met was his Peace
Corps teacher. You hear that all over Africa and the Third World.''
But not all idealists are young people. One volunteer out of 12 is
over age 50. Massachusetts furnishes more volunteers than all but
four other states, said Gearan. Among the top 25 colleges feeding
the Peace Corps are UMass, Tufts, Smith, Williams, BU, and Gearan's
alma mater, Harvard (he is class of '78).
</P>
<P>
   Gearan started a new Crisis Corps, to recruit former volunteers
to go back for short stays to countries hit by natural disaster or
humanitarian crises. ``In Honduras on the last trip, we have one
guy who's an engineer on the Central Artery project here. He's
taking two months to go back to Honduras to help out after
Hurricane Mitch. He's a perfect example of a guy who's been there;
he can go in and literally on Day One be ready to make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate efforts are made to furnish volunteers with training,
language skills, and medical precautions. Not one volunteer has
been kidnapped, and ``safety and security are our No. 1 priority.''
In-house surveys show a high level of volunteer satisfaction,
Gearan said. ``Nine out of ten would volunteer again, and the same
proportion would recommend it to others.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Corps remains Kennedy's enduring governmental
monument. It made JFK into a worldwide figure of inspiration, the
most popular American abroad before Muhammed Ali, the all-time
popularity champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in countries today which did not exist when the Peace
Corps started,'' said Gearan, ``And we're in countries today where
you couldn't get a visa as an American.''

   If medical researchers fail to cook up a cure for the common
cold in our lifetime, it won't be for lack of trying. Despite its
name, the common cold is caused by not one common virus but five
different viral families, encompassing a couple of hundred unique
viral strains among them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a chance that a cure, or at least a
viable treatment, is in the works. Luck played an important part in
the story of a molecule known by the name of intercellular adhesion
molecule 1, or ICAM-1 _ one of a group of molecules that sit on the
surface of cells and adhere to other cells when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers noticed that ICAM-1 protrudes from cells in your
nasal cavity and acts as the entryway by which most members of one
family of common cold viruses, known as rhinoviruses, penetrates
your cells, infecting them. The history of the discovery of ICAM-1
is a scientific tale of collaboration, competition and chance.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts with Timothy Springer, a biochemist turned
immunologist at the Harvard Medical School. In the early 1980s,
Springer was studying lymphocytes, white blood cells that do much
of the work of fighting off infections and defending against any
bacteria or viruses that might invade your personal space. To do
their jobs, lymphocytes must stick to other cells.
</P>
<P>
   When Springer began his research, no one knew quite how this
stickiness was achieved. In 1981 he and his colleagues identified a
single molecule that seemed crucial to the adhesive aspect of a
type of lymphocyte known as a killer T cell. Because Springer had
only a general idea of what this molecule actually did, he gave it
a generic name, lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA-1), and
set out to learn whether his hunch was true, and if so, why.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people Springer called was a colleague at the
University of Pennsylvania who had heard a talk by a pediatrician
named Donald Anderson. ``In 1982,'' Anderson says, ``I received a
letter from a child's father. The girl was very young, maybe 2 or
3. The letter just said, 'My daughter has all kinds of strange
infections. Would anybody in the state of Texas have any interest
in taking care of her?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him and did a variety of studies on her. What we
noticed was that her white blood cells lacked the capacity to stick
to surfaces. They would slide right off glass or protein surfaces,
which is very unusual. White blood cells usually stick avidly to
almost everything.'' By 1985, Anderson had located a half dozen
similar patients in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson's colleague told Springer about him, the two
began working together. Studying blood samples from Anderson's
patients, they verified that the white blood cells would not clump
together, as normal white blood cells do, thus strongly suggesting
they were missing LFA-1. Further research showed that the protein
was indeed missing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the team published the result: LFA-1's target was
ICAM-1. The discovery launched an entire field of biology dedicated
to the study of cellular adhesion in the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Richard Colonno, then a molecular biologist at Merck,
now a vice president of infectious-disease drug discovery at
Bristol-Myers Squibb, showed definitively that 90 percent of all
rhinoviruses used one receptor, and the other 10 percent used
another. It meant 90 percent of half of the common cold viruses
might be stopped with the same drug, which was a large enough
percentage to justify developing a treatment and putting it on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-'80s, Colonno and his colleagues produced an
antibody that attacked the receptor and blocked the virus from
getting into the cell and replicating _ at least in a test tube.
But when they tried to come up with a cheap version of the
antibody, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   Colonno's work, however, had spawned competition from the work
of two molecular biologists, Jeffrey Greve and Alan McClelland who
worked for Molecular Therapeutics. McClelland and Greve tried to
nail down the receptor's identity, and succeeded in pinpointing the
gene that coded for the rhinovirus receptor as well as the receptor
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Greve's laboratory purified the protein and sequenced it,
creating a precise map of the string of amino acids that composed
the protein. When researchers in Greve's lab compared their
sequence with those in a computer database of proteins previously
sequenced by other researchers, ICAM-1 matched perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the library ... to find out what ICAM-1 was, and
came up Springer's group,'' McClelland says. Springer's ``group''
now included a pair of former researchers _ Robert Rothlein and
Steven Marlin _ who were working at Boehringer Ingleheim.
</P>
<P>
   Once Greve and McClelland realized ICAM-1 was the rhinovirus
receptor, word began to spread. Marlin got a call asking him if
ICAM-1 could be the receptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In very short order,'' Marlin says, ''we put together concrete
information that ICAM-1 was the receptor to a major group of
rhinoviruses.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next decade BI and Bayer, the company that owns
Molecular Therapeutics, raced to get a cold cure to market first.
Both teams hit on the same strategy. They produced a form of ICAM-1
that was not rooted in the cell walls but was soluble. They could
squirt it into noses in the hope that the rhinovirus would snatch
up the free-floating ICAM-1 and never get around to grabbing the
ICAM-1 receptors that let it into the cells. The strategy is a
''decoy effect,'' Marlin says.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of problems had to be solved first, however. For
instance, your nose produces mucus as a barrier to foreign
particles. Could soluble ICAM-1 survive, or would the mucus break
it down and wash it away before it had the chance to decoy any
rhinovirus?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also had to prove that the soluble ICAM would
work on all or most of the 90-plus strains of rhinovirus.
Reassuringly, their experiments showed that the virus seemed to
remain susceptible to the ICAM decoys, at least in test tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ICAM is good enough to make a marketable cold treatment
remains to be seen. McClelland, for one, calls it a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the kind of approach that, even if it doesn't
work, will certainly have advanced our understanding quite a bit.
And _ who knows? _ maybe it will work. The common cold has caused
enough problems for us all. It would be nice to have something you
could just take and be done with it.''

   &UR; WHAT'S A PINNA FOR? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The folds of the outer ear _ the pinna _ seem gratuitous, a
waste of cartilage and skin. But they are, some Dutch researchers
have found, crucial to our ability to pinpoint the vertical
location of sounds _ whether they come from above us, below, in
front, or behind. When a sound wave enters the outer ear, it
bounces around the pinna's ridges. Some frequencies are enhanced,
others diminished, with the pattern of those changes determined by
the particular shape of the pinna. Since everyone's pinnae are
different, so is the acoustic stamp placed on sound entering the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Biophysicist John van Opstal, who works at the University of
Nijmegen in The Netherlands, and his colleagues placed plastic
molds inside their own ears (and those of a student) to alter the
shape of their pinnae and wore them day and night for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``earprint,'' Van Opstal surmised, would have to be
learned by the brain if he and his colleagues were to retain their
normal hearing. (The brain determines horizontal distance to a
sound's source by measuring the differences between the two ears in
the arrival time and loudness of the sound waves.) Initially, in
tests in a darkened laboratory, none of the subjects could
determine the vertical source of a sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you position the source of a sound at many random locations
_ up and to the right, down and to the left _ the subject thinks
that the sound is moving only in the horizontal direction and not
at all in the vertical,'' Van Opstal says. But after four or five
days, three of the subjects began to regain their normal hearing.
(The fourth took almost three weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the hearing of all four returned to normal, and
remained so when they took out the molds, which suggests that the
brain can learn and retain many auditory maps. Interestingly, the
subjects noticed no difference in their hearing during the
experiment while they were outside the lab, even at the beginning
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the reason is that our visual system tells us where a
sound is coming from, although our auditory system tells us
something different,'' Van Opstal says. ``So the visual system is
the driving force that trains the auditory system, by correlating
what is seen with what is heard.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; CRANE SURGEON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eduard, a rare Siberian crane, suffered from severe arthritis
for five years. In the wild, Siberian cranes stand on soft, mushy
marshland. In zoos, however, where the birds typically live on hard
surfaces, arthritis is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither painkillers nor anti-inflammatory medication could
ease Eduard's pain, surgeons recently implanted an artificial joint
in his left ankle. The procedure, never tried on a bird, was
performed by Avery Bennett, an assistant professor of wildlife and
zoological medicine at the University of Florida, and Eugene
O'Brien, a hand surgeon with the Hand Center in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-hour operation at the University of Florida Veterinary
Medical Teaching Hospital, the surgeons replaced part of the ankle
joint with a flexible plastic device about the size of a
clothespin, normally used as an artificial joint in the big toes of
humans. Eduard is now recovering nicely, say his keepers.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; HOW TO GROW BONES FROM SCRATCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When surgeons need to graft bone _ for, say, reconstructing
someone's face after an accident _ they dig it out of another part
of the patient's body, usually the pelvis. ``It's a painful
operation,'' says John Davies, a dentist and biomedical engineer at
the University of Toronto. ``And because the patient must undergo
essentially two operations, he has to stay on the operating table
for a longer time. That's more costly and means a longer recovery
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies and his colleagues have found a way to avoid that first,
bone-harvesting operation. They've developed a polymer scaffold
that mimics the structure of real bone. In particular, it's
designed to work like trabecular bone _ the spongy bone beneath the
skeleton's hard outer shell. Like trabecular bone, the matrix has
countless interconnected pores, each about a millimeter in size.
Nestled within those pores are both osteoclasts (bone-eating cells)
and osteoblasts (bone-making cells). When the synthetic bone is
transplanted, those cells spread and grow new bone, healing the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have tried to seed bones onto a scaffold before,
Davies says, but with little luck. Some groups tried a matrix of
calcium phosphate _ the mineral that makes up coral. ``It works
extremely well when it comes to growing cells, but when it's put in
the body it's not absorbed. It just stays there. So that's not a
very good long-term strategy,'' he says. Other researchers have
tried biodegradable foams, but the pores in the foam are so small
that bone cells can't penetrate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they make bone, it's only as a shell formed on the
surface,'' Davies adds. By tinkering with two manufacturing
processes commonly used to make biodegradable foams, Davies has
made a foam that has much larger pores _ about the same size as the
pores in real spongy bone. ``When we seed the scaffold with cells,
the cells grow right through and penetrate to a depth of up to
about half an inch, so they make bone in a three-dimensional
configuration,'' he says. ``We haven't gone any deeper than that,
and we don't plan to, because when surgeons remove bone for
grafting, they only chip out tiny bits of bone, and we are trying
to create an alternative.'' Davies plans to test the synthetic bone
in simple dental surgeries within a year.

   &UR; WHAT'S A PINNA FOR? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The folds of the outer ear _ the pinna _ seem gratuitous, a
waste of cartilage and skin. But they are, some Dutch researchers
have found, crucial to our ability to pinpoint the vertical
location of sounds _ whether they come from above us, below, in
front, or behind. When a sound wave enters the outer ear, it
bounces around the pinna's ridges. Some frequencies are enhanced,
others diminished, with the pattern of those changes determined by
the particular shape of the pinna. Since everyone's pinnae are
different, so is the acoustic stamp placed on sound entering the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Biophysicist John van Opstal, who works at the University of
Nijmegen in The Netherlands, and his colleagues placed plastic
molds inside their own ears (and those of a student) to alter the
shape of their pinnae and wore them day and night for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``earprint,'' Van Opstal surmised, would have to be
learned by the brain if he and his colleagues were to retain their
normal hearing. (The brain determines horizontal distance to a
sound's source by measuring the differences between the two ears in
the arrival time and loudness of the sound waves.) Initially, in
tests in a darkened laboratory, none of the subjects could
determine the vertical source of a sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you position the source of a sound at many random locations
_ up and to the right, down and to the left _ the subject thinks
that the sound is moving only in the horizontal direction and not
at all in the vertical,'' Van Opstal says. But after four or five
days, three of the subjects began to regain their normal hearing.
(The fourth took almost three weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the hearing of all four returned to normal, and
remained so when they took out the molds, which suggests that the
brain can learn and retain many auditory maps. Interestingly, the
subjects noticed no difference in their hearing during the
experiment while they were outside the lab, even at the beginning
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the reason is that our visual system tells us where a
sound is coming from, although our auditory system tells us
something different,'' Van Opstal says. ``So the visual system is
the driving force that trains the auditory system, by correlating
what is seen with what is heard.''

 &UR; CRANE SURGEON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eduard, a rare Siberian crane, suffered from severe arthritis
for five years. In the wild, Siberian cranes stand on soft, mushy
marshland. In zoos, however, where the birds typically live on hard
surfaces, arthritis is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither painkillers nor anti-inflammatory medication could
ease Eduard's pain, surgeons recently implanted an artificial joint
in his left ankle. The procedure, never tried on a bird, was
performed by Avery Bennett, an assistant professor of wildlife and
zoological medicine at the University of Florida, and Eugene
O'Brien, a hand surgeon with the Hand Center in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-hour operation at the University of Florida Veterinary
Medical Teaching Hospital, the surgeons replaced part of the ankle
joint with a flexible plastic device about the size of a
clothespin, normally used as an artificial joint in the big toes of
humans. Eduard is now recovering nicely, say his keepers.
</P>
<P>
   While the bird's surgery may be used to help other arthritic
cranes, younger, healthy captive birds need preventive care. The
International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis., Eduard's home,
plans to build shallow, soft wetland environments to better
accommodate its 17 Siberian cranes.

<P>
   If medical researchers fail to cook up a cure for the common
cold in our lifetime, it won't be for lack of trying. Despite its
name, the common cold is caused by not one common virus but five
different viral families, encompassing a couple of hundred unique
viral strains among them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a chance that a cure, or at least a
viable treatment, is in the works. Luck played an important part in
the story of a molecule known by the name of intercellular adhesion
molecule 1, or ICAM-1 _ one of a group of molecules that sit on the
surface of cells and adhere to other cells when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers noticed that ICAM-1 protrudes from cells in your
nasal cavity and acts as the entryway by which most members of one
family of common cold viruses, known as rhinoviruses, penetrates
your cells, infecting them. The history of the discovery of ICAM-1
is a scientific tale of collaboration, competition and chance.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts with Timothy Springer, a biochemist turned
immunologist at the Harvard Medical School. In the early 1980s,
Springer was studying lymphocytes, white blood cells that do much
of the work of fighting off infections and defending against any
bacteria or viruses that might invade your personal space. To do
their jobs, lymphocytes must stick to other cells.
</P>
<P>
   When Springer began his research, no one knew quite how this
stickiness was achieved. In 1981 he and his colleagues identified a
single molecule that seemed crucial to the adhesive aspect of a
type of lymphocyte known as a killer T cell. Because Springer had
only a general idea of what this molecule actually did, he gave it
a generic name, lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA-1), and
set out to learn whether his hunch was true, and if so, why.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people Springer called was a colleague at the
University of Pennsylvania who had heard a talk by a pediatrician
named Donald Anderson. ``In 1982,'' Anderson says, ``I received a
letter from a child's father. The girl was very young, maybe 2 or
3. The letter just said, 'My daughter has all kinds of strange
infections. Would anybody in the state of Texas have any interest
in taking care of her?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him and did a variety of studies on her. What we
noticed was that her white blood cells lacked the capacity to stick
to surfaces. They would slide right off glass or protein surfaces,
which is very unusual. White blood cells usually stick avidly to
almost everything.'' By 1985, Anderson had located a half dozen
similar patients in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson's colleague told Springer about him, the two
began working together. Studying blood samples from Anderson's
patients, they verified that the white blood cells would not clump
together, as normal white blood cells do, thus strongly suggesting
they were missing LFA-1. Further research showed that the protein
was indeed missing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the team published the result: LFA-1's target was
ICAM-1. The discovery launched an entire field of biology dedicated
to the study of cellular adhesion in the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Richard Colonno, then a molecular biologist at Merck,
now a vice president of infectious-disease drug discovery at
Bristol-Myers Squibb, showed definitively that 90 percent of all
rhinoviruses used one receptor, and the other 10 percent used
another. It meant 90 percent of half of the common cold viruses
might be stopped with the same drug, which was a large enough
percentage to justify developing a treatment and putting it on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-'80s, Colonno and his colleagues produced an
antibody that attacked the receptor and blocked the virus from
getting into the cell and replicating _ at least in a test tube.
But when they tried to come up with a cheap version of the
antibody, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   Colonno's work, however, had spawned competition from the work
of two molecular biologists, Jeffrey Greve and Alan McClelland who
worked for Molecular Therapeutics. McClelland and Greve tried to
nail down the receptor's identity, and succeeded in pinpointing the
gene that coded for the rhinovirus receptor as well as the receptor
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Greve's laboratory purified the protein and sequenced it,
creating a precise map of the string of amino acids that composed
the protein. When researchers in Greve's lab compared their
sequence with those in a computer database of proteins previously
sequenced by other researchers, ICAM-1 matched perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the library ... to find out what ICAM-1 was, and
came up Springer's group,'' McClelland says. Springer's ``group''
now included a pair of former researchers _ Robert Rothlein and
Steven Marlin _ who were working at Boehringer Ingleheim.
</P>
<P>
   Once Greve and McClelland realized ICAM-1 was the rhinovirus
receptor, word began to spread. Marlin got a call asking him if
ICAM-1 could be the receptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In very short order,'' Marlin says, ''we put together concrete
information that ICAM-1 was the receptor to a major group of
rhinoviruses.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next decade BI and Bayer, the company that owns
Molecular Therapeutics, raced to get a cold cure to market first.
Both teams hit on the same strategy. They produced a form of ICAM-1
that was not rooted in the cell walls but was soluble. They could
squirt it into noses in the hope that the rhinovirus would snatch
up the free-floating ICAM-1 and never get around to grabbing the
ICAM-1 receptors that let it into the cells. The strategy is a
''decoy effect,'' Marlin says.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of problems had to be solved first, however. For
instance, your nose produces mucus as a barrier to foreign
particles. Could soluble ICAM-1 survive, or would the mucus break
it down and wash it away before it had the chance to decoy any
rhinovirus?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also had to prove that the soluble ICAM would
work on all or most of the 90-plus strains of rhinovirus.
Reassuringly, their experiments showed that the virus seemed to
remain susceptible to the ICAM decoys, at least in test tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ICAM is good enough to make a marketable cold treatment
remains to be seen. McClelland, for one, calls it a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the kind of approach that, even if it doesn't
work, will certainly have advanced our understanding quite a bit.
And _ who knows? _ maybe it will work. The common cold has caused
enough problems for us all. It would be nice to have something you
could just take and be done with it.''

   &UR; WHAT'S A PINNA FOR? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The folds of the outer ear _ the pinna _ seem gratuitous, a
waste of cartilage and skin. But they are, some Dutch researchers
have found, crucial to our ability to pinpoint the vertical
location of sounds _ whether they come from above us, below, in
front, or behind. When a sound wave enters the outer ear, it
bounces around the pinna's ridges. Some frequencies are enhanced,
others diminished, with the pattern of those changes determined by
the particular shape of the pinna. Since everyone's pinnae are
different, so is the acoustic stamp placed on sound entering the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Biophysicist John van Opstal, who works at the University of
Nijmegen in The Netherlands, and his colleagues placed plastic
molds inside their own ears (and those of a student) to alter the
shape of their pinnae and wore them day and night for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``earprint,'' Van Opstal surmised, would have to be
learned by the brain if he and his colleagues were to retain their
normal hearing. (The brain determines horizontal distance to a
sound's source by measuring the differences between the two ears in
the arrival time and loudness of the sound waves.) Initially, in
tests in a darkened laboratory, none of the subjects could
determine the vertical source of a sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you position the source of a sound at many random locations
_ up and to the right, down and to the left _ the subject thinks
that the sound is moving only in the horizontal direction and not
at all in the vertical,'' Van Opstal says. But after four or five
days, three of the subjects began to regain their normal hearing.
(The fourth took almost three weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the hearing of all four returned to normal, and
remained so when they took out the molds, which suggests that the
brain can learn and retain many auditory maps. Interestingly, the
subjects noticed no difference in their hearing during the
experiment while they were outside the lab, even at the beginning
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the reason is that our visual system tells us where a
sound is coming from, although our auditory system tells us
something different,'' Van Opstal says. ``So the visual system is
the driving force that trains the auditory system, by correlating
what is seen with what is heard.''

 &UR; CRANE SURGEON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eduard, a rare Siberian crane, suffered from severe arthritis
for five years. In the wild, Siberian cranes stand on soft, mushy
marshland. In zoos, however, where the birds typically live on hard
surfaces, arthritis is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither painkillers nor anti-inflammatory medication could
ease Eduard's pain, surgeons recently implanted an artificial joint
in his left ankle. The procedure, never tried on a bird, was
performed by Avery Bennett, an assistant professor of wildlife and
zoological medicine at the University of Florida, and Eugene
O'Brien, a hand surgeon with the Hand Center in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-hour operation at the University of Florida Veterinary
Medical Teaching Hospital, the surgeons replaced part of the ankle
joint with a flexible plastic device about the size of a
clothespin, normally used as an artificial joint in the big toes of
humans. Eduard is now recovering nicely, say his keepers.
</P>
<P>
   While the bird's surgery may be used to help other arthritic
cranes, younger, healthy captive birds need preventive care. The
International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis., Eduard's home,
plans to build shallow, soft wetland environments to better
accommodate its 17 Siberian cranes.

 &UR; HOW TO GROW BONES FROM SCRATCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When surgeons need to graft bone _ for, say, reconstructing
someone's face after an accident _ they dig it out of another part
of the patient's body, usually the pelvis. ``It's a painful
operation,'' says John Davies, a dentist and biomedical engineer at
the University of Toronto. ``And because the patient must undergo
essentially two operations, he has to stay on the operating table
for a longer time. That's more costly and means a longer recovery
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies and his colleagues have found a way to avoid that first,
bone-harvesting operation. They've developed a polymer scaffold
that mimics the structure of real bone. In particular, it's
designed to work like trabecular bone _ the spongy bone beneath the
skeleton's hard outer shell. Like trabecular bone, the matrix has
countless interconnected pores, each about a millimeter in size.
Nestled within those pores are both osteoclasts (bone-eating cells)
and osteoblasts (bone-making cells). When the synthetic bone is
transplanted, those cells spread and grow new bone, healing the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have tried to seed bones onto a scaffold before,
Davies says, but with little luck. Some groups tried a matrix of
calcium phosphate _ the mineral that makes up coral. ``It works
extremely well when it comes to growing cells, but when it's put in
the body it's not absorbed. It just stays there. So that's not a
very good long-term strategy,'' he says. Other researchers have
tried biodegradable foams, but the pores in the foam are so small
that bone cells can't penetrate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they make bone, it's only as a shell formed on the
surface,'' Davies adds. By tinkering with two manufacturing
processes commonly used to make biodegradable foams, Davies has
made a foam that has much larger pores _ about the same size as the
pores in real spongy bone. ``When we seed the scaffold with cells,
the cells grow right through and penetrate to a depth of up to
about half an inch, so they make bone in a three-dimensional
configuration,'' he says. ``We haven't gone any deeper than that,
and we don't plan to, because when surgeons remove bone for
grafting, they only chip out tiny bits of bone, and we are trying
to create an alternative.'' Davies plans to test the synthetic bone
in simple dental surgeries within a year.

BLACK HAWK DOWN 
A Story of Modern War 
By Mark Bowden 
Atlantic Monthly Press, 386 pp., illustrated, $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's Somalia misadventure began as a mercy mission. It
dissolved into a shoot-'em-up search for warlords and ended with
the bodies of US soldiers dragged through the streets of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no episode better illustrates the intellectual poverty
of US foreign policy following the Cold War. The Oct. 3, 1993,
debacle has haunted US policymakers ever since, prompting a US
force a week later to pull back just before intervening in Haiti
and paralyzing the Clinton administration a year later as more than
a half million people were killed in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bowden's harrowing, authoritative account of the Somalia
debacle, ``Black Hawk Down,'' benefits from auspicious timing,
coming just as Washington debates whether to intervene in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter, manages to bridge the
broad gulf between Americans, who thought they were doing good, and
Somalis, who saw the US forces as destructive agents of a United
Nations that was trying to frustrate a legitimate bid for power by
a clan leader.
</P>
<P>
   That clan leader, Mohammed Farrah Aidid, became America's white
whale. And Captain Ahab in this story was retired Admiral Jonathan
Howe, the unyielding UN mission leader trying to abduct Aidid, who
was frustrating international peace efforts. Howe, Bowden writes,
had evidence that Aidid was inciting demonstrations, then gunning
down his own people to accuse the UN of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Howe and US military leaders, with the backing of Clintonites
Anthony Lake and Madeleine Albright, aggressively used US muscle to
try to counter Aidid in mid-1993. On July 12, TOW missiles slammed
into a home where Aidid's leadership was meeting, killing at least
54 people and wounding 200. The brutality of that attack was
eclipsed overseas by the deaths of four Western journalists, who
rushed to the scene only to be killed by enraged Somalis.
</P>
<P>
   Using extensive interviews with US soldiers and Somalis, Bowden
skillfully recreates the weeks leading up to the biggest firefight
since the Vietnam War. Bored troops trapped rats in their hangar
barracks, cut limbs off goats to practice field medicine, and sat
around reading John Grisham novels or playing board games like
Risk, Scrabble, or Stratego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Hawk Down'' comes alive as it recreates the disastrous
Oct. 3 mission by 140 elite US Rangers and Delta squad
``operators'' to abduct two Aidid lieutenants. Bowden intersperses
the interviews with transcripts of military radio traffic to detail
how an intended hourlong mission stalled, how Somali fire brought
down two Black Hawk helicopters and how troops fought to rescue
their buddies and make it back to base from a city suddenly out to
destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   To survive, precision shooting turned into indiscriminate fire
at the Somalis, dehumanized as Sammies or Skinnies by the US
troops. Bowden writes that soldier Eric Spalding ``saw a little
Somali boy who looked no more than five years old with an AK-47,
shooting it wildly from the hip, bright flashes from the muzzle of
the gun. Somebody shot the boy and his legs flew up into the air,
as though he had slipped on marbles, and he landed flat on his
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, Spalding had urged a colleague not to shoot a
woman in flowing purple robes who was carrying a baby. ``The woman
abruptly turned. Holding the baby in one arm, she raised a pistol
with her free hand. Spalding shot her where she stood. He shot four
more rounds into her before she fell. He hoped he hadn't hit the
baby. . . . He thought he probably had. . . . There wasn't time to
fret over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden may be faulted for overreliance on direct quotes in
battle and in a paucity of sources and 20/20 hindsight in
describing Aidid's strategy against the Americans. But he gets the
finale right. Although the ferocious battle severely depleted
Aidid's forces and stockpile, the impact came from the TV footage _
of corpses of several of the 18 fallen Americans, carried as
trophies by Somali mobs.
</P>
<P>
   And with those images, Operation Restore Hope, begun to feed
starving Somalis and find peace, was dead. President Clinton
pledged to reinforce the US troops while his administration planned
their pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said the Pentagon failed to back up the troops with
heavy armor _ and did not think through the entire intervention. No
new rules have emerged since for possible US involvement in civil
wars. US inaction in Rwanda was matched in Congo and in Sierra
Leone, where more people were killed in one month than throughout
the yearlong conflict in better-publicized, European Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Aidid died in 1996, but Somalia's chaos continues. Just Sunday,
a dozen Somalis from warring clans were killed in a firefight over
roadside ``taxes.'' It didn't make much news.

LAHEY LOSES ITS HEART DOCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was a wisp of a man, really, small in size but huge in
stature, his very presence able to fill a room, even an entire
life, which was precisely Dr. Warren Nugent's intent. In the
process of saving lives, he also filled them _ with hope, with
humor, and with dignity for those resigned to the dark possibility
that they may never grasp such feelings again.
</P>
<P>
   He combined the manner of a country doctor with the intellect of
one of the foremost specialists of his kind. He was in demand the
world over on the lecture circuit, the recipient of too many
medical honors to fit on any normal man's shelf. Back at home,
though, at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass., his patients knew
him best for his simple, unfailing kindness, his willingness to
talk them through the toughest of times and invest himself in their
needs.
</P>
<P>
   All along, he taught crucial lessons of character, not only in
the way he lived his life, but last week, in the way he died.
</P>
<P>
   Medical schools don't teach their students how to inform a
14-year-old girl that her colon must be removed and explain the
humiliating side effects that linger the rest of her life. But with
his silvery-white hair and his soothing voice, Dr. Nugent knew how,
with a grace uncommon in the halls of any hospital.
</P>
<P>
   His was the unalluring field of gastroenterology. His mission,
though, was the human heart. ``He thought it was important for
people not to get depressed by the disease,'' says his Lahey
colleague, Dr. Andrew Warner. ``He encouraged people to get out and
do something, to join a team or play an instrument, to be active in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the product of a time when the medical profession was
imperial, the individual doctors imperious. Decades later, he saw
the dawn of an age when doctors became known in bureaucratic
parlance as care providers, burdened with triplicate insurance
forms while taking instructions from an accountant on the other end
of the line. Yet Dr. Nugent always did it his own way. The diseases
he treated were chronic, his patients with him for life. He guided
the sick through graduations, marriages, and parenthood, creating
bonds, becoming a steady voice of calm.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Fran Wojnoski. Her prior doctors wanted to
remove her intestine, leaving her in the unpleasant need of a
colostomy bag. Dr. Nugent instead recommended an experimental
treatment involving an overnight intravenous feed that pumped
nutrients into her body in lieu of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't met him, they would have taken my insides out,''
says Wojnoski. ``If I hadn't met him, I'd probably be dead. He'd
take an hour on the phone with you if you needed him. If I called,
he'd see me immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   He was revered by doctors and nurses alike at the world-renowned
Lahey Clinic he called his home. He treasured them in return. He
arrived in 1954, learned gastroenterology at the knee of the
legendary doctor Sara Jordan, and never strayed anywhere else. He
became chairman of the department, was heralded from afar, and
received patients from every corner of the globe, especially from
his native Canada.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Joan, says he whistled every day as he left for work,
so happy with his lot. He was slightly shorter than the 5 feet, 7
inches that he often proclaimed, with curly, close-cut hair and a
frame kept trim on the ski slopes and his backyard tennis court in
Medfield _ an unusual indulgence in a modest life. He decorated his
office wall with fishing flies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nugent tried retiring in 1990, but it didn't quite take.
Truth is, he didn't know the business end of a hammer from the head
of a nail, so handy work was out, and you can play only so much
tennis over the course of a day. Two years later, he was back in
the office, seeing his patients and training his successor, Dr.
Warner, in the way to soothe a soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn about diseases in medical school, and how to treat
patients in a hospital,'' says Warner. ``He taught me how to relate
to people in their whole lives.''
</P>
<P>
   He retired for good in 1995. Alzheimer's disease began setting
in shortly after. He fought it off in the best way he could, by
staying active and traveling. He continued an annual sojourn to a
fishing lodge in Canada with family and friends. He skiied as
recently as last year.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, the disease began to overcome. Three weeks ago,
his family checked him into Lahey. On Saturday afternoon (3/13),
with his wife, four sons, and daughter surrounding his bed, Dr.
Nugent died at the age of 75. It is less an irony than an act of
great intent that he took his last breath in the hospital he so
loved, a place where he not only saved lives, but filled them with
hope, humor, and dignity.

LOTT'S EXCUSES FOR RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a press conference last week, a reporter willing to pester
politicians on such trivial matters as bigotry, racism, and white
supremacy asked Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, ``Senator, can
you explain why you wouldn't support a resolution to censure the
Council of Conservative Citizens . . . ?
</P>
<P>
   Lott responded, ``I think if anybody wants to have a resolution
condemning any groups that advocate, you know, white supremacy or
racism, you know, we should support that. But when you start naming
one group over another group, or this group or that group, the list
is going to get to be pretty long, and that would be the wrong
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a follow-up. ``But you all did that with the Khalid
Muhammad resolution several years ago and everybody supported that,
you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said, ``That was one individual. Are we going to start
doing that repeatedly, naming individuals and groups?''
</P>
<P>
   There was another follow-up. ``That doesn't seem hypocritical,
you supporting one and not the other?''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said, ``No. No, no, no. It doesn't seem hypocritical to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott is the devilish dodger who has yet to break a sweat in the
three months that have passed since articles in The Washington Post
and The New York Times detailed Lott's cozy ties with the C of CC.
The 15,000-member group has a thick lineage to the racist white
citizens councils of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Its Web page is a current linkage to 1990s hate. Either its own
page or the pages of organizations that link back to the council
are engines of paranoia, desperately trying to prove black genetic
inferiority and the harm done to straight, white, Anglo-Saxon men
by Jews, homosexuals, and feminists.
</P>
<P>
   The C of CC's Web page has been praised by Web pages that also
support the Ku Klux Klan, Aryan Nations, and David Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The articles forced Lott to distance himself from the council.
``I have made my condemnation of the white supremacist and racist
view of this group, or any group, clear.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly muddied the water with the incredible claim that
he had ``no firsthand knowledge'' of it, despite having made
speeches before the group in the 1990s, despite the fact that an
uncle declared him an honorary member, despite the fact that he
never protested the use of his Senate column in the council's
newsletter, despite having had top officials of the group visit him
in Washington in 1997 and despite posing with a smile for a photo
with the officials.
</P>
<P>
   The condemnation became even more hollow when Democratic
congressmen Robert Wexler of Florida and James Clyburn of South
Carolina last month introduced a resolution to condemn the council.
As of early this week, the resolution has 132 signatures, including
10 Republicans. Wexler contacted Lott's office to invite him to
introduce a similar resolution in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, as you can see, is refusing. This is despite the fact that
Lott was one of the senators who voted, 97-0 in 1994 to condemn the
hate speech of Muhammad, a previously unknown aide to Louis
Farrakhan in the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it all comes down to,'' Wexler said last week, ``is when
it is a black person who is racist, it's OK to condemn that
invidividual and single him out, but when it is a white person or
white group, that it is not OK to single out that group.''
</P>
<P>
   That observation is shared by NAACP chairman Julian Bond. When
the African-American mayor of Washington, D.C., momentarily
accepted the resignation of a white aide who used the word
``niggardly,'' a word with no racial meaning, Bond said he received
50 telephone calls from the media, including one from Australian
public radio. As of Thursday, Bond said he has received only six or
seven calls from the media about Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought it up with Arlen Specter and Mitch McConnell,'' Bond
said. ``I said, `What are you going to do about Trent Lott?' They
said, `What about Trent Lott?' even though this had been in several
articles and columns in the Post.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican senators also voted to condemn Muhammad's
speech. Bond said, ``What this says is that white bigotry is so
ordinary, so everyday that it can pass without notice, even if you
cannot even begin to compare the proportionality between this
obscure figure of Muhammad and Lott, one of the most powerful men
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott should no longer be obscure and obtuse about the council.
If the United States Senate can stop to condemn Muhammad, a
crackpot with no influence, it must be used to condemn a council
powerful enough to have Lott, Representative Bob Barr, and
Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordice as keynote speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The battle to turn up the heat resumed Thursday, when Wexler
held a press conference with several civil rights organizations.
But Wexler needs help. Perhaps when Julian Bond gets 50 phone calls
on Trent Lott, we can begin to predict the day that Lott makes the
only condemnation that now matters, in the Senate.

 MIDDLEBURY, Vt.: ... the family.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If that seems simplistic, something has to explain why the
Panthers have prevailed in virtually every circumstance: as an
unknown commodity in 1995, the second year New England Small
College Athletic Conference members were allowed to compete in the
national tournament, ``and a lot of the kids didn't know the
difference between the ECACs and the NCAAs,'' says Beaney. In 1996,
when the pressure to repeat was tangible and the Final Four was in
hostile Wisconsin. In 1997, when many of the core players had
departed and the expectations were relatively modest. And in 1998,
when the seniors were seeking perfection, another generation of
contributors had been lost, the national record was at stake, ``and
it was almost a relief when we won,'' says Beaney.
</P>
<P>
   Something must explain why freshmen scored the winning goal in
the national final for three straight years before this year's
captain, Nickolai Bobrov of St. Petersburg, Russia, and Belmont
Hill, broke the string last year as a junior. ``Just when they
expect one thing, we throw something different at them,'' says
Giannacopoulos, who did the honors as a freshman in '97. ``Maybe
this year we'll have the goalie do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And something must explain why this year's team _ which rolled
the dice by bypassing the ECAC tourney (NESCAC teams can play in
only one postseason event), then sweated out an NCAA bid, which it
received only because the selection committee chose five Eastern
schools _ is back within hailing distance of the national summit.
</P>
<P>
   Bobrov thinks it's the Panther prototype, once suggested by
Beaney but in recent years demanded by the upperclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unsaid rule,'' says Bobrov. ``We assume it together.
We try to get the young guys up to speed, teach them the tradition
on and off the ice. We want to uphold the Middlebury style, promote
the integrity of the game and the role of the hockey player as role
model.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes community outreach, again initially mandated by
Beaney and now standard operating procedure among the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players place more demands on themselves than the
coaches do,'' says Beaney.
</P>
<P>
   They work on projects such as local blood drives, speak at high
schools, assist with various youth hockey programs, and go a bit
beyond. Tuesday's pre-practice skate included third-grader Jonathan
Grohs, at whose school McKee is a guidance counselor. The boy's
father died March 6, ``and this is so special for him,'' said his
aunt, Trudy Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   When a local sports psychologist was recovering from a heart
attack suffered at a recent game, Beaney suggested that it might be
nice for the team to send him a get-well card. ``Coach,'' he was
told, ``we already did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing stressed early on,'' says Sealfon, another of this
year's captains, ``is that the way the players act off the ice
reflects on the whole team.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it seems the Panthers have carried town-gown
relations to extremes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the first national title was achieved at arctic,
ancient Duke Nelson Arena, the Panthers' home until plush Kenyon
opened as part of a $17.5 million renovation this past January. The
players' first act as college kings was to scale the glass behind
their net _ right into the delirious embrace of the townspeople who
had been encamping there long before any titles were at stake.
``And it's not hero worship,'' says Beaney.
</P>
<P>
   What it seems to be is genuine affection. The locals who work at
Kenyon part-time find their way into the players' hearts each game
when they turn an unused locker room into an unofficial hospitality
suite for the Panthers, replete with a menu that on any given night
can include homemade chili, barbecued chicken wings, or similar
combustible delicacies.
</P>
<P>
   The support assumes more dramatic forms as well. The Panthers
finished this regular season at Williams, knowing they needed a win
to have even a remote shot at an NCAA invitation. When they arrived
in Williamstown, Mass., after a bus ride of more than two hours,
they were almost too shocked to disembark. Awaiting them was an
honor guard of Panther loyalists that stretched from the bus to the
arena entrance, through the lobby, and on to the visitors' locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd heard a few people were coming,'' says Giannacopoulos.
``But I didn't believe this. The support here is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it wasn't just students,'' says Beaney. ``Townspeople from
every walk of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Middlebury wound up winning, 5-2, then was kept in suspense for
15 days before getting an NCAA slot, albeit with an unwelcome trip
west.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there was a chance we wouldn't make it,'' says Beaney.
``But you know what? That would have meant our last memories of
this season would have been the Williams game. And that's not such
a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' says Giannacopoulos, ``we would have come out here to
finish the three-on-three, anyway, with or without the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now they can achieve both objectives, though winning the big
tournament is hardly a given. Despite their survival at St. Norbert
_ thanks to a deciding goal by, naturally, a freshman, Ryan
Constantine _ the Panthers won't be favored. Then again, they
weren't supposed to get this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was expected to be a rebuilding year,'' says junior
goalie Jon Marsh, a transfer who began his career at the Air Force
Academy and has compiled a 17-5-1 record while trying to keep this
drive for five alive. ``I think we've still got some playing left,
whether it's one or two more games.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's one game, that won't mean failure. ``The national
championship is the ultimate destination,'' says Giannacopoulos.
``But there's a lot of steps before that. We've got to walk
together.''
</P>
<P>
   If they ascend the mountaintop one more time, they'll add
another gold watch, courtesy of the NCAA, and another gold ring,
courtesy of the school, to their jewelry collection.
</P>
<P>
   With sundry choices, Beaney always wears his 1996 ring ``because
of where we won it and who we beat (RIT).''
</P>
<P>
   He has another reason for wearing it, but like the success of
his program, its significance is below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of special,'' says Beaney. He takes off the ring
to reveal an inscription on the underside. ``Each year's team has a
slogan,'' he says. ``They engrave it on the ring. This one was,
`Find A Way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What's the 1999 slogan?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' says Beaney, smiling. ``The players haven't
told me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's their slogan. Their team. Their dynasty.

UNH AIIMING FOR ITS FIRST TOURNEY TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The University of New Hampshire, its first outright Hockey East
regular-season championship in the bank, starts its quest for
another first this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats clinched their first regular-season league title
with a weekend sweep of Maine two weeks ago. And now they will take
a run at their first Hockey East tournament title.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1-seeded Wildcats take on No. 4 Providence in the first
semifinal at the FleetCenter at 5. No. 2 seed Maine and No. 3
Boston College play in the second game, scheduled for 8. The
winners play Satuday at 7 for the title.
</P>
<P>
   There are incentives aplenty this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Providence probably needs to win the event to get into the NCAA
Tournament, which begins next weekend in Worcester and Madison,
Wis.
</P>
<P>
   UNH has a spot in the NCAAs locked up with its regular-season
title, and Maine and BC will receive at-large berths if they don't
get the guaranteed spot for winning this tournament. But where the
teams will be seeded will depend on weekend results.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College is looking for a second-straight league
tournament title and to regain the form that took the Eagles to the
national championship game last year and had them ranked No. 1 in
the country in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's seniors are seeking their first league title and the
team's first since 1995. The Black Bears also want to tune up for
their first NCAA appearance since 1995. Maine, which was 17-15-4
last year, has lost in the league championship game two of the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bears hold a 2-1 edge over Boston College this year,
splitting their two games at Conte Forum and winning, 6-4, in their
last meeting, in Orono Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   UNH has a 2-1 edge on Providence as well. The teams split a pair
of games in early November and the Wildcats took a 4-2 decision in
Providence Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, UNH was the No. 3 seed and was upset in the Hockey
East quarterfinals by Maine. This year, fueled by the sweep of
Maine and last weekend's sweep of Merrrimack, the Wildcats come to
the FleetCenter confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question the level of play goes up a notch each weekend
from here on in,'' said UNH defenseman and captain Steve O'Brien of
Braintree and Catholic Memorial. ``It will be tough, but if we play
our game, we can win those championships.''
</P>
<P>
   It starts with Providence against Friar guns such as Mike
Omicioli, Fernando Pisani, and Jerry Keefe. ``It's going to take
our team doing our systems in all three zones,'' O'Brien said.
``We've got to be physical like we were against Maine. We've got to
stay in other teams' faces. With guys like Omicioli and Keefe we've
got to put pressure on and not give them much space or time to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   UNH has appeared in only two tournament championship games,
losing to Maine, 4-1, in 1992, and to Boston University, 4-2, in
1997. Providence won the tournament with a 3-2 win over Maine in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case for the last three years, the Wildcats will
be led by forward Jason Krog (30 goals, 45 assists in 36 games).
Last Saturday night he had a career-best four goals in a 5-4 win
over Merrimack that boosted the Wildcats into the semifinals.
Darren Haydar, his freshman linemate, had the other goal. And Mike
Souza, a junior from Wakefield who lines up with them, had three
assists.
</P>
<P>
   Krog led a UNH sweep of Hockey East's top awards. He was named
Player of the Year, Dick Umile was named Coach of the Year, and
Haydar Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Krog, Maine's Steve Kariya, and BC's Brian Gionta were named
Hockey East's first-team all-star forwards. Maine's David Cullen
and UNH's Jayme Filipowicz were the first-team defensemen, and BU's
Michel Larocque was the goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Krog, Kariya, Gionta, and Larocque were the Hockey East picks
among the 10 finalists for the Hobey Baker Award, given to the best
player in Division 1.

SNOW-SHOEING THE NATION'S FASTEST-GROWING WINTER SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
(poetry style) 
 
There's a patch of old snow in a corner 
That I could have guessed 
Was a blown-away paper the rain 
Had brought to rest. 
It is speckled with grime as if 
Small print overspread it, 
The news of a day I've forgotten _ 
If I ever read it. 
_ ROBERT FROST 
 
(end poetry style) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so it is patch-of-old-snow season, except at ski areas,
where the building of depths is like saving money, with snowmakers
running through cold nights to give the depths their compounding
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Killington in years past has built up more than 20 feet of snow
to keep the Cascade trail skiing into June.
</P>
<P>
   But in the rest of the outdoor world, spring presents a bit of a
problem when, just before mud season, the going is soft and slushy.
Cross-country skiing is OK in some places, where the tracks have
been groomed firm, but in the mush, unless you know your klisters _
does anyone know klisters these days? _ the ski tends to collect
these huge globs of stuck snow on the scaled kick zone.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of step-glide, you clomp ahead as if you'd strapped your
feet into a pair of concrete blocks.
</P>
<P>
   But take heart, ye winter-weary, dying to get out and do . . .
something. Anything. One of the best back-country conveyances in
the most marginal, thin, rough, uneven cover remains what has
become the fastest growing winter sport in the US: snowshoeing.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of the sport is pretty easy to fathom. In a word,
``minimalism.'' Snowshoeing requires no lifts, no lessons, no
infrastructure, no prepared trails of any kind. And shoeing, as one
aficionado friend is fond of saying, is the kind of discipline in
which one advances from beginner to intermediate in about 20
minutes, the initial lesson being how to wind the straps around
one's boots.
</P>
<P>
   Which, by the way, is also a piece of good news. Though some
entrepreneurial wise guys have marketed a boot designed for
snowshoeing, treat this with the same caveat emptor your might a
pet rock. Plain old hiking or outdoor boots will do fine.
</P>
<P>
   Just three years ago, in the 1995-96 snow season, the National
Sporting Goods Association reported that 400,000 people were
snowshoeing. The next season that figure leaped to 660,000, and
last season more than a million Americans were out busting through
woods and meadows with their now lightweight, thoroughly modern
equipment. Plastic and strong lightweight alloys have transformed
the sport from the old wood-frame days.
</P>
<P>
   Again, what separates snowshoeing from anything else done on
snow is its range and flexibility. And as early spring arrives with
its tremendous variety of conditions _ from rock hard mornings to
slushy afternoons _ snowshoeing is up to all of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people show up to ski and the conditions are marginal,
they might not want to get out there,'' says Brendan Sullivan, a
former US Ski Team racer who directs the cross-country center at
Bretton Woods. ``But then we have snowshoes for them, and that
takes the excuses away. They can still go out there and have a
winter wilderness experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others in the industry, Sullivan has seen snowshoeing take
off in the last few years. This is partly due to the product and
all its plusses, but another boost comes from the snowshoe
manufacturers who have given attractive discounts to cross-country
ski areas to buy and rent their products at a relatively low price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a smart marketing move for them,'' says Sullivan, ``to
target the same market (as Nordic skiers) and give them the
option.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many skiers either carry a pair of snowshoes in the car
when they head north, or drop into rental shops to pick them up at
a cost of $10 to $12 a day. Snowshoe prices range from around $100
to $180, depending on quality, size, or weight-bearing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, proponents of cross-country skiing would say, ``If
you can walk, you can cross-country ski.'' This was an interesting
reversal of history, since cross-country was trying to market
itself as an alternative to Alpine skiing, a relative newcomer to
snow sports. The pitch line was not entirely true.
</P>
<P>
   It is for snowshoeing, however. ``Especially if people use
poles,'' says Sullivan, ``if they can walk, they can put on a pair
of snowshoes with those crampons and feel solid on anything they
walk on _ ice, groomed trails, or ungroomed.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter idea is discouraged for obvious reasons, he adds.
Straying from groomed trails in the forest around the base of Mt.
Washington, for instance, could result in getting lost.
</P>
<P>
   But the temptaiton when shoeing is always to get off the groomed
trail and hit the woods, where the deep snow is. And it's
particularly fun climbing up mountains through wilderness terrain.
</P>
<P>
   What also must be said for cross-country skiing is that
snow-shoeing has none of that smooth, exhilarating glide, speed, or
grace that make Nordic skiing so beautiful and satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   But when the melt is on, followed by those crusty old patches of
snow in the woods, the spring move is easy, say aficionados, who
have even established snowshoe race circuits and orienteering meets
on shoes. Strap on a pair, and just take off. Easy as that.

GO LIGHTLY WITH SOAP PADS ON OLD GALVY CREAM CAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 21, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a nice old galvanized milk can, actually a smaller
sized cream can, that has my grandfather's name on it. I'd like to
clean it up some, but how? It is not rusting.
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD O'HARA, Plymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Since the can is a family heirloom with a provenance
(significant background), and possibly worth more than you realize,
you may not want to do much to it at all. Too much cleaning and/or
refinishing antiques can reduce their value. I suggest washing it
with detergent and water, and scrubbing lightly with a bristle
scrub brush; rinse and let dry. Or, rub lightly with soap pads,
just to get surface dirt off, not to cut through the galvanizing;
rinse and let dry; be content with that. Rub very lightly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have clumps of moss in the ridge of my house in New
Hampshire. It is real moss, not algae. How can I remove it without
wrecking the asphalt shingles?
</P>
<P>
   BARRY BERKAL, Swampscott, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Moss has very shallow roots, so you should be able to scrape
it off carefully with a wide putty knife or, more safely, a wood
spatula or similar wide-bladed wood tool. After that, scrub off
residue with a bristle scrub brush. Then, apply a mix of one part
bleach and three parts water to kill any residue. Incidentally,
moss is great stuff _ in the right place: a shady corner of the
yard or similar area. It is maintenance free and will look good,
going dormant in winter and coming right back in spring. The
Japanese revere certain types (there are many kinds), and Americans
should learn to live with it. But not on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to put up vinyl siding and replace windows. The walls
are covered with asphalt shingles, very thick and pretty ugly. The
siding people say they can put the vinyl right over the asphalt. Is
that a good way to do it?
</P>
<P>
   CONCERNED, in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No, it is not a good way to do it. If anything is uglier than
vinyl, it is asphalt siding, which pretended to be brick or wood or
other natural products, and never worked. Later, the cover-uppers
used asbestos cement shingles, which caused their own problems and
still didn't look like wood. Then there was aluminum, finally
vinyl, which the siding people like to say is final, but still
doesn't look like wood.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I think the asphalt should come off, no matter how
expensive it is to remove and dispose of because it is a hazardous
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Vinyl or any other covering over the asphalt will not be even or
smooth because of the uneven surface of the asphalt, despite
putting an underlayment on first. Besides, you are adding another
layer, bringing the wall out even further, which may require new
molding around window and door casings.
</P>
<P>
   There are probably old wood clapboards or wood shingles under
the asphalt, and putting vinyl over this rather even surface would
result in a fairly decent-looking siding. Just hope that the wood
under the asphalt has not rotted out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My niece painted the baby's room recently, and spilled half a
gallon of latex paint on the wall-to-wall carpet, creating a stain
about two by two feet. With much gnashing of teeth and long, hard
scrubbing with water, the stain is gone and the carpet looks good.
The paint was pretty close to the color of the carpet. But it is
stiff as a board. How can we soften it?

   A. It's the paint that was not removed that is stiffening the
carpet. What you have to do is knead the carpet to try to break up
the paint that is sticking to the fibers. Try vacuuming the spot,
really pushing the cleaner bar against it. If you have a beater
bar, use it. Repeat this as often as your energy holds up. Another
trick: Lift the carpet as you would lift a dog by the scruff of the
neck, and knead the carpet, rubbing it against itself.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes scraping a wood board over the spot will help break up
the paint. Don't try paint remover or anything to soften the paint
because anything like that will stain the carpet.
</P>

<P>
   Q. My mahogany coffee table has a leather top, which has a few
white stains on it. How can I remove them? Also, a black leather
pocketbook was left beside a white leather one, and some of the
white came off on the black. And how can I get that white off the
black?
</P>
<P>
   HELEN YOUNG, Weston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. For the stains on the top, try rubbing them with a little
toothpaste. There's just enough abrasive to take off the very top
of the finished leather, enough to remove the stains without
spoiling the leather. You could try the same with the pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   If you are leery about either of these techniques, you can use
an Apple Leather Care product made by Apple Polishers of Stow. The
company makes a number of products, including Leather Cleaner, an
aggressive cleaner designed to safely clean finished leather. Call

MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUND CAN IMPROVE SAVINGS EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 21, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 16-year-old girl who has saved about $5,000 through
baby-sitting jobs, etc. It is currently in a savings account
earning negligible interest. I would like to invest it so that when
I am in my mid-twenties I will be able to buy a car. What sorts of
stocks, bonds or mutual funds would you recommend?
</P>
<P>
   V.R., Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Basically, there are two courses you might take to improve
your returns. Most bank savings accounts do indeed provide a
negligible interest return. You can probably come close to doubling
the interest level if you went with a money market mutual fund _
getting perhaps 5 percent rather than the 2 1/2 to 3 percent you're
probably getting now. Such an account left alone for nine years
would grow to $7,757 over nine years _ not enough for a splashy new
car, but a nice start. With this investment, you would face, well .
. . a negligible level of risk.
</P>
<P>
   When you get into stocks and bonds and the mutual funds that
invest in them, the risk is no longer negligible. You might pick a
relatively low-risk fund that divides its investments between
stocks and bonds. One idea here is that the conservative
investments in bonds will reduce the risk inherent in the stock
markets. Another is that the bond and stock markets often move in
opposite directions, so if the stock portion of the portfolio is
heading south, at least in theory the bond portfolio will
strengthen and ease your losses.
</P>
<P>
   Balanced funds are good for what investors call
intermediate-term investments _ money that's being put away for a
period that might range from five to ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Puritan fund is an excellent example of such an
balanced fund. If you look at its record in detail for the past ten
years, it will give you a general sense of what to expect, both in
terms of general long-term results and how frustrating owning such
funds can be at times. During that decade, the fund produced
average total returns of 14.32 percent a year. But that average is
far from consistent. During those years, returns ranged from a high
of 24.46 percent (in 1991) to a low of minus 6.35 percent (in
1990). So you'll have to think a while about how you'd feel if you
put $5,000 in such a fund, only to find that it was worth $4,500,
or even less, a year hence. Still, if you are in for a nine- or
ten-year haul, the odds are excellent that the good years will far
outweigh the bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   But don't count on anything like that 14 percent figure I
mentioned above. Almost everybody who follows the stock markets
thinks the past ten years have been exceptional, and it's not
realistic to expect that such heady gains will continue.
</P>
<P>
   But I do think it's reasonable to hope for 8 percent average
returns, and if that happened your money (at least on paper) would
almost precisely double by the time you're 25 years old, growing
from your initial $5,000 to $9,996.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a civil service employee, 44, and I will be eligible for
retirement in 2011. I contribute the maximum allowed to the Thrift
Savings Plan and have the following assets: IRAs of $21,500 in
Vanguard Star, $12,000 in Janus, and $6,000 in Cisco Systems common
stock. I also have $15,000 in Franklin US Government Securities,
$9,000 in Washington Mutual Investors, and $40,000 in a credit
union's money market account. I want to be more aggressive. I'm
considering moving most of the Vanguard money to Vanguard Growth
and Income, with perhaps 10 percent of it going to Vanguard Health
Care. Would you recommend consolidating any of the accounts?
</P>
<P>
   M.P., La Mesa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. I like your thinking, but I don't think you're proposing to
go far enough. And not only do I think you shouldn't consolidate
your fund positions _ I think you should diversify still further.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, when you liquidate the Vanguard Star position, I
suggest you divide the proceeds evenly between Vanguard Growth and
Income and Vanguard Specialized Health Care. Such a move would put
the Health Care position at roughly at 10 percent of the total
portfolio, and would add a lot more growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   If you indeed want to take a more aggressive stance, I'm sure
you've realized that the two positions that are most likely to drag
down portfolio are the government bond fund and your big money
market position. Why not divide the money now in Franklin US
Government Securities fund between Franklin Income, a balanced fund
with a relatively modest stock allocation, and Franklin Rising
Dividends, a mid-cap stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   As for the money market account, I suggest you begin by deciding
how much money you feel you would need as emergency savings to be
comfortable.Whatever the amount, I'd move it amount to a good
mutual fund money market account, which is likely to offer a
dramatically higher yield than what you're getting with the credit
union, and would provide similar liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 31-year-old woman with no debts and the following
investments: I have a 401(k) plan at work now worth $13,000, with
20 percent invested in Fidelity Spartan U.S. Market Index fund, 30
percent in Baron Asset fund, and 25 percent each in Fidelity
Magellan and Fidelity Freedom 2020 funds; I add $480 a month to
this account. I also have a $10,000 account with Janus funds, with
the investments evenly divided among Janus fund, Janus 20, Janus
Worldwide Janus Global Technology, and its money market fund, and I
add $500 a month to these accounts. I also have 80 shares of Exxon
Corp. and add $150 a month to this investment through its dividend
reinvestment program. Finally, I have $10,000 in a money market
fund. I have no plans such as buying a house or a car in the near
future. Is the distribution of my money appropriate?
</P>
<P>
   E.S., Acton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You are doing a terrific job of developing your portfolio,
and if you can maintain the disciplines of diversification and
saving, you will have a mammoth nestegg by the time you're 65 --
nearly $4.4 million based on assumed 10 percent average annual
growth and contributions at the current level. (And that doesn't
factor in your $10,000 money market account, which I presume to be
emergency savings.) I probably would have looked for a health care
sector fund rather than going with Janus brand-new Global
Technology fund, but certainly you've moved into one of the two
sectors that are most likely to outperform over the long haul. I
think I also would have selected Janus Overseas rather than Janus
Worldwide, arguing that the 56 percent of the Worldwide portfolio
that's invested in U.S. equities duplicates the positions in your
traditional domestic growth funds; with Janus Overseas you would
get a pure international play. If I were you I would make that
switch right now, and at some point in the future I suggest you add
a health care sector fund to the mix. But that's all quibbling --
you're doing a great job.

IRELAND'S CORRS FAMILY: SIBLING HARMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a busy St. Patrick's Day for the Corrs. The Irish
pop-rockers arose at 4 in the morning on Wednesday in Manhattan to
prepare for the ``Today Show,'' then caught their breath and headed
over to the ``Rosie O'Donnell Show.'' That was just the morning.
That afternoon, they had another steady diet of interviews, before
playing their evening gig at Roseland Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Corrs _ sisters Andrea, Sharon, and Caroline and their
brother, Jim _ are in heavy demand everywhere these days. They have
sold 4 million albums overseas, where their stardom has moved from
Ireland to the continent, and especially to England, where the
Corrs CD, ``Talk on Corners,'' has been No. 1 for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The next boundary to fall is the United States, where the Corrs
are determined to achieve similar recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes repeated returns to America to break through,'' says
guitarist Jim Corr. ``America is so huge _ it's like 50 countries
in one. But we feel we have laid the foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Corrs are not everyone's pint of Guinness _ they can sound
sticky-sweet at times _ but there is a growing depth that is hard
to deny. ``Talk on Corners'' has a tune cowritten with Alanis
Morissette producer Glen Ballard and another with the veteran
hitmaker Carole Bayer Sager. There are entrancing covers of Jimi
Hendrix's ``Little Wing'' and Fleetwood Mac's ``Dreams.'' Drummer
Mick Fleetwood even sat in on this song during the group's PBS
special, ``Live at Royal Albert Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very nice what Mick said about us. He said, `I love
this band. They play with passion,' '' notes Corr proudly during
our phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a passion to rival that of fellow countrymen U2, but
it's a sincere enthusiasm as the group merges pop, rock, and the
traditional sounds of fiddle and pennywhistle. ``We go off in
directions that might not be predictable,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Corrs started playing music at their home north of Dublin,
where their parents sometimes played in a cover band. Singer
Andrea, the youngest at 24, is also an actress and appeared in the
Irish film ``The Commitments'' (``she played the sister of the
band's manager and got to speak a few rude lines,'' says Jim) and
in ``Evita,'' where she played Juan Peron's mistress.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Corrs, who are influenced by everyone from Irish
groups Horslips and Moving Hearts, to the Eagles and the Police,
kept working on their music and have improved to the point where
they were asked by the Rolling Stones to recently open five dates
of their American arena tour.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what it's like to be the only brother in a group with
three oft-described beautiful women, Jim offers this quick, nicely
diplomatic response: ``I don't see three beautiful women. I see my
sisters. This is complete normality for me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remains reunite: Barry &AMP; the Remains were the original hot
property of Boston's garage-rock scene. The group attended Boston
University, cut its teeth on gigs at the Rathskellar in Kenmore
Square, was the first local band to sign with a major label (Epic
Records). They achieved pop immortality by opening a Beatles tour
in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``We toured with the Beatles for three weeks and 14 cities. It
turned out to be their last tour and our last tour as well,'' says
Barry Tashian, who later played with Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris,
and his wife Holly in the duo Barry and Holly Tashian.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the success of '60s garage-rock compilations (such as
the ``Nuggets'' series on Rhino Records, which has featured the
Remains' seminal ``Diddy Wah Diddy''), and by the success of a book
he wrote about the Beatles tour (``Ticket to Ride''), Tashian
reformed the Remains last year. They'll play their first,
welcome-back Boston gig Saturday, sharing a bill with the Lost,
another reunited '60s band that stars Willie Alexander, a Boston
rock legend. The show's emcee will be Peter Wolf of J. Geils Band
fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first (comeback) date was last year at a festival in Leon,
Spain,'' Tashian says from his home in Nashville. ``It was
fantastic. A couple thousand kids were there. The average age was
25 and they were going crazy for the band. We played all our stuff
and they knew all the words. We were later told there are 70 bands
in Spain covering Remains material. We knew nothing about that, so
it was overwhelming to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Remains had more than their 15 minutes of fame in the '60s.
They were on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' and ``Hullabaloo.'' They
played Boston Garden with the Dave Clark Five. They broke up only
after Tashian realized that they would never be as big as the
Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   But, responding to the ``magic'' of the '60s, Tashian says that
``we're rocking again and people are telling us that we're still
nailing it.'' The rest of the Remains are original members as well:
keyboardist Bill Briggs (who has been selling cars in Burlington),
bassist Vern Miller (a music teacher in New Jersey), and drummer
Chip Damiani (a contractor in New Haven).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just taking things one day at a time,'' says Tashian.
``But it's amazing that the four of us are still here.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Coffeetable Stones: A lavishly beautiful, photo-oriented tome,
``The Rolling Stones: A Life on the Road,'' is now on sale.
Combining concert photos from the past 35 years, along with
interviews, it was compiled by Dora Lowenstein, daughter of
longtime Stones business manager Prince Rupert Lowenstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started talking about it in 1994,'' she says. ``I had the
idea of doing a program for the `Voodoo Lounge'' tour, but that
transformed into a book of the tour and then more.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowenstein had access to the Stones archives and to the band
members, who consulted on the book. ``They had direct involvement
and looked at all the designs,'' she says of the Stones.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenstein, now 32, has seen more than 100 Stones shows. She
also has her own firm, Dora Lowenstein Associates, which organizes
all of the Stones's parties, from backstage affairs to the Prince
of Wales Heritage Fund Weekend. Not a bad job.

LYCOS TEAMS WITH HSN TO SELL FINAL FOUR GOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet portal Lycos Inc., struggling to preserve its merger
with assets of USA Networks Inc., is launching an important
business venture with one of USA Networks' best-known companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Shopping Network (HSN), one of the USA Networks firms
that is to merge with Lycos, will team up with Lycos this weekend
in a campaign to sell merchandise related to the NCAA Final Four
college basketball championship. Lycos will sell basketball
memorabilia on a special Internet site that will promote other
products for sale on HSN's TV channel. Meanwhile, the TV network
will flash advertisements for basketball merchandise for sale on
the Lycos Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be harnessing our on-line eyeballs to sell
product,'' said Jeff Bennett, vice president of electronic commerce
at Lycos. ``HSN is going to be our partner in on-air promotion and
fulfillment.''
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly an unusual campaign for Lycos. Earlier this year
the company worked with the National Football League to set up a
promotional Web site devoted to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But this Lycos-HSN alliance is different. The Lycos Super Bowl
site sent souvenir buyers to the NFL's on-line store. In this case,
Lycos itself will sell merchandise to visitors. And all the orders
Lycos receives will be shipped through HSN's order-fulfillment
system.
</P>
<P>
   HSN's ability to ship as many as 80,000 customer orders a day is
a key selling point for Lycos' controversial plan to merge with HSN
and several other companies now owned by USA Networks. Lycos
executives have argued that other on-line firms will have to spend
as much as $500 million to build an order-fulfillment
infrastructure like HSNs. The proposed merger, they said, would
instantly give the new USA/Lycos Interactive Networks Inc. a major
advantage over other Internet retailers.
</P>
<P>
   But terms of the deal have infuriated some Lycos shareholders,
who want more for their stock at a time when Internet companies are
selling for billions of dollars. David Wetherell, chairman of CMGI
Inc. of Andover, originally supported the deal, but resigned from
the Lycos board after the company's shares lost a third of their
value. Now Wetherell, whose company controls nearly 20 percent of
Lycos shares, is working to scuttle the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ullas Naik, who tracks Lycos for First Albany Corp. in Boston,
says the outcome of the Lycos-HSN basketball promotion could either
help improve prospects for the merger or scuttle it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can demonstrate to the street that there are synergies
between Home Shopping Network and Lycos, there might be a
possibility that Lycos shareholders, those who are negatively
disposed to the deal, may reconsider,'' Naik said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ironically, a successful promotion could have the reverse
effect. Naik said shareholders may conclude that Lycos can gain all
the advantages of the merger without having to merge. That could
actually increase opposition to the Lycos-USA Networks deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' headquarters are in Waltham, Mass.

THE `US' QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Now that Terry Murray has agreed to pay $16 billion to
build the WalMart of New England banking, you think he wants to see
Home Depot move in? Think again.
</P>
<P>
   A Fleet-BankBoston merger was supposed to be the deal that would
never happen because the regulators would never allow it. Murray,
of course, was smarter than all of us. He has wanted this deal for
years, and he has done his homework in Washington; this merger is
going to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   The only real issue left is who will be Fleet's competition?
</P>
<P>
   As Ira &AMP; Anne &AMP; Ted &AMP; Alice inside the banks all wonder ``What
about me?', it's a good time to ask, ``What about us?'' You know,
as in us, the customers who now have a choice between Fleet service
and our friendly hometown bankers who are somehow supposed to keep
this behemoth honest.
</P>
<P>
   To get the deal past regulators, Fleet faces the biggest
divestiture in banking history. It has proposed selling $13 billion
in deposits and about 270 branches across New England. Who gets
what in those sales will determine Fleet's competition on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: Fleet is going to try and get away with the
weakest competition the regulators will allow. We, of course, want
just the opposite: the strongest possible competition.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet will argue, and quite correctly, that there is more
competition than ever. Citicorp is huge in the credit card business
here. G.E. Capital is a giant business lender. And there's that
thing called the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But wade through all the big-picture, future-of-banking stuff,
and you are still left with this: Fleet wants anyone in here as a
competitor as long as it's not a big national player. And if it
doesn't want BankAmerica or First Union here, maybe we should.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the world is going in just the opposite direction.
Thursday, the Massachusetts congressional delegation waded in,
saying it would ``oppose vigorously'' the sale of the branches to
one bidder and instead urging that the branches go to ``a diverse
group'' of local banks.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds great in the district, but Terry Murray couldn't
have written the letter better. Fleet would like nothing more than
to be competing against a bunch of pigmies. ``We were a little guy
once, too,'' one Fleet/BankBoston executive told me. He somehow
managed not to break out laughing.
</P>
<P>
   What Fleet fears most is giving a First Union a foothold here.
Even if First Union swooped up the entire $13 billion in deposits _
unlikely -- it would still be only a start. But it could then start
buying, snapping up USTrust (dial 1-800 Neal Finnegan) and maybe
even Citizens Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the little guys, a First Union would have the resources
to spend on technology. It could build market share by competing
aggressively on price, offering better deposit rates and lower
lending rates. It has a brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has a lot of latitude over who gets what. Under the rules,
Fleet will pick the buyer or buyers it favors. Regulators must
decide if the deal maintains competition, not which of the offers
is best for the region. The price the branches fetch is less
important to Fleet than the competitor.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy enough to construct an argument that Citizens, not a
First Union, could provide Fleet the toughest competition, at least
in the short-term. A winning bid could provide Citizens with bulk.
Plus it has a local headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it. Fleet has no interest in strengthening Larry
Fish's hand at Citizens. When Fleet bought Shawmut in 1995, Fish
bid on the Connecticut branches being divested. He lost.
</P>
<P>
   This game is almost over, but not quite. The activists know they
have some leverage during the approval process. Already, Bruce
Marks, the Jessie James of community activists, has popped up after
several years of robbing banks around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Marks wants a big national player here. He calls Fleet ``the
feudal landlord who wants to sell to the peasants you can crush any
time. The last thing it wants is to sell to its competitive feudal
landlords.'' We haven't had quotes like that since Fleet paid Marks
millions to go away in the old second-mortgage days.
</P>
<P>
   But Marks has a point. If someone doesn't squeeze the Justice
Department now, it will be Fleet squeezing us later.

17-year-old embarked on ``a systematic tour of the most interesting
parts of the world.'' Vincent was one of the first American
travelers to see the great temple of Angkor Wat, a monument to the
four-armed Hindu god Vishnu the Preserver. Covering nearly one
square mile and cresting in a central tower taller than the
Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, the temple of Angkor Wat is the
largest and one of the most haunting religious edifices in the
world. For the next 98 years, an ever-growing stream of
sophisticated travelers from around the world journeyed to Angkor
Wat and the ruins of the nearby royal city of Angkor Thom.

EASTWOOD WINS BIG AS A LOSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TRUE CRIME 
Directed by: Clint Eastwood 
Screenplay by: Larry Gross, Paul Brickman, Stephen Schiff (novel:
Andrew Klavan) 
Starring: Clint Eastwood, Isaiah Washington, Denis Leary, Lisa Gay
Hamilton, James Woods, Diane Venora 
Running time: 127 minutes 
Rated: R (language and some violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a lot of true grit, or at least convincing grit, in
``True Crime,'' and that's what makes the new Clint Eastwood movie
interesting. Eastwood not only looks his own age but uses it to
bolster his performance as a character who's pretty much a washout
as a man but has enough left to be a talented newspaper reporter.
Just enough, in fact, to go to bat at the last minute for a
death-row inmate he's convinced is innocent. He holds off the
race-against-time cliches (although not to the extent of omitting a
car chase) by nailing the details of the awfulness of death row and
focusing on the crumbling prospects of his Oakland Tribune
reporter, Steve Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood is too savvy to fashion an anti-capital-punishment
editorial, even if he were in favor of it, which I'm by no means
sure he is. He also knows enough to not try to get too cute with
what in many other hands would be the scapegrace charm of the
journalist. Rather, Eastwood plays the guy as the recovering
alcoholic we're told he is, barely keeping things together, given
focus by his job, which is the only thing he does right. As a
father and husband, he's blown it, we're convinced in a piercingly
sour little scene he has with his estranged wife, Diane Venora, and
the daughter he keeps disappointing. (She is played by his own
daughter, Francesca Fisher-Eastwood. A nice touch!).
</P>
<P>
   His late-night pass at a colleague sent her out into a rainy
night to die in a car crash. He inherits her assignment,
interviewing the condemned man the day before he's scheduled to be
executed by lethal injection. As the convicted man, Isaiah
Washington is given as pristine a character as credibility allows.
He's a born-again Christian whose dignity in the face of death and
sensitive fathering of his own young daughter heightens the
reporter's own conspicuous character failings. As his nose for news
starts to twitch to life, the suspense begins. Can he refute what
he feels is a faulty case in time to stay the execution?
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood knows Oakland, having grown up there, and his longtime
cinematographer, Jack Green, captures it with a grave clarity that
imparts to it a played-out look that deftly fits with the
protagonist and his self-diminished prospects. The shabby precincts
through which Everett moves parallel the shabby mess he has made of
his life _ which Eastwood nails wryly and unsparingly. As his
reopening of the case picks up speed, the question is whether he
can overturn the guilty verdict against a black man for shooting a
clerk in a convenience store. The more resistance Everett
encounters to reexamining the case, the more convinced he is that
the condemned man is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more subtlety than Eastwood has been credited with to
slide around the cliches implicit in the situation and work in some
comedy. But Eastwood brings it off with an enjoyable level of
detailing and finesse. As actor and director, he never allows heavy
moralizing to drag down the story, slyly finding humor in the
tension between Everett and his metro editor (Denis Leary), who's
furious because he knows the reporter is having an affair with his
wife. There's even more humor in the exchanges between Everett and
his boss, played by James Woods with an amusement and indulgence of
Everett's foibles to which he can't quite give voice. This is the
second smart script in as many weeks to have Stephen Schiff's name
on it, proving that there's not only life but commercial viability
after ``Lolita.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood's famed economy, the screenplay's emphasis on
character, and the film's allowance for atmosphere work on several
levels _ and lift ``True Crime'' beyond the crudely manipulative
nonsense that's cluttering up the genre. Clearly, Eastwood has
learned to enjoy playing weakness and could go on for years playing
damaged old pros with just enough left to keep going. His
confidence in his own musical ability is growing, too, and
deservedly so. He wrote a nice bluesy song for the finish, which
provides a moody but never self-pitying grace note. It's a shame to
have to roll the closing credits over the richly rueful atmosphere
in its all-but-deserted downtown pedestrian mall where, to steal a
line from the film, Santa rides alone.

AFFLECK, BULLOCK ARE OK, BUT `FORCES' FIZZLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
FORCES OF NATURE 
Directed by: Bronwen Hughes 
Screenplay by: Marc Lawrence 
Starring: Sandra Bullock, Ben Affleck, Maura Tierney, Steve Zahn,
Blythe Danner, Ronny Cox, David Strickland, Meredith Scott Lynn 
Running time: 102 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (sensuality, language and a scene of drug use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Forces of Nature'' is exactly what the new romantic comedy
starring Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck is not. It wants to be a
neo-screwball comedy, with Bullock's free spirit upending Affleck's
buttoned-down blurb-writer. And it at least avoids formula
predictability. But it doesn't fly off the screen with the fizzy
energy of liberating disruption. It's a pleasant enough couple of
hours with two attractive leads, and it carries itself beyond
formula in tone as well as incident. But force, no. Nature, no. The
film just doesn't have that kind of spontaneity and impetuosity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Affleck does have his enjoyably squirmy moments as a very
straight guy headed from New York to Savannah to get married. All
it takes is one skid on a runway, and he's off the plane and into a
hired car, especially when he hears there are storms between him
and his wedding. So we're all set up for a road comedy, complete
with the sweet loose cannon sitting beside him, Bullock's character
named Sarah. She's also on her way to Savannah to sell her bagel
shop in the wake of a crumbling marriage to an exploitive flake.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock and Affleck throw themelves at the subsequent missed
connections and string of disasters that pull them way off course
from their intended destination and into a romance that he fights
and she doesn't. What's missing, though, is the screwball energy
that Sarah needs. Bullock is right to not want to get locked into
sweetheart roles, but you get the feeling, watching her here, that
she thinks she's being a lot wilder than she actually is. The
action is there in Sarah, but we don't feel the conviction and
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Forces of Nature'' isn't the ennui-producing dead weight
it could have been, considering how underwhelming it is. Affleck
does some nice things with his eyes when his character stares ahead
into the next disaster, not knowing how to stop it. Bullock is at
her best when she isn't trying to be zany, but slips into a more
realistic, serious mode and allows her character's vulnerabilities
and insecurities to show. The mood even turns bittersweet,
something unheard of in a studio comedy.
</P>
<P>
   There's a fundamental decency at work in ``Forces of Nature''
that works against the anarchy of screwball comedy, but makes the
characters more humanly appealing. To its credit, Marc Lawrence's
screenplay doesn't demonize or ridicule the fiancee waiting in
Savannah, either, a chance Maura Tierney makes the most of.
``Forces of Nature'' scores most of its points in its quieter
moments, when it isn't pushing the comedy too hard. Maybe they just
should have played it straight.

CONSUMER GROUPS FEAR BIG MERGERS WILL LIMIT CONSUMER CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The fee for taking cash out of an ATM machine might be
75 cents or a dollar. Or, it might be free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   A choice of ATM machines on the corner is one of the many ways _
some visible and some not _ in which fierce competition benefits
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The $16 billion acquisition of BankBoston Corp. by Fleet
Financial Group Inc. is being billed as a way to preserve a large
hometown institution by warding off buyers from outside the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the union _ before any branches are sold _ would lead to a
higher concentration of customer deposits in greater Boston than
has resulted from any other merger in recent banking history,
according to federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, consumer and bank experts said, is that a merger in
which one of the two major banks in the region disappears could
crimp competition, leaving customers only one megabank and dozens
of smaller institutions. This could cause higher fees for consumers
and limit options available to small businesses that are most
likely to rely on banks for financial services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not aware of a merger with more anti-competitive consumer
effects than this one,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive director
of the Consumer Federation of America, a Washington group that has
studied the impact of bank mergers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's good and healthy for banks isn't always healthy for
small business borrowers,'' said Julie Scofield, executive director
of the Smaller Business Association of New England.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger, Fleet Boston Corp. would have the lion's share
of deposits in New England's largest cities. According to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., combined consumer and business
deposits would be 40 percent of total deposits in the Boston
metropolitan area, nearly half of Hartford's deposits, and 58
percent of deposits in the Providence-Fall River area.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston, in announcing the merger this week, said
they would sell bank branches and ATMs in order to obtain approval
from federal regulators and to avoid antitrust challenges. The
banks plan to divest 270 branches across New England _ including
most of Fleet's branches in Massachusetts _ and shrink assets by
$13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Schepker, Fleet's spokesman, disputed speculation the merger
would hurt consumers. Banks, he said, are already under attack from
all sides of the financial industry.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, banks have lost billions in deposits since the mid-1980s
to mutual funds as investors have become enamored of investment
income earned by mutual funds .
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's Merrill Lynch in a cash management account or
Charles Schwab in a liquid mutual fund _ there are many options for
consumers,'' Schepker said. The popularity of transactions
performed on the Internet adds a new layer of competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Biggio, a partner in the New York law firm of Akin,
Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld and a former deputy assistant in the US
Justice Department's merger division, suggested that the
Fleet-BankBoston merger may become a test of how much bank
dominance is acceptable for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, in reviewing bank mergers in the past
has traditionally focused on the impact on small business of
mergers between banks within a metropolitan area. Branch sales
resulting from Fleet's acquisition of Shawmut National Corp. in
1995 appeased regulators' concerns that small and mid-sized
businesses have enough banks with which to do business. When banks
sell off branches, customers are transferred to the buying
institutions, which then try to keep the customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, there hasn't been much activity'' at the Justice
Department in reviewing the impact on consumers since that market
is usually more competitive, Biggio said. Although unfamiliar with
details of the Fleet-Boston merger, Biggio said, that if there is
``significant concentration, this may be a case where the consumer
issues come into play.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Griffin, a financial specialist for the Consumers Union
said, ``lack of choice'' in the merger ``is a real concern that
needs to be looked at by the regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department declined comment on the pending merger.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger is approved, Fleet Boston Corp. would be the
newest creature to emerge from 15 years of consolidation in
nationwide banking. Amid such rapid change, it would be difficult
to predict the landscape even five years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Vaill, chief executive of Boston Private Bank &AMP; Trust
Co., predicted that competition will be reduced immediately after
the merger. Loyal customers of both banks ``are going to have to
eat the food that's fed to them,'' he said. ``Over time, other
competitors will move into the market and provide choices.''
</P>
<P>
   A look back shows that consumers have often suffered as banks
increased their clout in a market through mergers. Although it's
difficult to blame mergers for higher fees, Federal Reserve studies
show that fees nationwide are up sharply as the industry has
consolidated into bigger and bigger banks.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, according to a July 1997 survey by MassPIRG,
the local affiliate of Ralph Nader's consumer group in Washington,
most fees charged by the six big banks were higher than those
charged by small banks eager to grab customers with lower fees.
</P>
<P>
   Banks ``use their size not to bring down the cost to the
consumer but they use a lack of competition in the market to set
higher fees,'' asserted Deidre Cummings, a consumer advocate at
MassPIRG.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there could be less competitive pressure than in the
past, when Fleet and BankBoston kept a sharp eye on each other,
often setting prices to undercut the other bank.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when the state Legislature failed recently to pass
a bill that would have banned ATM surcharges charged by banks to
noncustomers that use their ATMs, BankBoston said it would charge
non-customers $1. Fleet set its fee at 75 cents. A Cambridge
Savings Bank customer facing only two choices _ Fleet or BankBoston
_ would tend to use Fleet's machine.
</P>
<P>
   There will only be one choice if the merger is approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big getting bigger. The small getting smaller,''
complained Francesco Ciailone, after walking out of a BankBoston
branch in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Bank fees have risen nationally as banks have become more
dependent on fees, which are a more stable source of revenue than
the loan business, bank analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Often the big institution sets the tone after a bank merger. In
the San Francisco area, consumer groups are concerned that
NationsBank Corp., when it merges with BankAmerica Corp., would
eliminate BankAmerica's free checking accounts, said Ken
McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action in the Bay area.
NationsBank does not have a comparable product, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, San Francisco _ unlike Boston _ has an alternative, he
said. Washington Mutual, a big savings bank, also provides free
checking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, it's going to be very hard for NationsBank to
come in and set fees on these accounts if their major competitor is
not charging fees on the basic checking account,'' McEldowney said.

 RUN-UP REVEALS INTERNET'S POWER(For use by New York Times News
Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riskyman67 took the wild events of Thursday morning in stride
and offered this bit of reassuring advice: ``Just hang on to your
seats and enjoy the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   He was only one person in a crowd of investors writing on
Internet chat boards about the huge one-day gain and frenetic
trading activity in the stock of a previously obscure public
company, Netegrity Inc. of Waltham, Mass. Chances are, they were
responsible for much or even most of the activity that caught
everyone off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of got our coming-out party,'' said Netegrity
president Barry Bycoff, whose company sells Web security software
and services. ``As it turns out, it was a surprise party.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netegrity boom was another example of the power that now
rests in the hands of wired investors, who spend much of their day
scanning the Internet for news, corresponding on
investment-oriented electronic bulletin boards and actively trading
stock on line. They do not have the ability to affect big stocks
like Gillette Co. or Fleet Financial Group. But they can take small
stocks, particularly small technology shares, on a roller-coaster
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Netegrity stock shot up early Thursday and gained 90 percent in
value by day's end. The amount of stock traded, just under 10
million shares, made it the 14th most active issue anywhere, just
behind AT&AMP;T Corp. The volume roughly equaled the number of all
Netegrity shares swapped in the last 18 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the news: There was no news. Or not much to speak of.
</P>
<P>
   The Netegrity boom began when the Massachusetts Investor's
Digest, a free monthly newspaper with a ciculation of about 20,000,
issued a press release about the flattering profile of Netegrity in
its current issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look out Lycos! There is a new hot Waltham-based Internet
company, Netegrity, that is looking to grab mindshare and
marketshare in the e-commerce arena,'' the release began.
</P>
<P>
   The story and the rest of the issue had been available in a
newspaper box outside the Fidelity Investments investor center and
at other locations around downtown Boston or the city's suburbs
since Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was shot out into the electronic world and landed in
many places, including the part of Yahoo Finance dedicated to
information and chat about Netegrity.
</P>
<P>
   The stock roared ahead, from an opening price of just under 8,
and traded above 15 before noon. The price dipped a few dollars in
the afternoon, but finished strong to close at 15, up 7 1/8 for the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 8 million shares had traded hands by midafternoon, and
company officials said at that time they believed only about
160,000 involved bigger investors selling blocks of stock. The rest
were small trades, many executed by individuals, for 100, 500, or a
few thousand shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``A press release hits the on-line databases and goes into
(Internet) search engines. The power of the Internet to get news
disseminated is what sparked this,'' said Michael Stern, a former
Merrill Lynch broker who started Massacusetts Investor's Digest a
year ago. ``This is the first time it seems to have had a direct
effect on the stock, which is kind of scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Any third-party news about a stock like Netegrity can have an
outsized impact because it fills a void. The company is so small no
brokerage analysts follow it. Netegrity shares were worth just $141
million, even after their advance Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Riskyman67 and lots of other investors, writing under Web
pseudonyms, saw the release and stock reaction early. They
celebrated their good fortunes on Yahoo. So did investors writing
on a chat board at RagingBull.com, operated by a small company that
was the subject of another Massachusetts Investor's Digest profile
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of Netegrity news that hardly got as much
attention Thursday: A company filing with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission disclosed that Fidelity OTC Portfolio fund had
acquired 700,000 shares, a 5.15 percent interest in the company, in
a private placement earlier this year. Presumably, the fund made a
killing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Netegrity shares had slumped to as low as 1 3/16 in October and
traded with a price band of 1 to 4 for most of 1998. With it
seemingly stuck there, some investors had given up on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mouth is open,'' said an executive at one Boston brokerage
office that owned 350,000 Netegrity shares but sold them last year.
``I think of all the money I left on the table. We just didn't have
the patience and we regret it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Internet-related firms, Netegrity remains more
promise than performance. The company lost money in each quarter
last year and reported revenues of only $4.9 million for all of
1998. Its SiteMinder product and services control user access to
e-commerce on Web sites. Big new customers include Delta Air Lines
and Radio Shack.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Bycoff about the most important event in his firm's recent
past and he points to a key reseller agreement signed in January
with Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been focused on building our product and building our
market, not promoting the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bycoff can worry less about that today. But he has a different
problem: What the Net gives in a flash, it can take away just as
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   Avinash Persaud, the man who agreed to take a job as the head of
currency at Putnam Investments and mysteriously bailed out two
weeks later, resurfaced Thursday at State Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Persaud was named managing director and global head of research
for State Street's financial markets business. He had taken the
Putnam job in January and then, without explanation, said the deal
was off. Persaud had been head of foreign exchange and currency
research at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. in London.

HEARD ABOUT THE FIGHT IN THESTREET.COM? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; wonder if the potential investors in TheStreet.com would be
interested in knowing that the cofounders, Cambridge's own Martin
Peretz and the odious James Cramer, are on the outs. How this will
affect the forthcoming public stock offering of the on-line
business-reporting site is anyone's guess. No one's allowed to talk
to the press during this enforced ``quiet period'' of stock
registration.
</P>
<P>
   Said silent time hasn't shut up the voluble Cramer, however.
He's raving in the current issue of Slate (www.slate.com) about his
``enemies'' who ``sincerely want to see me fail. They want to drive
a wedge between my partners and me.'' Hmmm. Maybe they've
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what's soured this once-sweet relationship. It
seems like only Thursday that Peretz was squiring Cramer around
Cambridge, trying to drum up clients for his protege's
money-management business. (That's separate from TheStreet.com.)
Peretz _ owner of the New Republic magazine and a savvy investor in
his own right _ and Cramer were quite successful. Many of Cramer's
clients hailed from Peretz's Harvard-New Republic coterie, e.g.,
Michael Kinsley, now editor of Slate magazine. In some cases,
Peretz even loaned friends money to invest with Cramer. The fund
performed well, at least until last year. Cramer turned in a
sub-par performance, lost clients, and bridled at critics who
suggested he was spending too much time promoting himself on
television, and too little time at his trading desk.
</P>
<P>
   With the new stock deal, Peretz and Cramer are aiming to get
rich _ again. TheStreet.com is one of the few successful Internet
publishing ventures. Sure, they're losing tons of dough. But they
have 37,000 paying subscribers, which is a lot for the Web. They
have a talented staff and savvy early-stage investors, including
the New York Times Co., which owns the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   So let's speculate. Peretz and Cramer each own about 2.5 million
shares. We can't know what the stock price will be, but like other
Internet stocks, it probably will be bid up quickly. A comparable
company, MarketWatch.com, went public in January at $17 and
recently traded in the low 60s. So Jim and Marty are each looking
at a $50 million payday.

My self-serving memoir
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Librarians will surely have the good sense to file Simon
Fireman's forthcoming ghostwritten memoir, ``No Justice,'' in the
category: Books That Should Never Have Been Written.
</P>
<P>
   Fireman, you may recall, is the moneybags chief of Aqua-Leisure
Inc. in Avon, Mass. who got nailed for making illegal campaign
donations in the waning days of the 1996 Bob Dole campaign. (He's
also the uncle of Reebok chairman Paul Fireman.) Fireman pleaded
guilty to charges that he forced employees to give a total of
$120,000 to candidates on his behalf between 1991 and 1995, and
received a harsh penalty, paying $1 million personally and $5
million through his company. He was also sentenced to six months of
arrest at his Marina Bay home in Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Fireman has been blabbing to anyone who will listen that he is a
victim of a Department of Justice scheme to score a big campaign
finance conviction against a Republican, given that embarrassing
revelations about illicit Indonesian and Chinese donations to the
Democrats were surfacing in the Clinton-Dole campaign. He may even
be right.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine provided me with a brief summary of his
manuscript, which Fireman declined to discuss, apparently because
he thinks that reporters will show up for a big pre-publication
press conference scheduled for the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Fireman's lawyer Morris Goldings says about the
forthcoming tome: 1. Yes, it repeats the malpractice charges that
Fireman recently leveled against his former defense attorney Thomas
Dwyer. 2. Yes, trial judge William Young is in the book. ``It's
critical of certain aspects of the case as handled by (Young),''
Goldings says, but the bombastic nonsense I had heard about will
not be published. 3. So, was Fireman unfairly targeted? Goldings:
``There's some speculation about how this case got out of the
Federal Election Commission so quickly.'' 4. Yes, there will be
much blather about the need for campaign finance reform.

SARANDON'S NEW ROAD MOVIE IS AN UNEVEN TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
EARTHLY POSSESSIONS 
Starring: Susan Sarandon, Stephen Dorff, Elissabeth Moss, Jay O.
Sanders 
Directed by: James Lapine 
Written by: Steven Rogers, based on the novel by Anne Tyler 
On: HBO 
Time: Saturday at 8 p.m. 
Rating: TVMA 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Thelma and Louise,'' Susan Sarandon was Louise, the more
worldly voyager on the road to empowerment and revelation. But in
``Earthy Possessions,'' Sarandon plays a variation on Thelma, the
scatterbrained member of the T-bird twosome. Putting on her best
flake bearing, she is Charlotte Emory, a small-town homemaker who
is taken hostage by a bank robber, forced to hit the road with him,
and, naturally, ultimately, freed up to be herself. She might as
well be living out the ad slogan for ``Thelma and Louise'':
Somebody said get a life . . . so she did.
</P>
<P>
   You've gotta love the road, that movie mecca that always seems
to lead to the Liberation Highway, with detours along Adventure
Avenue and Self-Esteem Street. Not long into the ``Earthly
Possessions'' trip from upstate New York to South Carolina, it
becomes obvious that our sheltered Charlotte isn't exactly a
hostage anymore. In fact, she is altogether digging the excitement
of being on the lam, as well as the gruff charms of her
gun-wielding kidnapper, a handsome hothead named Jake. And so goes
``Earthly Possessions,'' which premieres Saturday on HBO at 8 p.m.
The romantic comedy, based on the novel by Anne Tyler, is an overly
familiar tale of learning to take the wheel of life, with its roots
in every road movie from ``It Happened One Night'' to Jonathan
Demme's ``Something Wild.'' While it does contain a few mild
pleasures, most of them thanks to Sarandon, it suffers from too
much predictability and a distractingly cutesy tone.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, you wish Sarandon had stayed away from the project,
simply because of its similarities to the indelible ``Thelma and
Louise.'' But she wins you over with her earthy, rebellious, and
slightly clueless Charlotte. ``Ex-cuse me,'' she yells at Jake when
he grabs her pocketbook, not long after he has dragged her out of
the bank with his gun pressed against her. She manages to bring a
fresh spin to some of the more stock scenes, including when she and
Jake get drunk together, hit the dance floor, and then fight about
whether or not to make love. As Jake, Stephen Dorff is neither a
plus nor a minus, going through his usual boyish, explosive moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earthly Possessions'' has an uneven, lighthearted tone that
undermines the characters' emotional shifts. Mostly, the comedy is
quirky and quaint _ too much so _ but at times it veers into
satire, as Charlotte and Jake become increasingly notorious. Like a
mock newsmagazine, the movie flashes to deadpan interviews with
people who have crossed the couple's path. And then Charlotte's
vain husband and Jake's girlfriend are portrayed in much more
cartoonish terms than the others. Perhaps director James Lapine,
who hits just the right comic notes in ``Impromptu,'' is a little
too eager to jazz up the plain story. Halfway through the journey,
you may find yourself wishing he'd step on the gas a bit, and get
us to the finish line a little faster.

RAVENOUS SERVES UP HAM-HANDED CANNIBALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
RAVENOUS 
Directed by: Antonia Bird 
Screenplay by: Ted Griffin 
Starring: Guy Pearce, Robert Carlyle, Jeremy Davies, Jeffrey Jones,
John Spencer, Stephen Spinella, Neal McDonough, David Arquette 
Running time: 100 minutes 
Rated: R (considerable gore and strong violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trouble with ``Ravenous'' is not that it's a bad movie. Many
bad movies prosper. The trouble with ``Ravenous'' is that it can't
decide exactly what kind of bad movie it wants to be. This can be a
real problem with a cannibal movie, which is what ``Ravenous'' is.
Taking its cue from the Donner Pass episode, in which some
snowbound pioneers in the Sierra Nevadas ate others, it focuses on
a small Sierra Nevada fort in 1847, where a handful of soldiers
make bad jokes about serving their fellow men _ and do.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Griffin's script doesn't know if it wants to be a straight
horror movie, an exercise in black humor, or a metaphor for the
19th-century American doctrine of Manifest Destiny, a rationale for
gobbling up any land in its path. Having failed to resolve the
question of tone, the film compounds its shortfall by failing to
bring any faceting to the characters, leaving them two-dimensional
and uninvolving. The only one we care about is an American Indian
relegated to second-class-citizen status, pressed into service as a
maid. She's the one we hope will get away.
</P>
<P>
   She also supplies a visual reminder of the theory, articulated
by one of the flesh-eaters, that they may be possessed by an evil
spirit the Indians call a wendigo. According to the legend, those
who eat their enemies acquire their strength by consuming them.
Robert Carlyle, who first presents himself as a victim and later is
revealed to be one of the cannibals, is the busiest dispenser of
rationales. In an age before flu shots were invented, he points to
his own increased strength and immunity from disease and declares
human flesh a sort of health food.
</P>
<P>
   He and Jeffrey Jones, a more genial cannibal, are hugely
interested in bringing Guy Pearce's fluky military hero into the
fold. As Jones's officer says with a straight face (and I'm not
making this up), ``It's lonely being a cannibal.'' Pearce's
put-upon soldier could reply that it's not that great being a
vegetarian either, at least not in the company he's currently
keeping. But he's too busy clutching a big knife, trying not to
fall into too deep a sleep, lest he never wake up, and trying,
above all, not to examine too closely the contents of the simmering
stewpot in the rude log cabin they all share.
</P>
<P>
   Antonia Bird's direction does little to improve matters and it
isn't long before you're wondering what the actors _ including
dementos played by David Arquette and Jeremy Davies _ saw in this
confused and unfocused script. The mountain scenery in the Czech
Republic (standing in for the Sierra Nevada) is impressive, and
impressively contrasted with the dark, heavy, claustrophobic cabins
where most of the film takes place. Still, it's hard to work up
much appetite for ``Ravenous.'' Hannibal Lecter did this sort of
thing a lot better.

MIDDLEBURY HOCKEY IS MORE FAMILY THAN DYNASTY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   MIDDLEBURY, Vt. _ Arranged in chronological order, 1995-98, the
elegant walnut-and-gold NCAA Division 3 championship plaques
dominate a trophy case in the lobby of Middlebury College's
Fletcher Field House. They represent an era of excellence
unprecedented in college hockey; no other team at any level ever
has won four such prizes in a row.
</P>
<P>
   They might as well be stashed in a broom closet.
</P>
<P>
   Down below on this Wednesday afternoon, the pristine ice of
spanking new Chip Kenyon Arena is being carved up in a competition
that, for the moment at least, is of even greater consequence to
the Panthers than their latest foray into the national semifinals
two days from now.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Beaney has been talking up this event all week, the
Final Four has been winnowed to two survivors, and the atmosphere
is understandably electric.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies, checks, elbows, and shots are flying from one side of
the rink to the other; rollicking cheers chart the ebb and flow of
the game until, finally, there is a champion.
</P>
<P>
   John Giannacopoulos, Curt Goldman, Ross Sealfon, and Grayson
Fertig exult. They have just won the season-long Panther intrasquad
three-on-three tournament, the glory that goes with it, and, most
cherished of all, the unique championship trophy. It's a crude
balsa rendering of a Middlebury goalie atop a knotty pine base,
carved by a bus driver from Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was our driver for the 1996 Final Four at Wisconsin-River
Falls,'' says Beaney, ``and after we got home, he sent this along
with a note saying how much he'd enjoyed driving such a nice group
of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of what it represents _ ``an appreciation for good
people who play exciting hockey and give honest effort'' _ Beaney
considers this folk art as precious as any of the handsome hardware
shimmering in the lobby upstairs. Because of what it represents _
``camaraderie, enjoying the moment'' _ Beaney considers this
three-on-three diversion as vital to his program as any national
recognition. Even now, on the verge of that other Final Four _ the
one in Northfield, where Middlebury (19-5-1) will continue its
quest for another page in the record book when it faces Rochester
Institute of Technology (26-1-2), followed by an semifinal between
Wisconsin-Superior (21-7-3) and host Norwich (26-1-2).
</P>
<P>
   When the Panthers, the upstarts in this year's NCAA field
despite their legacy of supremacy, returned to the rink Monday
after upsetting the top Western seed, St. Norbert, by coming back
from an opening loss _ their first ever in 19 NCAA games _ to win
the next night and the deciding minigame at DePere, Wis., Beaney
emphasized three things to his players: ``Take care of your
academics because you've missed some class time and we're going on
spring break; prepare for RIT; and let's finish the three-on-three
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like nonsense, the joke apparently is on the other
65 teams in Division 3. ``What's amazing is that it wasn't the
winning that mattered most,'' says Ryan Goldman, part of the Class
of '98 that graduated with four national titles and a 95-9-6
record. ``It was the fun we had. Beaney always stressed fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It just so happens that the Panthers generally wind up the
celebration with a national championship party.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   College hockey's counterpart to the 1949-54 Yankees, 1956-60
Canadiens, and 1957-69 Celtics, Middlebury is an unlikely dynasty.
On a stately, rustic campus set amid a postcard from heaven, in the
shadow of the Green Mountains, surrounded by dairy farms and ski
lifts, it is also an unorthodox one.
</P>
<P>
   The architect is the owlish Beaney, 47, a former captain and
volunteer assistant at the University of New Hampshire under
Charlie Holt, who was renowned throughout the college ranks for his
graciousness and tactical tinkering. ``He'd win 10 games in a row
and he'd try a new alignment,'' recalls Beaney. ``When someone
would ask him why, he'd say, `We want to see if this way works
better. If it doesn't, we'll just go back to the other way. We
already know that works.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Beaney is an ardent disciple. With two national titles already
in hand, but unhappy with the Panthers' play in 1997, he devised a
new look, pairing right wings with centers and sending out
three-man defensive units, in effect turning the left wing into a
defensive hybrid. In fact, it wasn't so different. ``We'd always
played a center-right wing forecheck,'' says Beaney. ``But this
way, we could interchange more players, give the players a better
frame of reference for the system. We didn't change the system.
What we did was put a different label on it, change the mind-set.
Now we take more pride in defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers promptly reeled off a 29-game unbeaten streak over
a two-year span, annexing national title No. 3 in the process. But
it's not the specifics that make Beaney's fine-tuning instructive;
it's the philosophy behind it. ``I'm always tinkering,'' he says.
``Sure, everybody likes to win. But at the end of the day, I don't
think that's the most important part of the job. I think one reason
we've won is that we never have emphasized winning. To me, it's a
matter of developing a bond. I think success plays a part in that.
But I know you can't have success without the bonding, the hard
work. The exciting part for me is to see the changes each year, to
see the seniors take the freshmen under their wing. We try to give
the players ownership of the team, with the coaches as guides, to
make them responsible for it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The secret lies in the attitude as much as the execution, the
Panthers will tell you. ``That's what we recruit first,'' says
Beaney, who came to Middlebury in 1986 after successful coaching
stints at Bellows Free Academy and New England College, followed by
a three-year hiatus during which he was director of admissions at
Berwick Academy and an aide to Holt. ``Our players are not
necessarily the best, top to bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that they're slouches. Most, like soccer and potential
hockey All-American Giannacopoulos, who's from Needham, Mass., by
way of Belmont Hill, are products of exclusive and highly
successful private schools. Panthers assistant Lou Santini is
legendary for mining the New England preps for talent, and though
athletic scholarships are prohibited at the Division 3 level,
Middlebury, its idyllic Champlain Valley setting, and its national
reputation for academic excellence are not a hard sell. Beaney,
Santini, and Beaney's chief lieutenant for 12 of his 13 years here,
Wes McKee, mold the talent, which has included three of the last
six national Division 3 Players of the Year, a host of
All-Americans, and the near-flawless Class of '98 _ goalies
Francois Bourbeau and Chris Farion, who alternated games; forwards
Mark Spence and Emil Jattne; and defensemen Goldman and Filip
Jirousek.
</P>
<P>
   Talent notwithstanding, certain things won't be compromised.
Beaney remembers recruiting a player for the Class of '98, and
coming off a mediocre 13-10 season, he needed all the help he could
get.
</P>
<P>
   The father of one prospective recruit asked him, ``Can you win
the national championship?''
</P>
<P>
   Beaney responded, ``I don't want your son coming here if that's
why he's coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the Panthers haven't stopped winning national
championships since. The group Beaney brought in coalesced, and a
tradition was born that transcended the titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't overestimate the power of family,'' says Ryan
Goldman, whose brothers, junior Curt and sophomore Scott, rank 1-3
in scoring on this year's team. ``The sum is greater than the parts
split up. The tradition is the power of the family.''

IT'LL BE BRUINS FROM WHERE TAYLOR'S STANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When you sit down with your morning corn flakes and
coffee and peruse the NHL standings, it's hard not to hypothesize
about where the Bruins will finish.
</P>
<P>
   With the standings so tight and Boston having 15 (of 82) games
remaining, it's just as hard for the players to keep from examining
all the possible scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are in sole possession of eighth place, the final
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, with the Rangers and
Florida still hot on their trail. Montreal and Washington are still
considered contenders but their hopes are fading fast.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the Bruins are the favorites to gain a postseason
berth while others think the Rangers or Panthers have a more
favorable schedule. Bruins center Tim Taylor likes his team's
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking all the time,'' said Taylor. ``When you lose,
you're looking at the teams behind you. When you win, you're
looking at the teams ahead of you to see if you can catch them.
Obviously, we're looking at teams behind us and making sure they
stay behind us. Against Toronto, we win a big game (4-1 Wednesday)
and you know Florida is watching the scoreboard before their game
(in San Jose) and they see we won and now it puts pressure on them.
They lose, now they're 3 points back.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we keep winning, we're in a good situation. It's
really tough for teams who are behind already to see the team
they're trying to catch win a game. Mentally, it's like, `Aw, they
won again.' And they have to win just to stay where they were.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Panthers made the trade with Vancouver to get star wing
Pavel Bure, many thought that might be the kiss of death for the
Bruins, especially considering the way they were playing. Taylor
said he didn't fret about the Bure acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``How good is he going to be, rushing him back after a knee
injury?'' said Taylor. ``I've had knee surgery before. He's going
to have to wear a brace, he's going to be slower, he's taking
someone else's ice time. He's going to be pushed to be offensive,
so how much defense is he going to play? A lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bure not being 100 percent upon his return,
Taylor said there's also the factor of how his presence affects the
rest of the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think with them, they put so much emphasis on Bure
coming back that the rest of the guys psychologically think, `He's
back, he's our savior' and I don't think they play as well,'' said
Taylor. ``No one steps to the forefront to help him out. They
expect him to do it himself. Then when he's out, everyone seems to
rally around and play their solid defensive game and that's how
they're winning hockey games. Look at the Colorado game, Bure
scores three goals and they still lose, 7-5. Would you rather win,
2-1 or 2-0 or lose, 7-5?''
</P>
<P>
   Looking around the rest of the conference, Taylor said there are
some clubs who have not fared as well as he expected (the Rangers
and Montreal to name two), some who have done better, and some
about where he expected. He said it has made for an interesting
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little surprised with the way some teams are playing
right now,'' he said. ``As the season started and as it was
progressing, I don't think anyone could've figured out what was
going to happen at the end because we thought it might take 90
points just to make the playoffs. It still might look that way but
no team is really running away with it. Buffalo is about where I
thought they'd be. Pittsburgh is better than where I thought they'd
be. Toronto is a lot better than I thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone predicted Florida, they have the easiest schedule.
But then I looked at their next three road games and the way
Anaheim, LA, and San Jose have played of late . . . Detroit went
out there and went 0-3 against those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida started 0-1 Wednesday night, losing a 4-2 decision to
the Sharks, and will face Los Angeles Saturday and Anaheim Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the Bruins are trying not to be preoccupied with
other clubs. Instead, they'll concentrate on playing the same style
they did against the Maple Leafs and if they do, their fortunes
will take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we did extremely well in keeping the game really
dull,'' said Taylor. ``It was a slow game and that's when we play
the best on the road. That's what we do, we take the crowd out of
it and their crowd wasn't in it. We had some chances early and we
didn't capitalize but we didn't really give them too much. The only
opportunity they had was (Derek) King shorthanded in the second
period but other than that, we held them pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do best is we wait and when other teams make a
mistake, we seem to capitalize on them. When we were going through
our slump earlier, teams were still making mistakes against us but
we weren't putting the puck in the net. It seemed like we would
make one mistake and the other team would score and it would cost
us a game. Now, that seems to be going back in our favor.''

FOR AL JOYNER, NO SPEEDY RECOVERY FROM LOSS OF WIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are certain days when it is cloudy and misty that Al
Joyner shudders and recoils at the thought of ``the most painful
day of my life.'' It is the type of gloomy day that reminds him of
a gloomier day still, Sept. 21, 1998. That was the day Joyner
discovered his wife, Olympic gold medal sprinter Florence Griffith
Joyner, dead in the master bedroom of their home in Mission Viejo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember how there was no sun and it was misty,''
Joyner said as he sat Thursday in a quiet lounge at the Royal
Sonesta Hotel in Boston during a break from a book signing tour of
his late wife's recently published ``Running for Dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible day,'' he added, his voice trailing off into
a whisper. ``A terrible day.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite rampant rumors that Griffith Joyner's death was somehow
related to abuse of performance-enhancing steroids _ rumors that
she, her husband, and her brother-in-law/coach, Bob Kersee,
vehemently denied after she handily won the 100- and 200-meter
events in the 1988 Seoul Olympics _ an autopsy concluded that the
38-year-old former sprinter had asphyxiated during an epileptic
seizure in her sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Olympics, I told her that she was probably capable
of doing a 10.5 (in the 100 meters),'' recalled Joyner, a 1984
Olympic gold medal winner in the triple jump. ``She laughed and
said, `If I do, they'll probably want to dissect me.' And in the
end, they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy also revealed that Griffith Joyner had a congenital
blood vessel abnormality called a ``cavernous angioma'' on the
front-left part of her brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to go around and tell people about my wife, and
then to correct any misinformation that was out there about her for
the last and final time,'' Joyner said, explaining why he agreed to
do the book tour. ``I don't want my daughter growing up, having to
answer those same questions. I just want my wife to be able to rest
in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As hurtful as those accusations were, Joyner said he was so
grief-stricken following his wife's death that, in the darkest
moments, he comtemplated suicide. But, he says, two things stopped
him. First, there was his belief in God, and then there was the
couple's only child, Mary Ruth, 8, who took time off from school to
accompany her father to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for those two things, I don't think I'd be here
today,'' he said. ``I thought I would never say that. I always
wondered how people would feel that way; that they would want to
end their life. But in that situation, it was one of the most
helpless moments of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He felt about as helpless as in the moment he discoverd his
wife's body and tried to awaken her, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about that now more than anything else,'' Joyner said,
his eyes glancing down at the glass coffee table. ``I wish I hadn't
fallen asleep downstairs. I will always feel that, maybe, I
could've helped save Florence if I had been there. I came in that
night and said, `Honey, I'm home. I love you.' And she said, `OK, I
love you, too,' and went upstairs to bed. Those were her last words
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of it, however, has brought Joyner little solace.
``I don't think I'll ever be at peace with it,'' he said. ``It's so
hard, because I miss her so much. This (pain) is something that is
never going to go away. That's the way it is, but you try to go on.
Sometimes the things you miss the most are the small things. Those
are the things you really take for granted. They're things that
only a married couple in a relationship would know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like coming up to you from behind, unexpected, and
having her put her arms around you and saying things like, `Thank
you for putting up with me for all these years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Again, his voice trailed off. ``It's those little things.''
</P>
<P>
   And though the pain still lingers, Joyner says his daughter, who
carries herself with her mother's aura of confidence, has been a
source of inspiration and consolation. She has served as his ray of
hope on those gloomy days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, she's an inspiration,'' he said. ``She has a lot
of her mother in her. She has her strength. A week after Florence
had passed on, she had to go back to school. We were standing on
the stairway in the house and I started thinking about things and
started crying. Mary was crying and I was like, `Mary, what's
wrong?'
</P>
<P>
   ``She came down, sobbing, `Daddy, I'm going to be a week behind
in school.' I was thinking, `That ain't why I'm crying,' but I
figured things were going to be all right,'' he said, breaking into
a chuckle. ``So, two hours into school, I began thinking about Mary
and thinking how it was going to be just as hard for her, because
it was a brand new school and she didn't have any friends and then
two weeks before school started she lost her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know how people are going to respond, but the school
was great. So, two hours into her first day at school, her teacher
called me and said, `Mr. Joyner, Mary's in (phys. ed) right now,
but she requested that we call you and tell you that she's doing
all right and hopes that you are, too.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I just cried and cried like a baby that day, because it said
so much and it meant so much to the point that I'm up there
thinking about her and she took the initiative to have her teacher
call me. The next day, I cooked her oatmeal like I normally do for
breakfast, and she dropped it. She said, `Dad, I'm sooo sorry.' We
were running late, but it was like she didn't want to do anything
that would bring me any more hurt. It's amazing, but when I look at
her, that adds to my strength and helps to keep me going.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on those gloomiest of days.

THE KEY TO REPLAY: EQUAL COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a suggestion to the National Football League on how to
ensure a level playing field for instant replay officiating.
</P>
<P>
   Pay the network carriers to have the same amount of cameras and
playback machines at each game.
</P>
<P>
   As it is now, ESPN, CBS, ABC, and Fox use different amounts of
equipment in their coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a network uses four cameras or 20, every major play _ or
at least those deemed reviewable by the recent NFL owners agreement
_ would be captured on video. Whether its the best angle of the
play is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, for instance, covers as many as eight games on Sundays and
uses 10 cameras and eight playback machines for its national game
and a minimum of four cameras and three playback machines for its
regional contests.
</P>
<P>
   CBS uses 15 cameras and ten replay machines at it two top games,
and a minimum of seven cameras and five replay machines at its
regional games. More cameras translate to more isolation shots of
individual matchups. Individual cameras could be assigned to each
of the skilled positions with another one trained solely on the
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer cameras means less isolated shots of those individual
matchups. All the big plays will be shown, but instead of seeing Ty
Law jam Keyshawn Johnson at the line of scrimmage, viewers would
see the matchup later in the play when the ball neared.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can catch all the action with four cameras, but you feel
more comfortable with more,'' said one television analyst. ``That
way, you know every angle is covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanket coverage is not an issue on ESPN or ABC. ESPN uses 20
cameras and 10 replay machines for each of its Thursday or Sunday
night games. ABC uses 12-15 cameras and six or eight replay
machines for every Monday Night football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every play covered from multi-angles,'' said ABC
spokesman Mark Mandel. ``Whatever happens on the field, it will be
documented.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine for those speciality games, but the majority of
games don't draw that amount of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   If it is any consolation, at least both teams would suffer
equally in games covered by only four cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Sure.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the Buffalo Bills after their game in Foxorough or
the Seattle Seahawks, who lost to the New York Jets when Vinny
Testaverde was given credit for a touchdown he didn't really score.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the way it is,'' said CBS analyst Phil Simms.
``The good thing is that it can correct some very unjust calls. The
bad thing is that it could become the focus of every single
telecasts, whether a call is reversed or not. Yea, there were some
tough calls last year. But one thing you'll find out is there
weren't a lot of them. I say, get on with the game and not belabor
blown calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms said that instat replay still won't settle everything. He
pointed out that the pass interference call at the end of last
year's patriots-Bills game in which Terry Glenn was pushed would
still be ultimately decided on the field. The ruling awarding
Vincent Brisby a catch when he was out-of-bounds could have been
reversed, as would Vinnie Testaverde's last minute touchdown
against the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   John Madden doesn't like the system for a completely different
reason. ``No coach wants replay to be tied to timeouts,'' madden
said. ``The head coach has the worst seat in the house, so he's
probably not going to see the play clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden said the system forces coaches to deploy an assistant to
monitor the game in the press box. The assistant coach weould then
signal their challenge to the referees.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent trend of conferencing among officials during
games, Madden suggsted adding a monitor to those meetings and allow
the refree to decide whether further review is warranted. ``They're
taking all that time anyway,'' madden said. ``Then the coaches
would have nothing to do with it. If an official missed something
it would get corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Creator' speaks

   TNT basketball analyst Kenny Smith grabbed a great interview
with Allen Iverson aired after Tuesday night's Lakers-Timberwolves
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be known as a point guard or two guard,''
Iverson told Smith. ``I'd rather people label me a creator.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson talked about his once-stormy relationship with coach
Larry Brown. ``It was rocky at first,'' he said. ``But I've
matured. I'm listening to him now. I realize that he was never
trying to hurt me. He was just trying to make me a better player.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown agreed, saying, ``We have a mutual respect now.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson also talked about his off-the-court problems. ``I know
that I will make mistakes,'' he said. ``I also know know that I
learn something every day. I know that I'm not a bad guy just
because of the people that I hang around with or the way I wear my
hair. The credit comes when you start winning. Dennis Rodman became
a genius all of a sudden after the Bulls started winning
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson said he would love to play with Rodman. ``He plays every
game as if its his last,'' Iverson said. ``I want all my teammates
to know that is how I play the game. I just try to send that
message to them that I may be the highest-paid player on the team
but look at all the burn marks and cherries that I have from diving
on the floor.''

Holyfield-Lewis No. 8
</P>
<P>
   TVKO, the pay-per-view arm of HBO, generated 1.2 million buys
for the Holyfield-Lewis fight or roughly $60 million. That makes
the fight the eighth highest television gate in history . . . ESPN
has gotten its wish to televise the America's Cup without worrying
about airing a competing network's logos. Fox Sports Net had signed
an agreement allowing the upstart cable network to plaster its logo
on Young America's yachts. It's great marketing, akin to placing
posters of Keith Olbermann behind goalie nets to ensure that Fox
Sports Net gets shown on competiting networks whenever a goal was
scored. ESPN threatened to not carry the race unless Fox Sports Net
wasn't allowed to basically receive free advertising space. It's
understandable, but ESPN's opposition allowed Fox Sports Net to
transform its guerilla marketing strategy to a higher ground.
``When we gave money to help build a winning US entrant, we did it
to bring the Cup back to America, and it was a good marketing
opportunity,'' Fox spokesman Vince Wladika told Associated Press.
``When it became apparent that the televising network was willing
to sacrifice the event along with America's chances of reclaiming
the Cup, we felt it was our duty to put our own interest behind
that of America's reclamation of that Cup.'' Bully for Fox Sports .
. . Former Nets and UMass coach John Calipari debuts on ESPN's
``NBA Matchup'' March 21. The show, hosted by Andre Aldridge and
analyst Fred Carter, airs on ESPN2 at 12:30 a.m. and on ESPN at
8:30 a.m. on Sunday mornings. Calipari replaces analyst Jim Lyman,
the former Philadelphia, Washington, and Clippers' head coach who
was named a Nets assistant Wednesday.

DUKE IS KING, BUT THE COURT IS WIDE OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the college basketball season winding down to its final two
weekends, the pecking order this season remains clear. There is
Duke and there is everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   There is also more parity than ever. If there is any doubt about
that, look at the makeup of the Sweet 16, which includes five
double-digit seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Included are representatives from three mid-major conferences:
Gonzaga (West Coast), Miami of Ohio (Mid-American), and Southwest
Missouri State (Missouri Valley).
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga coach Dan Monson has a theory on why parity _ if you can
call it that _ has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they reduced the scholarships from 15 to 13, big schools
couldn't take everybody,'' said Monson. ``If there were still 15
scholarships, (Gonzaga guard) Matt (Santangelo) would be at
Stanford today.''
</P>
<P>
   The other factor is the NBA. The bigger programs, especially,
are having trouble keeping their best players for more than a year
or two, which eventually proves costly, unless you are a school
such as Duke or Kentucky that can restock every year.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Duke, if the Devils make the Final Four, they will
have beaten a No. 16 seed (Florida A&AMP;M), a 9 seed (Tulsa), a 12
seed (Southwest Missouri State), and either a 6 seed (Temple) or a
10 seed (Purdue) to make it to St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly heavy lifting and would be the easiest route to
the Final Four since 1991, when North Carolina reached the Final
Four by beating No. 16 Northeastern, No. 9 Villanova, No. 12
Eastern Michigan, and No. 10 Temple.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Calipari, Part II? No
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's deal with some rumors (and right now they are just
that) which spawn like tornadoes this time of year. No, deposed
Nets coach John Calipari will not be coaching next season in
Amherst or anywhere in New England in the near future. When
Calipari was at the University of Massachusetts, he had a clause in
his contract that stated he could leave the Minutemen if any one of
a group of selected schools called. UCLA, Kansas, and North
Carolina were on that list.
</P>
<P>
   Will any of those jobs open soon? Perhaps. The speculation about
Bill Guthridge's future remains a prime topic in North Carolina.
The latest is that if Guthridge decides he has had enough, Kansas
coach Roy Williams would replace him. As for UCLA, Steve Lavin has
irked some old-time Bruin loyalists with his Generation X style of
coaching. That, plus the Bruins' early exit (a first-round loser to
Detroit) could make things interesting for Lavin in the next
several months. Would the Bruins switch Lavin for Calipari?
Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari wants to get back into college coaching, but he can
afford to wait for a high-profile job such as Kansas, Michigan, or
UCLA. Calipari has also checked with the NCAA to see if there are
any ramifications of the Marcus Camby affair that could hurt him in
the future with NCAA schools. No matter what happens, Calipari will
not have to worry about his next paycheck for awhile, since he
reportedly received a payoff of nearly $3 million from the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Irish have options
</P>
<P>
   Here's the latest on the Notre Dame situation. It could get
resolved quickly if the Irish call Utah coach Rick Majerus, who
might bite if he can be convinced the Irish are serious about
upgrading their program as quickly as possible. Majerus is not big
on images, which means putting on three-piece suits and schmoozing
with alumni and high rollers. He is into finding kids who have a
passion to play the game and who will win. But some people at Notre
Dame don't think Majerus would be a good fit, and he also makes
nearly a $1 million a year, which Notre Dame will not match. San
Diego State, which is building a new facility and wants to upgrade
its program, also reportedly is focusing on Majerus. Notre Dame
officials have put together a list of five or six coaches:
Delaware's Mike Brey, Washington's Bob Bender, Siena's Paul Hewitt,
Seton Hall's Tommy Amaker, Princeton's Bill Carmody, and Xavier's
Skip Prosser. The list will then be prioritized and the Irish will
try to have their coach by the end of the NCAA Tournament, at the
latest . . . Brey and Wake Forest coach Dave Odom are reportedly
being considered for the Georgia job, although Oklahoma's Kelvin
Sampson and Tulsa's Bill Self are also supposedly in the mix, while
St. Louis has asked permission to talk to New Mexico's Dave Bliss,
who has also interviewed at Vanderbilt and Baylor . . . Marquette
is asking about former St. John's coach Fran Fraschilla, who also
has his name up for consideration at East Carolina and San Diego
State . . . Trouble is brewing at Minnesota, where Clem Haskins
will have a difficult time recovering from the academic scandal
that was revealed last week.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boyages `hot' assistant
</P>
<P>
   One of the hotter assistants is Ohio State associate head coach
Rick Boyages, a longtime protoge of Jim O'Brien. Boyages is ready
to be a head coach. Yale and Brown are already interested, and if
Steve Alford makes the expected move from Southwest Missouri State
(supposedly Iowa), Boyages's name is already on that ready list.
``Ricky is definitely ready,'' said O'Brien. ``I just want him to
get into a position where he has a chance to compete and win.''
Boyages also could wind up in the Ivy League at Yale or Brown, each
of which are searching for new coaches. If Holy Cross upgrades its
pay and increases its scholarship level in the mostly
nonscholarship Patriot League, it could be a decent job. But
athletic director Dick Reagan also wants someone with head coaching
experience and is trying to finalize a deal that would bring former
Pittsburgh coach Ralph Williard to the Cross . . . Former Virginia
coach Jeff Jones wants to get back into the mix and could wind up
at a place like East Carolina.

FRYE SET TO GIVE IT A TRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Watch out for Superman. He's coming soon to
your neighorhood ballpark disguised as Red Sox second baseman Jeff
Frye.
</P>
<P>
   Frye will start at second base Saturday against the Pittsburgh
Pirates. He knows there are a lot of people pulling for him to
succeed after missing the entire 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Superman,'' he said when asked how he would approach his
first big league game in 18 months. ``Just before the game I'm
going to slip into a phone booth and . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to play (in tonight's game) against the Reds. I know
everybody wants me to be out there. But I don't make the final
decisions, and if it takes one more day for me not to get injured,
that is what I've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With little more than two weeks left in spring training, it has
suddenly become very important that the Red Sox evaluate Frye. At
the start of spring training he was sidelined by a bruised rib
cage. It was thought he was finally ready to play last week, but a
nagging groin problem kept him on the practice field. Thursday he
was taking ground balls and running the bases, always a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   Moves have to be made if he cannot perform. The trade winds
normally heat up in the last two weeks. The Sox still don't have a
position for newcomer Jose Offerman, who has started 11 of the 16
games at second base this spring. Donnie Sadler (2), Jim Chamblee
(2), and Lou Merloni (1) have started the other games. Sadler and
Merloni could make the club as utility players. But because of his
experience Frye has an edge at second. And his ability to play
several positions has always been a strong point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff didn't lose his job,'' reminds Sox manager Jimy Williams.
``He just got hurt. If he's going to be with us he's going to go
out there and play. What he does out there will tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has no problem platooning players. Scott Hatteberg and
Jason Varitek share the catching. Damon Buford, Trot Nixon, Troy
O'Leary, and Darren Lewis constitute the outfield rotation. Reggie
Jefferson and Mike Stanley were supposed to swing with Offerman in
a designated hitter/first base rotation. But this all assumes Frye
can cut the proverbial mustard.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we've got to put him out there and see what happens,''
said Williams. ``Actually, he could play against the Reds in
Sarasota. But I'm being a little cautious. It seems to me that if a
player is coming off an injury, it's not the best thing we can do
to put him in a road game. That's an hour-and-a-half bus ride, the
game and some ice, then an hour-and-a-half bus ride back home.
Better to let him stay here and get in his work. Then he can face
the next day in a better frame of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams says his preference with middle infielders is not to
platoon. But that's not always possible. Nomar Garciaparra started
143 games. But his partners included Mike Benjamin (73), Sadler
(38), Merloni (32), and Mark Lemke (29). Benjamin has since moved
on to Pittsburgh. Frye would undoubtedly get the lion's share of
starts at second. But he has to prove himself in the last couple of
weeks, which is a challenge worthy of Superman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can play,'' said Williams, ``then 10-12 days should be
enough. But he has to get out there.''

EASLER EASING HIS WAY BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Mike Easler says there are no hard feelings.
Even though he was fired by the Red Sox in 1995, and sued for
wrongful dismissal (the suit was settled out of court), Easler says
he'd still like to manage the Boston ball club someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's ever a winner in Boston, I would love to be a part
of it,'' Easler says. ``I'd love to manage the Red Sox. It would be
different for the city, I'll tell you that. Maybe that would break
the curse.''
</P>
<P>
   Easler has landed. Three years after that zany spring when he
refused to coach replacement players and was shown the door by
general manager Dan Duquette, Easler is hitting coach of the St.
Louis Cardinals. He's teaching Mark McGwire how to hit home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark teaches me,'' says the original `Hit Man.' ``I watch him.
When I got the job, I got tapes of all the hitters. I studied Mark.
I've never seen a man, day after day, so fundamentally sound. He
never makes a mistake. He has a total understand of hitting. He
took all the stuff he learned in Oakland and he looks totally
different now. He used to have big holes in his swing. Basically,
the only thing I try to do with Mark is make him stay back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cards decided not to bring Dave Parker back after last
season and manager Tony La Russa called Easler, who'd managed
independant Nashua of the Atlantic League in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Easler played 14 seasons of big league ball before becoming a
hitting coach in 1991. He worked with the Blue Jays and Brewers
before taking over as Red Sox hitting coach in 1993. Mo Vaughn
became his prize pupil and Vaughn had trouble letting go when
Easler was dismissed in '95.
</P>
<P>
   What happened between the Sox and Easler has never been entirely
clear. He refused to coach the replacement players in the spring of
'95, claiming the ball club should pay him the then-major league
minimum $115,000. Easler was making $80,000 at the time. Duquette
suspended him and eventually hired Jim Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Easler went to the National Labor Relations Board, which ruled
he had a legitimate case. According to Easler, the Red Sox placed
liens on the beauty salon run by his wife, and a rental property he
owned. After the suit was settled (he received no money, but the
liens were removed and the Sox agreed not to seek back wages), he
coached at National Christian University in San Antonio, then
managed Nashua.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, all the things that happened between Boston and here
were all for a reason, to get my mind and heart back into the
game,'' he says today. ``I had experienced the death of my mother
and the death of my father. It was a combination of so many things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of the replacement situation. I used that as a
reason not to come back. But I was just burned out. Nothing against
Dan, but with that replacement thing, there was an agreement that
me and Dan had that I don't think he lived up to. It was private.
He knows. It was other things. I was just burned out. And then with
the replacement situation and the way they were paying the coaches,
it just didn't add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I talked to Dan last spring and spent a lot of time in his
office. When you go through these things, you might say things and
act a certain way. I knew it was going to hurt my career. But it
took me to go two or three steps backward to get to where I am
now.''
</P>
<P>
   He never stopped coaching Vaughn after he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the '95 season Mo called me in the winter time after he
struggled so badly against Cleveland,'' Easler said. ``After that I
flew in there about every two weeks and we worked at the cage in
his house. Jimmy knew it. Everybody knew it. Jimmy's a great coach
and I respect him. We just have two different philosophies. But
Mo's similar to me. He hits inside-out, and hits the ball to all
fields. Hit for average and power. But now I haven't talked to him
since August. He's on his own now. He's a big boy now.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mike Easler is back in the Show.

`TRUTH' DOCUMENTARY DETAILS TROUBLED CAREERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   For a man whose agenda was breaking the law, comedian Lenny
Bruce spent a lot of time studying it. He hadn't become obsessed
with it in order to further subvert it. Rather, he wanted to
understand why and how it was raping him, forcibly entering his art
and shutting it down.
</P>
<P>
   That's the depressing revelation of director Robert Weide's
sneakily affecting documentary ``Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the
Truth.''

   The film exists as an incensing time capsule of an era when the
cops would haunt a nightclub's exit doors to lock a guy up for
having a big, critical mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the documentary branch of the Academy managed to screen
the film and nominate it for an Oscar this year. Perhaps members
were absorbed in Weide's tacit assertion that in an age of Jerry
Springer, Marilyn Manson and the Internet, Lenny Bruce couldn't get
arrested for his brand of cerebral raunch and lightning social
commentary. Or maybe it's that Weide allows the facts and Bruce's
material to speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce was a martyr for his art, driven almost insane by attempts
to censor his act. ``Swear to Tell the Truth'' begins as a sort of
``This Is Your Life'' with the comic's eccentric mother, his wife
and daughter offering biography and doing some psychological
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Early, Weide shows Bruce doing uncanny impersonations and
innocuous-enough sketch routines. Later, he unearths an unaired
performance on ``The Steve Allen Show,'' in which Bruce seems
addled and distracted with the humorous melancholy and rootless
lifestyle that would eventually force his wife to leave him. The
film grows darker and slightly harrowing, once it's clear that
Weide wants to lay Bruce bare.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Bruce is not merely a troubled family man but a
self-avenger whose stability and judgment (never one of Bruce's
more active traits) went spiraling.
</P>
<P>
   Paranoia unseats Bruce's smooth demeanor, and he's shown in a
collection of still photos, archival footage and home movies as
devolving from a swank lounge cat into a harried, hard-bitten
creature who often looks cornered and weary.
</P>
<P>
   Once speaking his mind became a challenge, Weide suggests that
Bruce decided to contort his image, chilling with Hugh Hefner at
the Playboy mansion. Hefner, his magazine and lifestyle, were the
perfect societal affront to which he could attach himself. But for
the men dogging Bruce, Hef was never the offensive critic Bruce
was. Playboy was a surveillance man's best friend. They couldn't
get into Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either dug Lenny or you wanted to wash his mouth out with
soap,'' says a friend. What prurient detractors did to Bruce was
worse: They washed him out.

YOUNG MAYOR BRINGS MATURE QUALITY TO OFFICE

<P>
   VALATIE, N.Y. _ Mayor-elect Jason Nastke is not your ordinary
teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after graduating from high school, Nastke was elected
the top official in this village of 1,500 Tuesday when he defeated
the 65-year-old incumbent, Charles White Sr., by 182 votes. He
takes office April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Valley Community College sophomore will work with a
four-member board of trustees that includes his father, Joseph
Nastke, a political novice compared to his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my boss in politics,'' Joseph Nastke said with a laugh.
``I am the boss at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Nastke, 19, is mature for his age and insists he won't
allow his photograph to be taken if he is not in a suit. He wanted
to run for the village board two years ago, but state law said he
was too young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a complete interest in my community,'' he said.
``It was just a real love for government, history.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk around the quaint village about 20 miles west of
Pittsfield, Mass., and people praise Jason not for his youth but
for his love of his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to do great for the village,'' said Fern
Bashford, owner of Fern's Deli on Main Street. ``He is a very smart
young man. He does his homework before he does things.''
</P>
<P>
   She pauses, seemingly aware the word homework could be
misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does his research before he opens his mouth,'' she
clarifies.
</P>
<P>
   Michele and Steven Abrams, owners of Abrams Jewelers, are
similarly enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed the change,'' Michele said. ``He is very young, but
he's really on the ball as far as what's going on in the village.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man's disgust over the handling a new water system for
the town and a heated fight at a February board meeting prompted
Jason Nastke to run for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I said that was wrong. It was a disgrace,''
Nastke said. ``It was wrong that the mayor couldn't keep control of
the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Nastke said his son pulled him into politics: It was not
the usual topic of discussion around the family's dinner table as
Jason grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason developed that interest on his own,'' his father
recalled. ``I have never been involved in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   His age became an issue in the campaign, with White opining the
village did not need a ``childlike'' mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big issue, a real big issue, but you know I went to
people and said, `I really want to do the job. I told you I could
do the job of trustee and I did. I want to do the job of mayor,'''
Nastke said.
</P>
<P>
   The part-time job, which pays $2,700 a year and carries a
two-year term, will not interrupt his education. Nastke is
completing his studies for an associate's degree in business and
finance, and he plans to transfer to a four-year college. He has
not selected one, but promises it will be close enough to home for
him to commute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever college I go to would have to be within traveling
distance so I can continue to be mayor,'' he said.

SAN ANTONIO CONSIDERS NAMING AIRPORT FOR CESAR CHAVEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The City Council is considering renaming the San
Antonio International Airport for California labor organizer and
farm activist Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Councilmen Rick Vasquez and Mario Salas are sponsoring the
latest attempt to name a prominent San Antonio landmark after the
former United Farm Workers president, who died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Jeff Webster is the only council member who opposes
the proposal, although others expressed some reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Seven council members, one more than necessary to change the
airport name, have endorsed a plan to ``begin the review process''
leading up to an April 22 council vote on whether to name the
airport for Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Renaming the airport would be an appropriate and expedient way
to pay tribute to Chavez, Salas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``An airport has international significance,'' Salas said. ``It
sends an important worldwide message.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Ed Garza said changing the name would be a procedural
snap compared with the lengthy process needed in renaming streets,
which some businesses oppose because of the expense of changing
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   If the council agrees, the airport officially would be called
Cesar Chavez San Antonio International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Jose Menendez said some voters believe Chavez is long
overdue for a permanent and public honor, while others have said
they would oppose any recognition of Chavez, whose role as an
advocate for farm workers drew opposition from agribusiness groups
and conservative politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Howard Peak was cool to the idea of renaming the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a process,'' Peak said, citing the practice of
referring all items requested by council members to a scheduling
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Several council members said Peak privately expressed fears of a
public backlash over the issue. The mayor has said he would like to
see a major street named after Chavez.

EASTWOOD MISSES HIS TARGET IN `TRUE CRIME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clint Eastwood looks tired. Not old _ this isn't some rant
against 60-plus actors wooing nubile co-stars. Age has nothing to
do with it.
</P>
<P>
   No, Eastwood looks tired in a pooped-to-his-bones,
existentialist kind of way, as though this game he's been playing
is no longer any fun.
</P>
<P>
   It was, once. But in ``True Crime,'' Eastwood's success as an
actor-director-producer is hampered by the maddening suspicion that
he'd rather be doing something else. He seems distracted, bored out
of his wits, bushed. As Everett, a crusading (what else?)
journalist who makes an 11th-hour effort to clear a death-row
prisoner, Eastwood is so low on gas his direction so lackadaisical
that it's a wonder the movie doesn't konk out in the first
half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   That it doesn't is proof of two things: That the ticking-clock
anxiety of a man doomed to die at midnight is a powerful source of
suspense. And that Isaiah Washington, playing the condemned Frank
Beachum, is one of the most quietly dynamic actors working in films
today.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen Washington before in ``Out of Sight,'' ``Bulworth,''
``love jones'' but you've never seen him hoist an ailing film to
his shoulders and carry it to the finish. He has ferocious talent,
a combination of gravity, stillness and short-fuse dynamism that's
rare in a performer so young. If nothing else, Eastwood deserves
credit for giving him elbow room.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he gives everything elbow room. Odd as it is for
a man of mythically few words, Eastwood seems incapable of making a
tight movie. His last two (``Absolute Power'' and ``Midnight in the
Garden of Good and Evil'') were baggy duds, and even his best
recent films (``Unforgiven,'' ``The Bridges of Madison County'')
mosey along at their own sweet pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``True Crime'' is neither his best nor his worst film, and at
128 minutes it's far from his longest. But it's flatly directed,
awkwardly edited and until a crackerjack crescendo in the final
reel herky-jerky paced. And the end will leave you scratching your
dome in bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, any movie that credits three screenwriters (among them
Stephen Schiff, who adapted ``Lolita'' and ``The Deep End of the
Ocean'') has a right to be confusing. It also has a right to
mix-and-match an assortment of haggard stereotypes, from the cute
but abusive panhandler (``Promise me you will not spend this on
food,'' says Everett in one of the film's funnier bits, handing the
guy some money) to the trash-mouthed, sex-obsessed newspaper
editor. James Woods brings a certain high-wattage loathsomeness to
the editor, and Denis Leary, as a hangdog assignment editor who
mopes a bit when his wife (Frances Fisher) sleeps with Everett,
musters a particle of sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood himself musters none, in part because he's not supposed
to: His Everett is a terrible father, a lousy husband, an
obstreperous employee and an altogether unlikable individual. But
rest assured, he's a great reporter this, despite the fact that he
never files a story and the only notes he takes are cryptic
paraphrases on the order of ``Blv. J.C.'' (He scribbles this,
somewhat grudgingly, after Beachum delivers an eloquent soliloquy
on fear, isolation and his faith in Jesus Christ).
</P>
<P>
   All the same, the worst crime committed by the screenplay isn't
its lack of journalistic verisimilitude. It's the absolute failure
to explain why Everett cares about Beachum and what makes him chase
wild geese in an effort to save him. All we're told is that he has
a blazing epiphany involving potato chips (long story), and that he
trusts his ``nose''; his schnozz gets big play, both literally and
figuratively. The rest is as fuzzy as it is forced.
</P>
<P>
   Except Washington. If you see ``True Crime,'' see it for his
performance for his crisp delivery, for his touching goodbye scenes
with his wife and daughter, for his exquisite dignity in the face
of death. In a film short on dramatic tension, he's reason enough
to watch.

SOME DISHES TASTE BETTER WITH AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Some dishes simply taste better a day or two
after they're made.
</P>
<P>
   Meatloaf, for instance. Or vegetable soup, or chili, or
cheesecake, or spaghetti sauce, or lasagna. Just about anything in
the Italian food family, for that matter. These foods improve with
age because the more time allowed for the flavors to marry, the
better the food tastes. Since flavors seem to meld no matter what
the temperature of the food, these dishes, and others like them,
are particularly suited for weekend cooking and weeknight eating.
</P>
<P>
   Take that meatloaf. Make one on Sunday and serve it up with a
big bowl of mashed potatoes. After dinner, cut the meatloaf into
slices and wrap each slice separately in plastic wrap. Then, place
the slices in a plastic container or wrap them in freezer paper.
Now you have individual portions of meatloaf for whenever you
choose.
</P>
<P>
   And those leftover potatoes, cover and store them in the fridge.
A day or two later, you can take them out, form them into patties
and fry in very hot oil for potato cakes.
</P>
<P>
   And cheesecake: Mix it and bake it but don't put any topping on
it. If you leave the cake plain, topping slices as you serve them,
you can freeze the leftovers for serving another time. Wrap the
cake pieces tightly in plastic wrap and place in a plastic
container. Thaw in the refrigerator before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Soups, sauces and chili can all be made on Saturday or Sunday
and served during the week. There are a few things to remember,
though:
</P>
<P>
   _ Place hot foods in shallow containers for faster cooling and
freeze within two hours of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leave at least a 1/2-inch of space at the top of the freezer
container when packing; liquids in these recipes will expand as
they freeze.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thaw frozen foods in the refrigerator, in cold water or in the
microwave. Even though they have been cooked, foods may be
hazardous if left at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reheat foods to an internal temperature of 165 degrees or
until hot and steaming.
</P>
<P>
   _ When microwaving, be sure to cover and rotate the food so it
heats evenly. Allow food to stand for two minutes after heating.

`STAR WARS' IMITATORS FACE THE LEGAL FORCE OF LUCASFILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two months before the release of its
much-anticipated new ``Star Wars'' movie, Lucasfilm Ltd. is sending
a message to companies and individuals who might be thinking of
pirating images from the flick: Don't.
</P>
<P>
   The San Rafael, Calif.-based film production company said
Thursday it received about $1 million in a settlement with unnamed
companies that have made, sold and advertised counterfeit products
bearing the images of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vadar, among other
``Star Wars'' characters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the companies have been ordered to stop making and
selling the products.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm President Gordan Radley said his company was
``dedicated to its `Star Wars' fans and will go to great lengths to
ensure that the merchandise they purchase is safe and not of the
inferior quality found in unauthorized products. As the new film
(`Episode I: The Phantom Menace') approaches, we are aggressively
dealing with these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm said it could not release the identities of the
alleged pirates due to a confidentiality agreement. Nor would it
explain what products had been counterfeited.
</P>
<P>
   However, a lawsuit filed by Lucasfilm in December 1997 in San
Francisco federal court alleged that three East Coast postage stamp
manufacturers made stamps flanked with ``Star Wars'' images for use
in various West Indies and African countries without having a
license to produce or sell them.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses named in the lawsuit that sold the stamps were
Volpone Stamp Co. of Hicksville, N.Y.; International Collectors
Society in Owings Mills, Md.; and New York City-based
Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the stamps, Lucasfilm's suit alleged that the
companies had not been authorized to use ``Star Wars'' images for a
pamphlet they produced titled ``99 Little Known Facts About Star
Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpone would not comment on the settlement with Lucasfilm.
Executives from International Collectors Society could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Malamud, president of Inter-Governmental Philatelic,
defended his company's business practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any stamps we ever produced were fully licensed and approved
by Lucasfilm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm is credited with founding modern movie merchandising
back in 1977, when the first ``Star Wars'' film was released.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the company has racked up an estimated $4.5 billion
in sales from toys, calendars, T-shirts and myriad other
paraphernalia bearing images from the three ``Star Wars'' films.

WINDOWS 98 IS WATCHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I heard somebody say that Microsoft uses
Windows 98 to ``brand'' everything you do with a serial number so
they can tell who created a file in case they need to trace
something. Is that ethical?
</P>
<P>
   _ Big Brother's Keeper
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BIG: Interesting. ``Microsoft'' and ``ethics'' in the same
paragraph. I don't think I've ever seen that before.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know it all sounds like one of those Internet hoaxes, but
it's true. Windows puts an identifying number on your computer that
is embedded in Office 97 documents. And Microsoft actually admitted
it. Of course, Microsoft called it a minor security flaw and
started churning out lots of reasons why it's really not a bad guy.
According to the Microsoft Ministry of Truth, the number ``was
designed to help third parties work with and reference Office 97
documents.'' Doubleplusgood doublespeak, no?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't end there. If you used the Registration Wizard to
register Win98 electronically, you should know that Microsoft
probably gathered that number as well as your name and address and
information about your hardware during the process. Thinking about
wiping your hard drive yet?
</P>
<P>
   The boys in Redmond are scrambling to put a good face on this
fiasco by plugging the security holes. They say they've updated
Microsoft.com to stop receiving hardware info during registration,
and they're coming up with a new wizard that won't even look for
it. They're working on a way to remove an existing hardware ID, and
they say they'll purge whatever they've already gathered. Hey, I
know what you're thinking, but Microsoft guys never lie. Well,
almost never.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also promises a patch for Office 97 that prevents
insertion of the identifier and a tool to remove anything that's
already in your documents. Check for those at
officeupdate.microsoft.com soon.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes me wonder what else those weasels are up to that
we haven't found out about. You know, there's this black van that's
been following me for weeks now. Whoops! Somebody's knocking on the
door. Who could it be at this hour?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: A computer-savvy friend tells me Bill Gates
caused the Y2K problem by his design of DOS. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   _ Suspicious
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SUSP: I hope you're happy. You've put me in the
uncomfortable and unfamiliar position of defending Big Bill.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, he didn't design DOS. He bought it, slapped his
name on it and made a gazillion dollars off it. Second, the Y2K
problem goes back to when computer memory was so precious that
programmers couldn't waste the two extra bytes it would take to
represent a date with four digits. Now, older programs and systems
will think 2000 is 1900, and civilization as we know it will come
to an end.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't blame Bill. He was busy being born about the same
time the problem was. Hmmmm. Maybe I spoke too fast. I certainly
don't want to add to all those Antichrist rumors, but you do know
his real name is William Henry Gates III, don't you? If you take
all the letters in ``Bill Gates,'' convert them to ASCII codes, add
up the numbers, then add the III it comes out to 666. I'm sure it's
all a simple coincidence.
</P>

AUTHOR TAKES A SWING AT THE OTHER SIDE OF FIDEL CASTRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he finished his novel, ``Castro's Curveball,'' Tim Wendel
was probably thinking of Kevin Costner. Costner would be perfect
for the part of Billy Bryan, an aging catcher making a last stab at
baseball with the Havana Lions in 1947, discovering Fidel Castro's
curveball in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities of ``Castro's Curveball'' (Ballantine Books,
$23.95, 286 pages) being turned into a movie can't be hurt by
baseball's decision to OK a home-and-home series between the
Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban national team this spring _ the
first such exchange between Cuba and the United States since Castro
took power in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the novel came when Wendel read a piece written by
former major leaguer Don Hoak for Sport magazine in 1964. Hoak said
student demonstrators routinely took over ballfields during winter
ballgames in Havana in 1950-'51 and that during one of those
demonstrations he batted against Castro, who had taken the mound _
fouling off two pitches before the police moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Wendel was intrigued by the incident. Add a Cuban old-timers'
claim that Castro had a so-so fastball, a sneaky slider, ``but his
best pitch was his curveball,'' and Wendel had enough to wonder out
loud what would've happened if Castro had been wooed by American
baseball instead of Cuban politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro's Curveball'' goes so far as to have Castro volunteer
for tryouts, unleashing his wicked curveball on American sluggers,
before signing a contract with the Washington Senators. But the
book is seriously crippled by Wendel's decision to describe Castro
only from the outside. Because Wendel doesn't enter Castro's
thoughts, there is no way to explain how he could commit himself to
a revolution and playing baseball at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Castro is supposed to sign his contract, he writes a
note to Bryan saying, ``I've gone to Holguin, in the interior, to
train with my university comrades-in-arms to overthrow the corrupt
government of the Dominican Republic. We plan to oust the truant
Trujillo. For now, beisboll must be delayed ...''
</P>
<P>
   Moments like that come close to being laughable, and Wendel
knows enough to keep them to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Wendel's take on Castro _ a charming, headstrong speaker who had
no problem sacrificing others on his way to power _ is backed by
historical accounts. Castro's early idealism made way for the
bloodbaths at Santiago in 1953 and the suicide landings of 1956,
when he led 82 revolutionaries into a dead-end invasion.
</P>
<P>
   But Wendel is unable to get a real handle on Castro, then or
now.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he turns ``Castro's Curveball'' into a romance novel, a
tale of an over-the-hill catcher and a beautiful revolutionary torn
between ballgames and overthrowing the government.
</P>
<P>
   Wendel, a former sportswriter for the San Francisco Examiner who
also wrote the story of the 1980 U.S. hockey team, ``Going for the
Gold,'' has Bryan returning to Cuba half a century after his
postwar adventures with Malena Fonseca to find Malena's daughter _
his child or Castro's? _ and a completely different Havana.

 By MARK GREEN WITH NANCY YOUMAN  
 From ``The Consumer Bible,'' published by Workman Publishing 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even before Chief Justice Marshall declared in 1819 that ``the
power to tax is the power to destroy,'' taxes had been this
country's great obsession. Political careers are lost for
supporting them; millionaires go to prison for evading them. And
the rest of us _ the ``little people,'' in Leona Helmsley's
immortal words _ are left to sweat and fret as April 15 looms near.
 &HT;    Some 115 million Americans dutifully file their income tax
returns with the Internal Revenue Service each year. Slightly over
half of taxpayers choose to go through this painful ritual alone,
sitting at the kitchen table with paper, pencil and eraser or at
the computer answering questions from a tax preparation software
program, and measuring the extent of the damage. The rest, due to
fear or financial complexity, seek solace or savings by hiring a
tax preparer.
 &HT;    Finding the right professional can truly be a taxing task. There
is no national standard or educational requirement for tax
preparers: All you need to do is click your ruby shoes together
three times and murmur, ``I am a tax preparer'' et voila, you can
hang out a shingle and get down to business. Only California and
Oregon have qualifying guidelines.
 &HT;    And while fiscal laws are in a constant flux, one in seven
preparers has in recent years canceled subscriptions to tax
information services that help keep accountants up-to-date. The
result: U.S. taxpayers demanded $100 million in damages from
certified public accountants in 1992, according to the chief
insurance liability underwriter for the accounting industry.
 &HT;    Therefore you need to take some time to find the right person to
take care of your financial health, if you choose not to do it
yourself. Step one is to decide if you'll prepare your tax return
yourself or go for professional help.
 &HT;    If your tax situation changed little since last year, or if you
have only a few pieces of information _ one or two W-2s, some
interest and investment income, and a mortgage deduction _ consider
sitting down at home one weekend with pen, pencil, coffee and
calculator and slogging through until it's done.
 &HT;    As one business journalist who has done his own taxes for 20
years explains, ``I go it alone because of an absolute conviction
that no outsider will take as much care with my return as I will,
no matter how big the fee.''
 &HT;    You should be able to knock off your return in an afternoon.
According to the IRS, it takes the average taxpayer 3 hours and 27
minutes to prepare a 1040 Form, plus two more hours for forms
listing itemized deductions and capital gains and losses.
 &HT;    If you decide to go it alone, the IRS offers free help with
publications, phone hotlines and walk-in centers. While telephone
assistance has been notoriously unreliable, the rate of technical
accuracy had reached 89 percent by 1993, up from 78 percent in
1991.
 &HT;    In addition, call your local IRS office to find out about
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, a program that offers free
assistance to low-income taxpayers, the disabled, non-English
speakers and, in conjunction with the American Association of
Retired Persons, low- and moderate-income citizens 60 years and up.
 &HT;    Consider also investing in a tax guidebook or, if you have a
computer, a software program.
 TAX PREPARATION SOFTWARE  
 &HT;    It may not be the most fun you'll have on your computer, but
various companies now offer tax preparation software, both in
stores and on the Internet, to replace the pencil and eraser of
old.
 &HT;    Three programs dominate the market. Turbo Tax (and its Macintosh
counterpart, Macintax) and Personal Tax Edge, both by Intuit, Inc.,
which controls 80 percent of the market, and Kiplinger Tax Cut, by
the folks responsible for your neighborhood H&AMP;R Block storefront.
 &HT;    All three follow a question-and-answer interview format similar
to how a flesh-and-blood preparer operates; all three are
reasonably user friendly; all three enable you to test different
scenarios to maximize your savings; and all three have become quite
affordable.
 &HT;    The downsides: The existing programs can be less than accurate
for complicated returns (with Turbo Tax getting the best results in
a Consumer Reports survey). They take a generally conservative
approach to the tax code, which may not suit more aggressive
taxpayers.
 &HT;    And, as one skeptic points out, ``impressive as some software
is, it can't put on a suit and wave your receipts in front of an
IRS auditor.''
 &HT;    Finally, it is worth noting that in a Consumer Reports survey of
26,000 readers, it took software users an average of nine hours to
prepare their taxes, as opposed to five hours for pencil-and-paper
proponents. However, to be fair, the former often faced more
complicated returns.
 A GOOD TAX PREPARER IS HARD TO FIND  
 &HT;    If your tax return is reasonably complex or if you need
professional backup, help is available. But not all tax preparers
are equally qualified.
 &HT;    Each year, Money magazine asks 50 tax preparers to calculate
taxes owed by a hypothetical household. In 1997, none of the 45
respondents came up with the same figure _ and none came up with
the magic number of $42,336, the figure calculated by the expert
who prepared the test.
 &HT;    Answers ranged from $36,322 to $94,438. Less than one in four
respondents came within $1,000 of the correct answer. In addition,
there was no correlation between the fees charged and the accuracy
of the returns.
 &HT;    A few pointed queries should help you come up with the right
person for the job. First, find out about prospects' professional
background. Ask how preparers stay current on tax developments _ do
they read specialized journals or attend seminars? As always,
recommendations from family, friends or colleagues are a good place
to start.
 &HT;    Find out if your preparer shares your financial philosophy _
whether he or she will aggressively push the legal envelope or act
in a conservative fashion.
 &HT;    Finally, ask how the fee is computed. Storefront preparers
generally charge based on the number of forms; enrolled agents and
CPAs, on an hourly basis. Steer clear if the fee is calculated
based on the size of your income rather than the complexity of your
return. Don't forget to ask if your preparer will reimburse you for
errors that result in interest or penalties.
 &HT;    Most important, look for someone whose skills march the
complexity of your return. Just as you wouldn't hire Albert
Einstein to tutor your child in fourth-grade math, you don't need a
CPA from one of the Big Six accounting firms to file a 1040EZ (for
``easy'') form. At the same time, you don't want to hire a rookie
if you're playing in the big leagues.
 &HT;    Tax professionals break down into four categories:
 &HT;    + Storefront preparers provide the best bang for the buck if
your filing is fairly straightforward (only a few documents).
Because anyone can claim to be a tax preparer, make sure to check a
prospective preparer's qualifications. You're probably in good
hands if you go to one of the large national chains.
 &HT;    H&AMP;R Block, which files one in seven U.S. tax returns, requires
all its employees to complete annual 11-week courses. For an
average of $50, you can expect a solid, straightforward job _ but
no fancy accounting to jazz up your refunds.
 &HT;    Unlike enrolled agents, CPAs and tax attorneys, storefront
operators cannot represent you at an IRS audit. Large chains,
however, will generally send a preparer to accompany you to the IRS
if your return is audited.
 &HT;    For business returns or complicated personal returns _ if you
sold a house, got married or divorced, want to claim depreciation
of assets or had partnership income last year _ consider going to a
more thoroughly trained professional. There are three kinds:
 &HT;    + Enrolled agents are certified to practice before the IRS after
having either worked at the IRS for a minimum of five years or
passed a rigorous two-day exam (only 30 percent pass). They are
skilled at navigating the system and can handle most functions a
CPA would serve, including complex tax returns, financial planning
and representing you at an audit, often for up to one-half to
one-third less than a CPA would charge.
 &HT;    + Certified public accountants, like enrolled agents, should be
considered for complex filings _ especially if your situation
involves large investment portfolios, business interests, trusts or
self-employment plans. CPAs may be especially valuable for
financial and tax planning.
 &HT;    But while all CPAs have some tax training, not all are experts
on individual returns. And while they are required to take 80 hours
of continuing education courses every two years to maintain their
CPA designation, they may do so in a field unrelated to your needs.
 &HT;    + Tax lawyers are the industry's 800-pound gorillas. They
generally do not assist in the preparation of individual returns
but rather intervene in complex issues like divorce settlements or
more adversarial IRS audits.
 &HT;    
 SIDEBAR: HOW TO GET HELP  
 &HT;    + To get free assistance from the IRA, call (800) 829-1040 or
your local IRS office. The hearing-impaired with TDD equipment
should call (800) 829-4059.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the American Institute for Certified
Public Accountants in your area, call (800) 862-4272.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the National Association of Enrolled
Agents in your area, call (800) 424-4339.
 &HT;    + The IRS puts out more than a hundred useful booklets,
including Publication 1, ``Your Rights as a Taxpayer,'' Publication
17, ``Your Federal Income Tax,'' and Publication 910, ``Guide to
Free Tax Services.''
 &HT;    + Several organizations _ such as Consumer Reports, H&AMP;R Block,
Ernst &AMP; Young, etc. _ put out annual tax preparation guides. For
$15 or $20, these guides can help you prepare even moderately
complex returns.

 By RUTH SHERMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Every year April 15 rears its ugly head, and I'm never ready.
You would think, since for years the IRS has celebrated this date
as its annual tax festival, that I would be prepared. You would be
wrong. Luckily, I know I am not alone. That's clear from the
monumental increase in Valium and aspirin consumption at this time
of year.
 &HT;    I begin thinking about filing taxes at the beginning of the year
when the tax forms supplant Christmas catalogs in the mailbox. Of
course, the forms are thrown on a pile on the desk with the feeling
that there's plenty of time. The due date looms someplace far off
down a misty path.
 &HT;    In February, public service announcements emphasize filing
early. There is talk about electronic filing. Mailers arrive
touting TurboTax and other software of the same ilk. W-2s and 1099s
keep arriving in the mail. You look at them, idly speculating on
why so much is taken out each year. For a moment there is a twinge
of recognition of an urgent task. But the feeling soon passes.
 &HT;    March is a lovely month. Spring is coming. You begin to think
about getting out and buying some new clothes. You think about that
CD player you want, that, in fact, you certainly deserve (you
WORKED for it, after all). You throw on your coat and head out to
the nearest electronics emporium. The tax forms by this time have
fallen into a pile under the desk.
 &HT;    On April 1, you have the feeling of impending trouble. You know
it's not your allergies (that's usually a May-June ritual). By
April 10 reality dawns: It's tax time.
 &HT;    Usually this epiphany comes about in one of two ways: A
co-worker sidles over to you and, with a barely contained smirk,
informs you that not only did she file her taxes January 1, but she
also already got back a big, fat refund that was immediately
invested in Electro-Silico Intercom International stock that
already has brought in a tidy profit of at least $15,000 (and
counting).
 &HT;    The second way? Tripping over a pile of tax forms leaking out
from under your desk.
 &HT;    No matter how the news gets through, what ensues is total,
unremitting PANIC. Where are those receipts? Why didn't I get those
W-2s? Papers start flying. Drawers are emptied out. Chaos reigns.
It is not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    This year, I have vowed to take steps to help ease tax time
trauma. In the spirit of good fellowship, I now offer them to you:
 &HT;    1. Make up file folders that you keep in one drawer in your
desk, clearly labeled with the tax year, with specified
subcategories (e.g., charitable contributions, medical expenses,
stocks, dividends, etc.). Whenever a critical piece of paper starts
floating around, catch it and put it into the relevant file. Now go
out and play.
 &HT;    2. Put all tax information forms into one folder.
 &HT;    3. During the year make sure all records, on paper or computer,
are kept up-to-date (this means your checkbook, too). All bank
statements should also be put into a separate file. (How does it
feel to actually behave like a grownup?)
 &HT;    4. If you use a tax preparer to do the real work of processing
your taxes, contact him or her in advance and talk over what will
be needed, and when you will have to deliver it. Keep a record of
what you are turning over and make copies of forms for your files.
 &HT;    5. If you live your life through your computer, right about the
time you're breaking open the holiday fudge is the time to put in
the order for the federal and state software you'll need for
completing your taxes. All forms are included in the software,
which then frees up one paper file that you can use for all those
long-winded Christmas letters you mean to answer but never do.
 &HT;    6. If electronic filing appeals to you, make sure you understand
all the instructions, since it can be a bit tricky. If you don't
understand it, you can call the IRS for further information.
 &HT;    7. Circle April 15 on your calendar and on that day get up, get
out and go directly to the post office. After mailing your tax
return, don't forget to stop off for the mandatory chocolate
truffles _ you earned them!
 &HT;    Now you are free to take the time to think about more important
things, like solving mysteries of the universe such as why cereal
boxes have to be ``allowed to settle'' so they're only
three-quarters full when you buy them, and why taking one bite of
dinner instantaneously triggers at least 17 telephone sales
solicitations.

LE CARRE'S NEW NOVEL IS SINGULARLY DISAPPOINTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GINGER BRISTOW  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Le Carre's new novel, ``Single &AMP; Single,'' will be a
welcome sight in bookstores to his many long-term fans.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War, the book begins well. Le Carre,
always an excellent writer, will not fail the reader with his
style. The book opens with one of its most interesting characters.
On a hillside in Turkey, a lawyer is on his knees, his hands tied
behind his back, a small gun at his head.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Mr. Winser, consciously chooses denial of the
situation, and his thought process is very interesting. As his life
passes before him, he asks himself why he has to keep marrying
these women through his life to find out he does not like them. By
the time the video and tape recording of the murder are complete,
we know the lawyer very well. I hated to see him die.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story of a venture capital investment house in London,
Single &AMP; Single, setting up off-shore businesses with the Orlov
brothers, who have turned their communist-government-controlled
businesses toward the free market.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional press proclaims the firm of Single &AMP; Single ``as
boldly going where lesser houses dither,'' and ``quartering the
nations of the new-look Communist bloc in search of opportunity.''
This opportunity runs the gamut from new legitimate business to
prostitution and finally illegal drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   When the younger Single is made aware of the immoral, not to
mention illegal, activities of his father and the new partners, he
betrays his father to customs officials.
</P>
<P>
   Single feels like a traitor, but accepts this over being a
criminal. But when the father disappears, the son seeks his
location, introducing us to a host of characters from his personal
and professional life.
</P>
<P>
   The basic promise of the book _ a father and son who through
betrayal and reversal of fortune find their way back to redemption
_ unfortunately does not materialize. It was this promise that kept
me reading.
</P>
<P>
   The writing is interesting for those who can jump from an
interior monologue to a dialogue, all within the same conversation.
This is not a book for lazy readers. It requires focus and
attention to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   With Single the younger, who seeks to redeem himself by
searching for his father who has gone into hiding, we look for the
same personal insight that the lawyer had in his final minutes, but
it never appears. This character never engaged me even though I
struggled to like him and share in his redemption.
</P>
<P>
   The characters seem to have been well thought out, but they just
never quite become real, including Single's mother, who is
something of a caricature. About three-quarters through the book,
we discover that one of the lead characters is gay. This has never
been hinted at, and it becomes relevant when the customs office
tries to strike a deal with him. It seems almost an afterthought
that works to move the plot forward, but meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   The plot and story-line drive the book, and for those who are
interested in the changes taking place in the old Soviet bloc, this
may be a book for them. For those who are looking for well-drawn
interesting characters, the book, is 345 pages of disappointment.
But fans of good writing and John Le Carre will not share in it.

FROM THE SUMERIANS TO THE 19TH AMENDMENT: A TAXING HISTORY

   &UR; By CYNTHIA BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Spring in America is a pretty mixed bag. On the one hand,
springtime means gardens and baseball and hours of extra daylight.
On the other hand, just as the weather turns fair and we yearn to
get out of the house, it's time for the annual downer: filing
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Few things in history are as hated as taxes. Across cultures and
classes and entire millennia, people have feared them, resented
them and hunted for ways not to pay them. But no matter how
fiercely resented, they don't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ben Franklin's dictum _ ``in this world, nothing is
certain but death and taxes'' _ has been true since the earliest
dawn of recorded time.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes are at least 5,000 years old. In fact, one of the major
reasons that the Sumerians _ the world's first great civilization,
and the inventors of writing _ developed writing at all was because
priests and kings wished to keep better track of mandatory tax
payments to temple and throne. (It was also the Sumerians who
invented history's first tax receipt _ a clay tablet, carefully
scratched _ in anticipation, perhaps, of history's first tax
audit.)
</P>
<P>
   As civilization spread through the ancient world, so too did
taxes, sometimes by tithing (voluntary and not), sometimes by
excise duties, and sometimes _ the grimmest times _ by imposing
slave labor. Direct taxes also were often invoked, although with
caveats: While directly taxing a Roman citizen was considered
insulting, it was all right to tax the province (which is why, in
Luke 2:1, a pre-tax census is taking place).
</P>
<P>
   Taxation in medieval Europe was fairly hit-and-miss, with formal
taxes tending to be imposed only during crises. An example was the
so-called ``Saladin tithe,'' imposed to raise money for France and
England to overthrow the sultan Saladin during the Third Crusade;
once the crusade petered out, so did the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Medieval Europe marks the very last time taxes were not too
terribly taxing. From the 15th century on, as governments grew
larger and more expensive, taxes became ongoing, and the need for
collection more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   In England, the attempt to expand collections in the colonies
sparked resentment, then revolution. While taxes alone did not
cause the American Revolution, they certainly kickstarted the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The colonists despised England's power to tax them, less because
of the revenue loss (actually fairly light) than because the Sugar
Act and the Stamp Act reminded the colonists, each time they paid,
how unfree they were.
</P>
<P>
   With taxation so touchy a topic, the Founders were, not
surprisingly, rather vague on the subject when framing the
Constitution, content to allow this hot potato to cool off in the
hands of future generations.
</P>
<P>
   The first federal income tax appeared in America during the
Civil War. The North imposed a 3 percent tax on incomes above $600,
reaching 5 percent for incomes above $10,000 (predictably, these
rates later rose). One interesting provision of Civil War taxes was
that taxpayers' names were routinely published in the local paper,
along with amount paid. This created an excruciating dilemma:
Obviously, the less tax you paid, the less money out of your pocket
_ but then, the less good your finances looked in the eyes of your
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While the war was in progress, there was little griping about
the income tax; there was plenty afterwards, though, especially in
the Northeast, where most of the nation's power and wealth resided.
</P>
<P>
   In 1872, East Coast congressmen tossed it out and replaced it
with tariffs on products which just happened to be manufactured in
their states. These tariffs was bitterly resented in the west _
``the west'' being anywhere west of the Alleghenies _ where
manufacturing was minimal and incomes in general far too low to
have to pay much income tax anyway. Soon the stage was set was an
east-west battle of wills.
</P>
<P>
   In 1894, a second income tax became law; two years later, the
Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. This ruling galvanized
sectional feeling, the pro-tariff east howling that the west's
continued enthusiasm for an income tax betrayed ``communistic
leanings,'' and the pro-income tax west howling back how the
country was being taken over by its 4,000 known millionaires and
their ``whorish lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   A move arose, supported by Democrats, Populists and progressive
Republicans, for a third income tax _ this one's constitutional
legality to be guaranteed by means of an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over an income tax amendment became, very swiftly,
a hot political issue. Those opposed to the tax (Teddy Roosevelt's
``malefactors of great wealth'') took the position _ sound
familiar? _ that taxes were unfair because they punished success
and rewarded failure.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor of income tax (``the idle, the lazy, the
shiftless,'' according to their opponents) argued _ also familiarly
_ that wealth in America was becoming too concentrated, and taxes
would help to level the moneybags.
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, an amendment _ No. 16 _ was ratified by the necessary
36 states. Rates ranged from 1 percent to 7 percent, with a $3,000
($4,000 for married couples) exemption. With personal income in
1913 averaging $621, the 16th Amendment clearly was something not
meant to apply to most people _ only the well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   This situation didn't last. In 1913, less than 5 percent of the
population filed tax returns; by 1919, this number had nearly
doubled; by the end of World War II, close to half the American
public was filing. And it's never been that low since.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 160 million tax returns will be filed.
What's more, the whole rigmarole of taxation _ 1040s, W-2s, lO99s _
has become so common and shared an experience that complaining
about it, once thought highly uncouth, is now a conversational
icebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes, like springtime, have become accepted as part of the
natural order _ even if, at best, it's the most grudging acceptance
humanly possible.

 By MARK ALBRECHT AND THOMAS RAY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We remember receiving a panicked call on a Friday afternoon from
a self-employed marketing consultant. Without warning, the IRS had
put a levy on his checking account, causing his rent check and
other payments to bounce.
</P>
<P>
   He had avoided doing his tax return one year while working on a
major project and missed the tax deadline. Even with the best
intentions of filing the return, something had always gotten in his
way. Although this happened very innocently, he was frightened and
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   During our first meeting, he confided that the tax problem had
actually started earlier. He had not filed his tax returns for the
previous seven years and the IRS presented him with a bill for
$12,000. Because he was living from month to month, there was
little hope that he could ever pay off the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   After further research, we found that the IRS had computed his
tax bill for him, without including any deductions. Using legal
deductions, we prepared the returns and most of them resulted in
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Our client was ecstatic when we informed him that he actually
owed just $1,000 and would soon be free to get on with his life.
Although the bill could not be paid in full, we still negotiated an
affordable $25 monthly payment plan and the IRS finally agreed to
release the levy on his checking account, allowing his rent and
other bills to be paid in time. Thankfully, this story had a happy
ending, but it also teaches us to care for our tax matters before
they become serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   When April 15th rolls around, nearly 20 percent of the taxpaying
population will owe Uncle Sam for current and back taxes with
little or no ability to pay their bill. These are not bad or
dishonest people. Tax troubles are often triggered by poor cash
flow stemming from unintentional circumstances such as a business
failure, job layoff, divorce or health problems. Chances are you or
someone you know will face a sizable tax bill, property lien, wage
or bank garnishment or even a seizure of valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is desperate to settle over $200 billion in back taxes
and utilizes aggressive collection techniques to reduce its
receivables. In some businesses, IRS wage garnishments on an
employee will result in termination. Countless loyal Americans feel
forced to hide in the underground cash economy.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been avoiding a tax problem, there is only one
effective alternative. Simply stop worrying and negotiate. You will
not go to jail or lose your house unless you have been convicted of
tax fraud. So don't worry!
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate options by which you can reach a settlement
without causing unreasonable hardship. You may even be able to
eliminate the tax bill or at least have it greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Your first option in handling an IRS tax problem is a monthly
payment plan called an Installment Agreement, where the balance is
paid off over three to five years. The payment amount is based on
strict IRS formulas calculating your ability to pay. At best, an
Installment Agreement puts you into a safe harbor by stopping the
collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   As part of your agreement, you will make your monthly payment
plus file and pay your taxes on time. If you fail to comply, the
collection pressure returns and you are back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that it is an expensive loan with a current
effective rate of over 17 percent in interest and penalties. Plus,
if the tax bill is large enough and requires three or more years to
pay off, the IRS may attach a lien to your assets as protection.
</P>
<P>
   The next option, called Offer in Compromise, entails a dollar
settlement with the IRS. Sometimes you can pay less than 10 cents
on the dollar for your settlement without undue harm to your credit
report. The amount of your offer is based on your net worth plus a
factor of your monthly disposable income. It is always wise to
offer payment in one lump sum. The IRS also weighs factors such as
your age, health, education and future earning potential.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the complex OIC process takes six to nine months if
handled by a competent tax professional. Thorough analysis and
proper planning of your financial and tax situation should be done
before contacting the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Upon acceptance of the OIC, you must also file returns and pay
any owed taxes on time for a period of five years. Failure to do so
will nullify the settlement, and the old tax problem will come back
in full with accrued interest and penalties. Annual tax planning is
especially important during this probationary period to ensure full
compliance and freedom from collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Your final option is the dismissal of taxes in Chapter 7
bankruptcy. The IRS is gy
back the IRS and creditors, usually over three years, while keeping
assets and income protected.
</P>
<P>
   A bankruptcy ill remain on your credit report for a period of
seven to 10 years. Yet with steady income and no new credit
problems it is now possible to be worthy of new credit and
financing after just six months. However, proposed changes in
bankruptcy laws will make it very difficult to discharge taxes.
Should you decide to take this route, you would be wise to move
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do first? Get advice from an experienced tax
professional. After all, we are talking about the IRS. You are
extremely vulnerable in competing against a seasoned collection
officer and there is no time to master an understanding of the
numerous technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to save money, many people undertake this process
alone and find themselves in more costly situations. This is
clearly a time when you want representation to protect your best
interests. A licensed CPA or enrolled agent can save you
considerable amounts of money, time and hassles without costing a
small fortune.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the negotiating process, you can now make an
honest evaluation of your finances and prepare a realistic monthly
budget. Regardless of your situation, it is also important to
budget your projected tax liability correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Self-employed taxpayers have the additional burden of staying
current with their quarterly estimated tax payments. Have your tax
consultant prepare a quarterly tax projection to ensure that there
are no surprises at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Try to think of your estimated tax payment as an additional
monthly overhead cost such as rent or phone. To help you to stay in
compliance with the IRS, the monthly budgeting process is a simple
yet highly effective tool which can also generate savings for a
more prosperous future.

   A damaging battle is about to break out in the consumer
electronics industry on a scale not seen since the VHS and Betamax
standards for VCRs fought it out in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Rival alliances plan to launch two incompatible music formats.
Both will come with draconian anti-copying measures that may
discourage potential purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   Standards have already been established for storing video or
computer data on DVDs (DVD-Video and DVD-ROM). Now the DVD Forum,
the industry's standards-setting body, has come up with a sound
format called DVD-Audio. This is backed by the recording company
Warner Brothers as well as electronics manufacturers Toshiba and
Panasonic.
</P>
<P>
   DVD-Audio promises to provide higher-quality sound than audio
CDs. It samples sound 192,000 times per second, compared with
44,000 times per second for CDs. And each sample it records is
stored as a chunk of data 24 bits long, against 16 bits for CD.
This ability to store more information results in improved sound
quality. What's more, DVD-Audio will cram 80 minutes of six-channel
surround sound on one side of a disc.
</P>
<P>
   But Philips and Sony, co-inventors of the CD format that now
dominates the record industry, make royalties from every CD player
and disc sold. They want to promote a high-quality extension to CD
technology so that they can maintain those revenues. They are
planning to launch a format called Super Audio CD. Instead of using
chunks of data of a fixed length, this format codes sound as a
stream of single bits.
</P>
<P>
   DVD-Audio discs require special players. And while Philips and
Sony say their format is compatible with existing CD players, they
have yet to produce mass-market discs to back their claim.
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback from consumers' point of view is that both
formats are likely to include a new copy-control system developed
to satisfy the big record companies.
</P>
<P>
   The sound is encrypted, and a digital ``watermark'' is added.
This still allows the disc to be copied onto analogue tape, but
record companies will have the option of adding extra codes to the
discs to control how many digital copies you can make, and of what
quality. &QL;

computer data on DVDs (DVD-Video and DVD-ROM). Now the DVD Forum,
the industry's standards-setting body, has come up with a sound
format called DVD-Audio. This is backed by the recording company
Warner Brothers as well as electronics manufacturers Toshiba and
Panasonic.
</P>
<P>
   DVD-Audio promises to provide higher-quality sound than audio
CDs. It samples sound 192,000 times per second, compared with
44,000 times per second for CDs. And each sample it records is
stored as a chunk of data 24 bits long, against 16 bits for CD.
This ability to store more information results in improved sound
quality. What's more, DVD-Audio will cram 80 minutes of six-channel
surround sound on one side of a disc.
</P>
<P>
   But Philips and Sony, co-inventors of the CD format that now
dominates the record industry, make royalties from every CD player
and disc sold. They want to promote a high-quality extension to CD
technology so that they can maintain those revenues. They are
planning to launch a format called Super Audio CD. Instead of using
chunks of data of a fixed length, this format codes sound as a
stream of single bits.
</P>
<P>
   DVD-Audio discs require special players. And while Philips and
Sony say their format is compatible with existing CD players, they
have yet to produce mass-market discs to back their claim.
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback from consumers' point of view is that both
formats are likely to include a new copy-control system developed
to satisfy the big record companies.
</P>
<P>
   The sound is encrypted, and a digital ``watermark'' is added.
This still allows the disc to be copied onto analogue tape, but
record companies will have the option of adding extra codes to the
discs to control how many digital copies you can make, and of what
quality. &QL;

   A fondness for garlic could ease livestock through the trauma of
weaning, say researchers in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Pig farmers often stop piglets from suckling as early as three
weeks after they have been born so that their mother can produce
another litter. But it can be up to a week before some of the
piglets learn to eat solid food.
</P>
<P>
   This is unacceptable on welfare grounds, argues Jon Day of the
Terrington Research Centre near King's Lynn in Norfolk, England.
``And it's also bad for farm productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Day believes piglets will switch more readily to solids if both
milk and the feed have the same strong flavor. He has already
tested this idea with rats.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Emmeline Randall and Richard Sibly of the
University of Reading, Day added garlic or cumin to the food of
pregnant rats. Control females received normal food. After allowing
the pups to suckle for three weeks, they were offered two pots of
food, one flavored with cumin, the other with garlic.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of weaning, 60 percent of the food eaten by the
rats fed on the garlic-flavored milk was from the garlicky pot. The
rats also spent 80 percent of the first day in physical contact
with the container of garlic-flavored food, suggesting that they
were strongly drawn to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle is to get them to stick their noses in the trough
and take a bite,'' says Day, who will present his results next week
in Scarborough at the annual meeting of the British Society of
Animal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Rats fed on cumin-flavored milk ate equal amounts of both foods
on the first day, which suggests that they were not as strongly
conditioned as the garlic-eaters. But they did spend 60 percent of
their time on the first day in contact with the cumin-flavored pot.
</P>
<P>
   Day is now seeking funding to test the garlic treatment on
piglets down on the farm. &QL;

   Attempts to build weapons that incapacitate people by harnessing
the power of very low-frequency sound waves are destined to fail,
says a German physicist.
</P>
<P>
   Some weapons developers have claimed that infrasound,
frequencies too low to hear, can cause debilitating effects such as
nausea and diarrhea. But Jrgen Altmann of Ruhr-University Bochum
has studied the scientific literature and is convinced that the
weapons will never work. He presented his findings this week to a
joint meeting of European and American acoustical societies in
Berlin. ``All these effects of infrasound do not really exist,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   William Arkin, a writer and consultant based in South Pomfret,
Vt., has obtained documents describing infrasound research that
came from the Pentagon under the Freedom of Information Act. The
papers claim high-power infrasound could leave troops
``incapacitated by nausea.''
</P>
<P>
   Police also believe infrasound weapons would have advantages
over chemicals such as tear gas. ``It is environmentally benign,
can be switched on and off and can be controlled much better,''
says Sid Heal of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that low-frequency vibrations make you ill may have
started because some people feel queasy during earthquakes. Nikola
Tesla, the inventor of transformers and generators, reportedly
duplicated the effect with a vibrating chair almost a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   But those observations were based on mechanical vibrations in
solids, which couple energy to the human body much more efficiently
than sound waves can transfer energy from the air. Altmann says
that experiments in which people or animals have been subjected to
airborne infrasound suggest the weapons won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found no hard evidence for vomiting or uncontrolled
defecation, even at levels of 170 decibels or more,'' Altmann says.
And while air transmits infrasound very well, he points out that
the wavelengths are so long _ 17 metres or more _ that it spreads
out too rapidly to form a controllable beam.
</P>
<P>
   Altmann blames rumor and misunderstanding for the stories
surrounding infrasound. ``You can't hear it, so you're inclined to
believe what people say about it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Heal, who works with the U.S. Army on its infrasound weapons
program, admits that the research has been refocused. As well as
attempting to create prototype weapons, researchers are trying to
develop a better understanding of how infrasound might affect the
human body, he says. &QL;

   Beetles that dine on dead bodies and flies that nibble rotten
fruit could soon be saving your bacon. Researchers in Britain are
using the antennae of such insects to create sensors that warn when
food is about to go rotten. If detected soon enough, such
deterioration can sometimes be halted.
</P>
<P>
   Blowflies, bluebottles, fruit flies and carrion beetles have a
fine and discriminating sense of smell, thanks to nerve cells in
their antennae. Carrion beetles, for example, can sniff out a dead
animal from a long way off, while fruit flies pick up early signs
of decay in fruit.
</P>
<P>
   John Pickett, Lester Wadhams and Eleanor Pow at the Institute of
Arable Crops Research in Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, England are
exploiting this keen sense of smell by inserting tungsten
electrodes into the antennae of insects as small as aphids. The
electrodes register discrete electrical signals created in the
antennae when neurons are exposed to traces of volatile odors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The substances we're looking for are not detectable by human
noses,'' Pickett says. ``The insects get there first.''
</P>
<P>
   By exposing the ``wired'' insects to substances emitted by
rotting fruit, Pickett and his colleagues can identify the unique
electrical signal each odor produces in the antennae. As little as
one picogram of a substance is enough to generate such signals.
``The olfactory neurons are quite specific for the compounds we are
trying to analyze for,'' Pickett says.
</P>
<P>
   Once the signature for a given chemical is established, Pickett
and his colleagues can make a sensor to detect it by wiring up a
live insect or a detached antenna. By examining individual neurons,
Pickett's team has also identified the protein receptors for
particular odor compounds. ``It might be possible to fabricate
these proteins into cellular sensors,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the team plans to develop sensors for meat that is
starting to deteriorate. The project is being funded by the
Anglo-Dutch company Unilever. &QL;

WRITER SPENDS A BRACING YEAR AS RANCH HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Books where the authors spend a day, a month or a year at
someone else's job are usually dumb. The Plimpton School of Writing
has three variations: Me, me and me, topped by fairy-tale
conversations and veterans giving grudging respect to the rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboy Way: Seasons of a Montana Ranch'' by David McCumber
(Avon Books, $24, 338 pages) isn't like that. McCumber, a former
editor at the San Francisco Examiner and Santa Barbara News Press,
has written about a long, sometimes brutal year as a rank-wage
ranch hand living in a trailer on the 6,000-acre Birch Creek Ranch
in central Montana, bringing the reader into the heart of his
adventure, morning to night.
</P>
<P>
   From his first days on the ranch, feeding hay to cattle in
snow-covered fields, McCumber puts the reader right there _ ``Three
hours and seven loads later I was a wreck. The muscles in my arms
and shoulders were cramping constantly ... and the shooting pain in
my back was now a fixture, from shoulder blades to beltline,
grabbing as I moved in any direction, stabbing when I tried to
breathe deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   McCumber puts the reader through the calving process, too,
bringing heifers out of the freezing cold into stalls, reaching up
inside of them to pull a calf out, some mewling healthily, some
never moving. On the last day of a 20-below windstorm, McCumber has
to take 10 dead calves to the dump above the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down at the carcasses of cows and calves, getting ready
to pitchfork 10 more bodies onto the pile, he writes, ``Some were
little more than hide and bone, others looked as though they had
just stopped for a rest _ except that the birds had without
exception pecked out the eyes. All this was set against the
picture-postcard backdrop of the Crazy Mountains. A light, fine
snow was falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nature is the one constant in ``The Cowboy Way.'' Not a day goes
by that McCumber doesn't tip a hat to it _ ``One morning as we
headed out of the shop yard to get our first load, I looked back
over my shoulder and saw that the first direct rays of the sun were
touching the stackyard on top of the bar, above the shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``First the top of the haystack, then the whole stack, then, as
we rounded the corner, the hill beneath it glowed gold, with
everything else still in shade. Spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   McCumber draws clean portraits of his co-workers and his
workaholic boss, Bill Galt, as well as the demands of a
contemporary cattle ranch, caught between four-wheel roundups and
horseback nostalgia. What emerges from ``The Cowboy Way'' is the
weight of nature on the land and the men who try to cope with it,
season to season.
</P>
<P>
   McCumber talks about hauling wide loads down a state highway all
morning _ ``We moved the swathers, without blocking any holiday
traffic, and at noon, Bill gave us the rest of the day off. That
brightened the crew's mood considerably. I drove to Livingston for
a Fourth of July barbecue. I tried to be sociable, festive even,
but I kept falling asleep in the middle of conversations. People
who don't work on a ranch have a hard time understanding this.''
</P>
<P>
   McCumber writes of deer and elk and getting away for a rare turn
at fly-fishing. ``I fished until the deepest part of dusk was
turning to night, keeping only the last _ two pounds of dinner with
a yellow belly and wide dark spots across its back. I fried it with
butter and garlic and green onions and fat slices of an enormous
meadow mushroom ... I drank two Miller beers and wished for this
one night to come back to me one more time, perhaps late in my
fifth decade, when I would need it just as much as I had tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   McCumber is able to carry across that joy to the reader time and
again _ the joy of watching a miserable winter turn to spring, the
joy of sitting on a good horse, handling stray steers, the joy of
seeing an elk cross a fence a few feet away, massive, majestic.
McCumber also describes the misery of a mud- soaked autumn and
winter, close calls with angry steers, and the ranch hosting
hunters for money, cutting up carcasses as part of the deal (``More
brain-salad surgery with the chain saw'').

<P>
   In the end, when McCumber says his goodbyes, unhappy to leave it
all behind, the reader is just as unhappy to see him go. This is
one walk-a-mile-in-my-shoes book that really works.

BATTLE FOR THE OSCARS PITS BRAVE SOLDIERS AGAINST BAWDY
ELIZABETHANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Try as you might, you cannot run away from the Oscar onslaught.
Every day, a TV spot is telling us that ``Shakespeare in Love'' is
the leading Oscar contender. Let us count the ways. It's nominated
for, among others, Best Picture, Best Actress, Supporting Actress
and Supporting Actor, Screenplay, and, probably, best vowel usage
by an American portraying a Brit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare'' may be the most sheerly enjoyable movie of all
the nominated films this year. It also happens to be very shrewd
about all of the Shakespeare stuff (the women are smarter and more
emotionally evolved, as they are in all Shakespearean comedies);
it's also a period piece, a romantic comedy and a comedy about
romance, all of which give this picture standing that none of the
other nominees has. This must be why it has 13 nominations total _
two more than ``Saving Private Ryan,'' considered to be the most
Oscar-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   A recent GQ piece strained to turn a truism _ you have to be a
gimp to win an Oscar _ into an article. And besides being a little
dated, it missed the point. It almost seems that to get a
nomination you have to set a movie in the past _ the 16th century,
for example, when most of the academy members were born, I think _
to get the Oscar voters to take your movie seriously. Look at this
year's Best Picture nominees: ``Shakespeare, Elizabeth,'' and the
movies that play on more recent nostalgia, the World War II-set
``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``The Thin Red Line'' and ``Life Is
Beautiful.'' Basically, they're all set in one of two eras.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the Oscar-nominated movies, given how square the
subjects are, try shifts of mood to expand their worlds, and
several use a contemporary energy to deal with their subjects.
``Elizabeth'' is staged with colors _ curry oranges, yellows and
greens _ that didn't seem to even exist in the country where it
takes place. ``Saving Private Ryan'' has the narrative shove of a
horror film; Steven Spielberg can't resist the showman's instinct,
even though the characters have been lifted from other World War II
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Of the pictures nominated for Best Picture, my favorite would
have to be ``Ryan,'' even though the delirious and self-conscious
charms of ``Shakespeare'' are hard to resist. But another movie
that attracted nominal Oscar attention, perhaps because it didn't
fare so well at the box office, deserves more center-stage notice
than it got. That movie is ``Out of Sight,'' Steven Soderbergh's
smart adaptation of Elmore Leonard's crime caper.
</P>
<P>
   In the Best Actor field, ``Sight's'' star, Clooney, gives the
first performance of his career that feels liberated from the TV
box. But he'll undoubtedly get other chances. Tom Hanks is
steady-handed in ``Ryan,'' and his restraint helped as much as his
top-of-the-heap reputation. (He's almost like a champion
prizefighter at this point, a male Meryl Streep who has to go out
of his way to not be nominated.) Ian McKellen's finely etched comic
suffering as director James Whale is a tribute to an actor's love
of work and filigree. Roberto Benigni seems to have been swept
along in the good will for ``Life Is Beautiful.'' And Edward
Norton's fire-eating act in ``American History X'' is the opposite
of the cool tone of the other nominees. (Though it helps that, in
re-editing the picture, he trained a spotlight on his own acting.)
</P>
<P>
   But Nick Nolte _ for his burly, heedless performance as a doomed
abuse victim in the far-too-undernoticed ``Affliction''_ deserves
the Best Actor Oscar for this and a lifetime of work. However,
another actor also gave the turn of his life this year, although in
a deeply flawed movie: I wish that Danny Glover had at least gotten
a nomination for his weary, well-meaning sufferer in the adaptation
of Toni Morrison's ``Beloved.''
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised, too, that ``Beloved'' didn't do better for the
young women who played the daughters: Christine Elise's
clear-headed Denver, and Thandie Newton's risky attempt at the
title apparition were every bit as good as performances by the
other nominees in the Best Supporting Actress category.
(''Beloved'' was set just after the Civil War, which you'd think
might have helped.) And it doesn't matter that the movie wasn't a
box-office champ, because four of the five nominated Supporting
Actress performances were movies that also were underwhelming
moneymakers: Kathy Bates in ``Primary Colors''; ``Little Voice's''
Brenda Blethyn; Rachel Griffiths for ``Hilary and Jackie''; and
Lynn Redgrave's bewildering Col. Klink impression in ``Gods and
Monsters.'' The likely winner, Judi Dench as the imperious
plot-device Queen Elizabeth in ``Shakespeare,'' offered a roaring
good time.
</P>
<P>
   Dench brings to mind a precedent. This must be the only year in
which a Supporting Actress and a Best Actress nominee both got nods
for playing the same character. Cate Blanchett got a Best Actress
berth as a Queen Elizabeth who watches the world hurtle past her.
Meryl Streep (in ``One True Thing,'' her subtlest work in a while)
and Emily Watson (in ``Hilary and Jackie,'' her most commanding
work in a while) probably have their names on the academy's short
list, their nominations just dependent on them actually being in a
movie. And Gwyneth Paltrow (''Shakespeare'') has been raring at the
bit for years, finally getting her shot.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad she wasn't nominated for her most deeply felt
performance. No, not that great ``Saturday Night Live'' bit where
she mercilessly parodied Sharon Stone's hungry posturing; I mean
for her role as the cold, tortured flirt in ``Great Expectations,''
which was so roundly imagined you expected to see her in the lobby
afterward. Fernanda Montenegro's bullish turn in ``Central
Station'' is better than the sentimentally conceived part written
for her, and were she a bigger star in North America, it's the kind
of thing she could win an Oscar for. But she's not, so she won't.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise _ and for me, disappointment _ came in the
Best Supporting Actor category. Generally, the supporting fields
are the most fun to watch, as they often reward the most blatant
picture-stealing roles. Geoffrey Rush (''Shakespeare''), Billy Bob
Thornton (''A Simple Plan''; he's said to have rewritten his part),
Ed Harris (''The Truman Show''), and Robert Duvall (his shambling,
Columbo-like cakewalk in ``A Civil Action'') do just that. And
James Coburn got the token Hey-He's-Still-Alive-And-Working
nomination for ``Affliction.'' But Bill Murray's canny control in
``Rushmore,'' perhaps the most consistent thing about the movie,
was inexplicably ignored _ a sure thing that was scratched before
the race began. We can only hope that he's got this good a role in
his future _ and that someone will come through with a winner's
speech that will be as much a sassy triumph as his would have been.

A SECOND OPINION: HANDICAPPING THE OSCARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Fashion,'' someone once wrote, ``is a despot that the wise
ridicule and obey.'' That about sums up the Oscars: Many people
believe they're ridiculous, but they watch the awards nevertheless,
and participate in the hype by making their own picks. Like these.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PICTURE and DIRECTOR
</P>
<P>
   Will win: ``Saving Private Ryan'' and Steven Spielberg
</P>
<P>
   Should win: ``Saving Private Ryan'' and Steven Spielberg
</P>
<P>
   Don't count out an upset by ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which is
likely to garner steam from all its nominations in technical
categories (it's also a far easier-to-take movie than ``Private
Ryan''). ``Shakespeare'' is terrific, but there's a difference
between good filmmaking and great filmmaking, and from D-Day
sequence to climactic battle, ``Ryan'' is one of the most
masterfully made films of the decade and the best movie of
Spielberg's career.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Nick Nolte, ``Affliction''
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Ian McKellen, ``Gods and Monsters''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Nolte's towering-yet-downtrodden portrayal of a born
loser in ``Affliction'' is the performance of his life, and the
academy is likely to honor his veteran status (and make up for his
not winning for 1991's ``Prince of Tides''). But McKellen's crafty,
brittle performance as faded director James Whale in ``Gods and
Monsters'' _ a ``Sunset Boulevard'' for the '90s _ is more subtle
and acutely observed, and was 1998's best performance, period.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Gwyneth Paltrow, ``Shakespeare in Love''
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Cate Blanchett, ``Elizabeth''
</P>
<P>
   The Screen Actors Guild Awards, which were filled with
surprises, make the acting categories more interesting than usual
this year. Among the SAG winners, Paltrow is the most likely to
repeat: Her film is better (and more popular) than those of the
other nominees, she has a Hollywood pedigree (parents Blythe Danner
and Bruce Paltrow), and her peers like her _ they really ``like''
her. Blanchett, however, dominated ``Elizabeth,'' taking Queen
Elizabeth I from giddy teen to regal queen. She also kept an overly
busy movie from falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Ed Harris, ``The Truman Show''
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Geoffrey Rush, ``Shakespeare in Love''
</P>
<P>
   This category's up for grabs: For some reason, SAG honored
Robert Duvall for playing a caricature of a lawyer in ``A Civil
Action,'' maybe because the guild was split over the excellence of
the other nominees. Academy voters will probably give this to
Harris as a way of making up for ``The Truman Show's'' not getting
a Best Picture nomination, but Rush's ribald and befuddled
theater-owner in ``Shakespeare'' is the Australian actor's most
entertaining performance to date. (Last year's best supporting
performance, Jeremy Davies' coward in ``Private Ryan,'' was
unaccountably not nominated.)
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Lynn Redgrave, ``Gods and Monsters''
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Judi Dench, ``Shakespeare in Love''
</P>
<P>
   If Oscar voters waited long enough to cast their ballots, the
disintegration of Redgrave's 32-year marriage (which happened after
the nominations were announced) will earn her the sympathy vote.
Her performance as James Whale's Hungarian housekeeper in ``Gods,''
however, verged perilously close to parody. Dench is in
``Shakespeare'' for six minutes, but you feel her presence as Queen
Elizabeth throughout _ although with the revelation that she had to
wear 5-inch heels to play against the much taller Paltrow, maybe
there should be an award for Best Actress Supporters.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER PICKS
</P>
<P>
   The two absolute locks would appear to be ``Life Is Beautiful''
for Best Foreign Film and ``Shakespeare in Love'' for best original
screenplay. Bet on Scott Frank's ``Out of Sight'' for best adapted
screenplay, although don't count out Bill Condon's script for
``Gods and Monsters'' or Scott B. Smith's sharp adaptation of his
book ``A Simple Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' will probably ride a wave of wins to
take categories such as Art Direction and Costumes; ``Saving
Private Ryan's'' wave will probably include Sound, Sound Effects
Editing, Dramatic Score, Cinematography and Film Editing. The
selections in the Best Song range from unmemorable to awful, but
Diane Warren's treacly ballad ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing'' _
file it under ``awful'' _ was the biggest hit, so it will probably
win.

MEXICO TO CHANGE ITS GUN LAWS THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico _ Locked away behind the dingy walls of a
hilltop prison here, a haggard 22-year-old Christopher Colvin looks
like a poster child for Mexican-style gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin, of Monroe, La., has lost about 30 pounds since he was
jailed here in January for crossing the border with a shotgun and a
pistol in his pick-up truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know I was breaking the law,'' said Colvin, as he
stared out from behind a metal screen.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen how life will change for Colvin and
scores of other Americans as a new and controversial Mexican law
takes effect this week.
</P>
<P>
   The law calls for fines of $800 to $1,000 instead of prison when
a foreign resident is caught with a single shotgun or low-caliber
handgun, but it stiffens the penalties for most handguns and rifles
higher than .22 caliber because they are reserved for use by the
Mexican military.
</P>
<P>
   The law strikes at the heart of a heated debate over border
relations in a region where, on the Texas side of the Rio Grande
firearms are in stock at Wal-Mart and on the Mexican side guns are
kept far from the hands of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Horacio Garza, mayor of Nuevo Laredo, said the law ``is very
strict, but is more favorable to tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison gates won't fly open for some 100 U.S. citizens held in
Mexico on weapons charges, but officials say it could promote
leniency and result in fewer foreigners landing in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface, for people who unwittingly cross to Mexico
with a gun or shell, this may mean a quick fuse for getting out,''
said Jaime Stewart, a Laredo, Texas-based attorney who specializes
in Mexican law.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have disagreed on such basic elements as the exact
date the law will take effect and how it will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   As a U.S. State Department official, who requested anonymity,
said, ``It may take months to work out exactly what this law
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous Americans, like Colvin, have said they were unaware
that possessing firearms or ammunition was illegal here and that
they never intended to break the law.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin, who speaks no Spanish, swears he can not stomach prison
food and survives on cans of tuna fish and sausage sent to him by
his family.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Laredo, Texas, located across the Rio Grande from
here, tries to warn tourists about Mexico's gun laws by passing out
warning handbills to motorists crossing the international bridge to
enter Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Transportation erected signs in several
U.S. border cities warning travelers not to bring guns into Mexico.
A bill mandating such signs is pending before the Texas
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Uriza Lara, the chief federal prosecutor here, said the law
is not retroactive but could still be considered by judges wanting
to impose light sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Among those whose family and colleagues created the greatest
stir over the situation was Tommy Bean, 60, a Vidor, Texas, car
dealer who spent more than seven months behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Bean was sentenced to five years in prison after he crossed the
border here with a handful of ammunition left in his vehicle from a
gun show, but he was released in October under a U.S.-Mexico
prisoner exchange program.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview from Vidor, Bean said his stint in prison
cost him his business, his retirement fund, and has left him
branded a felon.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was returned to the United States under the treaty, he
said he has had to report once a month to a probation officer and
can no longer dove hunt or vote.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, residents of foreign countries, including
Mexicans living in the United States, can pay a fine rather than be
sentenced to prison if they have a clean criminal record and had a
weapon singled out for leniency under the law.
</P>
<P>
   For weapons reserved for use by the military, the penalty has
increased five years for a maximum sentence of 30 years. Those
weapons include handguns above .38 caliber and long-barreled
weapons of calibers.223, 7mm and 7.62 mm; carbines of .30 caliber
or higher as well as automatic and semi-automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Because of street crime, armed insurgencies and an endless wave
of drug-cartel violence, Mexican officials have said they have no
choice but to impose strict gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mexico's stance on gun control has drawn the ire of
some Texas officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is draconian,'' said state Rep. Ron Wilson, a Houston
Democrat, who is sponsoring a bill mandating that the state erect
and maintain gun warning signs for travelers headed to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson recalled his own experience dove-hunting in Mexico in the
mid-1980s. He said he was questioned by federal police but allowed
to continue on his way after showing them a government-approved
hunting permit he had secured for use on a local ranch.
</P>
<P>
   As for Colvin, he and a friend, Jason Copes, 19, who is also in
prison here, crossed the international bridge with a 9 mm pistol, a
shotgun, and several shells lying in the bottom of a pair of
fishing waders.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin, a railroad worker, claims he realized he could not bring
a gun into Mexico when he read the warning handed out at Laredo
toll booths, but he said there was no place to turn around on the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   When he told Mexican customs officials he needed to take his
guns back to the United States, he was arrested on the spot.

YOUR E-TICKET TO OSCAR HOOPLA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Note use of italics throughout)  
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ So that inside connection didn't come through
with a pass to the exclusive post-Oscar party Sunday night? Looking
for the inside skinny on likely winners for your own Oscar pool? Or
maybe you've got a jones to play a bit with the whole notion of
celebrityhood.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which, the Internet has some solutions to fit your
starstruck needs.
</P>
<P>
   Start, of course, at the official Web site for the Academy
Awards, at www.oscar.com, where you'll find a raft of daily reports
on fashion, lots of great history and trivia, and information about
all the nominees, past and present.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar.com will also run photos of Oscar preparations, including
the rehearsals this weekend, and live, streaming video of
red-carpet arrivals. If you miss any of the winners, the site will
keep a continuously updated list of the winners, photos of them
accepting their awards and video and transcripts of their
acceptance speeches and backstage interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Several other major entertainment sites are also offering a
variety of events the day and night of the show.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Hollywood Stock Exchange and Excite are
combining to put on their own post-Oscar party at the House of
Blues in West Hollywood, featuring techno gods the Crystal Method
(from Glendale and Hollywood), the Absolut DJs' Emergency Broadcast
Network and a ``special musical guest,'' reportedly hip-hop folkie
(and Grammy winner from Los Feliz) Beck.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on getting tickets to the party (though we'll report
about the do next week), but you can still watch the proceedings
live online at the entertainment channel of www.excite.com or at
www.hsx.com/awards.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also have an Oscar-watching party online beginning at
5:30, and have been hosting an online charity auction of Hollywood
memorabilia and one-of-a-kind items made for the event. The auction
will benefit the Entertainment Industry Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The stock exchange, by the way, is a place where you can buy
``shares'' of various stars, banking on their fame as a way to
accumulate a pseudo-currency that can be cashed in for prizes and
other goodies. Bank on a few longshots before the telecast and see
if you can score a quick run-up in value.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment Asylum, the big entertainment site owned by
America Online at www.asylum.com has an entire afternoon and
evening's worth of festivities, according to CEO Monica Dodi.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, psychic Kenny Kingston of ``sweet spirit'' fame will
give his predictions of the winners. Then multiple monogamist Zsa
Zsa Gabor will weigh in with her (START ITALICS)dah-ling(END
ITALICS) take on all the arrivals during an in-studio chat.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment Asylum will be filming red-carpet arrivals, then
stocking the footage on the site for viewing whenever, Dodi said.
</P>
<P>
   And during the broadcast, Web users can send questions to the
Asylum's reporter in the backstage area, who will pose the best of
the queries to the winners when they face the press.
</P>
<P>
   After the show is over, the site's people will be hitting
several of the big parties being held mostly in West Hollywood and
Beverly Hills (though somehow I doubt they'll get into the
HSX/Excite shindig). A satellite truck will be parked at one of the
parties to ship back video that will be put online.
</P>
<P>
   E! Online is also expecting to put up a full day's worth of
programming and more at www.eonline.com/Hot/Awards.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, the online version of the E! cable television
channel will feature a couple of fun games.
</P>
<P>
   One is ``Stop Tom Hanks!'' from getting his third best actor
Oscar. Lob old tomatoes, rotten eggs and brown bananas at the
much-beloved star to keep him from getting into the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion for the ceremony. Hit other nominees like Gwyneth
Paltrow or Billy Bob Thornton and you'll be tossed off the red
carpet. Game over, man.
</P>
<P>
   The other is ``Oscar Bingo.'' The game creates a series of bingo
game boards by randomly placing a series of speech cliches. Print
them out and hand them to your partygoers. When they hear the
cliche, they cover up the square.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes a scorecard-like list of nominees that
can be printed out for Oscar pools, and insider picks for likely
winners. You can also listen in on the (START ITALICS)vox
populi(END ITALICS) with an online poll, lots of links, lists of
winners and discussion areas.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, E! Online gossip columnist Ted Casablanca
will be in an online chat area discussing the ceremony as it
unfolds. Afterward, he'll camp out at the red carpet area for the
West Hollywood party hosted by Elton John and In Style magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And for the truly catty, there'll be a place to post your
comments on people's fashion choices. The comments will be
incorporated by Joan Rivers in her post-ceremony fashion review to
be broadcast the following Saturday on E!. &QL;

 &HT;    MEDICARE REFORM STILL ALIVE - BARELY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    For release Sunday, March 21
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that the blue-ribbon commission named to chart
a course to keep Medicare financially sound into the 21st century
has failed to adopt a plan, what are the chances for reforming the
program in the next few years?
</P>
<P>
   Slim might be an optimistic assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is a clear effort by the leaders of the House and
Senate on a bipartisan basis, I think it would be difficult to move
any legislation (to reform Medicare),'' said Martin Corry, federal
affairs director for AARP, the nation's largest association of
older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds of doing Social Security (reform) in the next two
years are getting longer and longer, and the odds of doing Medicare
are longer still,'' Corry said.
</P>
<P>
   Given their narrow margins of control in both houses of Congress
and a presidential race without an incumbent in 2000, the
Republicans are likely to be cautious about pushing a reform plan
that could be portrayed as detrimental to the popular federal
health program for 39 million elderly and disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Without reform, Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund --
commonly called Part A -- will be exhausted in 2008. Just a few
years later, the first wave of the 77 million baby boomers will
become eligible for Medicare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to be this way. Here's what was supposed to
happen:
</P>
<P>
   The blue-ribbon panel of policy experts and key lawmakers was
supposed to have drafted a plan that would keep Medicare sound for
generations. The panel's recommendation was supposed to provide
enough cover for the White House and Congress to implement the
tough choices that might be required, without fear of political
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened:
</P>
<P>
   The panel was so deeply divided over policy differences that it
failed to adopt a plan. Both sides ascribed political motives.
Although the only plan considered -- a proposal by the panel's
chairman, Sen. John Breaux (D-La.) -- received 10 out of 17 votes,
it fell one vote short of the 11 required by law for it to make a
recommendation to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what's going to happen:
</P>
<P>
   Breaux will introduce his plan in the Senate Finance Committee,
which has jurisdiction over Medicare. Three of his supporters on
the panel, Sens. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), and
Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), are also Finance Committee members and said
they will support it.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's vice chairman, Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Calif.),
co-authored the plan with Breaux. Thomas is chairman of the House
Ways and Means health subcommittee, which also has Medicare
jurisdiction. He will introduce the plan in his subcommittee. The
plan also has the support of the full committee chairman, Rep. Bill
Archer (R-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   The Breaux-Thomas plan is given a fairly decent chance of
getting out of either the Finance or the Ways and Means Committee,
or both. Beyond that, its prospects are murky.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' liberal wing in Congress is uniformly skeptical
of the plan and rejoiced in its rejection by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ... proposal would destroy Medicare as we know it,'' said
Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Ways and
Means health panel. ``This plan just herds seniors into bare bones,
unattractive HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the commission had adopted the plan, getting it through
Congress would have been a steep hill to climb, said Gramm. ``I
think you would be deceiving yourself and the public to say that
it's not even steeper,'' in the wake of the panel's failure to
adopt the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Clinton, who has been loath to present
specific Medicare or Social Security legislation since his major
health reform proposal was summarily rejected in 1994, promised to
offer his own Medicare reform plan in the next month or so.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond politics -- which is a major stumbling block -- there are
deep and profound differences over what the federal government's
role should be in dealing with the health of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Should the government provide the health care coverage or should
it guarantee the coverage? That's the question.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1965, Medicare has been a government-run
health insurance program in which the government determines what
services will be covered and how much it will pay for them. In
recent years, Medicare also has covered beneficiaries who enrolled
in health maintenance organizations. This year the program is
expanding to include other forms of managed care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that the program is woefully out of date with
modern health care delivery. It doesn't cover prescription drugs,
it covers only some preventive care and it generally favors
in-patient hospital treatment over alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``And even though Medicare is inadequate in many respects, it is
also going broke,'' Breaux said. (CQ QUOTE)
</P>
<P>
   His plan -- dubbed ``premium support'' would have dramatically
changed the structure of Medicare. Instead of the government
determining coverage and paying for benefits, it would provide
people with money to purchase private insurance -- primarily
through managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Plans would compete for customers based on the services they
provided and the premiums they charged. The government would set
minimum services standards at least equal to those in the current
Medicare program. It would provide premium support by covering the
average cost of the premiums. Beneficiaries who wanted to enroll in
more costly plans would have to pay any excess over the average
cost out of their own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   People who didn't want to go into a managed care plan could
remain in the traditional fee-for-service program, which pays
doctors and hospitals directly.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worried that aggressive managed care plans would enroll
the youngest, healthiest beneficiaries, leaving the rest in the
traditional fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fee-for-service program would be treated as if it
were a competing insurance plan, critics suggested that its
premiums could be much higher than the average. That would mean
higher out-of-pocket premium costs for those in the fee-for-service
program.
</P>
<P>
   To help the poorest, Breaux's plan would have exempted
beneficiaries with incomes at or below 135 percent of the poverty
level -- about $11,000 for an elderly individual -- from paying
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   His plan also would have extended prescription coverage to the
poorest beneficiaries and given managed care companies an incentive
to provide it to others.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said it did not go far enough because it would not
have provided prescription drug benefits to all Medicare
beneficiaries, at a time when drugs are often replacing surgery as
a medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux would have merged Medicare's two trust funds -- one for
hospital costs, the other to pay doctors and related bills -- into
one fund financed through premiums and general revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of how much money his plan would save varied, but
Breaux said it would have extended the programs' financial
soundness from 2008 to at least 2013 or 2017.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Vladeck, former head of the Health Care Financing
Administration -- the agency that runs Medicare -- was one of the
commission's strongest critics of the Breaux plan.
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck argued that the small amount of savings that might be
produced through competition would not be nearly enough to offset
the fact that twice as many people will be enrolled in the system
in the next few decades. Vladeck said more money would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed using 15 percent of the projected federal
surplus -- almost $700 billion -- over the next 15 years to shore
up the Medicare program while structural changes are being made.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Clinton's plan argue that it does nothing to make
Medicare more financially sound because it merely transfers general
revenue to the Medicare trust fund while giving the impression that
it relieves the program's looming insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting surplus dollars into the Part A Trust Fund doesn't fix
Medicare's underlying program,'' Breaux said. ``I've likened it to
putting more gas in an old car -- it still runs like an old car and
doesn't have any of the features of a new car.''

   The panel's vice chairman, Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Calif.),
co-authored the plan with Breaux. Thomas is chairman of the House
Ways and Means health subcommittee, which also has Medicare
jurisdiction. He will introduce the plan in his subcommittee. The
plan also has the support of the full committee chairman, Rep. Bill
Archer (R-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   The Breaux-Thomas plan is given a fairly decent chance of
getting out of either the Finance or the Ways and Means Committee,
or both. Beyond that, its prospects are murky.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' liberal wing in Congress is uniformly skeptical
of the plan and rejoiced in its rejection by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ... proposal would destroy Medicare as we know it,'' said
Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Ways and
Means health panel. ``This plan just herds seniors into bare bones,
unattractive HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the commission had adopted the plan, getting it through
Congress would have been a steep hill to climb, said Gramm. ``I
think you would be deceiving yourself and the public to say that
it's not even steeper,'' in the wake of the panel's failure to
adopt the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Clinton, who has been loath to present
specific Medicare or Social Security legislation since his major
health reform proposal was summarily rejected in 1994, promised to
offer his own Medicare reform plan in the next month or so.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond politics -- which is a major stumbling block -- there are
deep and profound differences over what the federal government's
role should be in dealing with the health of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Should the government provide the health care coverage or should
it guarantee the coverage? That's the question.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1965, Medicare has been a government-run
health insurance program in which the government determines what
services will be covered and how much it will pay for them. In
recent years, Medicare also has covered beneficiaries who enrolled
in health maintenance organizations. This year the program is
expanding to include other forms of managed care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that the program is woefully out of date with
modern health care delivery. It doesn't cover prescription drugs,
it covers only some preventive care and it generally favors
in-patient hospital treatment over alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``And even though Medicare is inadequate in many respects, it is
also going broke,'' Breaux said. (CQ QUOTE)
</P>
<P>
   His plan -- dubbed ``premium support'' would have dramatically
changed the structure of Medicare. Instead of the government
determining coverage and paying for benefits, it would provide
people with money to purchase private insurance -- primarily
through managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Plans would compete for customers based on the services they
provided and the premiums they charged. The government would set
minimum services standards at least equal to those in the current
Medicare program. It would provide premium support by covering the
average cost of the premiums. Beneficiaries who wanted to enroll in
more costly plans would have to pay any excess over the average
cost out of their own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   People who didn't want to go into a managed care plan could
remain in the traditional fee-for-service program, which pays
doctors and hospitals directly.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worried that aggressive managed care plans would enroll
the youngest, healthiest beneficiaries, leaving the rest in the
traditional fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fee-for-service program would be treated as if it
were a competing insurance plan, critics suggested that its
premiums could be much higher than the average. That would mean
higher out-of-pocket premium costs for those in the fee-for-service
program.
</P>
<P>
   To help the poorest, Breaux's plan would have exempted
beneficiaries with incomes at or below 135 percent of the poverty
level -- about $11,000 for an elderly individual -- from paying
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   His plan also would have extended prescription coverage to the
poorest beneficiaries and given managed care companies an incentive
to provide it to others.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said it did not go far enough because it would not
have provided prescription drug benefits to all Medicare
beneficiaries, at a time when drugs are often replacing surgery as
a medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux would have merged Medicare's two trust funds -- one for
hospital costs, the other to pay doctors and related bills -- into
one fund financed through premiums and general revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of how much money his plan would save varied, but
Breaux said it would have extended the programs' financial
soundness from 2008 to at least 2013 or 2017.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Vladeck, former head of the Health Care Financing
Administration -- the agency that runs Medicare -- was one of the
commission's strongest critics of the Breaux plan.
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck argued that the small amount of savings that might be
produced through competition would not be nearly enough to offset
the fact that twice as many people will be enrolled in the system
in the next few decades. Vladeck said more money would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed using 15 percent of the projected federal
surplus -- almost $700 billion -- over the next 15 years to shore
up the Medicare program while structural changes are being made.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Clinton's plan argue that it does nothing to make
Medicare more financially sound because it merely transfers general
revenue to the Medicare trust fund while giving the impression that
it relieves the program's looming insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting surplus dollars into the Part A Trust Fund doesn't fix
Medicare's underlying program,'' Breaux said. ``I've likened it to
putting more gas in an old car -- it still runs like an old car and
doesn't have any of the features of a new car.''

   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico _ Locked away behind the dingy walls of a
hilltop prison here, a haggard 22-year-old Christopher Colvin looks
like a poster child for Mexican-style gun control.

   Colvin, of Monroe, La., has lost about 30 pounds since he was
jailed here in January for crossing the border with a shotgun and a
pistol in his pick-up truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know I was breaking the law,'' said Colvin, as he
stared out from behind a metal screen.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen how life will change for Colvin and
scores of other Americans as a new and controversial Mexican law
takes effect this week.
</P>
<P>
   The law calls for fines of $800 to $1,000 instead of prison when
a foreign resident is caught with a single shotgun or low-caliber
handgun, but it stiffens the penalties for most handguns and rifles
higher than .22 caliber because they are reserved for use by the
Mexican military.
</P>
<P>
   The law strikes at the heart of a heated debate over border
relations in a region where, on the Texas side of the Rio Grande
firearms are in stock at Wal-Mart and on the Mexican side guns are
kept far from the hands of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Horacio Garza, mayor of Nuevo Laredo, said the law ``is very
strict, but is more favorable to tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison gates won't fly open for some 100 U.S. citizens held in
Mexico on weapons charges, but officials say it could promote
leniency and result in fewer foreigners landing in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface, for people who unwittingly cross to Mexico
with a gun or shell, this may mean a quick fuse for getting out,''
said Jaime Stewart, a Laredo, Texas-based attorney who specializes
in Mexican law.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have disagreed on such basic elements as the exact
date the law will take effect and how it will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   As a U.S. State Department official, who requested anonymity,
said, ``It may take months to work out exactly what this law
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous Americans, like Colvin, have said they were unaware
that possessing firearms or ammunition was illegal here and that
they never intended to break the law.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin, who speaks no Spanish, swears he can not stomach prison
food and survives on cans of tuna fish and sausage sent to him by
his family.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Laredo, Texas, located across the Rio Grande from
here, tries to warn tourists about Mexico's gun laws by passing out
warning handbills to motorists crossing the international bridge to
enter Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Transportation erected signs in several
U.S. border cities warning travelers not to bring guns into Mexico.
A bill mandating such signs is pending before the Texas
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Uriza Lara, the chief federal prosecutor here, said the law
is not retroactive but could still be considered by judges wanting
to impose light sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Among those whose family and colleagues created the greatest
stir over the situation was Tommy Bean, 60, a Vidor, Texas, car
dealer who spent more than seven months behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Bean was sentenced to five years in prison after he crossed the
border here with a handful of ammunition left in his vehicle from a
gun show, but he was released in October under a U.S.-Mexico
prisoner exchange program.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview from Vidor, Bean said his stint in prison
cost him his business, his retirement fund, and has left him
branded a felon.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was returned to the United States under the treaty, he
said he has had to report once a month to a probation officer and
can no longer dove hunt or vote.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, residents of foreign countries, including
Mexicans living in the United States, can pay a fine rather than be
sentenced to prison if they have a clean criminal record and had a
weapon singled out for leniency under the law.
</P>
<P>
   For weapons reserved for use by the military, the penalty has
increased five years for a maximum sentence of 30 years. Those
weapons include handguns above .38 caliber and long-barreled
weapons of calibers.223, 7mm and 7.62 mm; carbines of .30 caliber
or higher as well as automatic and semi-automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Because of street crime, armed insurgencies and an endless wave
of drug-cartel violence, Mexican officials have said they have no
choice but to impose strict gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mexico's stance on gun control has drawn the ire of
some Texas officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is draconian,'' said state Rep. Ron Wilson, a Houston
Democrat, who is sponsoring a bill mandating that the state erect
and maintain gun warning signs for travelers headed to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson recalled his own experience dove-hunting in Mexico in the
mid-1980s. He said he was questioned by federal police but allowed
to continue on his way after showing them a government-approved
hunting permit he had secured for use on a local ranch.
</P>
<P>
   As for Colvin, he and a friend, Jason Copes, 19, who is also in
prison here, crossed the international bridge with a 9 mm pistol, a
shotgun, and several shells lying in the bottom of a pair of
fishing waders.
</P>
<P>
   Colvin, a railroad worker, claims he realized he could not bring
a gun into Mexico when he read the warning handed out at Laredo
toll booths, but he said there was no place to turn around on the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   When he told Mexican customs officials he needed to take his
guns back to the United States, he was arrested on the spot.

DOGS AND LOVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Choosing a dog is like falling in love.
</P>
<P>
   And whether we're swing dancing at a singles bar or playing
fetch in the park, there are certain looks and personality traits
that make the heart go pitapat.
</P>
<P>
   The characteristics that appeal to us in a dog are often the
exact ones we seek in a mate. Our choice of significant others and
dogs go paw in hand. And it is revealing about how we view both
ourselves and the world around us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, we search for another who makes us complete,'' says
Sarah Wilson, co-author of a number of dog training books,
including the classic ``Good Owners, Great Dogs.'' And what we feel
we are lacking, we seek from our significant others _ qualities
that make us whole. ``I go for smart, protective, and loyal dogs,''
Wilson says, ``and that's what I went for in my man, too!''
</P>
<P>
   If you have both a spouse and a dog right now, count all the
things they have in common (though you shouldn't necessarily share
this information with them). If you have one but not the other, let
one's personality be a guide to what you would seek in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. We love it when people look like their dogs. But
far more often, people look nothing like their dogs. ``The physical
opposite appeals to a lot of people,'' Wilson says.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of odd couples in the world _ some at the altar
(some need to be altered), some in the dog show ring. At any dog
show, the big ladies are often gathered with the tiny toy dogs, or
walking, as Wilson says, ``the nearly two-dimensional greyhounds.''
Short people just adore the giant breeds.
</P>
<P>
   We can't choose our family members, but we sure can pick 'em
when it comes to lovers and dogs.
</P>
<P>
   You love jocks? Get a retriever. Life of the party makes you
swoon? The Jack Russell terrier is your canine. You want athletic
and no-nonsense? Try a bloodhound.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, such an approach could revolutionize the way personals
are written. ``Trystless terrier _ mercurial, compact, smart,
independent, playful _ seeks big, lanky, laid-back blonde wolfhound
for walks in the park, chew-toy tussles, and occasional nips.''
</P>
<P>
   Big and chunky. Tiny and thin. Wired or calm. What we are all
seeking in another is one who can balance us.
</P>
<P>
   We have an internal checklist in the proper selection of a
companion: Are our play levels well-matched? Is she demanding?
Protective? How much does he shed? And best of all _ is this one
trainable?!
</P>
<P>
   But those checklists are different for everyone. ``What makes
one person feel complete drives another up the wall,'' Wilson
points out.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask our mothers, our friends, our dog trainers _ we don't
always choose wisely. Some people are just always getting their
fingers bitten.
</P>
<P>
   And even when we do find the right one, there are drawbacks.
Lots of women, Wilson points out, choose a dog who will make them
feel safe. Wilson says she herself fits this category. Her husband
and her dogs (German shepherds and Australian shepherds) are very
brave and protective of her. ``I pay a price for that preference,
though,'' she says, laughing, ``with occasional bouts of serious
barking. But with positive reinforcement and good socialization,
both groups are coming along nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   As in any romance, appearance counts in the chemistry or sizzle.
Ah! The ruggedness of a Rhodesian ridgeback, the glamour of an
Afghan hound, the piercing blue eyes of a Siberian husky. But in
love or dog shows, there is just no accounting for taste. We have
often experienced the old ``what on earth does she see in him?''
syndrome, whether our friends are trotting out a new beau or a
Boston terrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the eyes of love,'' Wilson says, ``anything is
beautiful.'' And we cannot see the flaws that others do in our
spouses or our dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately with any kind of love, it's what's under the skin
that lasts. ``If you're attracted just by the physical alone,''
Wilson says, ``it can be a disaster. Like a mail-order bride, that
gorgeous redheaded chow may be better in the picture than on your
couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has a friend with a Chinese crested _ a nearly hairless
breed. ``At first I thought it looked like a chicken that hasn't
been plucked properly.'' But as Wilson got to know and like the
dog, she came to love the look and feel of it.
</P>
<P>
   Our significant others and our dogs are reflections of our
aesthetic taste. ``That's why a lot of men absolutely hate it when
their wives go out and get toy dogs,'' Wilson says. It seems to
question their masculinity in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, many TV viewers were shocked when a low-slung,
heavy-set breed _ the clumber spaniel _ clobbered an Afghan hound
and took top honors at the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club dog
show. But one aficionado described her breed in the most romantic
terms. What she sees is a thick body made for hugging; the
dreamiest creamy lemon fur; and jowls that just scream sincerity.
In other words, her dreamboat.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like romance. But with dogs, Wilson says, ``it's the
idealized romance of the 18th-century poets. You know, `My love is
like a rosebud.' '' You see your dog running toward you, her hair
blazing with golden light as she gallops joyfully through the ochre
strands of tall grass. ``Your dog will never say . . . `I'm bored
with this relationship.' Or `I hate my life.' Your dog is true
love.''
</P>
<P>
   And truly, dogs do complete something in many of us. They add to
our lives in ways we don't even understand. But with dogs or
dating, we need to be adult enough to distinguish reality from
fantasy and to be happy with it. The perfect dog, as we all know,
was Lassie _ the dog who could pull Timmy from a swollen river and
do it without a lock of that collie fur out of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that perfect scene,'' Wilson says, ``took 15 takes and
four Lassies.'' The same, she says, is true of romance films. We
can't airbrush life the way Hollywood does.
</P>
<P>
   But we really don't need to. ``In a society that is always
sullying intimacy,'' Wilson says, ``dogs glorify it in a completely
innocent way.''

WHITE HOUSE TAKES ON NEW YORK CITY FOR HILLARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Saturday, President Clinton devoted his weekly national
radio address to the issue of police misconduct. On Thursday,
Acting Assistant US Attorney General Bill Lan Lee announced that
the Civil Rights Division of the US Department of Justice would
investigate ``certain patterns and practices'' of the New York City
Police Department. As it is, two US attorneys are already
conducting investigations into the NYPD's Street Crime Unit.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here? Why is the Clinton administration, which
has no jurisdiction over local police and has heretofore exhibited
zero interest in allegations of police brutality in New York City,
suddenly so attentive to possible misconduct by a handful of street
cops in the Bronx?
</P>
<P>
   The official answer is that this flurry of activity is
responsive to the shooting of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West
African man who was gunned down in a hail of 41 bullets by New York
City police officers. The real story is that Hillary Rodham
Clinton's campaign for the US Senate in New York has unofficially
commenced.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of the president's former chief strategist, Dick
Morris, if you believe all this federal interest in the Diallo case
is coincidental, ``you don't know Bill and you sure don't know
Hillary.'' This is the beginning, Morris says, ``of a carefully
orchestrated effort to use the White House to dirty the mayor so
the First Lady can defeat him for the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's concern about police brutality in New York City
conveniently overlooks reams of statistical data which show that
the NYPD is arguably the most restrained major metropolitan area
police force in the United States. And instances of New York City
police misconduct are declining. As Morris noted in his New York
Post column, ``complaints to the Civilian Complaint Review Board
are down 11 percent over the past two years, even though the size
of the police force has increased. Complaints which relate to the
use of physical force have dropped by almost a quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by almost any objective measurement, New York City cops
are among the most professional law enforcement officers in the
country. Under Giuliani's leadership, they have waged a war on
crime that has been so persistent and so successful that it has
literally turned the city around.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind about that. The point is that Hillary Clinton is
gearing up to run for the Senate seat being vacated by Daniel
Patrick Moynihan. Toward that end, she and her husband are pulling
every string to ensure that her campaign is successful.
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady's campaign is divided into two parts. Part One
might be called Operation Hillary. Working off a plan prepared for
her by former White House deputy chief of staff (and New Yorker)
Harold Ickes, Mrs. Clinton has been calling up New York State
Democratic Party leaders and entertaining a number of them at the
White House. As well, she has been burning up the phone lines to
major Democratic campaign contributors to get a realistic
assessment of her fund-raising capabilities and needs.
</P>
<P>
   As she works the various constituencies, party leaders have been
busy clearing her path. They have assured Mrs. Clinton that she
will have no primary opposition. That's a huge obstacle removed.
Another obstacle is residence. If you believe the New York
``insiders,'' Mrs. Clinton will solve that problem by moving to
Manhattan before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Part Two of Hillary's campaign deals with the biggest obstacle
in her path: Rudy Giuliani. This effort is being managed by
President Clinton and has all the resources of the federal
government behind it. In his radio address last Saturday, Clinton
announced an $87 million plan to curb police brutality. The federal
investigations into the Diallo shooting will cost at least $2
million and probably more. And this is just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, it is not hard to imagine that the Justice
Department will open an investigation into the New York City prison
system, that the EPA will ``probe'' clean air violations by the
City of New York, and that the Department of Health and Human
Services will ``uncover'' corruption in the New York City hospital
system. Indeed, it seems likely that all but a few branches of the
federal government will be enlisted in the task of destroying
Giuliani's record and reputation as Mayor. And the beauty of it is
that Clinton can commit all these resources at no expense to his
wife's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The tag-team Clinton campaign in New York allows Mrs. Clinton to
separate herself from her husband (by moving to New York) while
continuing to benefit from her marriage to him. She gets the best
of both worlds. He gets to make up to his wife for the
embarrassment he has caused her.
</P>
<P>
   Using the federal government to destroy an opponent is
unethical, of course, but the Clintons have never been especially
keen on ethics. They believe in winning, whatever the cost. Rudy
Giuliani take note.

MAN BEHIND VIAGRA FOCUSES ON OTHER MEDICAL RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE FOY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Dr. Ferid Murad could be a cult god to impotent
men everywhere, but he is content just knowing his medical advances
helped produce one of the more successful drugs in history: Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Though he remains impressed by the wild popularity and
importance of the little blue pill, Murad stressed Thursday his
findings in the field of nitric oxide have much broader
implications.
</P>
<P>
   Murad, of the University of Texas Medical School in Houston, won
the Nobel Prize last year for his part in the discovery that nitric
oxide can relax the muscles that control the body's blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   He retraced his research, which has spanned almost three
decades, for colleagues of the American Society for Clinical
Pharmacology and Therapeutics, which was meeting this week in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially (after the Nobel win), it was all about Viagra,'' he
said in an interview after his speech. ``But since then, I've tried
to point out that there are situations where people are surviving
because of nitric oxide.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, in premature intensive care units, children who
are only a couple of pounds, who usually would die, are now
surviving because they're given a nasal nitric oxide spray that
improves pulmonary hypertension and survival rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Murad also has been in the spotlight recently because of his
decision to join 66 other Nobel Prize winners in signing a letter
requesting federal funding for stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells are the recently isolated human cells that
continually divide, producing other cells that can develop into
complete bodily organs.
</P>
<P>
   The research is particularly explosive because cells currently
are gathered either from a developing embryo or from aborted
fetuses destined for disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Murad defended his support of the controversial stem cell
research Thursday, saying it has potential to treat many forms of
human disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stem cells are very important as tools in the laboratory,'' he
said. ``You can't inhibit research, but you have to use some common
sense so that you don't take it in crazy directions.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of the rapidly growing field of nitric oxide
research, Murad is excited about the possibility of producing a
host of new drugs to combat cancer, heart disease and other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at how far this has gone,'' he said. ``We knew at

a lot of opportunity lies ahead.''

   Scientists around the globe now are studying nitric oxide and
its effects. More than 20,000 articles have been published in the
field since the 1970s, Murad said.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery that nitric oxide can alter the function of other
cells represents ``an entirely new principle for signaling in
biological systems,'' the Nobel Assembly noted in granting the
prize to Murad and two other Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Murad shared the 1998 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine
with Robert Furchgott, of the State University of New York at
Brooklyn, and Louis Ignarro, a pharmacologist at the University of
California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Nitric oxide is a common gas better known as an air pollutant.
It differs from nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra, manufactured by the drug giant Pfizer, works against
male impotence by using nitric oxide to relax the smooth muscle in
the penis, thereby increasing blood flow to the organ.
</P>
<P>
   When originally discovered, the idea that any gas could regulate
key functions in cells was revolutionary, Murad said.
</P>
<P>
   Previously known signaling agents typically were complex
molecules rather than a light gas.
</P>
<P>
   Nitric oxide's properties allow it to pass through membranes
with ease, Murad said.

SEN. MOYNIHAN TO UNDERGO BACK SURGERY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said Friday
he will undergo surgery later this month aimed at alleviating lower
back pain that has worsened in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, 71, said he has a condition called spinal stenosis,
which is a narrowing of the passage that surrounds the spinal cord,
a cable of nerve tissue that runs from the base of the brain to the
lower back. The narrowing of the passage puts pressure on the
spinal cord, often causing pain in the lower back and legs.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery will be performed at Johns Hopkins University
Hospital in Baltimore on March 31 and is designed to ease pressure
on the spinal cord. Moynihan said he expects to be in the hospital
for about four days. Congress will be on a two-week recess during
that time.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said he has suffered from lower back pain
intermittently since he fell while on a Navy ship in 1946. But in
January, he added, he began experiencing more severe pain and has
had a difficult time walking. Since then Moynihan has been given
cortisone shots to help alleviate the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said his back pain had nothing to do with his decision
to retire from the Senate when his term ends in 2000. He was first
elected to the Senate in 1976 and announced his retirement last
November.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and New York Mayor Rudolph
Guiliani, a Republican, are considering running for Moynihan's
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said he has talked to Clinton about the possibility of
her running but added that he has no inkling of whether she will
decide to enter the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan is the top Democrat on the powerful Senate Finance
Committee, where he has shaped health care, tax and Social Security
policies during the 22 years he has served on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   His Senate colleagues regard him as one of the body's leading
scholars. Moynihan once taught economics, sociology and urban
studies at Harvard. He worked in the Labor Department in the John
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson administrations in the 1960s. President
Richard Nixon appointed him ambassador to India and later the
United Nations, where he also served under President Gerald Ford.

TAKING DUCHAMP TO ANOTHER LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1913, a decade before Marcel Duchamp gave up art for chess,
he took a bicycle wheel into his studio and mounted it on a stool.
He liked to watch it spin. The next year he took home a bottle
rack. In a letter to his sister, Suzanne, he said it was a
sculpture ``already made.'' For the next few years he collected
common, mass-produced objects, treated them as art and called them
readymades: a snow shovel (which he named ``In Advance of the
Broken Arm''), a urinal (``The Fountain''), a hat rack, a comb and
a dozen or so more.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of Duchamp's readymades on 20th-century art is
incalculable. Without Duchamp, would Jasper Johns have painted
flags and targets? Would Andy Warhol have made his Brillo boxes?
Would there be any Conceptual Art at all?
</P>
<P>
   Well, take a deep breath and imagine art without the readymade.
Last month, Artnews reported that Rhonda Roland Shearer, an artist,
had been trying for two years to prove that Duchamp's readymades
are not really mass-produced objects. She thinks he altered or made
them all, then cunningly covered up the evidence to create a
time-release surprise.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Shearer, this is like discovering that ``there was no
historical Jesus.'' She explains: ``You can't just say he was a
jokester and move on. What happens to the artists who took the
readymade as a sacred truth? It has meant too much to the people
who believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   This has caused a small stir among Duchamp scholars. First is
the factual question: Could she be right? Second, and perhaps more
to the point: Would it matter?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shearer has spared no expense to prove her case. She has 10
research assistants and a bank of computers working for her. She
has bought hat racks, coat racks, advertising signs, bicycle
wheels, postcards of the Mona Lisa, snow shovels, perfume bottles
and urinals as well as old catalogs advertising the above. Linda
Dalrymple Henderson, the author of ``Duchamp in Context,'' calls
her work ``all the scholarship money can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are complications even money and drive can't overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Duchamp himself admitted altering some of his readymades,
including ``Apolinaire Enameled'' (a sign for Sapolin enamel paint
whose letters Duchamp changed to honor the poet Apollinaire) and
``LHOOQ'' (a cheap reproduction of the Mona Lisa to which Duchamp
added a mustache and beard, which is now on display in the Museum
of Modern Art's exhibition, ``The Museum as Muse''). Duchamp called
these assisted or rectified readymades. Ms. Shearer is not fazed by
Duchamp's admissions. She insists his alterations always exceeded
what he claimed. For example, she thinks that before adding the
mustache and beard to the Mona Lisa, he painted in his own face.
</P>
<P>
   The assisted readymades aren't the only troublesome cases. Many
of Duchamp's readymades _ the bottle rack, bicycle wheel, snow
shovel, urinal, coat rack and hat rack _ vanished during his life.
They have been preserved only in photos of his studio, in replicas
that he sanctioned and in miniature models and photographs he
packed in his Boite-en-Valise (his museum in a suitcase, which is
also displayed in ``The Museum as Muse''). So in many cases, Ms.
Shearer is working with circumstantial evidence. She doesn't mind.
She says the absence of the original readymades supports the idea
that they never existed as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   This is Ms. Shearer's case against the readymades so far.
</P>
<P>
   Duchamp's readymade glass ampoule, which he named ``50 cc of
Paris Air,'' is larger than any that would have been readily
available to pharmacists. (And she has a tape of a man from Corning
Glass saying so.)
</P>
<P>
   The readymade perfume bottle with Man Ray's photograph of
Duchamp on it (now owned by Yves Saint Laurent) is green, she says;
the real bottles are peach-colored (like the empty but
still-fragrant one that Ms. Shearer bought for $650).
</P>
<P>
   The readymade snow shovel, which now exists only in photographs
and replicas, ``would hurt your hand'' if you tried to use it, Ms.
Shearer says, because it has a square grip. And it doesn't have the
normal reinforcements to keep it from breaking. (She has hired
people to make her a snow shovel like Duchamp's and use it until it
breaks.)
</P>
<P>
   There is more: the birdcage is too squat for a real bird, the
iron hooks in the photograph of the coat rack appear to bend in an
impossible position, the French window opens the wrong way, the
bottle rack has an asymmetrical arrangement of hooks and the urinal
is too curvaceous to have come from the Mott Iron Works, where
Duchamp said he bought it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just one case,'' Ms. Shearer says. It's one thing
after another. You start feeling like a fool for taking him at his
word,'' she says. ``Does this make him more interesting?
Absolutely. He has been dead since 1968, but it's as if he's alive
now, because we have a whole new set of objects.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Shearer explains in a two-part article in the journal Art
and Academe, it is time to stop thinking of readymades as objects
Duchamp brings home from the store and start seeing them as
``objects that he drags from the unconscious mind.'' She says that
Duchamp was influenced by the mathematician Henri Poincare's
concept of the fourth dimension and she says the readymades were
created to evoke it. She calls Duchamp's readymades
``three-dimensional shadows'' of his ``fourth-dimensional
creativity machine.'' (Don't ask.)
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Shearer has proved nothing else, she has proved an
irritant to Duchamp scholars. Although some are impressed by her
frenetic research and her extensive collection of Duchampiana, they
grumble that she is using her money (some from Paul Mellon) and
influential connections (including her husband, Stephen Jay Gould,
a Harvard professor) to get attention. (She has arranged a
symposium at Harvard University on Duchamp and Poincare, starring
herself.) They scorn her ``scientific method.'' And they are
astounded that a hobbyist can get so far. Molly Nesbit, an art
historian at Vassar College, says Ms. Shearer has introduced the
kind of ``overinterpretation'' fans tend to make.
</P>
<P>
   But why does anyone care? At this point in history, does it
matter if all the readymades were Duchamp-made?
</P>
<P>
   David Joselit, the author of ``Infinite Regress: Marcel Duchamp
1910-1941,'' says no. It doesn't matter now whether Duchamp's
readymades were mass-produced commodities or objects made to look
like commodities. The point is, ``everything is a commodity,'' and
there are some commodities we choose to call art. All of Duchamp's
readymades are assisted in some sense, he says. ``They were
transformed the minute he inscribed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics are not so blase. Ms. Henderson says it does
matter whether there was a genuine readymade, at least to start
with. ``The key issue is the first readymade, the bottle rack'' of
1914. And ``at that point Duchamp had no audience to fool by
manufacturing a fake object,'' she says. He had no motive for
deception.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have the concept of the readymade before you
challenge it,'' says Francis Naumann, the author of a forthcoming
book, ``Marcel Duchamp: The Art of Making Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction.'' After that, it matters less and less.
Once Duchamp established the idea of a readymade, he was constantly
monkeying around with it. He offered a ``shaved'' version of the
bearded Mona Lisa, and even created a ``reciprocal'' readymade:
``Use a Rembrandt as an ironing board.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, even if Duchamp intended to deceive, the readymade
``has already affected a half century of artists,'' Naumann says.
``You can't take that away.''
</P>
<P>
   The readymade proved that ``a work of art only is a work of art
if you accept it,'' Naumann says.
</P>
<P>
   The readymade proved that ``art is a set of relationships, not a
thing,'' Joselit says.
</P>
<P>
   The readymade proved that ``everything and anything can be
art,'' says Thierry de Duve, the author of ``Kant after Duchamp.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the readymade is safe and sound. But what about
Duchamp? ``My opinion of Duchamp would change if she's right,''
Naumann admits. ``It would be a grand act of deception.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Danto, the art critic for The Nation, is more blunt. ``I
guess it's possible that he made a commercial porcelain urinal and
a grooming comb. But what would I think of him if his great
contribution was as a ceramicist or a woodworker? I think it would
make him far less important.'' Of course, ``that wouldn't change
the readymade; that's part of the discourse now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if she's right,'' he adds, ``I have no interest in
Duchamp.''

PATAKI, ACTING LIKE A CANDIDATE, VISITS KEY PRIMARY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ New York Gov. George Pataki has added his
name to the long list of political luminaries who have trooped
through New Hampshire on their quest for national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the others, the Republican governor didn't specifically
say his mission is to capture a job in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But like the host of winners and losers who have historically
stumped in Manchester, from George McGovern and Richard Nixon to
Lenora B. Fulani and Pat Paulsen, Pataki allowed that he has the
credentials to lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you think about,'' said Pataki, 53, adding that
his experience as New York's governor shows he has the goods to be
a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my focus is on the positive message for my party and the
future of America,'' Pataki said Thursday during a busy night of
fund-raising, speaking and getting acquainted with GOP insiders who
could help him should he decide to run for president or vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   His key appointment for the visit, as keynote speaker at the
annual Lincoln Day Dinner of the city GOP Committee, drew 200
guests who applauded politely as the recently re-elected governor
drew from last fall's campaign speeches to recite his
accomplishments. He talked about drastically reduced welfare rolls,
safer streets, $19 billion in tax cuts, 400,000 new private-sector
jobs and a $1.8 billion budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he borrowed from addresses he delivered during a tour of
Republican gatherings in Chicago, Missouri and Florida in February,
when he had referred to Ronald Reagan as the positive force of the
20th century and how a similar leader is needed to mark the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policies of belief in freedom, belief in liberty and the
individual are right not just for the Republican Party,'' he said.
``They unite us. ... Those policies will allow us to look to 2000
... with confidence we can win those elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's visit included stops for money and publicity.
Shortly after arriving here aboard the Gulfstream of New York Mets
co-owner Fred Wilpon, Pataki joined a dozen state Republican
big-wigs who tossed $50,000 into the coffers of his political
action committee, the 21st Century Freedom PAC.
</P>
<P>
   He also booked interviews on radio and television to spread his
``positive message'' about the success of Republican governors and
conservative policies. Local broadcasts spread to parts of three
states and a taping for the CNBC cable network got the governor
about 15 minutes before a national audience.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pataki needs the exposure. Even in the politically savvy city of
Manchester, residents can't seem to place him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him. He's the mayor of New York,'' said one of the
three clerks at the Holiday Inn where the governor checked in. Two
other clerks at the front desk of the hotel said they simply didn't
know who he was. One gushed that two other would-be Republican
presidential nominees, Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes, had just
stayed the night.
</P>
<P>
   Around the New England city, it was easy to find others who
didn't know the governor. At the Merrimack Restaurant, near the
Holiday Inn, co-owner Maria Saitas said many presidential hopefuls
have stopped in for meals over the years, including Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him,'' she said of New York's governor. ``Patakus. He's
Greek. I'm Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who are quite familiar with the governor, such as the
executive board of the state GOP and other Republican loyalists,
spoke highly of the governor, who happens to be of Hungarian
descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a rising star on the national scene,'' said Stephen
Duprey, chairman of the state Republican Party, who noted that
Pataki comes from a big state with generous political donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the first one to say he's pro-choice,'' said Barbara
Russell, assistant chair of the state GOP committee, referring to
Pataki's position on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki refused to be pulled into a debate on abortion, despite
published reports in the conservative Manchester Union Leader
newspaper in which Buchanan challenged the governor to enter the
race and debate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he wanted to concentrate on the issues that unify
the Republican Party, not divide it. All the while, he steered away
from directly answering whether he would enter a primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's about a person and I certainly don't think
it's about me,'' he said. ``It's about being in a position where
the policies and ideas that I believe in, and I believe the
Republican Party believes in, will win in 2000 _ and after we win
we'll be able to govern successfully.''

SPRINGTIME TREES PUT ON A SHORT, SWEET SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 21)  
 (af)  
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had traveled in the South, but never during the time when
magnolias were blooming, so I was of a distinctly mature age when I
saw my first magnolia blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   I was living a little farther north, in the nation's capital,
and trudging off to some business, when I spotted the trees in one
of those tiny greenswards that Washingtonians call vest-pocket
parks. They are useless as parks, being crammed into the spaces
left over when streets run out of kilter and intersect at odd
angles, but some wisdom has led the city's landscapers to turn them
into little seasonal showplaces to inspire tourists and
brown-bagging civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   I had passed those trees dozens of times without giving them a
glance. They weren't very imposing and weren't, to a Midwestern eye
trained to elms, horse chestnuts and cottonwoods, all that
attractive. But on this grayish day in late March they were covered
with large dusty-pink blossoms, easily 6 inches across, like wine
goblets strewn among the skeletal branches.
</P>
<P>
   A friend from Virginia called them tulip magnolias, with a
derisive sniff. ``Not real magnolias,'' she said. ``They don't have
any scent.''
</P>
<P>
   One never misses experiences one never had, I suppose, and I was
more than willing to forgive these trees their lack of fragrance
for their ability to produce such impressive blossoms in northerly
climates. When I further identified the trees as a cultivar of
Magnolia soulangeana, a hybrid developed from crosses between more
sweetly scented species, I bought one to plant in my yard.
</P>
<P>
   As a city devoted to spring (possibly because it is unbearable
in the summer), Washington has more than the usual complement of
spring-flowering trees and shrubs. There are the famous Japanese
cherry trees, of course, surrounding the Tidal Basin in pink foam
and scattered everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   There are braces of Bradford pears nestled into square holes in
the pavement outside the entrances of scores of office buildings,
and every conceivable variety of crab apple and crape myrtle
adorning lawns from Foggy Bottom to the farthest suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Takoma Park, just outside the District of Columbia's
northwest border, calls itself Azalea City for the riotous display
that has, in some yards, entirely displaced the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is well and good, and it's worth a springtime
sojourn just to bask in the ambiance of dogwoods and redbuds and
flowering peaches and plums. But when it's over, it's over.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of May, the trees are just trees again. A dogwood
may be more attractive when it's out of bloom than, say, a
forsythia, but it's still unremittingly green.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of cherry blossoms, the brevity of the display is
the whole point. In Japan, they are a symbol of fleeting beauty and
courage, because the flowers last but a week and will open, once
bud formation is triggered by warm weather, even in the teeth of a
late-winter blizzard. Of course, in that case, their grand week
will be severely curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of transient glory applies to spring-flowering
trees in general. Barely a month passes from the time the first
cherry blossom opens to the time the last dogwood petal flutters to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, I especially admire those trees that do not
bloom in the early spring: witch hazel, for example, which displays
its yellow flowers in winter, proving itself up to the cherry
blossom's standard in courage, or golden-rain tree, which blooms in
summer with drooping clusters of yellow blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese pagoda tree blooms in late summer, with purple-tinged
flowers followed by a crop of bean-like fruits. Washington is well
endowed with this tree, sometimes called Chinese scholar tree, but
no one has thought to have a festival for it.
</P>
<P>
   I miss the catalpa trees that used to grace my front yard. Alas,
they grew old and brittle and had to be removed, but their pale
yellow flower clusters, borne upright like candelabra, were
beautiful in early summer, long after the spring blossoms were
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Summer-blooming trees tend to be less showy than spring
bloomers, because the flowers appear when the tree is already
leafed out. In most cases, you have to engage in the activity of
looking at the flowers _ they don't just come out and smack you in
the face.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are a few summer-flowering trees that manage
something close to spring-flowering theatrics. Mimosa, or silk tree
(Albizia julibrissin), is one example. It has eye-catching
plume-like pink flowers at the ends of the branches in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Those who like the looks of mimosa, but don't have the space for
a 45-foot tree, might consider instead the smoke tree (Cotinus
coggygria). It's more of a shrub than a tree, rarely getting over
15 feet in height, and has fuzzy purplish flower spikes in early
summer, like grape cotton candy.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting, too, are those blooming trees that are not of the
lawn-decoration variety. A horse chestnut (native species are
called buckeyes) would be a poor choice for the average suburban
lot, since it will reach 100 feet, but its early-summer blooms are
an impressive white with yellow blotches, borne in footlong
clusters.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a horse chestnut planted in one of Washington's
vest-pocket parks (it would have to be a large one), it was not a
park that I often walked by. If I had, I certainly would have taken
notice of it. I came late to the admiration of magnolias, but I've
loved horse chestnuts all my life.

EMOTIONAL AFTERSHOCKS: QUAKE TAKES TOLL ON COLOMBIANS' MENTAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMENIA, Colombia _ The couch in the cramped office of
psychiatrist Roberto Estefan is getting an especially heavy
workout.
</P>
<P>
   By day, Estefan treats a stream of patients suffering from panic
attacks, insomnia and depression provoked by a Jan. 25 earthquake
that devastated this city in western Colombia and killed more than
1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   At night, the patients' couch serves as the doctor's bed,
because Estefan's apartment building collapsed in the quake.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery efforts have focused on clearing the debris and
providing emergency food and shelter. But Estefan and other
psychiatrists are treating victims for the mental aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude 6 earthquake _ the worst to strike Colombia this
century _ was an emotional wringer.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three weeks after the temblor, Estefan and his team
at the mental health unit of San Juan de Dios Hospital in Armenia
treated 450 walk-in patients _ three times the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the hospital reported three suicide attempts
daily. Working door-to-door in a quake-ravaged barrio, one
psychiatrist counseled 65 people in 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever you go, people are asking for help,'' Estefan said.
``I go out for a hamburger, and most of the people who say hello
seize the moment to tell me about their insomnia and their
sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick tour of Armenia helps explain why.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the city's buildings were shattered. Thousands of
homeless and jobless have crowded into refugee camps, where
tensions run high. Virtually everyone has lost family members or
friends. In just 20 seconds, a way of life was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Religious sects have added to the turmoil by portraying the
quake as the wrath of God or a prelude to doomsday, Estefan said.
Geologists have registered 3,000 aftershocks, and people fear
another killer earthquake may be looming.
</P>
<P>
   The slightest movement ``leaves you traumatized,'' said Gerardo
Aguirre, a carpenter whose house collapsed. ``It seems like the
world is going to come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Luz Stella Toro, a lawyer who volunteered to help construct a
refugee camp called ``January 25,'' said that some people who have
jobs don't even bother going to work, because they believe they
will die soon.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake was followed by an outbreak of looting and
burglaries by refugees and roving gangs that bankrupted hundreds of
merchants and sowed panic in many neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a permanent fear of a new catastrophe _ or more
looting,'' said Diego Arbelaez, director of Ser Humano, a private
group that counsels dying patients but now focuses on earthquake
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Even medical care-givers are in mourning. Some are too busy
rebuilding homes or helping their families to report to work.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Raul Ossa, a doctor at San Juan de Dios Hospital, said his
father is upstairs in one of the wards, suffering from severe
depression after the death of his wife in the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some cracked walls, the hospital is structurally sound.
Some health workers, however, refuse to make rounds on the upper
floors, because they fear the building will collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Children are the most vulnerable, because they don't understand
what happened, Arbelaez said. Many have trouble sleeping, refuse to
go to school or won't let their parents out of their sight.

<P>
   Carlos Patino, an official with the National Federation of
Coffee Growers, said his two boys refuse to enter the family's
apartment by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any sound at night, everyone runs out to the
patio,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arbelaez said that about 200 psychiatrists and psychologists are
working in Armenia and surrounding towns. He added, however, that
2,000 are needed. Hospitals are running out of sedatives and
anti-depressants.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers have assumed part of the burden. Cuba has dispatched
a team of psychiatrists to Colombia, and the Association of
American Psychiatrists plans to lead seminars for mental health
workers in the earthquake zone.
</P>
<P>
   At the ``January 25'' shantytown, Richard Rusi, a volunteer
psychologist from Bogota, focuses on children. Because fault lines
run through the region, the youngsters may have to deal with
tremors for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   One woman told Rusi that her 4-year-old daughter no longer
speaks and began wetting her pants and sucking her thumb after the
earthquake. As a first step, Rusi told her to stop spanking the
child for such acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give them back their confidence,'' Rusi said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-year-old Joan Espinosa can barely pronounce the word
``psychologist,'' but he said that Rusi's counseling has made him
feel braver.
</P>
<P>
   At a park, workers for UNICEF and Save The Children use boiled
eggs and basketballs to demonstrate the Earth's composition. They
stage puppet shows about earthquakes to explain that it is a
natural phenomenon caused by the shifting of the Earth's plates.
</P>
<P>
   Others try to raise people's spirits in writing. A roving poet
has scrawled verses on some of the city's ruins. Banners across
Armenia's main streets provide uplifting messages, such as:
``Houses may fall, but not our dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that most people in Armenia have probably suffered
some degree of post-traumatic stress syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study on the quake's impact by the mental health
unit of Armenia's San Jose clinic, an earthquake can cause as much
psychological trauma as torture, kidnapping, rape, military combat
or grave car accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Depression and panic are normal responses. At times, Estefan
said he has been unable to contain his own sorrow and has burst out
crying.
</P>
<P>
   But if such symptoms last longer than a few months, Estefan
recommends therapy to avoid long-term problems. He fears that if
too many distraught people go untreated, the rates of crime,
alcoholism and suicide could increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prognosis is good,'' Estefan said. ``There is a huge
possibility to recover. But the earlier they come in, the better.''

PLIGHT OF WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA CALLED LACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California deserves a solid ``D'' for the
treatment of women and girls, according to a report card issued by
the Women's Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my child brought this report card home from school, he'd be
grounded,'' foundation President Patti Chang said as she, and a
panel of progressive women's advocates, made the report public
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report card, the foundation's first, evaluated how women
have progressed in five areas.
</P>
<P>
   The only decent grade, a ``B,'' went to the category of women in
politics. The education of women and girls earned a ``C''-plus.
</P>
<P>
   In the area of economic equality, the state earned a ``D.'' And
for its treatment of immigrant women and the surging number of
women and girls behind bars, California earned F's.
</P>
<P>
   This adds up to a 1.2 GPA, or a solid ``D,'' Chang said. The
report card was compiled from a wide array of statistics culled
from government documents, newspapers, scholarly works and activist
groups by the foundation, working with the Data Center of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Foundation, entering its 20th year as the oldest and
largest philanthropic organization for women in the West, issued
the report card as part of a $5 million, five-year, fund-raising
drive to resurrect the women's movement in California and provide
training in policy action.
</P>
<P>
   That would equal the amount of money the foundation has given
about 500 nonprofit groups that have helped hundreds of thousands
of women around the state over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was time to assess not only where we've come
from, but also where we need to go,'' Chang said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings contained in the report:
</P>
<P>
   _ California women work a disproportionate number of minimum-
and low-wage jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ They hold 59 percent of jobs paying $4.75 per hour, and 70
percent of those paying $5.15 per hour in a state where $12.46 per
hour is deemed the level needed for an adult with two children to
be self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   _ California women earned an average of $18,842 a year in 1997,
compared with $31,447 for men.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifteen percent of California women live at or below the
poverty line, compared with 13.7 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel Long-Scott, executive director of the Women's Economic
Agenda Project in Oakland, said the welfare cuts of 1996 may have
pushed many families off the rolls but not necessarily into jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts in welfare programs led to the ``feminization of skid
rows,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from one in five children in poverty to one in
four, nationally,'' she said.

 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the video for her hit single ``Hot Spot'' on MTV,
the rapper Foxy Brown straps on the persona of a star of
pornographic movies, appearing in a chrome bikini, then a fur
bikini _ standard costuming in adult films _ as she pumps and
postures her way through the rap, touching herself frequently, shot
from below and between the legs.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Larry Flynt, the publisher of Hustler magazine,
opened a blond-wood latte bar in December that also sells a casual
assortment of adult videos and sex toys. Hustler Hollywood is the
prototype in what Flynt says will be a national roll-out of
Gap-style newsstand sex shops _ a new one every 90 days, with next
stops in Las Vegas and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And in New York art galleries, a school of work is coalescing
that draws from the politics, graphic subject matter and
hit-and-run production values of adult entertainment. The Paul
Morris Gallery in Chelsea organized a recent show by Ken Probst of
on-set photographs of adult video productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold a ton of them to art directors and photographers,''
said Morris, whose clients include Tom Ford of Gucci; Mario
Testino, a fashion photographer, and Sam Shahid, a free-lance art
director. ``It's only a matter of time before this will show up
editorially.''
</P>
<P>
   Pornography _ by cultural consensus underground and off-limits
to the mainstream _ is breaking the surface like something that
won't stay buried, appearing at the Sundance Film Festival, on E!
Entertainment Television and in fashion magazines and A-list
movies.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-second peek released this month of the late Stanley
Kubrick's new film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' starring Hollywood's
premier power couple, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, is a
master-class version of the popular Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson
amateur pornographic home video. Cruise and Ms. Kidman, as husband
and wife, both naked, make love in front of a full-length mirror.
</P>
<P>
   This is not about ``sex sells,'' in the Madison Avenue sense. It
is not about the continuing push toward more explicit sexuality in
advertisements, movies or on network television. It is about the
appropriation of the conventions of pornography _ its stock heroes,
its story lines, its low-budget lighting and motel-room sets _ by
the mainstream entertainment industry, the fashion and fine-art
worlds and Main Street itself.
</P>
<P>
   Style front-runners love breaking a good taboo, and pornography
is a great one _ a perpetual renegade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only real outlaw left _ that's why it's hip,'' said
John Waters, the filmmaker who helped pioneer the crossover between
the adult industry and Hollywood, casting Traci Lords, a popular
pornography actress, in his 1990 film ``Cry-Baby.'' ``It's extreme
behavior that's in on the joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lords, who went on to star in mainstream movies like
``Blade'' with Wesley Snipes and to produce network television
shows, including episodes of ``Melrose Place,'' is an icon for a
younger generation of filmmakers and viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Liman, who directed the 1996 movie ``Swingers,'' drops Ms.
Lords' name, as well as that of Marilyn Chambers, another star of
the 1970s and '80s pornography world, in his new film, ``Go,''
which will open April 9. ``Go'' follows three teen-age supermarket
clerks who become involved in a drug sting and attempted murder.
They could have been extras in ``Boogie Nights,'' the
Oscar-nominated movie about the adult-film business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pornography was a key part of `Go,' more than you realize,''
said Liman, whose movie includes a lap-dancing scene in a private
party room with dancers Liman hired at the strip club in Las Vegas
where the sequence was shot; a three-person sex scene in a hotel
room, and an invitation, made over a suburban dinner, to a gay
couple to join a husband and wife in a swingers' encounter. The
scenarios are the off-the-rack titillations, and banalities, of
adult films.
</P>
<P>
   An important part of pornography's appeal to filmmakers like
Liman is its look _ a disconnected, disaffected distance between
emotional involvement and physical act that prevails in the faces
of the performers; the uncorrected color, and the bad lighting of
the environments. It is modern and bored, false and funny. It can
be scary in a forgettable way, perfect for the self-reflections of
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing it more in art in galleries,'' said Charles
Churchward, the design director of Vogue. ``More than the subject
material, young photographers are very intrigued by the lighting
and mood, the texture and color. They're trying to create a new
kind of good quality, using bad quality, and where they're getting
it from is the whole look of pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Freiser, who organized ``Naked and Famous,'' a recent
show at the Jessica Fredericks Gallery, said he thought work by
what he called a ``new crop of photographers'' like Susan Choi and
Malerie Marder, included in the exhibition, employed ``porn
strategies to emphasize what is revealed and what is not revealed''
in portraiture.
</P>
<P>
   Other photographers, like Jeff Burton, represented by the Casey
Kaplan Gallery in SoHo, have a more literal resume _ Burton's first
job was as a still photographer on adult film productions.
</P>
<P>
   The crossover into stylish magazines predicted, with some
insider's assurance, by Morris, the gallery owner, is already under
way. The spring-summer issue of Vogue Hommes, an international
magazine now on newsstands, includes a fashion shoot by Larry
Sultan staged as if on the set of a pornographic film, with couples
simulating sex on beds surrounded by men holding sound booms. The
captions detail the clothes _ the crew's, not the cast's.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, a new magazine about fashion, arts and amateur
pornography, edited by Andrew Richardson, a New York stylist,
splices photo stories on sex between presentations of clothing,
painting and poetry. It is already a must-see among fashion editors
and art directors, said David Harris, the design director of Vanity
Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the heroin-chic look similarly raised a
sensational subject to the status of a fashion trend, appearing
first on the avant-garde edge of the fashion zine scene, before
being more widely embraced. But Churchward of Vogue, for one,
doubts that pornography will be a player on the mainstream fashion
front. ``The concept isn't correct for American Vogue,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is also no lack of powerful critics, representing strong
currents in American social mores, who would object to the style
and entertainment industries' taking pornography's private imagery
public. That pornography continues to be vigorously argued about _
its critics are vociferous that it is demeaning to women and
corrosive to the lives of those involved in making it _ will keep
the bar high and may prevent it from making the leap into
fashionable venues.
</P>
<P>
   One man's hero is another's heinous neighbor, as Hollywood
learned in 1997, when a backlash against ``The People vs. Larry
Flynt,'' the docudrama directed by Milos Forman, was set in motion
by Gloria Steinhem, who disputed Flynt's depiction as a friend of
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But Liman, 32, the director of ``Go,'' who went to Brown
University, said that he thought the mainstreaming of pornography
was an inevitable sensibility for his generation. ``It's a
rebellion against '80s political correctness,'' he said. ``Porn is
incredibly politically incorrect. It wasn't even discussed in
college, wasn't even right for parody. People I know are fed up
with rules _ there are so many rules to being young. You can't have
sex, you can't drink, you can't smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled filming in Las Vegas: ``I visited a lot of strip
clubs. I was shocked at how trendy the strip clubs are, and how
mainstream, guys and girls of every socioeconomic description.
They're mobbed. They're the place to go at night. It weakens the
taboo, that you have to be pathetic to watch porn.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Kahn, 26, the director of Foxy Brown's ``Hot Spot''
video, said: ``Madonna started it all, with the `Erotica' CD and
the `Sex' book, by becoming a porn star. She made herself into one,
and kids picked up on that. There's a huge market of teen-agers who
grew up without the taboos. You're living in a post-Madonna
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Alison Maddex, a director of the Museum of Sex, an institution
devoted to exhibitions on sex in culture that is set to open in New
York at the end of the year, said that pornography may be a subject
ripe for stylish attention because it has itself become more purely
a matter of style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids think it's funny, strange,'' she said. ``It's more a pop
thing. The '70s _ porn's huge party decade _ have been a major
influence for 10 years, but it's weird music and clothing, porn as
platform shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   In February at Sundance, where the next generation of Hollywood
is born, two of the most talked-about screenings were ``American
Pimp,'' a documentary by Allen and Albert Hughes in which 30 pimps
are interviewed about ``the game'' against a soundtrack of 1970s
soul and disco music, and ``Sex: The Annabel Chong Story,'' a
documentary about the making of a film in which Ms. Chong, a gender
studies student turned pornography actress, is said to have sex
with 251 men in 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Pornography is no longer being viewed in the darkness of a dirty
theater. Someone _ a lot of someones _ has to have seen adult
entertainment in order to understand the fashionable references to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex has gone mainstream,'' said Fred Bari, an organizer of
Erotica USA, a consumer exposition with more than 100 exhibitors,
including Barnes &AMP; Noble, that is scheduled at the Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center from April 15 to 18. ``Sixty-three billion video
dollars, 23 of which is adult _ that's serious sales numbers.
People are tired of keeping it under wraps.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Adult Video News, a monthly trade publication, 686
million adult videos were rented last year. ``The American public
in general is more familiar with what's in porn and who's in porn
than ever before,'' said Mark Kerns, the features editor. ``When
they see the references in other fields, they can smile smugly and
think, `I know who that is.' The more that happens, the more
acceptable it becomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerns said that the 1998 rental figure was down slightly from
1997, which he attributed to the interest in the Internet, which
has made pornography as accessible as telephone service for those
who want it.
</P>
<P>
   Flynt, who is the adult entertainment industry's dean in the
debate over pornography's place in the mainstream, said: ``Contrary
to popular belief, the pornography industry is not as isolated as
one would think it is. HBO is using material as explicit as
anything we published in 1974, when Hustler began. Cable, video and
the Internet are creating a new culture. We're witnessing something
very profound.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Golin, the editor in chief of Maxim, a magazine for young
men, who is soon to become the editor of Details, its competitor,
said: ``There is not a day that goes by that I'm not pitched a porn
story. Porn has become just another thing that's offered
everywhere, that you can purchase as easily as books from
Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Golin has no big plans for it at his new job. But the March
``Mondo Hollywood'' issue of Details, which was viewed in the
magazine industry as an attempt to imitate Maxim under Details'
outgoing editor, Michael Caruso, is soaked to its soft core with
pornographic subjects.
</P>
<P>
   These include an interview with Julie Strain, a popular
pornography actress, and a profile of Matt Zane, who is the leading
director of ``gonzo porn,'' a new style of adult movies being
manufactured for Generation X, with the story lines and look of
music videos and indie films.
</P>
<P>
   Golin said that he thought young male readers were familiar
enough with pornography as mainstream subject to be beyond it as a
marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to be running out of shocking things,'' he said. ``I
think porn's old hat. Everyone's spent some time checking it out on
line. The sorry few who can't get a date _ let them buy a drink for
their mouse.''

PARENTS STILL UNEASY AT 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF SON'S CULT KILLING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, March 21) 
 
By RUTH RENDON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, Texas _ The sensation isn't as strong as it once was,
but this is still a bad time of year for Helen and Jim Kilroy.
</P>
<P>
   Each March, as the winter chill fades, they know that thousands
of high-school and college students are welcoming a break from
classes and heading for Texas beaches or the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, their son, Mark James Kilroy, was among those who
chose South Padre Island in South Texas as a spring break
destination. It started as a typical outing for the 21-year-old
student from the University of Texas at Austin, but it ended in
death after he was abducted off the streets of Matamoros, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a month later, his mutilated body was among 13 discovered
at a ranch outside Matamoros. The killers later were identified as
a gang of occult-obsessed drug traffickers who believed that human
sacrifices would protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Although their son's murderers have been brought to justice, the
Kilroys can't help saying a little prayer for the young people who
flock to the border at this time of year for a week of partying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as intense as it once was,'' Helen Kilroy, 54, said
from the couple's home in the Galveston County town of Santa Fe.
Still, she said, ``It's a bad occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a common sight when we see the kids going to the
Matamoros area,'' she said. ``You just wonder if everything has
been worked out or if problems still exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Before her son's disappearance, she said, Mexican and U.S. law
enforcement authorities rarely worked together. Now, she said,
young people on spring break are afforded at least some police
protection if they cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   George Gavito, a former Cameron County sheriff's lieutenant who
worked with the Kilroys in the search for their son, said things
have changed for U.S. spring breakers in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have more security and officers,'' said Gavito, who now
does security work for U.S. companies doing business in Mexico.
``They are aware of what happened 10 years ago and they keep it in
mind. For that reason, they keep a closer eye on the kids. They
kind of baby them a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kilroy disappeared March 14, 1989, while partying in
Matamoros. His mutilated body and those of 12 others were
discovered April 11, buried at Rancho Santa Elena outside
Matamoros.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities described a bloodstained shack where the bodies were
found as a ``human slaughterhouse.'' Two other victims of the same
drug ring were found at a nearby communal farm.
</P>
<P>
   The smugglers had performed human sacrifices, authorities said,
in the belief that they would provide magical protection from
police and rival drug organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the killers ended May 6 that year in a shootout
between the cult members and Mexico City police. Five drug-ring
members had spent weeks eluding police after the mutilated corpses
were found.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Maria Aldrete Villareal, 34, the cult's reputed
``godmother,'' was sentenced in May 1994 to 62 years in prison for
the ritual slayings. Four other cult members received 67-year
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Another gang member, Alvaro Dario de Leon Valdes, was sentenced
to 30 years for the slaying of gang leader Adolfo de Jesus
Constanzo.
</P>
<P>
   Constanzo reportedly had ordered de Leon to shoot him and his
bodyguard as police surrounded their Mexico City hideout.
Prosecutors said gang members agreed to kill each other if
apprehended by police, ``because their satanic religion prohibited
suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to choosing random victims, authorities said
Constanzo's gang killed and mutilated drug-trafficking rivals and
witnesses to their criminal activity. U.S. officials estimated that
Constanzo smuggled 2,000 pounds of marijuana per week into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gavito said the Kilroys' strong determination to find their son
helped in stopping the cult. He said he remembers Mark's friends
going to his office in Brownsville, Texas, to report his
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Mr. Kilroy showed up, he was there every day for the next
30 days. He wouldn't leave,'' Gavito said. ``In fact, it got to the
point that he was helping the dispatcher answer the phone. He was
at the sheriff's office early in the morning with biscuits and
coffee. It was real hard to tell him that we had other cases and we
needed to move on. I think that's what kept us all going. We kept
the heat on the Mexican authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Kilroys had not been as persistent, Gavito said, he
suspects the cultists would have continued killing for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sacrifice of Mark Kilroy helped in stopping this
cult,'' he said. ``The cult would have grown. They would have
killed probably 100 more people, if they ever were to be found out.
Since they were dealing in drugs, that means they were paying
bribes to some Mexican officials and they were protected. If it had
not been for Mark, it would have continued.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kilroys are active parishioners at Our Lady of Lourdes
Catholic Church in Hitchcock, near Santa Fe. The family observes
the anniversary of Mark's death by dedicating a Mass to him at the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Their other son, Keith, lives and works in the San Diego,
Calif., area.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Kilroys set up the Mark Kilroy Foundation to help
fight drug trafficking and help drug users kick the habit.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the seed money for the foundation came from the proceeds
of the book ``Sacrifice: The Drug Cult Murder of Mark Kilroy at
Matamoros,'' written by Jim Kilroy, 55, a chemical engineer, and
San Antonio writer Bob Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation provided money to start a residential treatment
center for men in Texas City and for women in Kemah.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also sponsors SAFE _ substance abuse free
environment _ programs in the Hitchcock and Santa Fe school
districts, said Helen Kilroy, who volunteers full time with the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's fourth annual gourmet dinner, dance and auction
drew about 700 people recently and raised $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing everything on our own,'' she said. ``Many
people in different organizations have joined together to have all
this happen. We would hate to have anyone get the impression that
we're doing it all.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those is Gavito, who befriended the Kilroys and
communicates with them weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the annual fund-raiser, the foundation raises money
through the sale of Jim Kilroy's book, which is available for
$16.08. The book, a personal account of what the family went
through in the time surrounding Mark's disappearance and the
discovery of his body, is available by contacting the foundation at
P.O. Box 777, Santa Fe, Texas 77517.

 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One car, or two? That's the kind of question that
gets thrown around the week before the Oscars, as nominees,
hotshots, never-beens and sharks zip around town, being seen and
scarfing up whatever goodies studios throw out.
</P>
<P>
   Take Brett Ratner, 28, the hotshot director of ``Rush Hour''
with Jackie Chan, billed as ``the fastest hands in the East'' and
Chris Tucker, ``the biggest mouth in the West'' (no nominations).
Ratner gathered his posse _ Chris Penn, who also appeared in ``Rush
Hour,'' and Joey Krutel, a childhood friend from Miami _ on
Thursday night to attend a party at the Atlantic restaurant. The
party was for New Line, the studio that released ``Rush Hour,'' and
it was being given by Mike DeLuca, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Juggling cell phones, Ratner first made sure that Penn would
meet him at the right house _ not his old one, but the new one high
in the Hollywood Hills with the view of the city flats below. Then
he said good night to his fiancee, Rebecca Gayheart, the actress,
as he and his boys headed out into the night.
</P>
<P>
   They decided: one car, Ratner's huge black Range Rover. On the
way, Ratner fielded a few more calls. (Someone was pitching him a
script, a cross between ``Goodfellas'' and ``Godfather II.'')
</P>
<P>
   Penn compared Ratner to a kid in the candy store who suddenly
owned the store. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because Ratner's $35 million movie, released last year, took in
$141 million at American box offices for New Line. In this
whirlwind week of parties leading up to the Academy Awards, he was
New Line's man of the hour. DeLuca greeted Ratner as effusively as
if he were in the running alongside Steven Spielberg and Roberto
Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner set up court at a rear table, and a procession began as
people came to greet him: the actresses China Chow and Tara Reid,
and a handful of movie executives. ``This is ground zero Hollywood
right here,'' said Rick Hess, the head of Phoenix Pictures, which
helped produce ``The Thin Red Line.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratner picked at spring rolls and ordered a Coke and a bottle of
water. Penn handed him a phone, to talk to Don ``The Dragon''
Wilson, a kickboxing star. ``Did you know Bruce Lee,'' Ratner
asked, then inquired whether he could beat Lee up. Talk turned to
the best Oscar parties to attend. The Vanity Fair party was the
clear choice. ``Ending the night at the Miramax party is best,''
said Ratner, because lox and hot eggs and potatoes are served.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he greeted Madonna, Marisa Tomei, Tia Carrere, Jennifer
Lopez and Farrah Fawcett. Only Ms. Tomei had ever won an Oscar
(best supporting actress in 1993 for ``My Cousin Vinny''), but
Ratner had had Ms. Fawcett's poster on his wall as a teen-ager, and
that counts for something. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Chris Rock and
Sean ``Puffy'' Combs were on hand, too, as was Hugh Hefner, in an
open-collared shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner circled the club, with a stop (quickly aborted) to try
out a few dance steps with a couple of girls. Just before midnight,
Penn said he was 34 and wanted to go home. There were meetings to
go to the next day, and more parties to attend in the week. And
Hollywood is an early-to-bed town.

LABEL GIVES A HOME TO SOUL SURVIVORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not often does one record label save an entire genre of music.
</P>
<P>
   Define? Establish? Yes. Sun and Stax down in Memphis, Chess in
Chicago, Motown in Detroit _ all formed our perception of a certain
era or a certain sound, and gave us classic performers such as
Elvis Presley, Muddy Waters, Marvin Gaye or Otis Redding.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but to most listeners, Jackson, Miss.'s Malaco Records
doesn't often get mentioned alongside these other classic labels.
Stop 10 guys wearing Stevie Ray T-shirts and ask them what Malaco
is, or who is on it, and my bet is at least eight of them won't
have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Their loss. In its 30 years _ profiled by a just-released six-CD
box, ``The Last Soul Company'' _ Malaco has released scads of
classic blues and soul recordings. Among them are King Floyd's
``Groove Me,'' Bobby ``Blue'' Bland's ``Get Your Money Where You
Spend Your Time,'' Z.Z. Hill's ``Someone Else Is Steppin' In'' and
Little Milton's ``The Blues Is Alright.''
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, Malaco actually ``saved'' soul music _ from
extinction and from itself.
</P>
<P>
   This was the early '80s, a horrible time for urban music. The
vapid flashiness of disco and its numbing thump had rendered
old-style soul of the sort Redding and Bland played all but
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Too many white listeners who had enjoyed classic '60s soul now
wrongly lumped disco and soul together, and the youth wave of
funk/disco acts swept up urban listeners.
</P>
<P>
   How, really, could a balladeer like Bland compete with the
gaudiness of a K.C. &AMP; the Sunshine Band, or the spectacle of
Parliament-Funkadelic? Simply put, he couldn't, and many '60s soul
stars found themselves dropped from major labels and/or unable to
get airplay.
</P>
<P>
   Malaco's Tommy Couch, a former University of Mississippi frat
boy and a serious music fan, stepped up. Before this, Malaco had
been a fairly successful regional label, doing soul, funk, and
old-style blues.
</P>
<P>
   From 1980 on, though, Malaco consciously gave soul singers a
home, nurtured them, promoted them. Couch saw that the deep soul
market was going untapped by major labels, and Malaco found its
niche _ initially with a journeyman Texas singer named Z.Z. Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had recorded for a number of small labels with middling
success, but when the singles ``Down Home Blues'' and ``Cheating in
the Next Room'' hit in 1981 and 1982, it reopened the floodgates
for classic-sounding soul. Malaco followed up with strong singles
and LPs by Bland, Milton, Latimore, and Denise LaSalle, and along
the way a large Southern audience rediscovered the music it had
always loved.
</P>
<P>
   Of all these artists, Dallasite Johnnie Taylor has reaped the
most benefits. A former Stax artist, he ran through the door Hill
opened and has had hit after hit ever since: His 1996 CD, ``Good
Love!,'' sold more than half a million copies and stayed atop the
blues charts for months.
</P>
<P>
   Considering his huge catalog of hits in the '60s, and his '70s
smash, ``Disco Lady,'' Taylor might have done OK if not for Malaco.
But dozens of other acts wouldn't have _ and soul itself might well
have become ghettoized into the margins of American music. Malaco
has made sure that hasn't happened, and ``The Last Soul Company''
is a fine and thoroughly enjoyable testimony to its legacy _ so
far.

JETTA IS JAZZY AND SNAZZY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Beetle might be Volkswagen's image car, but the compact
Jetta sedan is the German automaker's bread-and-butter vehicle in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   The Jetta has long been VW's best-selling North American model,
but most people don't know that it's also the best-selling European
car on this continent.
</P>
<P>
   To help boost already great sales, the Jetta got a complete
makeover for 1999. Nearly everything is new or vastly improved
enough so that this fourth-generation Jetta is more like a luxury
car than an affordable compact.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the more rounded and elegant exterior, and
continuing through an interior that seems more Audi-luxury than
Volkswagen-simple, the Jetta is the best compact vehicle VW has
ever built.
</P>
<P>
   Add the performance of the optional 2.8-liter, 174-horsepower
VR6 engine, the rigidity of the body and suspension, and the sporty
five-speed manual gearbox, and the Jetta seems to be more sports
car than small sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Prices begin at $14,845 (plus $500 transportation) for the base
GL model with 2.0- liter, 115-horsepower four-cylinder engine. Even
the base car is well-equipped, coming with air-conditioning, front
and side air bags for the front-seat occupants, premium eight-
speaker AM/FM/cassette stereo, antilock brakes, tilt and telescopic
steering wheel, heated manual-remote-control mirrors, power door
locks, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car was the midlevel GLS with the optional six-cylinder
engine, with a base price of $19,950 plus transportation. Amenities
added to the GLS include power windows and mirrors, cruise control
and a front center armrest.
</P>
<P>
   Top of the line GLX models come standard with the VR6 engine, as
well as automatic climate control, rain-sensor windshield wipers,
leather interior with wood trim, self-dimming rear-view mirror and
halogen headlights with fog lamps.
</P>
<P>
   For an extra $1,850, our test car came with a luxury package and
partial leather interior, the only options on the vehicle. Total
sticker was $22,325, including transportation, quite low for the
level of comfort and convenience features. This could very well be
the best compact-sedan bargain on the market: a near-luxury car for
less than $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the Jetta is more fun than riding in it. Sure, the back
seat is fairly roomy, and the front bucket seats are quite
comfortable, with adequate bolstering to keep driver and passenger
seated tightly during curves and turns.
</P>
<P>
   But with the speedy engine, tight steering and rigid body, the
Jetta's road handling abilities make it the embodiment of VW's
``Driver's Wanted'' advertising theme. Who says a sedan has to be
boring?
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, a 1.9-liter, 90-horsepower, four-cylinder
diesel engine will be available in the Jetta, with an EPA
fuel-economy rating of 49 miles per gallon on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the powerful six-cylinder engine in our test car, the
EPA ratings are a respectable 19 miles per gallon in the city and
26 on the highway. This is one speedy little car, but you don't
have to pay a huge penalty in fuel expense.
</P>
<P>
   My only complaint is that there is too much torque-steer in the
front wheels with the VR6 engine, a common problem in high-powered
front-wheel-drive vehicles. Torque-steer is the tendency to pull in
the direction of the drive wheel that is receiving power, rather
than going the direction the driver is trying to steer. It takes
some getting used to, especially when accelerating in curves and in
curves on rough road surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The Jetta has lots of good safety features. Besides the antilock
brakes and side air bags, it has daytime running lights,
energy-absorbing crumple zones in the body structure, three-point
safety belts for all five seating positions, a collapsible steering
column, and adjustable headrests for all seats.
</P>
<P>
   The galvanized steel body has the longest corrosion warranty in
the industry: 12 years/unlimited mileage. The basic new-car
warranty covers everything for two years or 24,000 miles, and an
extended 10-year, 100,000-mile warranty covers the powertrain.
Scheduled maintenance, including oil changes, is covered free for
the first two years or 24,000 miles, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   A four-speed automatic transmission is available for $860, but
who needs it? The Jetta is much more fun to drive with the manual
five-speed.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   At A Glance:
</P>
<P>
   1999 Volkswagen Jetta GLS VR6 sedan
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Compact, four-door, five-passenger, V-6 powered,
front-drive sedan, completely redesigned for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: With its 174-horsepower V-6, this is a speedy
compact sedan that is great fun to drive. Styling is more rounded
and aerodynamic than before, giving the car a much more elegant
look; the interior is well done, with obvious attention to detail.
And this is an affordable car that offers a lot more for the money
than many of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: Noticeable torque-steer in curves and turns.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR COMPETITORS: Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique, Pontiac Grand
Am, Oldsmobile Alero, Chevrolet Malibu, Acura Integra, Saab 9-3.
</P>
<P>
   EPA FUEL ECONOMY: 19 miles per gallon city, 26 highway.
</P>
<P>
   BASE PRICE: $19,950 plus $525 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   PRICE AS TESTED: $22,325, including transportation.
</P>
<P>

NEW VAUGHAN CDS ADD LITTLE TO HIS LEGEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine years after his death, the shadow of Stevie Ray Vaughan
still looms enormously large over the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the most recent issue of Guitar World magazine.
Kenny Wayne Shepherd, a SRV wannabe right down to the weathered
Fender Stratocaster, was named by readers as the best blues
guitarist, beating out Eric Clapton and B.B. King.
</P>
<P>
   This says far more about Vaughan than Shepherd, and what it says
is that we still hunger for Vaughan's style and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Epic Records obviously understands this: On Tuesday, Vaughan's
label is reissuing all four of the solo studio records he cut
during his lifetime. ``Texas Flood,'' ``Couldn't Stand the
Weather,'' ``Soul to Soul'' and his finest effort, ``In Step,''
arrive in stores remastered and with bonus studio and live tracks.
</P>
<P>
   A second single-disc best-of, ``The Real Deal: Greatest Hits
Vol. 2,'' also will be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is, is it worth buying all four CDs again, just
for a handful of bonus tracks and some brief comments by Vaughan on
music?
</P>
<P>
   Not in this case _ and I say that as a huge fan who used to see
Stevie in small bars in 1981 and 1982, before he signed to Epic and
released his debut, ``Texas Flood,'' in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The remastering has beefed up the sound on all four CDs at least
a little, which is nice, if not necessary for enjoyment of the
music. It's not as though the original LPs or the first CD versions
sounded bad or horribly thin; they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, 11 of the 14 bonus musical tracks are just different
versions of songs that were on the original CDs, or 1991's ``The
Sky Is Crying.'' In some cases, such as the poignant ``Life Without
You'' that concludes ``In Step,'' the live version is intense
enough to qualify as a fantastic addition to Vaughan's recorded
legacy. Another worthy _ and truly new _ addition is a funky take
on Hound Dog Taylor's ``Give Me Back My Wig,'' which is on
``Couldn't Stand the Weather.''
</P>
<P>
   But considering the paucity of truly ``new'' songs here, the
reissue series makes me believe that Epic is milking SRV's legacy
without really adding a whole lot to it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, too, that all of these reissues come after two live
CDs, ``In the Beginning'' (poor) and ``Live at Carnegie Hall''
(good), both of which featured songs not on Vaughan's studio
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   It seems, by now, that Epic is simply parceling out piecemeal
the Vaughan stuff it has in the can, in dribs and drabs, with
little rhyme or reason. If we're going to add ``new'' songs to his
CDs, they should be previously unreleased stuff like ``Wig'' _ and
``Slip Slidin' Slim,'' which is on ``Soul to Soul.'' Another option
would be a two-CD set of live jams with guys like Albert King and
Jeff Beck, which are readily available on bootlegs. What fan
wouldn't love to have that stuff?
</P>
<P>
   Also problematic is the 16-cut ``Deal.'' The songs are fairly
well-chosen, but it's a mystery why there is only one tune _
``Telephone Song'' _ from 1990's ``Family Style,'' Stevie's
collaboration with older brother Jimmie. I guess this just sets us
up for the inevitable third best-of, although at this point it's
hard to imagine what will go on it. I'm sure Epic will find, well,
something.
</P>
<P>
   What would have been nice, in the first few years after
Vaughan's death, would have been a truly complete boxed set, or
perhaps a three-CD set of previously unreleased material such as
``Wig'' and Freddie King's ``Hide Away.'' It's far too late for
that, though, even though Vaughan clearly deserves the same sort of
multidisc treatment paid to artists like Clapton and King.
</P>
<P>
   And considering that Vaughan didn't put out nearly as much
material as either of those artists have, a comprehensive box would
have been far easier to assemble. Ideally, it would have had all
the good stuff, plus some unreleased tracks.
</P>
<P>
   But whether one buys the reissues and/or ``Deal,'' or not, I
would avoid ``Sugar Coated Love,'' a CD with Lou Ann Barton singing
lead and, we're told, Stevie on 10 of the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Cut in 1977 in Austin and released in January, ``Love'' delivers
far less than the sort of white-hot Barton-plus-Vaughan summit
meeting it hints at. The sound is horrible, the recording
information is scant and Vaughan's guitar work isn't unusual enough
to make it stand out. He was, at this point, a sideman, playing
standard blues-band songs.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a true obsessive and just have to have every SRV lick
you can lay your hands on, fine; ``Sugar Coated Love'' is for you.
For anyone else, it's a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong; the Epic reissue program definitely has the
potential to do some good in the blues world. Vaughan inspired
absolute reverence in people, and rightly so. He remains one of THE
great bluesmen, alongside Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, and all
three Kings (B.B., Albert and Freddie).
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, these reissues may bring some new fans into the
fold _ most likely young kids who are just now discovering the
blues and Vaughan's legacy. And there's nothing wrong with that _
Stevie certainly deserves it.

   Fifty years ago, the dream of every cautious young American was
to work for a giant corporation. Better pay, more perks, automatic
advancement, and lifetime security were the entitlements associated
with a really good job: working for the telephone company, for
example, the local electric utility, or a Fortune 500 firm.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years, however, we in newspapers have pounded out a
constant stream of stories about takeovers, mergers, spin-offs,
downsizings, lay-offs, and plant closings. Things have changed, we
have warned in our Sunday editions, citing a variety of
authorities: Giant corporations are in the soup. They cannot be
counted on as stable sources of rising living standards or even
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Now a leading economist has written a concise and authoritative
survey of the economic forces that transformed corporations from
fat and happy institutions into the lean and mean competitors that
they are today.
</P>
<P>
   In ``New World, New Rules'' (Harvard Business School Press,
$29.95) Marina v.N. Whitman says that virtually every aspect of the
``implicit contract'' that once existed between corporations and
their various constituencies has been rewritten by a whirlwind of
economic change.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, she says, is that the forces of globalization,
deregulation, and technological advance have enhanced the dynamism
of the US economy. The bad news is that the same forces ``have torn
many people loose from their traditional mooring of economic
security and widened the income gap between the most succesful and
the least.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't come much more blue-chip these days than the
63-year-old Whitman. She was a member of the President's Council of
Economic Advisers under Richard Nixon. She is a former vice
president and chief economist of General Motors. She teaches at the
University of Michigan and is a director of Chase Manhattan,
Procter &AMP; Gamble, Alcoa, Browning-Ferris Industries, and Unocal.
</P>
<P>
   And the v.N.? It stands for von Neumann. Her father, John von
Neumann, was among the giants of 20th-century social science _ an
architect of the computer, strategic thinker par excellence. As a
child growing up on the leafy campus of the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton, N.J., she bicycled in the footsteps of Albert
Einstein, Kurt Godel, and Felix Gilbert _ before heading off to
Radcliffe College and a Columbia University PhD in economics.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mixture of slowdown, volatility, and sharpened global
competition that forced change upon large US corporations, starting
in the early 1970s, Whitman writes. They didn't want to undergo the
metamorphosis; they would have preferred to remain as they were,
``confident engines of growth and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the breakdown of the system of fixed exchange
rates in 1973, followed by the oil shocks, growth slowed in the
industrial nations. The poorer nations, especially in Asia, began
catching up and invading US markets. Alarmed by stagnant incomes
and a drop in long-term productivity, legislators in the United
States especially embraced deregulation as a means to restart the
economic engine.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a sharp diminution in the bonds of trust between
employers and the employed. ``Employment relationships once assumed
to embody a lifetime commitment are more likely to be regarded
today as contingent and probably temporary,'' Whitman writes.
``Loyalty has been redefined to mean mutual respect and support
only for as long as the relationship lasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Accelerating the change was the rise of investor capitalism.
Managerial autonomy long had been touted as the hallmark of the
modern age, but a host of financial innovations in the 1980s _
notably the high-yield instruments known as junk bonds _ created a
``market for corporate control.'' And that meant that boards were
no longer free to pursue diverse goals in defiance of narrow
economic logic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the increasing tendency of US, Japanese, and European
firms to invest directly in plants and whole companies in each
others' home markets gradually blurred the distinction between
``foreign'' and ``domestic'' and spared much protectionist conflict
in the 1980s and 1990s, but only at the cost of heightening
competition among firms, says Whitman. No more ``us'' and ``them;''
instead a struggle of each against all.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as Wall Street was reining in on corporations,
government was assigning new roles to them, Whitman notes, making
them watchdogs of consumer and workplace safety and equal
opportunity. Companies skinned back from other responsibilities
they previously had shouldered, in managing pension and health care
benefits. Corporate philanthropy has undergone a historic change,
becoming narrower and less dependable. Cross subsidies of all sorts
are out of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the downsizing of corporations' role in modern
society has impoverished nearly everyone, Whitman writes. One
result of the increased pressure has been a search for scapegoats.
Another, she expects, will be a search for substitute sources of
security _ including perhaps an expanded welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   The one place Whitman doesn't look for an answer is in a
restoration to a central place of corporations themselves. ``It is
not just impossible to resore the comfortable oligopolies that
characterized the United States of the 1950s and 1960s. A few
moments' thought reveals why it is undesirable as well.'' Why
exactly? The experience of Japan, she says, is enough to show how
lifetime employment and other paternalistic practices can put a
nation in a bad way.
</P>
<P>
   I dunno. Readers will have noticed that we in newspapers have
begun to hold out the hint _ the barest whisper _ that an age of
wealth-creating oligopolies might come again. One industry after
another seems headed for the kind of concentration and market power
that characterized the age of ``the good corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is probably true that orderly markets may never again afford
the swift elevator to wealth that they provided at the turn of the
20th century, or the completely unself-conscious ride to riches of
the 25 years after World War II. But the 1950s look pretty good
from here.

E! ESCALATES OSCARS FRENZY, DESPITE BEING LEFT OFF THE GUEST LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the front-running purveyor of televised Oscars hype, ``E!''
may be a victim of its own overachieving success.
</P>
<P>
   The cable channel built a sizable following for its frenetic
red-carpet coverage of Oscars attendees stepping from limos into a
blaze of flashbulbs and shrieking fans. That apparently gave the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences the bright idea to
throw its own grab-and-gab pre-show party _ and leave E! off the
guest list.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1994, the Rivers tag team, mom Joan and
daughter Melissa, will be shut out, at least for live reports
during the key half-hour leading up to the start of the Academy
Awards telecast.
</P>
<P>
   No other media outlet can broadcast interviews or supply live
footage during the actual Oscars broadcast. And now the academy and
ABC have tacked a 30-minute pre-show onto the official coverage,
called it ``Sunday at the Oscars'' and hired actress Geena Davis to
host it.
</P>
<P>
   Cautious not to bite the hand that allows some feeding at the
academy table, ``E!'' is making low-key public responses to the
obvious freeze-out. Says John Rieber, ``E!'' vice president of
programming and the pre-show executive producer credited with
coming up with the red carpet idea: ``We'll abide by all their
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``E!'' couldn't possibly be happy with the new arrangement,
which basically muscles it out of the celebrity-seeking loop at a
crucial time. Last year's pre-show was the channel's highest-rated
program.
</P>
<P>
   To counter, ``E!'' is planning an 11-hour Oscars frenzy: eight
before the telecast and three after the ceremony. Its coverage will
consist mainly of interviews, party reports and Joan Rivers dissing
celebrity attire, acceptance speeches and general Oscars etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will still do more (Oscars coverage) than anyone else,''
Rieber said. ``And Joan is the queen of the pre-show. The
celebrities know this. The viewers know this. Everyone wants to
talk to her, and that certainly won't change.''
</P>
<P>
   For all her criticism for being unprepared _ each year she gets
the nominations confused, leaving celebs looking baffled but making
for great comedic TV _ Joan Rivers has amassed quite a following.
That's thanks in part to her shoot-off-at-the-mouth humor, and the
way she yells ``Whaddya wearing?'' to celebs eager to promote their
designers and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   She's usually planted on the red carpet, flagging down attendees
as Melissa moves about elsewhere, giving Oscars facts and analysis
alongside ``expert'' Todd Newton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still very much in the game, a game we invented and have
perfected,'' Rieber said. ``It'll still be great because, while
there is more Oscar coverage out there, the question is, what will
you miss if you're not watching us?''
</P>
<P>
   What a shrewdly designed dig at ``Sunday at the Oscars,'' which,
from the looks of it, probably won't compare to the funky looseness
of ``E!'s'' gushy reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's half-hour is expected to include red-carpet arrival
coverage as well as something ``E!'' has never been allowed to do:
take cameras inside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, stake out the
lobby, go backstage, and check the pulse inside the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Gil Gates, at the helm of the awards show for the ninth
consecutive year, insists that they've watched enough pre-shows to
know what they want _ and don't want. Host Davis made that clear
during an interview, proclaiming, ``You certainly won't hear me
yelling to someone, `Who made your dress!?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gates gushes about the Oscars being ``an all-consuming event,''
but is this a good thing? In a society in which celebrity worship
seems to deepen with each generation, the Oscars easily rival the
Super Bowl in terms of empty media hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly now that more channels need to fill air time. CNN,
MSNBC, Fox News, Turner, AMC, Bravo and local news stations
handicap the Oscars race with specials and expanded coverage
leading up to the broadcast. Even Davis says, ``It's enough to make
you reassess your priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because much of it merely adds to the clutter _ like
Roseanne's ``Elizabeth'' fashion show and makeover on her talk
show. (Although those sick of Barbara Walters' pre-Oscars
interviews should check out Comedy Central's ``The Beth Littleford
Interview Special,'' a satire of Walters, during which Minnesota
Gov. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura shows Beth his favorite assault
weapons.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the question is which came first _ the demand for this
kind of coverage or the coverage that created the demand?
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, a lot of Oscar preview shows bore me to tears,'' said
Gary Cogill, film critic for WFAA/Channel 8 in Dallas-Fort Wort. He
tried to spice up his own preview show with an in-depth (for TV)
interview with Steven Spielberg and an interesting segment on how
Texas and Texans have been portrayed by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've overreacted to the Oscars, and the end result is
what you're seeing now in some of these shows. I find (Joan and
Melissa Rivers) insulting. I know people watch, but they're
abrasive and annoying in what they report and how they report it.
I'm more interested in the why and how. And audiences deserve that.
We can't continue to dumb down everything, even when it comes to
film.''
</P>
<P>
   Rieber agrees _ to a point. ``It's certainly become a massive
media event,'' he says. ``But every year we wonder if it's too
much, and every year it comes upon us and we get excited. I mean,
here it is. Can't you feel the excitement?''

LEADERSHIP DILEMMAS IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 21, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What separates real leaders from pretend leaders is the ability
to take the crowd where it doesn't want to go.
</P>
<P>
   And by pure coincidence, three New England governors are caught
in the jaws of political dilemmas of their own making at the same
time, with their reputations for leadership at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Gov. John Rowland enjoyed a wave of popular support
when his long months of backstage negotiations with the New England
Patriots football club paid off with the announcement the NFL
franchise would flee Massachusetts for the $374 million pot of gold
promised by Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   But now the deal is on shaky ground. Taxpayers resentful of the
giveaway, the most famous of whom is Ralph Nader, a scathing critic
of the Patriots' land-and-cash grab, are rising in anger. Rowland's
erector-set configuration of public and private financing is
tottering, because the gas company that owns the current stadium
site is demanding more money to move than Rowland's scheme
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Gov. Jeanne Shaheen still enjoys a 68 percent
poll approval rating, but her leadership is questioned by the
complicated snarl over what taxes must be raised to comply with
state Supreme Court rulings about how public schools are to be
funded. Pink slips have gone out to some Granite State teachers, as
the state's governmental machinery clanks and groans and stalls and
staggers..
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen won't sign the income tax the Republican-controlled
House approved. She proposed a new statewide property tax, a
business tax, a video slot machine tax, and higher booze and
cigarette taxes. The state Senate wrestled with the unpalatable
options, which carry a $1 billion pricetag, as the state confronts
an April 1 court deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen's political dilemma: she was elected twice vowing to
veto any statewide broadbased tax on income, sales or property.
She's caved on property, is apparently willing to cave on sales,
but refuses to budge on the income tax _ the one tax approved by
the House.
</P>
<P>
   The third politician grappling with a problem of his own making
is Gov. Paul Cellucci. Apparently convinced by in-house polling
data that his popularity rests on a tough-guy image, Cellucci has
been rattling off a series of crack-down-on-crime measures that
garner him a sliver of soundbite on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   But now it's time to stand and deliver for Cellucci, who used to
oppose the death penalty, but now promotes capital punishment as
the key to his crime containment program. Monday, the friends and
foes of capital punishment will flock to the State House for what
promises to be a long, contentious and bitter hearing on the pros
and cons, with life and death at stake for the prosecutorial pros
who want to slay the convicted cons.
</P>
<P>
   Last time around the House voted down the death penalty by one
vote, and Cellucci made a big deal of this in his campaign. This
time, the vote is still close. But Speaker Tom Finneran is against
it, and Cardinal Bernard Law's opposition is regarded as
significant, and possibly pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci tried a bit of political legerdemain, appointing a
handful of legislators to higher-paid posts in his administration,
and hoping to replace them with pro-death-penalty sympathizers.
Cellucci has demanded that the Legislature hold off voting on this
year's death penalty bill until, presumably, at least some new
death penalty advocates get elected.
</P>
<P>
   But those who follow the issue closely suggest that the
opposition is well-organized and that recent revelations of
misconduct by police, prosecutors or the justice system in a number
of states reinforce doubts about whether wrongly accused convicted
murderers can be unfairly executed.
</P>
<P>
   What political problem do all three governors confront?
</P>
<P>
   In each case, it was the governor's own initiative that has
resulted in a divided electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland sought a big splashy pro sports deal to be the capstone
on an expensive urban renewal program for Hartford, his ailing
capital city. But Rowland gave away so much money to Bob Kraft, the
clever Patriots owner, that there is not enough left on the table
to pay off the gas company that just happens to own the land where
the stadium will sit. How does Rowland successfully defend the
concept of enriching out-of-state owner Kraft, and stiffing the
local gas utility?
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen painted herself in a corner with the famous antitax
``pledge'' extorted from gubernatorial candidates in New Hampshire
for decades. She seems willing to ride with her decision to buck
the income tax, and play around with all the other pieces on the
tax chessboard. But she has not bowled over anyone with her
leadership as the state vacillates.
</P>
<P>
   She may yet win a Senate seat in 2002, and she may be a dark
horse for vice president, if the Democrats nominate Vice President
Gore, whose New Hampshire operation is run by Shaheen's husband.
Like Rowland, who is mentioned for consideration as a Republican
vice presidential option, she has to make a reputation as a bold
and innovative leader. That has not yet happened in the tax debate,
nor the stadium tussle.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is not mentioned by anyone as a vice presidential
contender, but he is undeniably close to Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
and could conceivably land some kind of federal job in a Bush
regime. Just having been elected as a Republican in a Democratic
state is a calling card in national GOP circles.
</P>
<P>
   But if he can't deliver the death penalty this time around,
fresh off an election victory, on an issue of his own choosing, at
a time of benign economic conditions, over what is most likely the
most favorable political terrain he'll enjoy in the forseeable
future, then he loses stature.
</P>
<P>
   This much can be said of Rowland, Shaheen and Cellucci in their
current struggles: they made their own beds, on issues of their own
choosing, and now they have to figure out how to persuade
majorities of their legislatures to swallow some tough votes. How
they handle that will determine what people think of them. We
measure our leaders by how they handle the tough ones.

FROM CELEBRITIES TO ZIONISTS, CABALA AN ENDLESS SOURCE OF SOLACE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For centuries the study of the cabala, the Jewish mystical
tradition, could be undertaken only by married men over 40 who had
mastered other aspects of Jewish law and learning. If anybody else
delved into this esoteric lore with its arcane symbols and
doctrines, the promised result was insanity.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know otherwise. Roseanne Barr, who has studied Jewish
mysticism, has suggested that cabala cures insanity: ``Before
cabala I had no friends and everyone thought I was crazy.'' Other
celebrities, from Elizabeth Taylor to Sandra Bernhard, have agreed.
``You absolutely are the master of your destiny,'' Madonna
proclaimed on MTV about the lessons of cabala. ``You have to take
responsibility for your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabala, which in Hebrew means ``that which is received,'' is a
complex body of texts and ideas, some of which are over 1,500 years
old, along with oral teachings. Cabalistic writings, most of which
have not been translated into English, with their allusions to
chariots, angels, alphabets, biblical figures and golems, were long
considered the most advanced and most difficult of Jewish texts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what is widely called cabala today, however, is packaged
in New Age best sellers that promise an almost magical ability to
heal the sick and enlighten the bewildered. Devotees don't actually
have to know very much. The celebrity cabalists, for example, are
encouraged to carry around a volume of the great mystical text from
the 13th century, the Zohar, and run their fingers over the Hebrew
letters to find illumination, even if they don't understand a word.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the tradition of serious study of Jewish mysticism
continues to thrive in religious communities. But it may be that
the most powerful movement in Jewish mysticism in the last 50 years
has not been the study of cabala but the study of the study of
cabala _ not mystical practice but mystical scholarship. It has
become an established academic discipline.
</P>
<P>
   This scholarly enterprise was established almost single-handedly
by the German-born historian Gershom Scholem (1897-1982) in his
classic 1941 study, ``Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism.'' He
discovered and interpreted ``lost'' mystical texts, overcame the
rationalist scorn that once clouded cabala and argued that
mysticism was at the center of Jewish history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a second and third generation of scholars in the
field, Scholem's powerful vision is itself being challenged, most
forcefully by a former student of Scholem, Moshe Idel, professor of
Jewish thought at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In a major new book, ``Messianic Mystics'' (Yale University
Press), Idel expands a project he began more than a decade ago,
questioning his mentor's views on almost every major issue. The
arguments are complex, but they have important implications for
understanding Jewish history and popular religious belief.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of messianism is central to these disagreements. For
Scholem, the cabala after the 13th century developed a new system
for making sense of the trials and exiles that scar Jewish history.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the human body was created in God's image, these mystics
believed, so every human act had its counterpart in the divine
realm; earthly history was but a reflection of the history of the
Godhead; both realms were riven by alienation and exile.
</P>
<P>
   A cabalist, by properly performing ritual, could begin to heal
not just the mundane universe but the spiritual one as well. This
mythology, a version of which is incorporated into contemporary pop
cabala, made Jewish history and personal experience part of a grand
theological drama of exile and restoration.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens, Scholem asks, if a savior, a Messiah, promises
to complete this process of repair and reparation, bringing the
drama to an end? Scholem argued that such a figure would be
revolutionary, not evolutionary. A Messiah would shatter the
tradition (as indeed, the figure of Jesus did when his disciples
founded Christianity). Scholem called messianism a ``theory of
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   In a magisterial essay, ``Redemption Through Sin,'' Scholem
described such a catastrophe in the 17th century, when a mentally
unbalanced man, Sabbatai Zevi, declared himself the Messiah.
Sabbatai engaged in bizarre and provocative acts, even instituting
a new blessing praising ``that which is forbidden.''
</P>
<P>
   A devoted cabalist became his ``prophet,'' interpreting his
deliberate violations of Jewish law this way: Sabbatai was seeking
sparks of divinity deeply hidden even in what was most forbidden;
he had to free those sparks from their polluting ``husks'' and
restore them to their divine origins. His acts of sin were acts of
redemption.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Scholem argues that Sabbateanism became a popular movement,
sanctifying sin (the novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer devoted his
first novel to this phenomenon, ``Satan in Goray''). The Turkish
sultan, nervous about the upheaval among the Jews, forced Sabbatai
to convert to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Even that shock did not immediately invalidate his claims for
devout believers; it too was a ``descent'' that would lead to
salvation. But eventually, Scholem suggests, it caused a widespread
crisis that undermined the foundation of Jewish faith. Only the
spirit of national and spiritual yearning remained, a yearning that
led to the Enlightenment and eventually to Zionism.
</P>
<P>
   Scholem's narrative has been extraordinarily influential, subtly
knitting together obscure mystical texts, social history and a
theory of religious interpretation. Nearly every scholar of Jewish
mysticism has worked in its shadow.
</P>
<P>
   But Idel, in a 1988 collection of papers, ``Kabbalah: New
Perspectives'' (Yale University Press) began a more earnest
rebellion. Its ambition was first noted in a highly critical review
of Idel's work in Commentary by Robert Alter, the biblical and
literary scholar; he argued that Idel's project made exaggerated
claims for itself while aggressively distorting Scholem's views.
But Alter's was a dissenting voice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with this book on messianism, the polemical ambition
becomes more explicit. Idel, who was born in Romania and moved to
Israel when he was 16, argues that nearly everything about
Scholem's interpretation of mysticism, from his emphasis on the
exile of the Jews to his focus on textual interpretation rather
than ecstatic experience, was a reflection of his intellectual
origins in German Romanticism.
</P>
<P>
   Scholem, who moved to Palestine from Germany in the 1920s when
Zionism was winning support among European Jewish intellectuals,
interpreted Jewish mysticism to suit Zionist ideology. He molded
the history of Jewish mysticism into a story about national and
spiritual evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Idel differs with Scholem on some scholarly conclusions, but the
most obvious differences are conceptual. There is, in Idel's view,
no clear-cut evolutionary development in mysticism or history.
There is not even a strong connection between mysticism and
history.
</P>
<P>
   Scholem sees messianism as dangerous and catastrophic; Idel sees
it as a part of ordinary mystical expectations. Scholem says the
sense of exile was central to much cabalistic thought; Idel,
rejecting traditional views of Jewish history, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   Scholem stresses the importance of ideas; Idel emphasizes the
nature of experience and the mystic's drive toward union with God.
Idel values variety and diversity over unity and coherence. (He
even wonders if he is being too post-modern.)
</P>
<P>
   Given the range of Idel's knowledge and the intricacy of the
arguments, his proposals will have to be evaluated by other
scholars. But the power of Scholem's vision is likely to endure,
even if Idel succeeds in upending some of its conclusions, simply
because Scholem helped explain how mystical ideas had power in the
world outside the mystic's study, enough power to stir popular
passions and belief (as they have in contemporary pop cabala).
</P>
<P>
   Scholem insisted that, in one cabalist's words, ``where you
stand, there stand all the worlds'': that the various realms of
human belief and action are inseparable, that there is no
separating the mystic from his surroundings. This is what made
mysticism dangerous, as well.
</P>
<P>
   In observing Israeli politics in the 1960s and '70s, for
example, Scholem objected to mixing messianism with politics,
arguing that utopian hopes can be catastrophic when brought into
the mundane world. At the same time, he suggested, this yearning
could never be eliminated. This tension was often at the heart of
Scholem's interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   Cabala tapped into human drives for historical redemption and
personal salvation, which is why cabalists were concerned that
their devotees lead a mature, settled life; the unleashed passions
might otherwise be seriously disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the contemporary universe of entertainment celebrities,
with its ceaselessly shifting personas and insatiable yearnings for
attention, could cabala be considered otherwise: a force for cozy
self-satisfaction.

 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When a new production at the Metropolitan Opera
returns a few seasons after its premiere, the company
understandably cannot commit the same amount of rehearsal to it as
when it was new. This probably explains why the performance of
Tchaikovsky's ``Queen of Spades'' on Thursday night, the first of
the season, lacked some of the dramatic flow and vivid detail that
characterized this Elijah Moshinsky production when it was unveiled
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this remains a powerful realization of Tchaikovsky's
greatest opera. The orchestra under Valery Gergiev played with
resonant sound and taut dramatic impact. In singing Ghermann, the
tireless Placido Domingo added yet another to the 100-plus list of
roles he has performed during his career.
</P>
<P>
   The opera has faced some criticism for the liberties the
libretto takes with the Pushkin novella on which it is based. The
story centers on Ghermann, an army engineer, who becomes obsessed
with wresting from a decrepit countess, known as the Queen of
Spades, her secret to success at cards. Pushkin's Ghermann courts
the countess' ward, Lisa, as a means to that end. Tchaikovsky's
Ghermann is as obsessed with Lisa, in this version the countess'
granddaughter, as he is with gambling. The opera also has been
criticized by some for the amount of musical pastiche it contains,
including an entire pastoral drama in Mozartian style.
</P>
<P>
   But this production vindicates Tchaikovsky's dramatic choices
and psychologically insightful music. Surreal elements lurk behind
the facade of the setting: St. Petersburg at the end of the 18th
century. Mark Thompson's costumes, in shades of black and white
with oversized powdered wigs, are evocative yet eerie.
</P>
<P>
   The set, also by Thompson, is a picture-framed gray tunnel with
sliding side panels. With the addition of props _ cream-white
columns, gold doors, lace curtains _ it can be transformed into a
palace ballroom, a music salon or whatever. But during Ghermann's
lone wolf scenes, the space is grim, like some dank underpass to
I-95.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The role of Ghermann, which Domingo aptly calls the Russian
Otello, is his first in that language, not counting some roles from
Russian operas he sang in Hebrew during his journeyman days with
the Israeli Opera. He worked on his Russian diction with
Ghermann-like obsessiveness, and it has paid off. Though
mature-looking for Ghermann, he hurls himself into the part with an
intensity that is ageless and sings with a power that seems almost
dangerous. Yet, the plaintiveness in his lyrical phrases gives this
pathetic character an affecting depth.
</P>
<P>
   The Kirov Opera soprano Galina Gorchakova sang with stylistic
authority, vulnerability and, at times, gleaming sound, though her
voice was marred by wobbly pitch and stridency. The noble-hearted
Prince Yeletsky, Lisa's suitor, is essentially a one-aria role. But
what an aria, and the dashing, dusky-voiced Russian baritone Dmitri
Hvorostovsky sang it magnificently. The superb mezzo-soprano Olga
Borodina made another smaller role, Lisa's friend Pauline, loom
large. The tenor Vassily Gerello was a suitably wily Tomsky.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary soprano Elisabeth Soderstrom, who is 71, has come
out of retirement at the request of the Met to portray the
countess. Acting is crucial to the role, but scant singing is
involved. Still, it took courage for Ms. Soderstrom to use the
remnants of her once-creamy voice to create her portrait of an
embittered old woman. She lacked sufficient terror, however, when
the crazed Ghermann steals into her chambers and literally
frightens her to death.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, this engrossing revival shows the Met at crunch time in
its season, yet working at its best.

THE FOOT GETS A HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Foot, a proposed sculpture for San Francisco
Bay about which nearly everybody seems to have an opinion, took a
big step when a key committee of the Art Commission here gave it an
enthusiastic hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect piece; it's sexy and beautiful,'' said Stanlee
Gatti, chairman of the commission's visual arts committee, which on
Wednesday unanimously approved Seattle sculptor Buster Simpson's
proposed foot in the Bay just off the end of Market Street.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture is a hollow, 18-foot-high, striated
stainless-steel rendering of a foot with its big toe just touching
the water.
</P>
<P>
   When a sketch of it was presented to the public in 1997, there
was an outpouring of both protest and praise. Critics wanted to
boot it back to Seattle. Fans, such as Gatti, say it's a major art
piece that would add to the city's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those pieces that could be a history marker for
America in art,'' Gatti said, adding that he has received numerous
calls from museum directors around the country who said they envied
San Francisco for having a chance to get The Foot.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture would cost $400,000 if approved, and because of
the controversy over its aesthetics, Simpson was given $25,000 to
come up with a plan.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he returned with a stainless-steel model of The
Foot along with computer-generated models of it.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti and fellow commissioners Denise Roth, Dugall Stermer and
Ralph Guggenheim seemed impressed. Richard Newirth, director of
cultural affairs, said it was ``stunning artwork'' and was so
impressive that it swayed doubting commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture, which would change colors depending on weather
conditions during the day and be lit with pulsating lights at
night, still must wade through deep water before it is approved.
</P>
<P>
   First, a citizens advisory committee must OK it. Then it must go
to the county Transportation Authority, made up of the Board of
Supervisors. The supervisors probably will hold a committee
hearing, then full board hearing. Then it needs a approval from the
Port Commission, which owns the water where the foot would stand.
</P>
<P>
   Newirth said he figures the approval process should take six to
eight weeks, although he agreed with Gatti that ``nothing is ever
easy in this town.'' In fact, one supervisor, Barbara Kaufman, has
delivered her review: ``Yech!''

<P>
   GENEVA _ The Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon was less than one day's
flying time Friday night from achieving what had thwarted
balloonists for two centuries: a nonstop voyage around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The big balloon's pilots _ Dr. Bertrand Piccard, a Swiss
psychiatrist, and Brian Jones, a British balloonist _ radioed a
message to their ground crew headquarters at Geneva Airport that
for the first time during their 19 days aloft, they had begun to
relax. It appeared virtually certain that they would accomplish
their goal.
</P>
<P>
   The balloon team's meteorologists forecast that the balloon, now
over the Atlantic after crossing Europe, Asia, the Pacific Ocean
and Central America, would arrive over the western Sahara early
Saturday morning. Forecasters said that by about 2 p.m. Greenwich
Mean Time (9 a.m. ET) Saturday, the balloon would reach 9 degrees
west longitude, achieving the global circumnavigation that began in
the Swiss Alps.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Noble, the flight director of the project, said at a
news conference here Friday night that the balloon might have
enough fuel to continue on to Egypt, perhaps even to a landing near
the Pyramids at Giza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian would love to land at that impressive place, and we
would like it too, because there's a good network of roads in the
Nile Valley, and that would help us reach the landing site
quickly,'' Noble said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 attempts by balloonists to circle Earth have been
made in the last decade alone, and all but this one fell far short.
Besides a place in the record books, the two balloonists will stand
to claim a $1 million prize and the Budweiser Cup offered by
Anheuser-Busch Brewing Co. to the first balloonists to circle the
world nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard disclosed in his radio message Friday that on Thursday
he and Jones had come to believe that they too would fail and would
be forced to make a landing at sea near the coast of Belize before
heading out over the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was slow and blowing in the wrong direction,'' he
said. ``We were cold, very tired, and feeling sick. Nothing was
going right.
</P>
<P>
   But then Piccard, who had been unable to sleep for days at a
time, used a technique of auto-hypnosis he had developed while
practicing psychiatry to put himself to sleep for a while. The two
men's spirits began to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   The Breitling Orbiter 3 is the third balloon sponsored by the
Breitling watch-making company. All three were built by a British
company, Cameron Balloons Ltd., and piloted by Piccard. The first,
on Jan. 12, 1997, was forced to land after only a few hours flight
because of a kerosene leak in the crew capsule. The second balloon,
in February 1998, ran out of fuel and had to land in Myanmar after
setting a new balloon endurance record.
</P>
<P>
   This time, more experienced and helped by some technical
improvements, Piccard shattered all endurance and distance records.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by radio to a hundred or more news correspondents
assembled here, Piccard apologized for having disclosed few details
of the trip during the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the first two attempts, it became clear to us that we
would not succeed, so we relaxed and had time to answer questions
and radio photographs to the ground,'' he said. ``But this time we
knew we had a good chance of making it, so we never let up.''
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, 41, is the son and grandson of two other breakers of
historic records. His grandfather, Auguste Piccard, also a medical
doctor, was the first balloonist to reach the stratosphere in a
pressurized crew capsule. He was also the builder of the
Bathyscaphe, a man-carrying submersible capable of reaching great
ocean depths.
</P>
<P>
   Bertrand Piccard's father, Jacques Piccard, set a depth record
in the Bathyscaphe, descending 35,815 feet to the bottom of the
Marianas Trench in the Pacific, the greatest depth ever reached.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the Breitling balloon was cruising eastward some
34,000 feet high in the core of a jet stream carrying it along at
about 100 mph. Piccard said he did not foresee further problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Breitling balloon, like most of its recent competitors in
the round-the-world race, is a hybrid type called a Rozier, which
gains lift from both helium and hot air. At night, when the air
cools, the helium also cools and contracts, losing lift. But
burners fueled by propane or kerosene are used to heat air and thus
make up for the deficit in helium lift.

`JOLSON SINGS AGAIN:' THE SOUND OF HANDS CLAPPING, THE CHILL OF
BACKS TURNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. _ Sunday night, if all goes according to
schedule, the legendary, brilliant director Elia Kazan will appear
on the stage of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. On
Saturday afternoon, another legendary, brilliant director of Greek
heritage, whose name is Andreas, will appear here on the stage of
the George Street Playhouse, where he has been spending much time
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Both men will be wreathed in clouds of moral debate, and a sound
with which both are familiar, that of hands clapping, will assume
unusual significance. Kazan, 89, is being given an Academy Award
for lifetime achievement, an honor that has drawn objections
because of his role as an informer during the witch hunts for
Communists in the 1950s. Protesters have urged those attending the
Oscars to refrain from applauding Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas will as usual receive lots of applause, oceans of it,
and even before the curtain calls for ``Jolson Sings Again,'' a
play by Arthur Laurents, who, not incidentally, has known and
worked with Kazan. The clapping should not, however, be taken as a
sign of approval.
</P>
<P>
   In the final moments of this brisk, probing and imbalanced drama
about naming names in the age of McCarthy, Andreas stands by
himself in a spotlight, bathed in the taped sounds of noisy ovation
and clearly chilled by the loneliness of it all. As
success-addicted stars always are finding out in Hollywood biopics,
there's no warmth in the adoration of crowds when you've lost your
friends. Yes, it's a hokey show business cliche, but in this
particular context it definitely has some bite.
</P>
<P>
   That scene captures the spirit of ``Jolson Sings Again,'' which
is probably this weekend's most purely topical evening of theater.
The play often feels confiningly shaped by the dramatic conventions
of the period in which it is set, with big, lip-biting
confrontations and bantering dialogue that is too silky to be
credible.
</P>
<P>
   But it also has the authentic heat of a war story told by a
soldier who has known the front lines. Laurents, best known as the
author of the books for the musicals ``Gypsy'' and ``West Side
Story,'' saw firsthand what happened to those who informed and to
those who didn't in postwar Hollywood and the ways in which both
were scarred. (The title, for the record, refers to Larry Parks,
who played Jolson on film and was also an informer.)
</P>
<P>
   At its best ``Jolson Sings Again,'' which has been directed by
David Saint and runs through March 28, pulses with the indignation,
confusion and pain of people trapped in a no-win moral quandary. It
also sustains a sophisticated dramatic argument, finding different
shades of judgments for similar acts of betrayal and arguing that
it is possible to separate the sinner from the sin.
</P>
<P>
   But if the play is about the impossibility of seeing the world
in moral absolutes, it also presents its theme with black-and-white
baldness. While the work has four characters of relatively equal
importance, only one of them feels fully developed in both the
writing and the performance.
</P>
<P>
   That is not, by the way, Andreas, although he is certainly the
center of the evening. Yes, he has unquestionably been inspired by
the career of Kazan. Portrayed by Armand Schultz, he is a sexually
charismatic man of dazzling talent who has made the transition from
Broadway to Hollywood, where he is flourishing as both a director
and a Lothario.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in his thrall are Julian (Robert Petkoff), a young
New York playwright, and Robbie (Betsy Aidem), the agent of both
men and the sometime lover of Andreas. The fourth member of the
quartet is Sidney (Jonathan Hadary), Robbie's husband and a
screenwriter of shaky talent but very firm left-wing principles.
The play examines the consequences of what happens when three of
the characters (all but Julian) are subpoenaed to name names in the
film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas may be the drama's drawing card as a sensational figure
a clef, but he is also its weakest link in that he functions less
as a real character than as a litmus test for those around him.
Unlike Kazan, who famously offered patriotic justification for
informing, Andreas is an unqualified, career-driven opportunist who
makes no bones about saying so. He is also an irresistible seducer,
and Julian is reduced to telling him flatly, ``You are evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The devil is never an easy role, and Schultz seems overwhelmed
by his character's satanic dimensions, going stiff when he should
be temptingly molten. Similarly, Julian, who must come to terms
with his homosexuality as well as Andreas' acts of betrayal, has
been conceived as a blank page of a man on whom the play's lessons
are written, and Petkoff adds little in the way of enlivening
detail.
</P>
<P>
   Laurents introduces an intriguing erotic element to the men's
relationship, yet their scenes together, which should be the play's
most urgent, have a woodenness that is part soap opera, part
debate. Hadary is fine as the wisecracking firebrand. But the
evening's naturalistic fire is mostly generated by Ms. Aidem, who
wears both her character's period affectations and her moral
ambivalence with wonderful flair and sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   Laurents, whose characters have been richly embodied by Shirley
Booth, Katharine Hepburn and Barbra Streisand, is a virtuoso in
creating women's roles, and he doesn't disappoint with Robbie. Here
is a person of solid convictions and very human instincts of
sexuality and survival, and Ms. Aidem does full justice to the
attendant battle within. The real heartbreak in the play comes not
when Andreas and Julian have their showdown but when Robbie says to
her husband: ``You're the good guy. Andreas is the bad guy. Which
am I? I'm both, Sidney darling.''
</P>
<P>
   The production has been handsomely staged, with great-looking
mid-century Hollywood costumes by Theoni V. Aldredge and a clever
revolving multipurpose set by James Youmans. Saint gives crispness
and suspense to the transitions between scenes, though he seems
less adept at helping his actors feel comfortable with Laurents'
epigrammatic dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those lines sound anachronistically self-conscious.
(``Stop pointing the finger, because sooner or later it points
back.'') Others, however, have a winning wit and elegance.
Consider, for example, Julian's dead-on assessment of the film
``Gentleman's Agreement,'' an Oscar winner in 1947: ``The movie
that said you better be nice to a Jew because he might turn out to
be a Gentile.'' It would be nice to hear what Laurents has to say
about ``Saving Private Ryan.''

 By ANNA KISSELGOFF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The great French mime, Marcel Marceau, returned
triumphantly to New York on Thursday night and taught us again that
the best of art is never literal.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying a passenger on an ocean liner, he turns green with
seasickness. Yet his face is painted white. It is a measure of his
silent genius that imagination and illusion still speak so potently
through his artistry. At a time when two generations of younger
mime artists have rebelled against his brand of classical mime,
Marceau remains a model, not a fossil.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has never seen the staples of the repertory with
which Marceau has toured the United States since 1955 should beat a
path to the Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College where two different
programs will be presented through March 28.
</P>
<P>
   Marceau's vociferous fans were already out in force to see the
first program of new and old pieces on Thursday. Schuyler Chapin,
the city's cultural affairs commissioner, opened the evening by
reading Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's proclamation of the day as
``Marcel Marceau Day'' and noted that Marceau was celebrating his
76th birthday on stage.
</P>
<P>
   To ask whether Marceau is still spry is to ask whether the sun
rises in the morning. When he counts invisible money he gives us a
symphony of fluttery fingers. When he ``climbs'' stairs he marches
in place with knees bent and slips his hand lower and lower on a
putative bannister, an exercise in contrasting movement. To analyze
his craft is to deny its poetry. And yet there is no way to avoid
tipping a hat to his gift for distillation, the essential gesture
or movement in constant concert with the mobile face.
</P>
<P>
   Like any major actor he stands between comedy and tragedy and he
oscillates between these two poles in his signature piece, ``The
Maskmaker.'' As his mouth turns up or down, we believe he has
pulled different masks on and off. It is common theatrical wisdom
that a mask imposes a specific character on an actor, that he
becomes the mask. But when Marceau suddenly cannot wipe away his
happy face, we see the opposite: a body limp with despair below a
grinning expression, a metaphor for human existence. Watch also how
Marceau's body shrinks and his beaming face fades into a frozen
peace in ``Youth, Maturity, Old Age and Death.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new ``Soliloquy of Three Poor Souls,'' he is a loser
telling a sob story, mocked by others on a park bench. The same
tale is retold with different emphasis by each character: the image
of a man who says he wanted to shoot himself because he could not
support his brood as a pianist and violinist is turned into a
satire. Whether the three characters are real or aspects of one
person is less important than the picture of rejection and
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   When playing multiple characters as in ``The Little Cafe'' and
``The Trial,'' he moves into a richer dimension. It is a very
French cafe where groggy, tipsy and choosy patrons are served by a
waiter whose day ends with a debonair outing at a music hall. There
is a wonderful scene when a dissatisfied customer is tricked by the
waiter who goes back into the kitchen for a minute and serves him
exactly the same dish. The customer beams. How do we know it is a
kitchen? Because Marceau creates a sense of place, even kicking the
door back with his foot.
</P>
<P>
   Superb is the word for his finger-pointing prosecutor and
defense lawyer in ``The Trial.'' ``The Pickpocket's Nightmare'' is
less satisfying, a generalized joke about hands shooting out from
panels.
</P>
<P>
   Detail comes back in a suite for Bip, Marceau's signature
character, when he looks for a job, travels by sea and is
overwhelmed by too many women from a dating service. Gyongyi Biro
and Alexander Neander were the silent and able announcers.

diamond-and-gold jewelry _ a necklace and cufflinks turned into
earrings, all valued at $6,300 _ is at the heart of the latest
allegations that Coles repeatedly violated rules limiting gifts
from bid cities to $150. Coles said again today he wouldn't resign
from the IOC. But a senior IOC official said the information
probably would force the committee to reopen an ethics inquiry on
Coles. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

today that the couple received jewelry from a Greek businessman
connected with Athens' failed bid for the 1996 Games. The
diamond-and-gold jewelry _ a necklace and cufflinks turned into
earrings, all valued at $6,300 _ is at the heart of the latest
allegations that Coles repeatedly violated rules limiting gifts
from bid cities to $150. Coles said again today he wouldn't resign
from the IOC. But a senior IOC official said the information
probably would force the committee to reopen an ethics inquiry on
Coles. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

IS THE PARTY OVER FOR THE NATION'S FRATERNITIES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The concept is admittedly radical, maybe even un-American.
Fraternity houses, long regarded by some educators as the
anti-culture on college campuses, are going alcohol-free. No more
keg parties, drink-filled rushes, or all-around unruly behavior.
Someday, Animal House may exist only on video at your local
Blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   The movement is in its infancy, and though not all fraternities
are jumping on the bandwagon, the wheels are in motion.
Fraternities are being influenced by a series of alcohol-related
incidents, most recently at Southwest Texas State University in San
Marcos, where a pledge was beaten to death by a former student
after a fraternity party.
</P>
<P>
   Student deaths at MIT, Frostburg State in Maryland, Texas A&AMP;M,
Michigan State, the University of New Hampshire and Louisiana State
during the past two years have cast a shadow over fraternity life,
which in reality is not as harmless as depicted in John Belushi's
``Animal House'' in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Fraternities know there is a public perception that they have
evolved primarily as drinking clubs for students whose grade-point
average is comparable to their blood alcohol level. Quoting from
generations-old mission statements, some national fraternity
leaders advocate a return to traditional values and helping young
men develop social skills and provide community service.
</P>
<P>
   The issue involves more than just accidental deaths. There also
have been numerous cases of alcohol poisoning resulting from binge
drinking. Undocumented are the number of fights, sexual attacks,
lost class time and other disruptions that can be attributed to
students getting wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Not all these problems can be placed on the welcome mat of frat
houses. But because of their image, fraternities are a lightning
rod in the ongoing debate about excessive drinking by college
students, particularly binge drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents have strengthened the case made by the National
Interfraternity Council, which adopted a resolution in January of
1998 encouraging member fraternities to pursue alcohol-free
chapters. The organization represents 67 fraternities on 800
campuses in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Phi Kappa Sigma, Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Nu and Phi Gammma Delta
are among major fraternities that will implement an alcohol-free
policy on July 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Glassman, director of insurance and risk reduction at
Sigma Nu, said the alcohol issue has prompted fraternities to
change focus and re-emphasize principles such as love, honor and
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make our fraternities appetizing to
high-quality potential members, those chased off by that wonderful
documentary, `Animal House,''' Glassman said. ``We want to give
students a chance to get involved and help our organizations do the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the national publicity generated by drinking-related
deaths, there is a prevailing attitude at many universities that
``It can't happen here,'' until, of course, it does.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the pledge's death at Southwest Texas State,
which became a double tragedy when the suspect committed suicide
two days later, a 60-day moratorium on social functions was
imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Officers from several national fraternities also visited the
campus, meeting with administration officials and undergraduate
chapter members to discuss making Southwest Texas State's
fraternities alcohol-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal is on the table. It's going to require a total
change in the culture of expectations when students arrive on
campus,'' said John Garrison, dean of students at Southwest Texas
State.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison said that campus life had not returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a sadness about this campus that will take
awhile to go away,'' he said. ``There is anticipation that things
will change. But there is also a determination to make this place
better, restructure our fraternities and work hard with the
community on alcohol-abuse issues.''

UNDATED: alcohol-bause issues.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fraternities that are not complying with the alcohol-free
movement say they are unwilling to be made scapegoats for a problem
that transcends college campuses and affects society at large.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that Greeks represent a small fraction of the
student population on most campuses, so a lot of drinking goes on
in residence halls and at off-campus venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an alcohol environment,'' said David Easlick,
executive director of Delta Kappa Epsilon, which was founded at
Yale in 1844 and includes former President Bush and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush among its alumni.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with the social atmosphere of a college
fraternity,'' said Greg Plezia, executive director of Zeta Psi.
``What is wrong is alcohol and drug abuse. But we're having good
success with our risk-management policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Drinking by fraternity members may be more visible, but binge
drinking by college students in general has been a growing concern
among educators, parents, and various government agencies for well
over a decade. Studies have sprouted like dandelions in the spring,
each with an ominous conclusion:
</P>
<P>
   College students not only believe drinking is a right, but an
increasing number are drinking with the intention of getting drunk.
A recent study by the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse
revealed that almost three out of every 10 Texas college students
are binge drinkers, with the rate climbing to 44 percent among
fraternity and sorority members.
</P>
<P>
   College Parents of America, a group based in Washington, D.C.,
advocates an eight-step alcohol education program focusing on
parental involvement. Richard Flaherty, president of the
organization, said it is important that parents refrain from
telling ``drinking stories'' about their college days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not extremists on this issue,'' Flaherty said. ``But I
do think there is a tendency for parents and educators to say this
has been going on for years and accept it as an abnormality of our
social system.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help, though, when alumni, parents and fans treat
alcohol as a major food group on football weekends. Students know
hypocrisy when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the recent studies and highly publicized stories
about college drinking have raised the level of awareness and
prompted stricter rules about alcohol consumption at many schools.
</P>
<P>
   Fraternities are feeling the heat. More social events are run by
third-party vendors; the vendors pour drinks and check proof of
age. Many fraternity socials are by invitation only.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement, however, is difficult. There is also an increasing
amount of drinking at off-campus apartments and other venues, where
the university does not have jurisdiction. That only increases the
risks, said Easlick of Delta Kappa Epsilon.
</P>
<P>
   Some universities believe that it is time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   At Michigan State University in East Lansing, students are
leading a strong anti-alcohol campaign after a student died of
alcohol poisoning at a local bar last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth College, where fraternity life was the inspiration for
``Animal House,'' plans to make its fraternities and sororities
co-ed in the hope it will promote more respect between male and
female students. Students oppose this move.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan J. Brant, executive vice president of the National
Interfraternity Council, said that ignoring the drinking problem
sends the wrong message. ``If we don't do these things, do we let
them \R students\S break the law?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Erv Johnson, director of communications for Beta Theta Psi,
which has 138 chapters, said his fraternity believes that
prohibition would be an admission of failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply mandating prohibition is failing in our
responsibilities to help young people prepare themselves for life
after college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At stake for fraternities may be nothing less than survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrettably,'' said Michael Shonrock, dean of students at
Texas Tech, ``if fraternities are not careful, they will drink
themselves out of business.''

 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sandwiched between friends in a booth at Lot 61 West
21st Street, dressed in leather pants and Manolo Blahnik heels,
Tait Chatmon took a moment to appreciate the view. ``In one glance
you have dreads, then you have lawyer types, then you have city
kids, then you have bridge and tunnel,'' she said, dragging her
finger across the room as if swiping icing off a cake. ``I love
it!''
</P>
<P>
   That's what you get on a Monday night downtown, and that's why
Ms. Chatmon and half a dozen of her friends make the trip down here
_ down to ``the city'' _three or four times a week. They come by
car.
</P>
<P>
   But they're not bridge and tunnel. They're from a part of
Manhattan where strollers are more menacing than cab drivers, where
the Gap is never more than a short walk from one's doorstep and an
exciting cultural moment is the opening of a new branch of Gracious
Home. This sleepy, comfortable Westchester of Manhattan is the
Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chatmon and her friends _ like many, many Upper West Siders
in need of a style fix _ shop everywhere but their neighborhood and
do almost all their socializing downtown. The Upper West Side is
their bedroom community, bridged to the city by the Nos. 1 and 9
local subway lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Upper West Side has gone through phases. Once a literary and
artistic haven of creative eccentrics and liberals, it became a
swinging singles scene in the 1980s. But now its trend-setting
appeal has eroded. It has turned from marbled rye to white bread,
as textured as a small city in middle America.
</P>
<P>
   The tone is set on 66th Street, with Tower Records, a
three-level Barnes &AMP; Noble, a Disney Store, a Sony Multiplex, an
Eddie Bauer, a Nine West and the Gap. Further north, it starts all
over again; the five-block stretch between 82nd and 86th Streets
has a Barnes &AMP; Noble, Gap, Banana Republic, Coach, Origins, Nine
West and a Sony Theater. Put a roof over the whole thing, and you
could be in a mall in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Megastores and Starbucks aren't the only villains. Nearly
everything that once gave the Upper West Side its quirky charm _
from Shakespeare &AMP; Co. books to Charivari, the clothing store _ has
been wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   The triangle of real estate defined by Zabar's, Lincoln Center
and the Museum of Natural History is a style-free zone. In between
the Nine Wests and the Eddie Bauers are countless restaurants,
clubs and shops. And yet, many who live there insist that there's
nowhere to eat or go out to.
</P>
<P>
   The Evelyn, one of the better bars, has the brassy Boston feel
of a Cheers with bad lighting. At Rain, a Vietnamese restaurant,
the droopy fernlike plants seem left over from the 80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is lame,'' said Saul Adams, a journalist who grew up in the
neighborhood. ``It's slowly become worse and worse. I mean, it was
never party central, but it used to have a little more character.''
</P>
<P>
   People who live on the Upper West Side get their hopes up with
every new flurry of openings, often only to be disappointed. And
mystified. Recently, a dozen or so boutiques and restaurants
designed to make the area more of a style destination have opened.
</P>
<P>
   But already, the outlook is bleak. The most sophisticated
newcomer, Calle Ocho, serves Latin American fare, the cuisine of
the moment, but in an oversize room teeming with Banana Republic
emigres. Balthazar it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why many residents feel shame when confronted by
someone who lives south of the border at Central Park South. When a
young woman was recently at dinner with Adam Rapoport, an editor at
Time Out New York magazine, who lives in the West Village, and
mentioned that she lived on the Upper West Side, his response was
typical. ``I've heard of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many 20-somethings like Ms. Chatmon, who live in the
neighborhood, are drawn to its suburban virtues. For grocery
shopping it's unparalleled: Fairway, Citarella, Zabar's. And it has
great gyms; the wet area at Reebok is the city's finest. Ms.
Chatmon likes the feeling of community and the fact that it's far
from the madding subways and midtown crowds. ``It's quieter,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet as a coma. But it wasn't always this way. In the 70s, when
hip spots started to crop up, the scene was an ethnic, intellectual
and swinging mix. There were dairy restaurants like Famous, 50s-era
date palaces like the Tip Toe Inn, art theaters like the Thalia,
chess clubs and Plato's Retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The magician Doug Henning starred in the musical ``The Magic
Show,'' a Broadway hit whose songs celebrated the neighborhood with
lyrics like: ``West End Avenue!'' and ``Right across the street
from Zabar's!''
</P>
<P>
   In the 80s, the Upper West Side got hotter, particularly
Columbus Avenue. Stores like Charivari attracted shoppers from all
over the city. It was one of the first stores in Manhattan to sell
clothing by designers like Anna Sui and Yoji Yamamoto. There was a
thriving singles scene at places like the Surf Club, and the China
Club attracted celebrities. It was never avant-garde like the East
Village, but then it was the 80s and preppies and yuppies were
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Columbus Avenue became so popular that rents began
to climb. Within a few years, they had doubled and tripled. The
individual businesses that gave the avenue its flavor could no
longer afford to be there. That's when the Gap, Banana Republic,
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Sony Theaters moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lost its specialness,'' said Barbara Weiser, whose family
owned Charivari. The store's five locations on the Upper West Side
have all closed in the last few years. ``Most people get altitude
sickness coming above 50th Street,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   In the 90s, downtown culture has edged yuppie culture out of the
mainstream. Four-star restaurants and Louis Vuitton have staked
claims in SoHo and Tribeca; the Upper East Side went downtown and
brought some of the downtown spirit back up with it. The Upper West
Side shares none of that synergy. It's neither ritzy nor hip.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the mallification of Manhattan seems to be
happening rapidly,'' said David Hershkovits, the publisher and
co-editor of Paper Magazine, who couldn't remember the last time he
had been to the Upper West Side. Even SoHo feels more like a
high-end mall these days.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Upper West Side it seems worse, the blandness more
entrenched. Blame the residents. Entrepreneurs secretly complain
that Upper West Side locals just aren't willing to spend on style.
As unfashionable as it may be, they prefer value to vogue.
</P>
<P>
   A restaurateur who is new to the area and who agreed to an
interview only if he were not named, lighted up at the opportunity
to vent about the problem. ``It's almost hard to believe some of
the things people say,'' he said. ``I have had people say, `I eat
my soup to the rim,' or, `I got my salad split, but we want
more.'''
</P>
<P>
   A clientele that demands Carnegie Deli portions is probably not
going to appreciate a shaving of truffle. And so, the restaurateurs
say, they dumb down their dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Kalt, an owner of Spazzia, the Upper West Side
counterpart to Spartina, a chic trattoria in Tribeca, has altered
the menu to fit price-conscious patrons. At Spartina, he offers a
roasted duck breast with figs and a 100-year-old balsamic vinegar;
at Spazzia, he swaps it for a roasted duck breast with Swiss chard
gratin and a chestnut honey sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give them the opportunity to spend less money,'' Kalt said.
If Upper West Siders see their homey neighborhood as a place to
nest but not to splurge, that may explain why Ansonia, a three-star
restaurant that was heralded as a breath of fresh air on Columbus
Avenue three years ago, couldn't cut it. The neighborhood rejected
its high-end ambitions and its comprehensive wine list, and the
restaurant wilted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurateurs are now trying a new strategy, opening
larger, more moderately priced places like Calle Ocho and Ruby Foo,
a popular Asian restaurant on Broadway that serves giant sushi to
please the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers regard the neighborhood in the same way. Stefani
Greenfield, an owner of Scoop, a trendy clothing store with
locations in SoHo and on the Upper East Side, said she would
consider opening on the Upper West Side, but if she did she would
open a Scoop Street, their lower-priced version.
</P>
<P>
   David Shearer, an owner of Totem, a design store in TriBeCa,
also considers the Upper West Side a viable market. If he opened a
store up there, he said, he would gear the merchandise for smaller
spaces and for families.
</P>
<P>
   Clubs have also been trying. The owners of Life, a popular
downtown club, helped open Cream, a club on Columbus Avenue, last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lewis, an executive director at Life, describes the uptown
clubs as more sanitized versions of those downtown. They open
earlier and draw a more clean-cut crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Cream, for instance, on a recent evening, looked as if it had
been decorated by a prom committee, had a sound system muffled like
a home stereo, and played three Michael Jackson songs in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   There were people from Staten Island, a bachelorette party from
New Jersey, and scant signs of fashion life. Plaid button-down
shirts. Satin stretch T-shirts from two years ago. One woman was
wearing a business suit. Bouncers were actually turning away people
in sneakers, a pretty regular accessory at a downtown club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a destination club,'' Lewis said. ``This club will
do well when it rains.'' He was right. Cream has done well, though
Life backed out after a year. Successful or not, many of the Upper
West Side boites come off as very suburban.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday night _ the big night for Upper West Side clubs
but popularly referred to as ``amateur night'' elsewhere in town _
the clubs were just plain out of touch compared with a place like
the Key Club on East 13th Street.
</P>
<P>
   There was more energy on a Thursday night at the Key Club last
week, when Ms. Chatmon was there with her entourage. On this night,
she was the party's promoter. With it in full swing, the place
swathed in red velvet and smoke seeping among people on the crowded
dance floor, Ms. Chatmon said that she's going to stop promoting
parties on the Upper West Side. ``It's just not bringing in the
crowd I want. It's just not downtown.''

 &HT;    NEW DEMOCRATIC CHAIRMAN UNVEILS EXPANSION PLANS
 &HT;    360&AMP;adds.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The incoming chairman of the Democratic Party on
Friday unveiled a multimillion-dollar expansion of its programs to
recruit and support candidates _ and a savvy team to raise money
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, who will succeed fund-raising wizard Steve Grossman
as the nuts-and-bolts director of the party, told members of the
Democratic National Committee that his ``America 2000'' plan will
combine the best of high-tech and old-fashioned grassroots
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC will create a Democratic Internet Center, digitized
voter profiles and a $1 million software link between its new
headquarters and those of the state parties. At the same time, it
plans to recruit and train 1 million volunteers for door-to-door
combat with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, grassroots politics will have silicon
strands,'' Andrew said in his first formal address to DNC members.
``We will electrify, digitize and personalize the way we do
politics in every election. We will make the party of high hopes
the party of high-tech.''
</P>
<P>
   To pay for it all, and to wipe out the lingering debt from the
1998 congressional election, Andrew has put together a new Finance
Department.
</P>
<P>
   It includes Beth Dozoretz, a Washington hostess and an
experienced fund raiser who brought in more than $2 million to the
party during the 1998 election cycle; Andrew Tobias, the author of
best-selling financial advice books, and Rep. Loretta Sanchez of
California, who has a nationwide fund-raising network in the
Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, the Indiana party chairman who was handpicked by
Grossman as his successor, credited Grossman with rejuvenating the
Democratic Party amid scandals arising from the party's aggressive
fund-raising during the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in this country has worked harder and longer than Steve
Grossman to put this party on a sound financial footing and allow
us to go forward,'' Andrew told the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   The party is still nearly $6 million in debt, down from $18
million at the start of the 52-year-old Massachusetts businessman's
two-year term.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the party's debt was reduced to $960,000, but it
rose again in the months leading up to the 1998 election, in which
the Democratic Party gained five seats and fought the GOP to a draw
in Senate races.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when Grossman arrived to begin a joint chairmanship
with Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the party not only was heavily in
debt, but its fund-raising on behalf of the Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign was under investigation by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans tried to bankrupt us,'' said Romer, who is
continuing as the party's general chairman, a position that makes
him its national spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   During his 24-month tenure as co-chairman of the party, Grossman
spearheaded a fund-raising effort that grossed more than $90
million. He put on a blitz of fund-raisers featuring President
Clinton, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore
and his wife, Tipper Gore. He expanded direct-mail and phone
solicitations beyond the party's aging liberal base. And he wooed a
new target: high-tech entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got on the phone and stayed on the phone,'' said David
Worley, chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's ``America 2000'' plan follows a similar course. But it
also calls for rolling out an on-line fund-raising effort as well
as a beefed up Democratic Business Council, the structure used by
the party to reach out to business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew has committed his new team to exceeding the amounts
raised by Grossman, but has not specified by how much.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the soft-spoken, behind-the-scenes Grossman,
Andrew used his appearance before the DNC to lambast the Republican
Party as ``the GOP _ Grumpy Old Party,'' and the GOP's presidential
candidates as a ``motley crew.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the current GOP
front-runner, is little known by American voters ``beyond the
monogram on his shirt sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said former Vice President Dan Quayle is ``more a punch
line than a president,'' Pat Buchanan is ``the most progressive
candidate of '99 _ 1899,'' Lamar Alexander ``gave plaid a bad
name,'' Rep. John Kasich of Ohio is so enthusiastic ``you'd think
he was the one on Viagra,'' and Steve Forbes is the candidate with
``the bank account of Bill Gates and the personality of MS-DOS.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew said the GOP candidates are ``a disaster in the making,''
and some Republicans ``want to call in the Red Cross'' _ a
reference to Elizabeth Dole, the former head of the charity.

THOSE NEW TEEN-AGE MOVIES FOGGED MY GLASSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, March 21) (DW) 
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trailers and buzz have begun for ``American Pie,'' a
fantastically puerile summer movie that could be the next
``Porky's.'' Despite its leering, sophomoric crudeness, the most
shocking thing about ``American Pie'' is how tame it looks next to
the other teen-age movies out there. The worst thing that happens
is that a confused teen-age boy sexually abuses his dessert, the
titular ``pie.''
</P>
<P>
   But a couple of recent releases take teensploitation to new
extremes. The crude hormonal antics in ``American Pie'' come off as
sweetly naive next to the casually raunchy ``Cruel Intentions'' and
the heavily sexualized horrors of ``The Rage: Carrie 2.'' No one
likes a titillating teen-age flick more than I do. In my 20s I was
still sneaking into John Hughes comedies. I'll see anything
starring Hollywood's ``thumb-sucking Lolitas with three names,'' as
Rex Reed recently called Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love
Hewitt and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   But is it just me, or have some of these movies become so
sexually explicit (in language, if not nudity), so slutty (in male
and female promiscuity), that they're like soft-core porn, without
the clever dialogue?
</P>
<P>
   Both ``Cruel Intentions'' and ``The Rage'' hinge on the cold,
calculated destruction of innocent virgins, a handy metaphor for
the moviemakers' designs on their audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Intentions'' is ``Dangerous Liaisons'' with bratty rich
kids on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Its Valmontian lothario
(played by Ryan Phillippe) is named Sebastian and bets his
stepsister, Kathryn (Ms. Gellar), that he can deflower a transfer
student (Reese Witherspoon) who has written an essay in defense of
chastity published in Seventeen magazine. Meanwhile, the scheming
Kathryn, intent on revenge against some guy who dumped her, vows to
ruin another virginal new kid (Selma Blair) at their exclusive
private school. A double deflowering! But that's not all. The
condition of the wager is that if Sebastian wins, he can have his
way with the only spoiled little rich girl in New York yet to elude
his grope: his stepsister.
</P>
<P>
   The specifics of this near-incestuous bet are too kinky to
describe and the dialogue is too obscene to quote. Suffice it to
say that these mischievous teeny-boppers touch on sodomy and oral
sex with such bored familiarity you'd think they were talking about
a trip to the Gap. Sebastian's romantic skills are formidable
enough to make a nymphomaniac of Ms. Blair and to seduce Ms.
Witherspoon's proud virgin into surrendering her eccentric
principles.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the real-life Ms. Witherspoon, who is 22 and engaged
to Phillippe, wrestled with her motivation for the part. ``One of
the hardest things for me about my chaste character was to find a
modern way to make a teen-ager a virgin,'' she said in the Suzy
column by Aileen Mehle in Women's Wear Daily on Feb. 17. ``Not to
say that all teen-agers are sex-starved, but it actually was
difficult to find a reason that wasn't self-righteous or
obnoxious.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that a hot Hollywood ingenue's understanding of
adolescence might be a tad more sophisticated than the average mall
rat in braces.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between ``Carrie'' (1976) and its new sequel,
``The Rage,'' is more than generational. In the original, Sissy
Spacek's telekinetic high school wallflower burns down the school
and kills all the popular kids for humiliating her at the prom.
Same premise in the sequel, but with a bunch of gratuitous sex
thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   The high school in ``The Rage'' appears to have some unspoken
rule barring female students from wearing bras. The football team
has a contest going to see who can have sex with the most girls:
more points for harder-to-get girls. When one shy, obscure girl
commits suicide because one of the football goons dumps her after
she gave up her virginity to him, her friend Rachel (Emily Bergl)
gets mad. You don't want to make Rachel mad. She is compelled to
use her own telekinetic powers when the popular kids humiliate her
by secretly videotaping the loss of her virginity to the one
nonjerk football player, then playing the tape at a party.
</P>
<P>
   What struck me about the climactic scene was not the bloodbath
of beheadings and impalings, but the video clip that sets it off.
This was supposed to be Rachel's first time, but she could give
pointers to Sharon Stone. The footage had the slick, slow-motion
production values of an episode of ``Red Shoe Diaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The adult sex these under-age movie characters are having is
being presented and styled like adult entertainment. Has sex
between teen-agers really become this much better since I was was
one, back when the first ``Carrie'' came out?
</P>
<P>
   In ``Clueless,'' the worst thing you could be was ``a virgin who
can't drive.'' But advanced degrees in carnal knowledge are being
attributed to teen-agers still on their learner's permit. Some of
these young women might take up a new pro-virginity book by Wendy
Shalit, ``A Return to Modesty'' (The Free Press, $24) out of sheer
performance anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1950s, Hollywood has been titillating adolescent
moviegoers. I became obsessed with a shameless beach-blanket romp
called ``Girls on the Beach'' (1965) in heavy rotation on American
Movie Classics a couple of months ago. But even in the milder PG-13
``She's All That,'' Rachel Leigh Cook _ the best of the
thumb-sucking Lolitas _ becomes ``all that'' by trading her modest
outgeek clothes for slutty ones and making herself look as tasty as
freshly baked apple pie.

PUNCHING AND KICKING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 21)  
(lh) 
 By PENELOPE GREEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I'm not going to say that I never saw the tapes,''
said Rique Uresti, a former male cheerleader wearing a Jim
Carrey-ish smile and slightly flared brown tights. ``But Tae-Bo is
Tae-Bo, and this is Gotham Box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This'' was certainly something. On a recent frigid Tuesday
night at the Equinox gym on East 85th Street and Third Avenue,
Uresti led 80 women (and one man, a 55-year-old accountant) through
a zingy series of punches and kicks. Eighty-one New Yorkers out at
dinnertime on a chilly evening. Uresti, whose resemblance to Jim
Carrey only deepened as he began to move, seemed to be having a
terrific time. He giggled and swung his head around like a Fosse
dancer. The women looked happy, too. They smiled and jabbed and
panted and counted out loud.
</P>
<P>
   It was very user-friendly, almost idiot-proof _ peppy, boppy,
martial artsy _ this kickboxing to Mariah Carey. A punch is a
wonderful gesture to fake, especially to an eight-count beat. And
there are no opponents in Gotham Box, and no bloody noses.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the women gathered, damply, into little happy-talk
bunches, tiny knots of feel-good testimonials to Uresti's class and
the overall satisfaction of the new way of working out _ which has
swept away last year's fads like so many old sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   The new way is called Tae-Bo (pronounced TIE-BOE), a name that
has been trademarked but has spawned many imitations, including
Uresti's Gotham Box. The real thing, a cocktail of tae kwon do,
boxing and aerobics, is the baby of a 43-year-old martial arts
champion and action-movie actor in Sherman Oaks, Calif., named
Billy Blanks. Blanks is distinguished among his fitness brethren by
both his beauty and his diffidence _ you might say that he is the
inverse of the overgroomed and voluble Denise Austin, of the
Lifetime channel _ and he runs an exercise studio and karate dojo,
which has lately metamorphosed into quite an empire.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy Tae-Bo exercise tapes to use at home; a set of four
costs $59.85. These are the tapes Uresti referred to, which are
sold by an infomercial playing 2,000 times a day on cable
television stations around the country.
</P>
<P>
   You must have seen its fervent testimonials, like ``It gets in
your blood,'' as one woman says. Or, ``It made a difference in my
comeback,'' as Carlos ``King'' Palomino, a welterweight boxer,
says, adding: ``I've had three fights, three knockouts.'' In a
growly voice, Shaquille O'Neal, the basketball star, says, ``Get
off your butt, man.''
</P>
<P>
   And soon Billy Blanks comes on, with his shy smile and his
devastating physique, and tells you he has always wanted to help
people, and you believe him. He tells you other fitness gurus have
lied to you, but that Tae-Bo will work because it is ``the Truth.''
And you believe him. I believe him. I bought the tapes. Why not? If
you've got the will, Billy Blanks says, Tae-Bo is the way. No messy
pills to buy, no unattractive machines, no Psychic Friends. What an
infomercial.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the tapes have reached almost $80 million, according to
an executive in the infomercial industry, and made Blanks a
millionaire many times over since the 30-minute advertisement began
saturation broadcasts last August and Blanks made a weeklong
appearance from the Bahamas on ``Oprah Winfrey.'' He also received
a reported $1.5 million advance for an exercise book from Bantam
Books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have acquired a book,'' said Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman
for Random House, of which Bantam is a division. ``The price is
speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   Money like this attracts imitators. A lawyer for Blanks, Jan
Yoss, said she sends an average of 60 cease-and-desist letters a
week to gyms and health clubs that are using the name Tae-Bo
without paying a licensing fee. Blanks took out a trademark on the
name in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Legal claims are also flying around Tae-Bo, including a suit
joined by the former boxing champion Sugar Ray Leonard, who says
his name was used without permission in the infomercial. A lawyer
for the advertisement's producer has declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Tae-Bo-ish classes like Tae-Box or Cardio Tai Box or Cardio
Kickbox can be found at a gym near you, although you will have to
fight to get into them. ``I have never seen anything like this,''
Felicia Bessen, group fitness manager at the Equinox gym, said.
``That infomercial really struck some chord. I've got 100 people
showing up for Gotham Box, and I've got every instructor in town
calling to say they can teach Tae-Bo.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Perry, aerobics director of the Newport County YMCA in
Newport, R.I., said: ``The crowds! It's like a Dead concert!'' Ms.
Perry has named her class Tae-Box. She says that people are so
caught up that they show a Pavlovian eagerness at workouts. ``You
count to eight,'' she said, ``and people start sweating right away.
And then you make them count and you're like, `This is a piece of
cake!' We had all this complicated choreography, and now all you
have to do is stand there and count to eight.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine says that Tae-Bo is the macarena of exercise:
irresistible moves with a beat that anyone can do and look sort of
OK. Men and women, young and old, all ``get'' Tae-Bo, because a
punch is an instinctive move.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about yoga, by contrast, is instinctive. (You remember
yoga, don't you? The ``inner'' workout?) Yoga is weird and painful
and elitist; it made you feel like you weren't quite a member of
the club. And that awful feeling of being left out meant that you
weren't primed to receive the mystical yummies that yoga was
hawking. Besides, unless you were writhing around with all your
pierced buddies down at Jivamukit on Lafayette Street in Manhattan,
yoga was boring.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps oneness is out. In any case, the mild aggression of
Tae-Bo feels like a welcome palate cleanser.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Billy Blanks' publicity agent, Julieann
Hartman, and manager, Jeffrey Greenfield, were hovering outside a
television studio in Los Angeles while Blanks was inside being
taped for an appearance on the Howie Mandel talk show. They passed
Ms. Hartman's cell phone back and forth as they spoke to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy; I'm getting 60, 80 calls an hour,'' said Ms.
Hartman, who used to work for ``Jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield said: ``What we are branding is not Tae-Bo, it's
Billy Blanks. And Tae-Bo is the vessel we're using to get his
message across.''
</P>
<P>
   And that message is?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is that you can change yourself from the inside out and
make yourself a better person,'' Greenfield said. ``We've got big
plans: Tae-Bo for kids, Tae-Bo for couples, combat Tae-Bo. And then
there's clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanks has a mawkish and compendious news release _ ``the Billy
Blanks story'' _ that describes his rise from ``abject poverty'' as
one of 15 children in Erie, Pa., to becoming a seven-time world
karate champion. He is married to his childhood sweetheart, Gayle,
and they have two grown children, Shellie and Billy Jr., both of
whom teach in his studio.
</P>
<P>
   He developed Tae-Bo almost 20 years ago and started teaching a
version of it, called Karobics, in 1982. When he found out a decade
later later that someone else had trademarked Karobics, he changed
the name _ a blessing, because Karobics has no euphony.
</P>
<P>
   By telephone from his California dojo, Blanks said that he has
kept his feet on the ground despite the frenzy of the last six
months. As we spoke, he said the line for his next class had
wrapped around the building once or twice and was heading down
Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's God's problem,'' he said. ``God got me into this, and He
can get me out. I've got people coming from all over the country to
see if I'm really the guy they see in the videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, I'm here at the studio,'' he told me. ``I'm the same
person I was yesterday. I'm never going to change because I know I
have a God bigger than anything I do. I've got to go. Have a
blessed day!''
</P>
<P>
   Before hanging up, Blanks said he wanted to build a dome under
which he could teach Tae-Bo to 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   I'd show up. Wouldn't you?

ST JOHN'S HAS A CELTICS LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The schedule says the Boston Celtics are in
New York Saturday afternoon. Don't believe it. Those are Pitino's
Impostors. The real Celtics will be on display right here in the
awesome Thompson-Boling Arena Saturday. They'll be playing Ohio
State for the NCAA South Regional championship and a berth in the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The uniforms say ``St. John's,'' but what that bunch happens to
be are the Celtics. The 1964 Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? The coach may be the all-time single-biggest Celtic
worshipper on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, of course, is Mike Jarvis, whose Celt- _ OK, St.
John's Red Storm _ take on Jim O'Brien's Ohio State Buckeyes. Mike
Jarvis hails from ``The Coast'' in Cambridge, and he grew up
idolizing the Bill Russell Celtics. His ultimate fantasy was to
coach the team, and it still may be. Until then, he will settle for
coaching a miniature Old Celtic team that features five
double-figure scorers, a high-octane fast-break attack, a clever
and selfless half-court offense, and a relentless defense.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't that sound like a team we used to know?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two people I still have to call today,'' Jarvis said
at a news conference Friday. ``The first is my brother Richard, who
would come up with the dollar and a half to take me to the Garden
for a balcony seat to watch the Celtics. The second is Red
Auerbach, who has become a real good friend of mine since my days
at George Washington. Why wouldn't I model my team after the
Celtics? They were the greatest winning institution in the history
of American sport, and the way it was done was with team, team,
team, a focus on defense, running when it was there, and setting up
intelligently when it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``When God sent me Patrick Ewing, I tried to make him into Bill
Russell, and he was polite enough to wait until he got to college
before he said, `Who was Bill Russell?' But one of these days I
will get another Patrick Ewing at St. John's, and I will do the
same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing missing from the current St. John's equation is
the Bill Russell sort. The Red Storm have no pure center. Jarvis
goes with a front line of 6-foot-7-inch Ron Artest, 6-7 Tyrone
Grant (the nominal center), and 6-6 Lavor Postell. There is no
dominant center, no eraser, no control tower to trigger the fast
break. That aside, what's left is a T-E-A-M in the finest Old
Celtic tradition, and it just happens to be playing its best
basketball of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After being blown out by the University of Connecticut in the
Big East title game, St. John's has (Red) stormed its way into the
Final Eight, squashing Samford, Indiana, and Maryland by a total of
65 points. The Maryland game included a run of 23 unanswered
points, a figure that speaks to great expertise at both ends. The
only team playing better of late is that Krzyzewski bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very fortunate and blessed to be in this position,''
acknowledges Jarvis. ``We hope our best is yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis took over a St. John's team that had underachieved for a
number of years despite the presence of two very high-profile
players in Felipe Lopez and Zendon Hamilton. The returning players
had gotten very tired of Fran Fraschilla. The team needed an
entirely new approach. It didn't take them long to discover that
Mike Jarvis was a very different sort of coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``What impressed me at our first meeting,'' says the thoughtful
Grant, ``was that he actually talked to us like men. Then he came
in with an open mind. He didn't care what had gone on before. He
gave everyone an opportunity to see if they could play.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone couldn't play, but about eight of them can and the
first five is as well-balanced a group as you could imagine. The
scoring totals range from Grant's 10.5 to guard Bootsy Thornton's
14.6. Precocious point guard Eric Barkley, who dazzled Maryland
with 24 points and 9 assists, is the clear floor leader, but
sophomore forward Artest, who blocked six Maryland shots, is only
14 behind Barkley (168-154) in the assist department. The
rebounding is another team effort, with Grant, Artest, and Postell
all averaging between six and eight a game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Old Celtics were never about stats, and neither is this
St. John's team. There are bigger teams and stronger teams, but few
more cohesive teams. They buy into anything the coach is selling,
and that's all any mentor can ask.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jarvis is in the interesting position of having been
involved in each of the three distinct levels of competition and
expectation an NCAA Tournament team has to handle. He has had a
cannon-fodder team or two at Boston University, where the selection
itself was the reward. He has had a Cinderella hopeful in George
Washington, which won two games in 1993 to provide the school and
its followers with a nice little week and a half March thrill. And
now he has a team that dares dream of winning the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is different now,'' he says. ``When you barely get in, you
always dream the Impossible Dream, but you have got to be
realistic. At the next level, you hope you can get to a Sweet 16, a
Final Eight, or even a Final Four, but you start making your
vacation plans. Now you don't think of making your vacation plans
until later. The same schools with solid programs seem to be there
year after year with a chance to win, and St. John's hopes to be
one of those programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The future can wait. In the here and now, these New Celtics of
his are 40 minutes away from the Final Four. If they get there,
maybe Red will send them a piece of the old parquet for good luck.
</P>

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AT 29-YEAR LOW IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The number of unemployed Massachusetts workers dropped
to a 29-year low in February in a sign that many more people are
reaping the gains of a robust local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's 2.9 percent jobless rate, down from 3.2 percent in
January, was well below the nation's 4.4 percent rate, resulting in
the widest disparity between the state and national rates since the
two began to diverge four years ago, say analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The February decline was only the third time since March of 1970
that the rate dipped below 3 percent. The last instance was in July
of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The number of unemployed in Massachusetts fell to 93,600 in
February, from 102,900 in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boom continues,'' commented Nicholas Perna, chief
economist at Fleet Financial Group. ``What a long way we have come
since 1992. The unemployment rate is down in the vicinity of 3
percent, which is remarkably low and well below the national
average. So, this is a great time to be looking for a job, to be
changing jobs, or to be getting back into the market after losing a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   New jobs were added in nearly every sector of the economy except
manufacturing. Massachusetts factories, hit by weaker exports to
Asia and other countries, shed 1,900 jobs in February.
</P>
<P>
   Since February 1998, the service sector has added 26,700 jobs,
or 2.4 percent. Real estate, finance and insurance jobs have
increased by 6,300 or 2.9 percent. Meanwhile, retail trade jobs
were up 10,500 or 1.9 percent over the year, with specialty stores
accounting for 4.2 percent of those gains.
</P>
<P>
   For employers, however, the lower jobless rate means competition
for skilled workers will likely intensify as Massachusetts
companies struggle to fill vacancies. ``We have the jobs, but we
are a high-cost state and housing is high cost, so there is a
serious impediment in terms of attracting people from other
states,'' remarked Fred Breimyer, chief economist at State Street
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   And although workers are having less trouble finding jobs,
analysts say wages have not risen markedly in response to the heavy
demand for labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, wages are flexible, and we tend to think they will
rise to meet the demand,'' said Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at
Thompson Financial Services. ``Instead, what we are hearing is that
companies simply cannot find qualified people. In many cases, they
are raising wages for the new people coming in, but not for those
who are already there.''
</P>
<P>
   How long will the economic boom continue? Forecasters are
predicting positive economic growth through 1999, but there are
indications the momentum will begin to lessen by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, companies will continue to face difficulties hiring and
that could put some constraints on their ability to expand,'' noted
Breimeyer. ``Secondly, the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates
as a means of slowing inflation, and third, there could still be
some negative impact from the situation globally.''
</P>
<P>
   The global trade crisis may create problems in coming months
because many Asian countries are facing more serious economic
problems than previously anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our economy is humming along,'' said Yolanda
Kodrzycki, an economist and assistant vice president at the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a high degree of consumer confidence, which means
people are willing to spend,'' she said. ``Increased spending is
showing up in the retail area, and in housing construction. So, I
would expect the unemployment rate here in Massachusetts to remain
quite low.''

`EARTHLY POSSESSIONS': MIDDLE AGE CRAZY, AND READY TO SHOW IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching Susan Sarandon loosen up is always fun. Her classic
transformation was, of course, eight years ago in ``Thelma and
Louise.'' On the road, she traded hair spray, high-collared blouses
and ladylike repression for jeans, a ponytail and a spree of
feminist retaliation and almost justifiable crime, her windburned
but glowing-with-freedom face to the sun. Ms. Sarandon's
metamorphosis Saturday night on the HBO film ``Earthly
Possessions'' isn't nearly so satisfying, but it has its own charm.
Don't let the fact that she seems to be playing her early scenes as
Edith Bunker throw you; the movie gets much better.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sarandon's character, Charlotte Emory, makes her entrance in
a raincoat and sensible shoes, standing in line at her hometown
bank mumbling to herself that she used to know everyone in town.
Her plan is to withdraw all the money from her account and leave
her husband, a minister of minimal emotions who has been taking her
for granted for years. But Charlotte is not an adventurous woman;
in early middle age, she has yet to have the courage to learn how
to drive a car.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan becomes irrelevant when a bank robber grabs her, holds
a gun to her head and takes her hostage. It's clear that he is not
an accomplished criminal when he takes only the $300 that one
teller had in her hands and makes his getaway in a bus. Luckily for
Charlotte, he is the young, cute and misguided Jake Sims (Stephen
Dorff), and the balance of power in their relationship constantly
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   It begins when Charlotte insists on getting off the parked bus
because she's claustrophobic. She also loses a little respect for
Jake when he admits he doesn't know how to hot-wire a car. But
things really start to get interesting when the romantic attraction
between criminal and hostage speaks its name.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign is the slightly seductive way Charlotte says
about her age: ``Anyway, it doesn't matter. It's just a number. It
doesn't mean anything.'' And the next thing you know, she and Jake
are both drunk on fruity cocktails with funny names, slow dancing
and taking a cheap hotel room for the night. Even then, things
don't take exactly the course you might expect. Later, things are
complicated by Jake's bimboish, pregnant 17-year-old girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte is either inconsistent or complex. ``It's just that
this is my very first time outside of Clarion,'' she tells Jake as
the bus pulls away from the depot in her hometown. But she's
quickly declaring that the town they've traveled to is dirty and
that the photograph of her on the television news programs is
horribly unflattering. And she's not too demure to make flirtatious
comments like, ``Well, you ARE the guy with the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte is, after all, an Anne Tyler character. And Ms.
Tyler's heroines have been know to make bold moves of independence
when the people around them least expect it. Some have also been
known to go home at the end, happier and wiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earthly Possessions,'' directed by James Lapine and adapted by
Steven Rogers, is full of verbal and physical humor. One of the
finest moments is Charlotte standing beside the table at the dance
hall patiently, waiting for Jake to pull out her chair for her. The
film's strength is that just when the laughs are coming strong, a
character will say something to reverse the tone completely (like
``Don't make me hurt you, Charlotte'' or Charlotte's line to Jake,
spoken somberly, ``I don't want to play anymore''). Are the people
we care about really on our side, or are loyalties always a matter
of changing circumstance? &UR;  &LR; Is life really light comedy or tense
drama? In the world as seen through ``Earthly Possessions,'' it's
never completely clear until the end.

   KOSOVO-CLINTON (Washington) _ With NATO air strikes looming,
President Clinton on Friday spelled out the need for risky American
military action in Kosovo if Serbian leaders are bent on
aggression. The allied nations must act, he said, because
``hesitation is a license to kill.'' (Summary wires). By John M.
Broder.

   CLINTON (Washington) _ News from President Clinton's news
conference Friday afternoon. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-MONEY (Washington) _ President Clinton's impeachment
appears to have a silver lining _ or at least a green one. Campaign
donations to Democratic coffers have soared, with much of the
giving inspired by the president himself as he crisscrosses the
country, blaming Republicans for trying to bring him down and
thanking his supporters for sticking by him. By Katharine Q.
Seelye.

   LIBYA-MANDELA (United Nations) _ Nelson Mandela, in Libya, says
the Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has promised in a letter to the
United Nations to hand over the suspects accused of the bombing
over Lockerbie, Scotland, by April 6. By Paul Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   SAUDI-RECESSION (Jidda, Saudi Arabia) _ Faced with a recession,
soaring unemployment and declining incomes, Saudi Arabia is
undergoing a transformation, and what once seemed inconceivable is
slowly becoming the order of the day. The government, famous for
free health and education programs and lavish military spending,
and for never collecting a nickel's worth of taxes, has announced
deep spending cuts concentrated in defense and security, even
putting on hold a $1.7 billion arms deal. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY-REPORT (New York) _ Two years ago, Gov. George Pataki gave
the trustees of the chronically troubled City University of New
York a new chairwoman with a mandate to steer the university in a
new direction. Less than five months later, the trustees got a
golden chance to carry out that mandate when Chancellor W. Ann
Reynolds resigned after repeated attacks from the board. But in the
20 months since, the opening the trustees created has turned into a
yawning gulf. Not only has the board failed to find a permanent
chancellor. It is not even interviewing candidates, the search
process having broken down last summer. And other top executives at
the university have drifted away one by one. By Karen W. Arenson.

JUDGE SETS DATE FOR LAWYER SEEKING MILLIONS FROM WORK ON TOBACCO
DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A Houston lawyer who tentatively was awarded
$260 million for advising the state in its multibillion-dollar
tobacco settlement has been ordered to appear before a federal
judge to defend the fee.
</P>
<P>
   Marc D. Murr this week was instructed to appear May 6 in
Texarkana before U.S. District Judge David Folsom to ``show cause''
why his fee award should not be nullified.
</P>
<P>
   A national arbitration panel had awarded Murr only $1 million,
but &UR;  &LR; Murr has asserted he's due far more under a state arbitration
panel decision that was based on his outside-counsel contracts with
then-Attorney General Dan Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Some state legislators and other attorneys involved in the
tobacco negotiations have argued for months that Murr's role was an
obscure one not worth a quarter of a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Also fighting that claim is Morales' Republican successor,
Attorney General John Cornyn, who last month asked Folsom to
dismiss Murr's claim.
</P>
<P>
   Folsom indicated that he could negate the larger fee
recommendation because of Murr's ``failure to comply'' with a
January 1998 court ruling in which the judge said the ultimate
award had to be approved by representatives of the state, Murr and
the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court has never selected any panel member for such an
arbitration,'' Folsom said in his order, dated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   By inference, the judge said the fee was worked out only by
representatives of Murr and his longtime friend Morales, who
engineered the $17 billion settlement with tobacco companies to
recoup state expenses for decades of smoking-related health care.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7, 1998, the state arbitration panel agreed to a fee
equalling 1.5 percent of the settlement, the court said. But if
Murr ``contends such an award is binding against the state of
Texas,'' he'll have to prove he complied with Folsom's order 14
months ago mandating that the court be represented on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Murr has not formally asked Folsom to enforce the state panel's
decision, but state attorneys have said they want to preclude that
from happening by getting the claim dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   In asking Folsom to dismiss the claim, Cornyn contends that Murr
should petition the Legislature for any award above the $1 million
recommended by the national arbitration panel. That panel reviewed
all attorneys' fees and awarded $3.3 billion to five other private
lawyers who developed the case for Morales and $1 million to Murr.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Cornyn said, ``I am encouraged that Judge Folsom has
ordered Mr. Murr to `show cause' why his claim of $260 million in
taxpayers' money should not be thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
   Murr did not return phone messages left Friday at his Houston
office.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Schenkkan, an attorney for Texas lawmakers who intervened
in the case to fight the higher fee, said the judge ``can throw the
claim completely out, and I assume, in addition, he can order
sanctions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JIDDA, Saudi Arabia _ Not long ago, most Saudis scorned greasy
spoons like Abu Zeid's.
</P>
<P>
   With barrels of oil money, they preferred the glitz of American
fast food or the cachet of French cuisine to the fluorescent
lighting, Formica tabletops and cheap mashed beans of Abu Zeid's.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with a recession, soaring unemployment and declining
incomes, Saudi Arabia is undergoing a transformation, and what once
seemed inconceivable is slowly becoming the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The government, famous for free health and education programs
and lavish military spending, and for never collecting a nickel's
worth of taxes, has announced deep spending cuts concentrated in
defense and security, even putting on hold a $1.7 billion arms
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Further steps are possible, including eliminating longtime
utility subsidies and even opening the long-closed kingdom, ever so
slightly, to foreign tourists and U.S. oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Among ordinary Saudis, long the world's most voracious
consumers, the change is visible among shoppers who are forsaking
luxury goods and bellying up for dish of mashed beans at Abu Zeid's
for 55 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are hungry you will take anything to fill your
stomach,'' said Ibrahim, 49, a retired air force officer and father
of eight, including two unemployed sons, all of whom live at home.
``And we are hungry now; we are in need.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades Saudi Arabia, with its vast oil
reserves, successfully walled itself off from the world beyond.
Even when oil prices dipped, its spending was sacrosanct.
</P>
<P>
   But the shock of the last year, in which oil prices slid 40
percent, has made clear to just about everyone that old habits must
die _ a conclusion that has not come without anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the river dries out, where do the fishermen go?'' asked
Abdullah Dabbagh, chief adviser to the Saudi Chamber of Commerce
and a member of the country's Majlis al-Shura, or consultative
council. ``If we dry out, where do we go?''
</P>
<P>
   In Jidda, the country's commercial center on the Red Sea, the
grim moods are reflected on the faces of anxious merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are going to be hard times,'' said a luxury car salesman
who would give his name only as Maher. He said car sales had fallen
50 percent since late last year. ``Hopefully we can find a way to
survive and overcome, because I can't imagine a dark future.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the country's oil income plunged by about 40 percent or
$20 billion, a result of the worldwide decline in prices. Having
crept into surplus for two years running, the Saudi budget fell
deeply back into the red, with a deficit of $13 billion, three
times what had been predicted. It was the biggest deficit since the
end of the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have spurted recently under a Saudi plan to slash
worldwide production. But to carry that off, the country has
pledged to cut its own production by more than 5 percent, something
that will limit its ability to recover lost income and will leave
it with continuing deficits. The plan is expected to be considered
March 23 at a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Saudi Arabia is in recession, its first in six
years. The economy is expected to shrink in real terms this year by
about 2 percent _ the deepest decline since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   With mounting deficits, the national debt is soaring and the
cost of interest alone consumes 15 percent of the budget. That has
put pressure on the currency, the riyal, the value of which is
pegged to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Average income has sagged, down to $6,300 in 1998, as measured
by gross domestic product per capita _ two-thirds of the level just
nine years ago. Unemployment is rising, with an estimated 100,000
young men every year entering a job market with little growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year, our eyes have been opened to things we
haven't seen before,'' said Said al-Shaikh, chief economist for the
National Commercial Bank. ``There is no doubt these are major
challenges for Saudi Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, everyday life in Saudi Arabia has not had the
gold-plated vistas that immediately greet most foreign visitors:
the new-model cars, high-end shops and wide, modern highways.
</P>
<P>
   Average income peaked nearly two decades ago, at more than
$28,000 in 1981, when they equaled those in the United States. It
has fallen ever since, diluted by the diminishing real price of oil
and by the country's soaring population, growing at 3.4 percent a
year, the world's 20th fastest rate.
</P>
<P>
   This year, average income is expected to fall again, to just
$5,700, one-fifth that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the big cities, shopping is still done at open-air
markets, not air-conditioned malls, and what passes for
entertainment might be a visit to a male-only drive-in featuring
television programs, with old sets balanced on tabletops at the
edge of the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Saudis say, the effect of mounting economic troubles has
become evident in the last year. Sharp cuts in agricultural
subsidies have brought migrants to the desert outside the capital,
Riyadh. In that city's outlying areas, young children can sometimes
be seen peddling tissues at traffic lights, providing a glimpse of
new poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In cities like Taif, two hours northeast of Jidda, and Abha, in
the kingdom's mountainous south, residents say they have opened
their doors to poor Saudis knocking in search of food. Some 45
percent of all Saudis are now 14 and under, and the fear is that
the hard times might only get worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really worried about my boys and my daughters,'' said
Ibrahim, who like most ordinary Saudis willing to speak frankly
about the country's economic difficulties would do so only on
condition that his full name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   In cutting spending, the Saudis will allow many defense
contracts to expire, and have also warned American and other
defense contractors that they plan to stretch out hundreds of
millions of dollars in payments that would otherwise have been due
this year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other big victims include the Saudi energy sector, particularly
among contractors employed by the government-owned oil company,
Saudi Aramco, whose budget for exploration and construction has
been virtually eliminated this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Saudis have shown signs that they at last
be willing to embrace changes aimed at attracting new revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Crown Prince Abdullah, the country's effective
monarch, cracked open a door closed since the 1970s, by inviting
U.S. oil companies to propose how they might again play a role in
the kingdom's energy industry. In the short term, diplomats say,
any role offered to them is likely to be limited, but even that
change would reflect a new openness to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also in the last 18 months permitted foreign
tourists to visit the kingdom for the first time, in an experiment
that many entrepreneurs hope will help create a new industry.
</P>
<P>
   A main focus has been Asir Province in the south where mountains
soar to 10,000 feet and preparations have now begun for a college
of tourism to help serve an expected influx of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Saudis and residents from gulf countries _ lured by
cool weather, Swiss-built cable cars, and family-friendly amusement
parks _ have become regular summertime visitors to the region, but
the Saudi government had never before issued tourist visas to other
foreigners in a determination to protect the country's strict
Islamic culture.
</P>
<P>
   But even within the royal family, many people are saying that
the government should find a way to accommodate foreigners _
particularly those who might pay top dollar to visit Saudi Arabia's
unspoiled Red Sea reefs and its vast Empty Quarter desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government has been very cautious about the effect
of hundreds of thousands of people from other cultures who would
offend local people without even knowing about it,'' Prince Bandar
bin Khalid, deputy chairman of Asir's tourism council.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I suggest is that we build enclaves on the Red Sea, only
for foreign and non-Muslim tourists, and within the enclave, they
can do anything they want,'' Prince Bandar said. ``As long as the
people don't see the tourists except when they are dressed
properly, that's fine. Of course, the religious people and the
extremists won't like it, but they won't have to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Asir, where tourism provides the only new jobs, local people
say they are grateful for any new business they can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the better,'' said Mohammed al-Alkemi, a merchant who
wore a traditional silver dagger in his belt as he sold honey in
the market in Abha, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Saudi Arabia has announced austerity measures before,
only to postpone them as economic prospects improved.
</P>
<P>
   In what was to have been a first step toward eliminating costly
government subsidies, it doubled the price of gasoline in 1995, and
announced a plan to install Saudis in government and private sector
jobs held by foreigners. Progress in both areas. however, has been
slow.
</P>
<P>
   With many Saudis unable or unwilling to take on difficult work
at low pay, foreigners _ most of them other Arabs and South Asians
_ still account for 67 percent of the government work force, and
they hold a staggering 95 percent of private sector jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The economic weakness now confronting the kingdom may finally be
driving home the message that change is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   A soaring level of debt driven upward by uncontrolled spending
now amounts to $130 billion, equivalent to the country's total
economic output and the debt is expected to swell by another $14
billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   At least officially, the Saudis have so far managed to finance
most of that debt at home _ only $7 billion is owed abroad _ but
strains are beginning to show.
</P>
<P>
   With Saudi banks drawn to the limit, the government has had to
rely heavily on its pension funds and other sources, including
Saudi Aramco, the Saudi oil company, which is officially autonomous
but last year borrowed more than $4 billion from foreign banks and
promptly transferred it to the treasury, Saudi bankers say.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the cash crunch, diplomats say, the government now
postpones payments to Saudi contractors for as long as two months,
then settles its debts in Saudi bonds instead of cash.
</P>
<P>
   A further indication of trouble came in January, when the
Moody's Investors Service downgraded Saudi bonds to junk status, in
what it called a reaction to the size and growth of the
government's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Those developments have caught the eye of international currency
speculators, who have put substantial pressure on the currency
recently by betting that the government's economic problems will
make it impossible for Saudi Arabia to maintain its rate of 3.75 to
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and economists say that Saudi Arabia has enough foreign
exchange to stave off that pressure. But the battle has cost the
Saudis billions of dollars in foreign currency reserves since
August, they say, and it was almost certainly the reason for murky
transaction late last year in which as much as $5 billion is
believed to have been transferred to Saudi Arabia by the United
Arab Emirates as part of a secret currency swap.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Kevin Taecker, chief economist of the Saudi American
Bank in Riyadh, a devaluation as early as next year is not at all
out of the question.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, March 19 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: S. MISSILE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 97-3, a bill to deploy an
anti-missile defense system for the United States. Supporters said
that the defense system is important to national security and would
also create jobs. Opponents said that the U.S. should be looking
for ways to stop the spread of existing weapons of mass destruction
rather than spending billions of dollars on unproven defense
systems. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: CHINA
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday voted 69-30 to table, or set aside, a
proposal that would have required congressional approval before the
United States could support admitting China into the World Trade
Organization. Supporters of the tabled motion said that Congress
needs to be involved in the decision in order to prevent any
``hasty deals'' with China. The bill's opponents said that the U.S.
economy will benefit greatly by China's admittance, and that the
proposal is unnecessary. A ``yes'' vote favors tabling the
proposal.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PALESTINE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 380-24, a resolution asking
President Clinton to oppose any Palestinian unilateral declaration
of independence. Supporters said that a declaration of statehood
would be a violation of the Oslo Accords, which outlined a
timetable for a peace settlement between Israel and Palestine.
Opponents said that the resolution is unnecessary since the Clinton
administration has already stated its opposition to a Palestinian
declaration of independence. A ``yes'' vote favors the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: STEEL
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 289-141, a bill to limit the
amount of steel imported into the United States. The bill would
also impose a steel notification and monitoring program on all
steel imports. Supporters said the measure is needed because the
Clinton administration has not taken the proper measures to address
the ``illegal dumping'' of foreign steel into the U.S. Opponents
said the bill is too radical and would interfere with free trade. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: H. MISSILE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 317-105, a bill to deploy an
anti-missile defense system for the United States. Although it does
not appropriate funding, the bill states that the defense system
against ballistic missile attacks should be deployed ``as soon as
technologically possible.'' Supporters said that all Americans
should be protected in case of a ballistic missile attack.
Opponents said that the defense system would not ensure protection
of the U.S., and would negatively affect efforts to remove Russia's
nuclear weapons. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, March 21, move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scheduled for the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-DEFENSE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The nation is fast moving
toward developing a national missile defense. When viewed as a
domestic political issue, it seems surprising that the former
divisiveness over the question seems to be suddenly, magically
melting away. But don't be fooled. As an international political
and diplomatic issue, the surprise is that it's more contentious
than ever. By William Schmitt. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   ECON-JITTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Dow floats near 10,000. Jobs
are plentiful. Wages are rising. Spending is everywhere. The
economy booms, month after month. And nothing seems to shake the
public sense of prosperity. So why are the oracles of the economy
talking like Nervous Nellies? Because this is not only the biggest
economic expansion in history but also the most atypical. By Louis
Uchitelle. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SMALL-ISSUES-REVIEW (Washington) _ If Bill Clinton shrunk the
presidency from a wellspring of grand ideas to a trickle of
itsy-bitsy proposals, then Al Gore, Elizabeth Dole and other
would-be successors are going further by addressing seemingly
unpresidential issues like traffic congestion and lights in
airplane passenger aisles. These appeals to everyday life may
reflect a radical change in what people expect from a president.
Talking about small issues may be a way of avoiding larger ones
that are more difficult, perhaps impossible, to deal with. By
Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-HANGERS-ON-REVIEW (Washington) _ Former New Jersey
Gov. Jim Florio wants to run for the Senate. Former Rep. Bob Dornan
of California and former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York signal
that they may want to run again for their old jobs. Like ghosts of
elections past, defeated politicians trying to reclaim old glory
demand attention from voters and the media. But the people they
often end up scaring the most are members of their own parties. By
James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET-AUSTERITY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Pledges of budgetary
austerity are emanating from both parties in a way they never did
when the outlook was bleak. Given that Washington's commitment to
fiscal discipline was notably absent during the 1980s and early
1990s when it was needed most, it seems fair to wonder whether this
bipartisan outbreak of responsibility will prove more than a
passing political fad. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   PORN-PALACE-REVIEW (West Hollywood, Calif.) _ Hustler Hollywood
is a 9,000-square-foot up-market sex emporium. With its
floor-to-ceiling windows and coffee bar, it unashamedly pitches
erotica. Opened last December, its sleek design, aromatic candles
and Kama Sutra massage oils are intended to appeal to women. It is
the flagship of what owner Larry Flynt hopes will be a nationwide
Hustler chain. By Frances Anderton.
</P>
<P>
   SEX-BOOK-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ In 1969, Dr. David Reuben
published the groundbreaking book `Everything You Always Wanted to
Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask.' Now, 30 years later, comes
an updated edition. Some idea of the revisions can be gleaned by
comparing some of the tamer passages of his book's two editions.
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR-PRISON-REVIEW (Undated) _ The most exclusive Oscar party
of all will take place in the Louisiana State Penitentiary at
Angola, the setting for `The Farm,' which was nominated for best
feature documentary. The guest of honor will be Wilbert Rideau,
convicted of murder 38 years ago, who co-directed `The Farm' with
New York filmmakers Liz Garbus and Jonathan Stack. He is not named
on the nomination because an Academy Awards rule permits only two
names per documentary. By Elin Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   BRAND-DIVERSIFICATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Retailers and makers of
products from T-shirts to watering cans are broadening their pitch,
selling their wares by marketing an entire way of living. Once
people get to know a brand's most famous product, the thinking
goes, they will trust that brand to deliver any number of items,
even if the original product has no relationship to the subsequent
stuff the company markets. By Jennifer Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-SNAFU-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a form letter from Arizona
State University, a prospective student's Social Security number
was inadvertently substituted for his name. The university says
only a handful of such faulty letters were mailed _ out of
thousands sent out recently by the college's parents association _
and the glitch has been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in he `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   SADDAM-MILOSEVIC-REVIEW (Undated) _ Iraq's Saddam Hussein and
Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic are similar in that both have become
experts at cornering the world's only superpower, frustrating its
diplomatic strategists, tying down its military and daring the U.S.
to use force to get its way. Each has laid bare the lack of a
Western strategy to deal with dictators who, simply by continuing
in power, further weaken the ability of their peoples to resist. By
Alison Smale.
</P>
<P>
   LATAM-TAXES-REVIEW (Quito, Ecuador) _ With governments all over
Latin America coming under pressure from the IMF and other lenders
to cut yawning budget deficits, there is a growing recognition that
the region's historical and deeply ingrained aversion to paying
taxes is crippling development and poisoning citizens' attitudes
about their societies and governments. By Larry Rohter.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will bubble up near the central Gulf
Coast Saturday as a weakening but still formidable disturbance taps
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Moderate to heavy rains are
possible, particularly across southern parts of Louisiana and
Mississippi. Showers and a few storms also will eventually develop
across southern sections of Alabama and Georgia. On the northern
flank of the system, broken areas of generally lighter rains will
spread slowly but inexorably from the lower Mississippi Valley
toward the southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   With Gulf moisture being monopolized by the disturbance, only
broken areas of light rain or light snow will develop over the
upper Middle West in conjunction with a cold front plunging
southeastward from Canada. Meanwhile, milder air will build into
the eastern Great Lakes region ahead of the front, though
northwesterly winds off the chilly waters of Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario will limit any warm-up in lakeshore communities.
</P>
<P>
   Brisk winds from the northwest will average 15 to 25 mph along
the Northeast Seaboard Saturday as the stirring of the lower
atmosphere by abundant sunshine allows momentum from fairly strong
winds aloft to mix toward the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and a few thunderstorms will accompany a cold,
upper-level low pressure system from California into Nevada and
southern Idaho. Small hail could accompany a few of the
thunderstorms as they pivot eastward over central California.
Moderate snows will fall over the Sierra Nevada. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Spring Ahead &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The astronomical beginning of spring occurs Saturday at 8:46
p.m. EST, when the direct noon rays of the sun strike the equator
over the central Pacific. The distinction between the astronomical
and the meteorological start of spring is one of perspective. Many
meteorologists subscribe to March 1 as the beginning of spring,
signifying the three-month transition between the three coldest
months and the three warmest months, on average. Regardless of
which definition is used, winter weather can intrude on spring.
Incorrigible winter never adheres to the calendar.

CLINTON MAKES CASE OF ACTION AGAINST SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Friday staunchly defended
preparations for U.S. involvement in the Serbian province of
Kosovo, warning that the killing of women and children had
``crossed the threshold'' for military action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate to think that we would have to see any more
little children die before we do what is right,'' Clinton said at
his first full-fledged press conference in nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   The president acknowledged that NATO aerial attacks against
Serbian military positions in and around the Kosovo province would
endanger American pilots, saying, ``U.S. and other NATO pilots will
be put in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, frustrated international mediators adjourned
the Kosovo peace talks and said they would not resume unless the
Serbs decide to accept the accord, which was signed by ethnic
Albanian leaders but rebuffed by President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia, which is dominated by Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton did not impose a signing deadline on the Serbs,
he implied that possible military intervention was near, saying
that ``hesitation leads to death'' in the volatile region of
southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, Serbian leaders, who have authorized the killing
of women and children, have already crossed the threshold needed
for NATO action,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
has claimed more than 2,000 lives in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo once enjoyed relative autonomy as a province of Serbia.
But Milosevic has gradually stripped away self rule, triggering a
rebellion in Kosovo last year that has led to violence between
rebels and Serbian forces, including recent mass killings of
civilians that are blamed on Serbians.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2.2 million people are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton described Kosovo as primarily a ``humanitarian
crisis,'' he said the fighting in the province threatened to engulf
the entire region by igniting ancient animosities in countries such
as Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the president met with congressional leaders
to lay out his case for possible U.S.-led intervention involving
other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the meeting, Senate Armed Services Committee
Chairman John Warner, R-Va., said, ``I think the meeting added
momentum toward the Senate supporting the president and NATO in
this action.''
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with Clinton, Senate leaders delayed until Monday
legislation that could block money for any U.S. military
involvement in the Serbian province without prior congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered five
Navy jet fighters to join the American fleet of more 200 warplanes
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   During his press conference, the president also addressed the
mushrooming scandal involving China's alleged theft of nuclear
weapons technology from a federal laboratory and allegations of lax
security measures by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that we in the White House have done everything
we could have done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born American engineer
working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, was
fired after allegations arose that he helped China learn the design
of an advanced nuclear warhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a crime was committed, anybody who committed it should be
punished,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But the president cautioned that his advisers had not yet
determined conclusively that any espionage had occurred. ``Nobody
has reported that to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the president ordered a review of security at U.S.
nuclear labs. The review will be undertaken by the president's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a bipartisan and independent
panel headed by former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H. The review is
expected to take 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has announced
plans for tightened security at the laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee, complained that security at Los
Alamos and at other facilities has been ``too loose too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice chairman of the committee, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.,
also was critical, saying of security measures, ``I no longer have
confidence we are doing it right.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ International monitors were ordered Friday to pull out
of Kosovo, and Western embassies ordered their nonessential staff
to leave Yugoslavia after peace talks here collapsed and NATO
renewed threats to bomb unless President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia accepted a peace plan for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is likely to be as long and as difficult as President
Milosevic wants to make it,'' warned Gen. Wesley Clark, the
alliance's supreme commander, at his headquarters in Belgium on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton called in congressional leaders
for a briefing on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials in Brussels said that no decision on bombing
would be made until all 1,400 cease-fire monitors were safely out.
They also said it looked unlikely that an order to bomb would come
on Sunday unless events on the ground forced NATO's hand.
</P>
<P>
   France and Britain ended the peace talks here after Serbian
delegates repeated earlier objections to accords providing autonomy
for Kosovo and 28,000 NATO peacekeepers to enforce the agreement.
Representatives of the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo signed
the accords, worked out in Rambouillet castle near here last month,
on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   With the Serbs refusing even to talk about peacekeeping
arrangements, there was no point in continuing the talks, a
statement Friday morning by the French and British foreign
ministers said. They agreed to reconvene negotiations only when the
Serbs had changed their minds and agreed to accept the accords too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rambouillet accords are the only peaceful solution to the
Kosovo problem,'' the statement by the French foreign minister,
Hubert Vedrine, and the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook,
said. ``Far from seizing this opportunity, the Yugoslav delegation
has tried to unravel the Rambouillet accords.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will immediately engage in consultations with our partners
and allies to be ready to act,'' they said. ``We solemnly warn the
authorities in Belgrade against any military offensive on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark told reporters that there were between 14,000 and 16,000
heavily armed Serbian police in Kosovo; 17,000 to 20,000 Yugoslav
army troops, and another 5,000 to 10,000 troops just outside the
borders, all with hundreds of tanks, armored vehicles and artillery
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian forces could pose a threat not only to the civilians
in Kosovo but also to the monitors there and to the 10,000 NATO
troops gathered in nearby Macedonia to lead the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   A separate European NATO force under French command is prepared
to go in from Macedonia and pluck out the monitors if the Serbs try
to keep them from leaving. The monitors, part of a cease-fire
mission by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in
Europe, were ordered Friday by the Norwegian foreign minister, the
organization's chairman, to start leaving by road for Macedonia on
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far the local Yugoslav army and political authorities have
been very cooperative,'' Melissa Fleming, a spokesperson for the
organization in Vienna, Austria, said Friday night. ``If there is
no obstruction, the observers could all be in Macedonia by Saturday
afternoon,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave the decision to bomb in the hands of NATO's
secretary-general, Javier Solana of Spain. The allies gave him
authority at the end of January to bomb Serbian targets and
Yugoslav military installations if that was what it took to get
Milosevic to accept the agreement and the peacekeepers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when he was president of Serbia, Milosevic
abrogated autonomy for Kosovo province, which would remain a part
of Yugoslavia under the accord the Serbs rejected, at least for a
three-year transition period.
</P>
<P>
   Solana has said he would consult with leaders of the United
States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia, the six
countries that had convened the negotiations here, and with other
allies before he decides what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has always been opposed to any bombing in Serbia, and it
is possible that either Russia or some Western country may want to
try to make one more run at Milosevic in Belgrade before the planes
are launched.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's military authorities have long been planning two
separate waves of air strikes aimed at forcing a change in the
Serbian position.
</P>
<P>
   The first wave, a short, sharp strike that could come within
hours of an order from Solana to Clark, the allied military
commander, would launch warplanes including B-52s and pilotless
cruise missiles from U.S. Navy ships in the Adriatic Sea to strike
selected Serbian military targets.
</P>
<P>
   The second wave, a phased set of attacks against air defense
systems throughout Yugoslav territory in Serbia and Montenegro,
would be aimed at rendering those defenses harmless in case the
allies decide later to continue bombing other targets.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have never wanted, as one French policy-maker put it,
to become the air force of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which wanted
independence for the province but settled for autonomy for the
three-year transition period when they signed the accord.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic has changed the situation on the ground in Kosovo
in recent weeks, violating earlier pledges to reduce his police and
military forces in the province and moving in tens of thousands of
soldiers and special police.
</P>
<P>
   A military offensive by those forces now, or an attempt to keep
the unarmed international observers from leaving, would have ``the
gravest consequences,'' Vedrine and Cook warned Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   William Walker, the American diplomat leading the OSCE observer
missions, said Friday, ``The fact that we pull out does not mean
there are not eyes and ears telling the world what is happening.''
He added, ``The world will know if anyone uses force.''
</P>
<P>
   About 22 percent of the 2 million people of Kosovo, 443,000
people, have been driven from their homes since Milosevic started
attacking the rebels a year ago, the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees said Friday. About 90 percent of the population in Kosovo
is ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   All the Western allies say they would prefer capitulation by
Milosevic over going ahead with air strikes, but even France,
usually the most reluctant to use force, sounds tough this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Milosevic bears the entire responsibility for the
situation and for its consequences,'' French President Jacques
Chirac said Friday after a meeting with the German chancellor,
Gerhard Schroeder, who agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   But if bombs do start to fall on Kosovo or even on Belgrade in
coming days, one consequence will be the end of the allies'
painstaking efforts to keep Russia with them on getting Milosevic
to come around.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, March 19 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: S. MISSILE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 97-3, a bill to deploy an
anti-missile defense system for the United States. Supporters said
that the defense system is important to national security and would
also create jobs. Opponents said that the U.S. should be looking
for ways to stop the spread of existing weapons of mass destruction
rather than spending billions of dollars on unproven defense
systems. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: CHINA
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday voted 69-30 to table, or set aside, a
proposal that would have required congressional approval before the
United States could support admitting China into the World Trade
Organization. Supporters of the tabled motion said that Congress
needs to be involved in the decision in order to prevent any
``hasty deals'' with China. The bill's opponents said that the U.S.
economy will benefit greatly by China's admittance, and that the
proposal is unnecessary. A ``yes'' vote favors tabling the
proposal.

   1) BILL NUMBER: PALESTINE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 380-24, a resolution asking
President Clinton to oppose any Palestinian unilateral declaration
of independence. Supporters said that a declaration of statehood
would be a violation of the Oslo Accords, which outlined a
timetable for a peace settlement between Israel and Palestine.
Opponents said that the resolution is unnecessary since the Clinton
administration has already stated its opposition to a Palestinian
declaration of independence. A ``yes'' vote favors the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: STEEL
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 289-141, a bill to limit the
amount of steel imported into the United States. The bill would
also impose a steel notification and monitoring program on all
steel imports. Supporters said the measure is needed because the
Clinton administration has not taken the proper measures to address
the ``illegal dumping'' of foreign steel into the U.S. Opponents
said the bill is too radical and would interfere with free trade. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: H. MISSILE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 317-105, a bill to deploy an
anti-missile defense system for the United States. Although it does
not appropriate funding, the bill states that the defense system
against ballistic missile attacks should be deployed ``as soon as
technologically possible.'' Supporters said that all Americans
should be protected in case of a ballistic missile attack.
Opponents said that the defense system would not ensure protection
of the U.S., and would negatively affect efforts to remove Russia's
nuclear weapons. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21)  
 (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contemporary investors seem to have condemned to the mists of
time the lessons of ``Small is Beautiful,'' the 1973 book by the
late E.F. Schumacher that extolled the benefits of all things
micro. Based on recent history, big is best is now the philosophy
of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher had a point. It used to be that earnings at small
companies grew more rapidly than their large-capitalization
cousins. Over time, that meant their stock prices tended to
outperform the behemoths that dwell in averages like the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   But from 1993 through 1998, small-cap stocks didn't do nearly as
well as large caps. And nothing has changed this year: Through
Friday, the Russell 2000 index, a small-stock benchmark, was down 6
percent; the S&AMP;P 500 was up 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These are not favorable developments for those who follow this
asset class. Claudia E. Mott, director of small-cap research at
Prudential Securities, took some time last week to talk about when
small might again be beautiful. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)At the end of last year, you were quite optimistic
about a rally in small-cap stocks. That hasn't happened. What went
wrong?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. During the fourth quarter of last year, I thought we would
have a rally that would last from six months to a year. It lasted
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Two major things happened. Small-company earnings, which had
been very good relative to big caps earlier in the year, started to
fall apart and are now in a position of weakness vis-a-vis the
large caps.
</P>
<P>
   Second, in the fourth quarter, mutual funds flow data started to
turn negative. That set us back into a tough market, where a lot of
managers had to sell stock to deal with redemptions.
</P>
<P>
   According to my calculations, February may have been a record
redemption month for small-cap funds. So, I feel we are back to
square one again, unfortunately. Right now, there is no convincing
reason to buy small caps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What is going to turn things around for small caps?
Don't they look like screaming buys compared with big-cap
stocks?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I really don't know what will turn this, and I'm running out
of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the normal things we look at just aren't working:
valuations, good earnings growth, a strong dollar and cuts in the
capital gains rate and the discount rate. All of those things
should tend to generate a fairly substantial rally.
</P>
<P>
   That said, I don't think the case for small-cap stocks is done.
Just when you think they are all washed up is probably the time
when things will turn around. I do know it won't take much money to
get it started. But I don't know what will trigger it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)There a lot of serious folks who believe that a
correction in big-cap valuations is long overdue. If that happens,
will a sharp slide in big-cap stocks bury the small caps?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. During most correction periods, the small-cap market does not
tend to be a shining star. But in the correction that took place
between 1976 and 1978, when the last Nifty 50 unraveled, the
small-cap market rallied about 25 percent when the large caps were
down about 11.5 percent. If lightning strikes twice, perhaps we
don't have to get totally annihilated if the large-cap market pulls
back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What sort of tactics are managers of small-cap
mutual funds employing to deal with this downturn?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They may be moving some money into cash, but using cash as a
defensive mechanism is not a good idea because it is not what these
managers were hired to do. Also, they are moving up into somewhat
bigger stocks with capitalizations of around $1 billion, compared
with a stock with a market cap of $300 million, because the
liquidity is better.
</P>
<P>
   But I haven't seen a lot of funds closing down. That issue is
more applicable to institutions like pension funds. Some have given
up on the sector, but not in a wholesale fashion. If you started to
see that, you would have had a much harder market. But keeping the
temperature of the institutional side of the business is one of the
things we are trying to keep a handle on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)There must be companies and industries within the
small-cap universe that you like.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I can't talk about specific companies. But we look at a model
combining valuation with earnings momentum. Based on those
criteria, we like home building, building materials, savings and
loans, computer software and peripherals and trucking companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)At base, what is the case for small caps?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, history is what history is. Perhaps there are some
seasonal patterns to when small caps do well, but you need them for
diversification. Small caps represent almost 85 percent of the
listed companies on the three major exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that concerns me is that a lot of people will get left
behind when this group comes back, because they chose to get out.

CLINTON SAYS IT'S `VERY IMPORTANT' TO TELL THE TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, confronted with a question at
his news conference Friday on what he thought his legacy on lying
will be, said young people should learn from his experience that
``there are consequences'' when a president doesn't tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   At his first solo press conference in 11 months, Clinton was
asked the question in the context of his many denials last year
that he had had an affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. ``What do you think your legacy will be about lying?''
asked Jan Smith of Fox News. ``And how important do you think it is
to tell the truth, especially under oath?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, looking solemn, replied, ``I think it's very important.
And I think that what young people will learn from my experience is
that even presidents have to do that, and that there are
consequences when you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he defended his record, adding, ``But I also think that
there will be a box score, and there will be that one negative. And
then there will be the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times
when the record will show that I did not abuse my authority as
president, that I was truthful with the American people, and scores
and scores of allegations were made against me and widely
publicized without any regard to whether they were true or not.
Most of them have already been actually proved false.''
</P>
<P>
   The president concluded, ``So I would hope that there would be a
higher regard for truth-telling by all people in public life and
all those who report on it.''
</P>
<P>
   His response was the most extensive answer he has given to the
question of what lessons he learned from the year-long impeachment
drama that ended Feb. 12 with his acquittal in the Senate on
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   During that time he dropped many of his denials and admitted
that he had given misleading answers as well as responses that were
not helpful to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the legal team
representing Paula Jones in her now-settled sexual harassment
lawsuit. But he insisted he had not lied under oath, even when he
denied having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dodged an opportunity to reflect how he was treated
during the impeachment process and whether he felt any lingering
resentment over it. ``Anything I say or do, or any time I spend ...
on that will detract from my ability to be an effective
president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he declined to address a question about an allegation
by nursing home owner Juanita Broaddrick of Van Buren, Ark., that
Clinton raped her in a Little Rock hotel room in 1978 when he was
state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, an attorney for Clinton, denied the allegation in
a statement last month. ``He speaks for me,'' Clinton said Friday.
``I think he spoke quite clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about books by former White House aide George
Stephanopoulos and political consultant Dick Morris that are
critical of Clinton, the president evoked some chuckling when he
said he had read neither one. But he did say that ``the
overwhelming majority'' of people working in his administration had
been loyal to him and that an unnamed scholar remarked to him that
his was the most loyal cabinet since the presidency of Thomas
Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of whether First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
will run for the U.S. Senate from New York, Clinton said, ``I
literally don't have a clue.'' He added that he thought she
``really would be a terrific senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said that last year, before Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., announced he would not seek reelection, the first
lady had talked to Clinton about moving to New York after they
leave the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's announcement last November set off speculation about
a Hillary Clinton candidacy. Mrs. Clinton was ``just immensely
flattered'' by such talk, Clinton said. ``But I don't have any idea
what she is going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about progress in repairing their relationship in the wake
of the Lewinsky scandal, Clinton said he and Mrs. Clinton are
``working hard, and we love each other very much. And we're working
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended Vice President Al Gore against criticism
directed at suggestions by Gore that he invented the Internet and
had grown up plowing farm fields in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Gore had fought in Congress for federal funds to
aid development of the Internet and had worked on his family's farm
as a boy. He added that Gore ``is, by nature, a reticent person
when it comes to talking about his life and his background.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he would ``be happy to toot his (Gore's) horn
in terms of the years that we've worked together,'' praising Gore's
role in ``all the good things that have happened in this
administration.''

DOW FLIRTS WITH RECORD LEVEL AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   After zipping past the 10,000 milestone Friday morning, the
stock market floated down the rest of the day due to disappointing
news about IBM Corp.'s profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not happen. It tried desperately'' to remain above the
10,000 level, said James Weiss, deputy head of stock investing for
State Street Research &AMP; Management Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial stock average
was down 94.07, or less than 1 percent, finishing an historic week
at 9903.55 after breaking the 10,000 barrier on Tuesday for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Investors on Wall Street and at their computers in remote
locations watched the Dow Friday, and analysts said that the
market's inability to get past 10,000 was one measure of the strong
psychological factors driving stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There either seem to be some gremlins in the closet that chase
the stock market down when it hits 10,000, or there are legitimate
sellers out there that have targeted a certain level as a sell
point,'' said Ned Riley, BankBoston Corp.'s chief investment
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These investors are missing the true concept of investing,''
Riley added. The market's level ``shouldn't dictate how people are
investing long-term monies.''
</P>
<P>
   A 9 1/16 plunge in the shares of IBM and dozens of smaller
technology companies deflated the market after Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter reduced its expectations for Big Blue's stock this year to
195, from 210, due to concerns about a slowdown in computer sales.
IBM closed at 168 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq index declined 41.47 points, or 1.68
percent, and finished the day at 2421.49. The broad Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index declined 17.26 points, closing at 1299.29.
</P>
<P>
   Friday also marked the quarterly ``triple witching'' phenomenon.
Triple witching is the quarterly expiration of contracts on stock
options, index options, and index futures. It typically adds to the
market's volatility as portfolio managers rush to buy or sell
stocks to square their positions. Analysts said that managers
seemed to be selling the market short to protect their portfolios,
a move that also dragged the market down.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Dow's lead, stock markets around the world reacted
favorably to a US rally on Thursday, when the US index of 30 stocks
gained 118 points.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Nikkei index soared 4.2 higher to its best finish since
July 31. Germany's DAX index closed 1.7 percent higher, Britain's
FT-SE 100 rose 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.6 percent.

CLINTON'S OTHER LEGACY IS BIG-TIME FUND RAISING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., N.J.,   ex., Ark., Calif., Fla., Ohio, Nev., N.H. )  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's impeachment appears to have a
silver lining, or at least a green one.
</P>
<P>
   Republican efforts to remove the president from office have
prompted a spurt in campaign donations to Democratic coffers, with
much of the giving inspired by the president himself as he
crisscrosses the country, blames Republicans for trying to bring
him down and thanks his supporters for standing by him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was impeached by the House on Dec. 19 by the House
and acquitted by the Senate on Feb. 12, single-handedly has raised
more than $9 million since mid-January. He has attended more
fund-raising events this year (13) than he has held Cabinet
meetings (1) or met with foreign heads of state (7).
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very big draw, probably our biggest ever,'' said Roy
Romer of Colorado, general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. ``When they see him being attacked in a partisan way as
he was all last year, people rise up and say, `I'm coming to the
table with twice what I gave before.' Receipts are double what we
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer said that Democrats were in ``Alamo syndrome,'' which he
described as fighting back against attacks on the president. As a
recent direct-mail letter from the committee to prospective donors
put it: ``Now is the time for key Democrats to rally around the
president and our party. Otherwise, nothing stands in the way of
the GOP's slash-and-burn tactics. The last Congress focused almost
entirely on investigating instead of legislating.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight weeks, Clinton has raised money for all three
Democratic campaign committees, those of the national party, the
Senate committee and the House committee. He has helped raise money
for two state parties, in New Hampshire and Arkansas, and for two
members of Congress. In one evening earlier this month he brought
in $2 million for Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey
Democrat, who prominently defended him during the impeachment
process. Torricelli is not up for re-election until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, two Democratic fundraisers said that the president
raised ``very little'' money in the first few months of 1997,
estimating that the first quarter's total was less than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The president's calendar is chock-a-block with more events, and
aides say it will only become more crowded as the 2000 campaign
draws closer. He is scheduled to attend Democratic National
Committee fundraisers next week in Cincinnati, Las Vegas and Los
Angeles. Two weeks later he heads for lunch in Detroit and dinner
in Boston to raise money for a joint committee promoting Senate and
House candidates in 2000. That committee alone is scheduling
Clinton for about eight more events this year, with a goal of his
personally bringing in $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The national party still is more than $6 million in debt, but
Romer said that erasing the debt was a lower priority than
organizing the party at the grassroots level to help Democrats
recapture the House and try to pick up seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Such a frenzy of fundraising is unusual for a lame-duck
president. ``He's out raising money like he's running for another
term,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a public
policy group. ``With all the fundraising the president keeps doing,
it may well be that Clinton's legacy is going to be as the greatest
big-money fundraiser in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans typically raise more than Democrats, and Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said that
his committee alone had raised about the same amount of money so
far this year as the president had for all Democratic committees.
But, he said, ``We'd much rather see the president working as the
president and dealing with policy than being in campaign mode.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton speaks at these events, usually for 10 or 15
minutes after dinner, he frequently strays to topics like his
political survival. At the Torricelli dinner, where singer Gloria
Gaynor entertained the crowd, Clinton joked that he was trying to
decide which of her anthems to take as his theme song: ``I Will
Survive,'' or ``Never Can Say Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   His purpose, aides say, is to thank supporters for sticking by
him, to repay what aides describe as his personal debt to members
of Congress who defended him, and, increasingly, to make a point of
what he perceives as his persecution by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, he pulled in half a million dollars for the
Democratic National Committee at a fundraising dinner in Stuart,
Fla.. After the Drifters sang their paean to loyalty, ``Stand By
Me,'' the president said: ``I thought about how the American people
have stood by me through thick and thin. This country has got to
get over believing that our political life is about beating each
other up and hurting people instead of lifting people up and
bringing them together.''
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke Tuesday in Florida, he took with him two
Democratic congressmen from the area, Reps. Peter Deutsch, who may
run for the Senate seat being vacated by Republican Connie Mack,
and Alcee L. Hastings, a former federal judge who, Clinton pointed
out, had been impeached in 1988 and removed from the bench. Unbowed
by his impeachment, Hastings went on to run for public office and
win a seat in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Gary, a Florida trial lawyer who was the host for the
event, said that the donors, many of them African-American, found
the president an inspiration. ``He has refused to be denied, he has
been down but not out, he has been a fighter, and has had, as we
say in the church, to climb the rough side of the mountain,'' Gary
said. ``When you see all he's been through and that he never
considered throwing the towel in, that's inspiration for a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent the previous weekend in his hometown of Little
Rock, Ark., where he helped raise money at a state party dinner
featuring former Sen. Dale Bumpers, who gave the closing speech
last month in Clinton's impeachment trial. He also visited
Texarkana, Texas, where he raised $500,000 for Rep. Max Sandlin,
who served as a deputy whip during Clinton's impeachment in the
House in December and helped hold the Democrats together.
</P>
<P>
   At these events and others, the word ``impeachment'' did not
pass from the president's lips. Instead, he used the word
``Constitution'' as code to convey his argument that his lying
about his affair with a White House intern did not rise to an
impeachable offense as described in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time in the last year when a lot of people just worried
which way the political winds were blowing,'' Clinton said at the
$1,000-per-person dinner for Sandlin, ``that guy was telling people
to read the Constitution of the United States of America.'' The
audience responded with a big applause.

WEST GIRDS FOR KOSOVO ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ A Western group Friday ordered its 1,400 human rights
monitors out of the troubled province of Kosovo Friday, a move that
will leave the warring Serbs and Albanians unwatched and will
heighten the possibility of a long-threatened NATO strike on Serb
targets.
</P>
<P>
   After the Serbs failed to join the ethnic Albanians in signing a
Western-brokered peace pact, President Clinton met with US
congressional leaders and made his most direct call for action to
stop the yearlong conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake; if we and our allies do not have the will to
act, there will be more massacres,'' Clinton said. ``In dealing
with aggressors in the Balkans, hesitation is a license to kill.
But action and resolve can stop armies and save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats scurried out of the Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade Friday to Budapest. The 1,400 monitors for the
Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe's verification
mission were set to take a convoy early Saturday south to
Macedonia. Belgium, Austria, Germany and Britain also urged their
nationals to leave Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am responsible for the safety of approximately 1,400
verifiers from many different countries in Kosovo,'' OSCE chairman
Knut Vollebaek told reporters in Oslo after announcing the order.
``I have no other choice in the present situation than to withdraw
the OSCE personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs, delivering a message through Greek diplomats,
said bluntly that if OSCE left, ``we would not be welcome back,'' a
high-ranking OSCE source said.
</P>
<P>
   OSCE staffers scrambled to pull their belongings together to be
ready to leave at 5 a.m., said Colonel Michael Philips, a military
aide to OSCE mission chief William Walker. ``We worried that our
belonging will be trashed'' at OSCE headquarters, he said. ``A lot
of people here are upset and crying and worried about their
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Western mediators officially dissolved the sputtering peace
talks in Paris Friday, saying the Serbs' unwavering refusal to sign
the pact made it useless to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no purpose in extending the talks any further,'' the
mediators said in a statement. Russia's foreign minister, Igor
Ivanov, said he disagreed with the OSCE pullout. Russia is a
traditional ally of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A Contact Group of six Western nations has been trying to forge
a pact between the Serb-dominated government of Yugoslavia, inside
whose borders Kosovo lies, and the ethnic Albanians, who make up
about 90 percent of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Western-drafted pact, which would give broad autonomy to
Kosovo and severely limit Yugoslav control over its own, southern
province, was signed by Albanian representatives. By refusing to
sign, the Serbs face a punitive air assault by NATO _ a threat made
more acute by Friday's decision to withdraw the monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will immediately engage in consultations with our partners
and allies to be ready to act,'' the co-chairs of the Paris talks,
British Foreign Minister Robin Cook and French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine, said in their statement.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus is meant to protect monitors from being harmed or
taken hostage should NATO follow through on its bomb threat. But
the pullout also means Kosovo could become a violent free-for-all
between the army of the ruling Serbs and the guerrilla force of the
ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's nobody watching, the Albanians are at the mercy of
the Serbs. And we know what kind of mercy they show,'' said Jason
Miko, an aid worker with Mercy Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worried,'' said the high-ranking OSCE source. ``We've
got indications that they're absolutely going to wreak havoc. It's
going to be a really ugly scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign observers are also skeptical about the plans of the KLA.
Both sides have violated the October cease-fire, and both sides
have been accused of provoking the other, hoping to lay blame for
peace-breaking on their respective enemies.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 monitors, including Walker, will stay in the
Macedonian capital of Skopje, but all others will head home.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors' voyage is a formidable one. They are unarmed, will
not be escorted, and will have to cross a border where there are
tens of thousands of Serb troops, as well as a bridge to Macedonia
OSCE military sources say is mined.
</P>
<P>
   Vollebaek said he had been assured by the Yugoslav government,
which has never liked having the OSCE in Kosovo, that the monitors
would be allowed to leave without incident. The Serbs have harassed
monitors, and last month detained international observers at the
Kosovo-Macedonian border for 22 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I choose the believe the promises I have been given,''
Vollebaek said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as well as
private aid organizations, are also beginning to pull out _ leaving
few people to help the more than 250,000 people displaced during
the yearlong fighting. The United Nations estimates that a fifth of
the Kosovar population has been chased or burned out of their homes
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 refugees have flooded over the Kosovo-Macedonian
border in the past month, said Fernando del Mundo, spokesman for
the UN group.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of foreign monitors has local Albanians worried that
the Serbs will launch a brutal assault against them, said Ylber
Bajraktari, a journalist with the Albanian-language Koha Ditore.
Serb forces have been burning villages and exchanging fire with
Albanian guerrillas in spite of an October cease-fire pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid, especially of the gap between OSCE leaving
and an air strike taking place,'' Bajraktari said.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers and monitors said Friday was uncharacteristically
quiet in Kosovo, and speculated that the late winter snow was
discouraging firefights.
</P>
<P>
   Miko said his staff spotted the heavy presence of both KLA
soldiers and Serb military in the hotspots of Vucitrn and Srbice
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the weather gets any better, these places could be the
sites of the first all-out fighting'' between the two sides, Miko
warned.

MARKETPLACE BLAST KILLS AT LEAST 60 IN SOUTHERN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Chechnya-Blast)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A powerful blast ripped through a crowded marketplace
in Russia's volatile southern rim Friday, killing at least 60
people, wounding scores more, and threatening the fragile peace in
a region brimming with crime and interethnic conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in Vladikavkaz, a regional capital 1,000 miles
south of Moscow and 30 miles from the breakaway republic of
Chechnya, turned an outdoor bazaar into a ghastly scene of carnage
and destruction. Television showed bodies lying among scattered
clothing and produce as local people and police tried to sift
through the blood-stained wreckage to identify the remains.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing, which authorities called a terrorist attack, also
highlighted Russia's failure to find a lasting solution to the
bitter territorial disputes that have surfaced in the northern
Caucasus region after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Russia's Interior Ministry put its troops on combat
alert to try to prevent further violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to warn those who favor stirring up the situation that
after today they will meet a harsh response,'' Deputy Interior
Minister Vladimir Vasilyev told NTV television.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the timing device exploded with the force of 15
pounds of TNT, spraying the market with shards that cut down
shoppers and merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember much,'' one man told Russian television. ``It
blew up and threw me and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Local police said the condition of the bodies made it hard to be
sure about the numbers of casualties, but early figures put the
death toll at more than 60, with more than 100 people hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities quickly termed the blast a terrorist attack,
and President Boris N. Yeltsin went on national television to
promise a ``merciless struggle'' against the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider this bloody crime an attempt to destabilize the
situation in the northern Caucasus, to sow enmity and hatred,''
Yeltsin said in a telegram to North Ossetian President Alexander
Dzasokhov.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin told Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, head of the
country's law enforcement services, and Vladimir Putin, head of the
Federal Security Service, to fly to Vladikavkaz to head the
investigation into the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin told reporters Friday that he would not only find
those guilty, but take ``serious measures'' to ``figure out why
this is happening today in the northern Caucasus.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one claimed responsibility for the explosion. Nor was
there a single potential explanation. The Russian Caucasus region
where Vladikavkaz is located is awash with weapons and teeming with
murderous hostage-taking gangs, who kidnap their victims for
ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The blast came at a time of renewed tensions between Russia and
Chechnya, who fought a bitter 21-month war in the separatist
republic that claimed as many as 80,000 lives and ended in 1996
with Chechen rebels in de facto control over the region. This month
Moscow threatened Chechnya with renewed force after a Russian
general was kidnapped in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   But an even older territorial dispute may also be involved.
Vladikavkaz is the capital of North Ossetia, a semi-autonomous
republic that waged a bloody conflict in 1992 with the neighboring
region of Ingushetia that left hundreds dead and forced 30,000
ethnic Ingush to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's blast came two days after two Ingush homes in North
Ossetia were blown up in the border region claimed by both sides,
and one day after 50,000 Ingush took to the streets of their
largest city, Nazran, to demand action from federal authorities to
end the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's minister for nationalities issues, Ramazan Abdulatipov,
told the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, that he thought
Ingushetia's leaders were responsible for the spiraling violence.
</P>
<P>
   Ingush leader Ruslan Aushev responded that someone was trying to
set up his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``See how deftly it is done,'' Aushev said on NTV television.
``Friday the Ingush had a rally, and today there is an explosion.
The criminals are happy because the Ossetians will say the Ingush
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like their fellow Muslim ethnic cousins the Chechens, the entire
Ingush nation was declared an enemy of the Soviet state in 1944 and
deported en masse to Siberia and Central Asia by Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin. Both peoples were allowed to return to their
homelands after Stalin's death in the 1950s, but Ingush often found
their homes occupied by Ossetians.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, Ingush claimed a part of
North Ossetia as their own territory, setting off the conflict.
Although the worst fighting ended in 1992, violence has
occasionally flared up, and the two regions are separated by a
heavily guarded border.
</P>
<P>
   Ingushetia stayed out of the war in Chechnya, and the Ingush do
not share the Chechens' desire to secede from Russia. But recently,
Ingushetia has tried to win the right to name its own law
enforcement officials and restore such pre-Soviet traditions as
allowing men to wear a dagger in public and allowing vendetta
killings.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Friday that when the final
word was written on his legacy, he would have one strike against
him _ for lying _ but ``hundreds and hundreds and hundreds'' of
pluses for the times that he was truthful.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he did not have ``a clue'' whether his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, would run for the Senate from New York. But
he said publicly for the first time that she had long planned to
move to New York when he left office, although he implied they
would be spending a lot of time apart because he would be in
Arkansas at his presidential library. He said they were ``working''
on their marriage, which has appeared stressed over the last year
in the wake of revelations about his extra-marital affair.
</P>
<P>
   At his first full-dress news conference in nearly a year, held
in the formal East Room of the White House, Clinton ranged over an
array of foreign and domestic issues for an hour. His tone was
generally conversational, but he became visibly testy when he was
asked whether his ``legacy will be about lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who admitted last year that he had lied when he denied
having an affair with a White House intern, said that telling the
truth was important. ``And even presidents have to do that, and
there are consequences when you don't,'' he said in an understated
reference to his impeachment on charges of perjury and obstruction
of justice, on which he was acquitted five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But then he tensed and his voice rose with anger as he asserted
that on balance, he had a strong record and that reporters needed
to be careful about telling the truth too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a box score, and there will be that one
negative,'' he said. ``And then there will be the hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of times when the record will show that I did
not abuse my authority as president, that I was truthful with the
American people, and scores and scores of allegations were made
against me and widely publicized without any regard to whether they
were true or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those allegations, he said: ``Most of them have already been
actually proved false. And it's very hard to disprove every false
allegation against you. But we have had more success frankly than I
was afraid we would when we started. So I would hope that there
would be a higher regard for truth-telling by all people in public
life and all those who report on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined Friday to discuss one of those allegations _ by an
Arkansas woman, Juanita Broaddrick, that he sexually assaulted her
in 1978 while he was state attorney general. His lawyer has denied
it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he wanted to devote all of his time to the
nation's business and would therefore refer all such questions to
his lawyers. Pressed as to whether he could not simply deny the
allegation, Clinton ignored the question and quickly moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been available only briefly to reporters since the
impeachment ordeal began more than a year ago. Friday's news
conference was one in a series of steps the White House has taken
in an attempt to thaw the icy relations with reporters that have
marked Clinton's tenure.

DIFFERENT STANDARD APPLIED TO MUSICAL SCORES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A few years ago, when Hans Zimmer began working on
the score for Terrence Malick's ``The Thin Red Line,'' the
German-born film composer was settled into a comfortable Hollywood
groove.
</P>
<P>
   After launching his career with relatively low-budget art-house
movies such as ``Moonlighting'' and ``My Beautiful Laundrette,''
Zimmer gradually had moved on to epics such as ``The Last Emperor''
and high-tech shoot-'em-ups such as ``The Rock.'' He'd received
Oscar nominations for his scores for ``Rain Man'' and ``The
Preacher's Wife'' and won a Grammy Award for ``Crimson Tide,''
making him one of the industry's most sought-after tunesmiths.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Zimmer and director Malick began discussing ``The Thin
Red Line,'' a decidedly unconventional World War II movie, Zimmer
quickly sensed that the collaboration wouldn't be conventional
either. As it turned out, he was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting to become very much established in a way here
(Hollywood), for better or for worse,'' Zimmer says. ``Terry took
me on this enormous sort of ride, and I learned so much. Because he
never would think of me as a composer, he would think of me as a
filmmaker, which was a lot to live up to, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Hollywood power ladder, composers tend to occupy the
lower rungs. Usually, they're brought in six or eight weeks before
a film is finished. That seldom allows room for music that is
stylistically experimental or emotionally ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, of all the personnel involved in making motion pictures,
perhaps only composers and songwriters are judged by their work
both within and apart from the movie itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music has a certain power, the best of it, to stand on its
own,'' says Andy Trudeau, an executive producer of cultural
programming for National Public Radio and lifelong movie soundtrack
buff.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some scores that fit so perfectly with the
photography and the acting that when you pull it out, it just lays
there like flat root beer. So I apply a `stand alone' standard.''
</P>
<P>
   By ``stand alone,'' Trudeau means that a film score must possess
a certain aesthetic value aside from its ability to illustrate,
underscore or otherwise contextualize the images on screen.
</P>
<P>
   On recent installments of NPR's ``Weekend Edition Sunday''
program (heard locally on KCRW FM-89.9 from 8 to 10 a.m.), Trudeau
and co-host Liane Hansen have been applying that criteria to this
year's five nominees for best achievement in music, original
dramatic score. Besides Zimmer, they are David Hirschfelder for
``Elizabeth,'' Nicola Piovani for ``Life Is Beautiful,'' Randy
Newman for ``Pleasantville'' and John Williams for ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' Oscars also are given for original musical or comedy score
and for best original song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which of these scores are you going to be listening to with
pleasure 10 years from now?'' Trudeau asks rhetorically.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hollywood composers seldom have the luxury of writing music
that aspires to a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, says Zimmer, both ``The Thin Red Line'' and
DreamWorks' animated ``Prince of Egypt'' _ for which Zimmer and
Stephen Schwartz received Oscar nominations in the best original
musical score category _ were ``sort of about working outside the
system, or what is thought of as the system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of working with Terry was very much experimenting,
reinventing myself in a way,'' Zimmer says. ``I've done a lot of
action movies, movies where people are shooting at each other, so
the first thing to do was to rid myself of all the cliches.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Oscars now have separate awards for dramatic and
comedic scores, some composers say there's still a presumption that
dramatic music is more difficult to write. In fact, the opposite
may be true, says composer Matthew Wilder, nominated this year for
Disney's animated musical ``Mulan'' along with lyricist David
Zippel and veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music naturally has a tendency to lean toward emotional
depth,'' Wilder says. ``It's easier to be romantic. I think it's
much tougher to find the comedic spin within a score.''
</P>
<P>
   But whichever composers are honored tonight, they'll almost
certainly be upstaged by the Gwyneth Paltrows and Tom Hankses of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, the average soundtrack sells about 2,000 to
3,000 units,'' says NPR's Trudeau. ``It's mostly a specialty field.
Once in a while you get a `Titanic' that comes along and blows
everybody away. But who remembers the other two scores that
(composer James) Horner wrote that year?''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Trudeau says, they were ``The Mask of Zorro''
and ``Mighty Joe Young.''

INVESTING FOR BEGINNERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not all investment clubs are exclusively for small-town
Midwestern women or for people whose income includes, or will soon
include, Social Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 37,000 such clubs nationwide, according to
the National Association of Investors Corporation, which helps
clubs organize. About 10 percent are run by people under 35, the
association says, and the percentage is growing steadily. And while
their monthly investments may be smaller than their phone bills,
members say the experience is fun, often profitable and great
training for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Hogan Kennedy, now 26, started what she called a ``wee
investment education club'' when she was a student at American
University in Washington. The impetus: Her father had told her to
invest her tax refund in a mutual fund _ an idea that left her at a
loss. So she and four friends (soon eight) started buying
investment guides and meeting regularly to share advice, though
they never invested as a group.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1994, Ms. Hogan headed to Chelsea, Vt., to
open a restaurant and founded another investment club. This time,
members contributed $25 a month and the club opened an account at
Charles Schwab. Each member was responsible for researching a stock
and presenting findings. The group would then decide whether to
buy, using criteria like ``potential and current profits, debt,
whether or not it was an up-and-coming field or a longstanding
company with new products,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The club averaged a roughly 15 percent annual return on its
investments, she said, although some investments the members didn't
make, in Internet stocks and the like, did even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we'd bought into Yahoo and the rest, but back then who
knew? Certainly not nine 20- and 30-somethings trying to figure out
the stock market in east-of-nowhere Vermont,'' Ms. Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out the markets from the big city, however, can be
equally challenging. Three years ago, Jeanhee Kim, 30, began an
investment club in Manhattan. It took almost six months for Ms.
Kim, a financial writer, and four pals to figure out the rules,
debating whether they should be a limited partnership (they were),
whether to register as a taxable entity (they did), how much to
contribute monthly and, perhaps most important, where to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they decided that each person would kick in $2,000 and
then contribute $50 a month. They bought stock in the Gap, Lucent
Technologies, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, as well as First Data, a payment
systems and information management company, and I-Flow, which makes
intravenous feeding and medication equipment. The members met
monthly, studying stocks, snacking on pizza and smiling at their
returns.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't all pizza, beer and dough. Group dynamics are
always tricky, but especially in an investment club, where
decisions have dollars-and-cents consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse than a book club, because you have to put money
into it, and it can be difficult getting a consensus,'' Ms. Kim
said.
</P>
<P>
   One member was a lawyer who decided ``how to organize, get tax
codes,'' Ms. Kim said, while another, a social worker, created
harmony and contributed a lot of common sense. Another member, she
said, was always thinking of the worst case and asking how they
would cope with disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made every decision slower, sometimes bringing levity
because he could be comical about it but sometimes bringing cries
of frustration from the group,'' Ms. Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   The club recently disbanded, because members had moved, married
or become too busy to attend meetings. Ms. Kim said her share is
now worht almost double her original investment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their difficulties, investment clubs are worthwhile for
both the learning and the camaraderie, Ms. Kim and Ms. Hogan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They serve as a valuable building block for when a person
moves ahead,'' said Ms. Hogan, who now lives in Green Bay, Wis.,
with her husband, John, and four children. She publishes an on-line
newsletter, ``The Money Maven,'' and hopes to start an on-line
investment club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can find a club, and for the cost of Internet access or
cable TV, start to build a stock portfolio,'' she added.
``Twenty-somethings who feel they don't have two nickels to rub
together can get involved in the emerging industries and take an
avid interest in the market without needing hundreds or thousands
of dollars.''

A FEW (MORE) WORDS FROM THE NOMINATED WRITERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the end of Orson Welles' ``Citizen Kane,''
newsreel editor Philip Van Zandt opines: ``I don't think any word
can explain a man's life.'' Of course, he was wrong. (Rosebud.) But
then, Van Zandt wasn't privy to the film's childhood flashback
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   He would probably also get some argument from this year's
Oscar-nominated writers, a talented group of diverse individuals
who have done a pretty fair job of explaining a lot of things _
men's lives, world wars and politicians' misadventures among them.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: &QL; 
ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY
</P>
<P>
   _ Warren Beatty and Jeremy Pikser, ``Bulworth''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty and Pikser first collaborated on ``Reds'' and reteamed
for ``Bulworth,'' a political film of a much different nature. The
comedy about a suicidal senator on a crazed, truth-telling jag
received critical hosannas, but only one Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped for more,'' Pikser says. ``Just as we hoped more
people would see the movie. But I look at it as quality vs.
quantity. The people who did see it, for the most part, loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus,'' he adds, ``for a political film, I think it did pretty
well. It got a bigger audience than, say, `The Nation's' subscriber
list.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty doesn't necessarily see it that way. But he's got a
bigger windmill to chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe now with the nomination, (20th Century Fox chairman)
Rupert Murdoch will see my (darn) movie,'' Beatty says.
</P>
<P>
   If he has waited this long, probably not.
</P>
<P>
   _ Roberto Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami, ``Life Is Beautiful''
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly the most audacious screenplay in the bunch,
daring to make a comedy set during the Holocaust. Guess what _ it
worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' Benigni admits. ``But I was scared like when
you are in love with somebody, because I was honest with myself. I
was not trying to make something violent or bad. A lot of friends
of mine told me that this would lose me a lot of my audience. But
the idea was so simple _ it's a love story, about a man's love for
his family and his son _ and I can't imagine something better than
this. If I could come back, I would remake it 100 times.''
</P>
<P>
   And we would just as likely come back and watch it again, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Rodat, ``Saving Private Ryan''
</P>
<P>
   Writing a Steven Spielberg movie is a little like playing on
Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls. The supporting cast tends to go
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's fine,'' says Rodat, whose biggest writing credit
prior to ``Ryan'' was the children's movie ``Fly Away Home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The satisfactions in writing are occasionally public, but more
often they're personal. For me, it's those times when I get inside
a scene and feel the emotions the characters are feeling. There's
nothing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Spielberg, Rodat has taken great pleasure in the public
dialogue the movie has inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people have realized the sacrifices their parents and
grandparents made, and that's been gratifying,'' Rodat says. ``I
don't think a lot of people had a sense of that before. The world
is far from a perfect place, but it's a much better place because
of these soldiers who died. I'll never be able to forget the
crosses in the cemeteries there in Normandy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, ``Shakespeare in Love''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Norman first started writing ``Shakespeare in Love'' in
1991, three years after one of his children suggested he think
about the Bard's early days as a playwright.
</P>
<P>
   ``That speaks for the value of the nuclear family, doesn't it?''
Norman says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   After a deal with Universal and Julia Roberts fell apart in
1992, the project fell into disfavor with studio executives. ``It
was damaged goods,'' Norman says. That changed when Miramax
chairman Harvey Weinstein rescued it in 1996, and the rest, as they
say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   Norman wrote the screenplay's early drafts. Playwright Tom
Stoppard added his own clever touches and Elizabethan in-jokes in
subsequent rewrites, both when the script was at Universal and,
later, with Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie almost died 10 times, but somehow kept coming
back,'' Norman says. ``I'm really in awe of that and it has made
all of the awards and success even more satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Andrew Niccol, ``The Truman Show''
</P>
<P>
   A former advertising copywriter in London, Niccol has plenty of
experience with the sort of blatant product placement featured in
``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being sold something every minute of the day,'' Niccol
says. ``In essence, we're being asked to acquire happiness. (The
film) wants to make you aware that you're being sold something and
that you don't have to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' was Niccol's first screenplay. He directed
his second, ``Gattaca,'' a thoughtful, futuristic tale of genetic
tinkering. Clearly, Niccol enjoys tackling weighty issues with his
work. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ADAPTED SCREENPLAY
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Condon, ``Gods and Monsters''
</P>
<P>
   Condon is as surprised as anybody that Oscar has recognized his
little movie, which was adapted from Christopher Bram's novel,
``Father of Frankenstein.'' When he screened the film last year at
Sundance, it received tremendous response, but no distributor
picked it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If critics didn't get behind it early, I don't think anybody
would have seen it,'' says Condon, who also directed the film.
Lion's Gate ultimately acquired the film in June and released it in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the movie in 24 days,'' Condon says. ``It had to be
that way, financing such as it was. (The movie cost $3 million.) I
knew that when I was writing it, so I structured it in a way that I
could make it quick.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Scott Frank, ``Out of Sight''
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight'' was Frank's second crack at adapting Elmore
Leonard; he had written the screenplay for ``Get Shorty'' three
years earlier. Both scripts won awards from the Writers Guild;
``Out of Sight'' gave Frank his first Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Box office aside, this was the most satisfying and fun job
I've ever had,'' Frank says. ``It was a gas all the way through.
(Director) Steven Soderbergh was so in sync with my script. He took
what was, on the page, a B movie and elevated into a really good B
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank says the key to adapting Leonard for the screen is to give
the script structure while maintaining the book's unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all happenstance, and that's what makes the books so
delicious,'' Frank says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Elaine May, ``Primary Colors''
</P>
<P>
   May adapted Joe Klein's best seller for the screen, not the
easiest of assignments. The book was long, complex and, as it was
loosely based on the life of everyone's favorite wayward president,
fairly well-known to audiences. While the film was not a big hit,
critics generally praised May's handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   May previously was nominated for her adaption work with Warren
Beatty on ``Heaven Can Wait.'' She was unavailable to comment for
this story.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scott Smith, ``A Simple Plan''
</P>
<P>
   Novelist Smith adapted his own book for the screen and was as
surprised as anyone that he was nominated for an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me doesn't think of myself as a screenwriter,'' Smith
says. ``I feel like a weekend golfer who has been invited to the
Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   In turning his psychological thriller into a movie, Smith seized
the chance to improve on his original work by making it more
detailed and complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central question of the film is `What would you do?'''
Smith says. ``That's the attraction, I think. People imagine
themselves in the situation and want to think they'd handle it
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Terrence Malick, ``The Thin Red Line''
</P>
<P>
   The lyrical war film, adapted from James Jones' epic novel, is
Malick's third effort as a writer and director in his sporadic,
25-year career. ``Badlands'' (1973) and ``Days of Heaven'' (1978)
preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   Malick, ever private, declined to comment for this story. As per
his contract, he did no interviews to promote ``The Thin Red
Line.'' Rumor has it that he will attend the Oscars. &QL;

NEW TEST PROMISES BETTER PREVENTION OF CERVICAL CANCERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Food and Drug Administration approved a detection test
Friday for the virus that causes cervical cancer, an advance that
might help doctors determine more easily which women with
precancerous conditions need more testing and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Using a sensitive DNA probe, the test, called Hybrid Capture II,
can detect all 13 forms of the human papilloma virus, or HPV, that
cause cervical cancer. A number of other strains of HPV, a sexually
transmitted virus, do not cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Although the incidence of invasive cervical cancer has been
declining steadily in recent decades, about 12,800 US women will be
diagnosed with it this year and nearly 5,000 will die, according to
the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of the new test, Digene in Beltsville, Md., has high
hopes for it. ``Essentially, we envision this test as a primary
screening device,'' Evan Jones, chairman and CEO of Digene, said in
a telephone briefing Friday with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more restrained. No one will really know how useful
the test is until the National Cancer Institute completes a
five-year study of it, perhaps this year, said Dr. Ellen Sheets,
director of the Pap smear evaluation center at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of using it as a screening test, she said, the HPV
test will more likely, at least initially, be used primarily on
women who have abnormal or ambiguous results on a Pap test, a
procedure in which a small sample of cells is taken from the cervix
with a swab and examined under the microscope for abnormal cells.
</P>
<P>
   Although the test can spot the presence of HPV, it cannot
determine whether cervical cells have become abnormal, the true red
flag for cancer, she said, adding that this is the reason she feels
it might not be a good screening test. The test is expected to cost
about $50.
</P>
<P>
   But every year, about 2 million women have equivocal Pap smears,
and for them, the test will be ``very helpful,'' said Dr. Sharyn
Lenhart, immediate past president of the American Medical Women's
Association and a psychiatrist in private practice in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The new test is a more sophisticated version of an HPV test that
Digene began marketing two years ago, and is probably more
convenient for use by smaller labs, an FDA spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The test comes on the heels of a number of other advances in the
detection of cervical cancer, including better ways to do Pap
tests. Two of those advances, AutoPap and PapNet, use computers to
help technicians pick out cervical cells that look abnormal under a
microscope. Also, ThinPrep allows cells to be spread more thinly on
the microscope slide so that they are easier to read. Unlike the
HPV test, these methods detect cells that might be cancerous, not
the presence of the virus that causes cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Better ways to tell which women with abnormal Pap tests need
further testing and treatment is not only a major concern for
patients, but for insurers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors cannot tell which abnormal results truly spell danger;
in fact, most abnormal Pap tests turn out to be nothing serious.
</P>
<P>
   But many women with abnormal Pap tests are sent on for
colposcopy, a test that can cost about $150 in which doctors use a
high-powered microscope to look at the cervix. This is often
followed by freezing, burning or using electrical wires to remove
suspect tissue, at another $500 or more a patient.
</P>
<P>
   This can cure the problem if a woman has cervical dysplasia, the
presence of abnormal cells, or carcinoma in situ, a noninvasive
cancer. But because of the ambiguity of Pap test results, many
women go through colposcopy needlessly.
</P>
<P>
   With the new Digene test, doctors may be able to test women who
have ambiguous Pap tests and see whether they have HPV, and if so,
whether it is one of the strains likely to cause cancer. A 1995
study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute
showed that 93 percent of women with invasive cervical cancer had
the high risk form of HPV.

MONTENEGRO, GRIFFITH BOTH EXCITED FIRST-TIMERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Odd how a little event like an Oscar nomination
can do funny things to a person's life. Just ask Fernanda
Montenegro and Rachel Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   Both are attending their first Academy Awards ceremony tonight,
and they're doing it in style, as nominees for what the irony-prone
Griffiths cheekily calls ``the little gold man,'' the Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, the 69-year-old queen of Brazilian live theater, is
up for best actress for her role in ``Central Station,'' as a
retired teacher whose hard heart softens as she helps a motherless
youth search for his father. It is only Montenegro's fourth major
film role in half a century of acting.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths, a rangy 32-year-old ``toiler'' from mildly political
middle-class Australian roots, is up for best supporting actress
for her role as the less-successful sister in ``Hilary and
Jackie.'' Despite a lengthy list of Australian and British credits,
her only American film has been ``My Best Friend's Wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   Both carry the weight of their nation's pride into tonight's
ceremonies; both say they are long shots to win. But both profess
to care little about their chances because it's already been one
glorious, if sometimes taxing, ride since the nominations were
announced Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``You divide your life in three parts,'' Montenegro said. ``I
think for me two parts are past and this moment is the beginning of
my third part. I'll call the third part `The Unexpected.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Like Montenegro, Griffiths said the Oscar nomination surprised
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never chased it; I never wooed it,'' Griffiths said. ``It's
like the Ace of Cups in the tarot (card deck). It's great that life
can give you these things. It comes out of the blue and it's
thrilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro found out she'd been nominated while sitting in a New
York hotel with the film's director, Walter Salles, and a group of
Brazilian journalists after attending the National Board of
Review's annual awards ceremony the previous evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got ready, got myself set up, because there was some very
discreet expectation'' that she might get a nomination, Montenegro
said. She had believed only that the movie might get nominated, as
it was, for best foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   Then they read off the nominees for best actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second name was mine and I didn't believe it,'' Montenegro
said. ``People started shouting, `You've been nominated,' and then
things happened very quickly. Then the phones started to ring.
Three women (from the studio) came then with a schedule (of
interviews and appearances) and it went all day.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. she was still doing work, having an interview over
dinner with a Brazilian journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very impressed with how well-organized this is,''
Montenegro said. ``It's sort of a controlled avalanche, a very
well-organized avalanche.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, her avalanche started months ago. First, there were
film festivals around the world, then the media junkets for the
film's American release, then various awards shows and other
promotional efforts that kept her from her Brazilian home and
family (all in the acting business as well) for all but a few days
at a time in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   She has done days and days of interviews, often from the Beverly
Hills hotel where she was ensconced for the recent Screen Actors
Guild and Golden Globe awards.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the preparations for the big Oscar night,
helped when the designer Valentino wrote her a note asking if she
would wear his gown to the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite certain I'll be very well-dressed,'' Montenegro
said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths, who during an interview shows off the pricey new
Jimmy Choo heels she'd just been given, has had a similar whirlwind
of attention since being nominated.
</P>
<P>
   For her, word came while she was sitting in a Melbourne,
Australia, hotel. She soon was partying with family friends and
repeatedly calling her best friend, just to say, ``I don't believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, her entire country had reason to not believe it, because
``Hilary and Jackie'' hadn't even been released there yet, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of Australians were as shocked as I was,''
Griffiths said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there's been an outpouring of support for her and
other Australian nominees such as Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush and
Peter Weir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of goodwill is extraordinary,'' Griffiths said.
``Anybody who's ever known you feels like they're touching this
little gold man through you. And people are so pleased for me,
people who know how hard I've struggled. People are rooting for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the past month, Griffiths has been shuttling in and
out of town for a series of awards shows and publicity appearances
for ``Hilary and Jackie'' and two other films that are being
released about now, while doing Oscar preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just having a good time,'' Griffiths said. ``I don't
expect to win. I feel like a dark horse who snuck in at the last
moment. I feel like I've already won. This is winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro gives herself little chance of winning either, but
plans to have a great time tonight nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quasi impossible,'' Montenegro said. ``I say quasi
because I never expected to be here, to be nominated, and yet, I'm
here. I'm already quite satisfied with being nominated. I'll be at
a party either way, whether I win it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her hotel's elegant parlor, Montenegro shakes her
head at the attention, and the luxurious trappings, that
accompanied her nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I have you, an American journalist, and an
interpreter talking with me here in this beautiful hotel,'' she
said. ``It's a magical moment. But I'm not starstruck. It was
written on the stars. It's like a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   For both, part of the thrill is meeting actors and others whose
work they've always respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven Spielberg told me I was great'' at the Oscar nominees
luncheon, Griffiths said. ``I could not believe I was standing next
to Steven Spielberg, but there can't be two such sweet people in
the world that look like him. But what was I going to say: `I
really liked ``E.T.''?'''
</P>
<P>
   For Montenegro, the actors she grew up watching in classic
American films inspired her but seemed so remote from her own
existence. Now, she'll be among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been an actress in Brazil for 50 years, and I never
expected to be here,'' Montenegro said. ``It is like a dream, a
dream, a beautiful dream. I feel like a Cinderella, like a bride,
an old bride. It will be like a fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   But sweetest of all for the two actresses, the nominations have
been a tremendous validation of their craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, I had to take the hard-slog road,'' Griffiths
said. ``The question of `am I good enough?' has never been far
away. But this kind of acknowledgment cemented my position in
Australian cinema. It buys you grace. You don't have to beg to be
gotten in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Grifiths had to hurriedly rearrange her schedule the
afternoon of the nominees luncheon when director Brian De Palma
asked to meet with her.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's nomination, the first of a South American actress
since Norma Aliondru in 1987, has changed the way people in Brazil
see her.
</P>
<P>
   ``(They) feel like it's the end of the World Cup,'' Montenegro
said. ``Brazil loves me, and I feel it. I don't want to be
self-indulgent, but when I go to restaurants, people applaud. It is
very, very astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, that will stop, Montenegro said, but for now, life is
sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no illusion, but in this moment, I have the respect of
my audience,'' Montenegro said. ``Perhaps they'll stop (applauding)
at the end of March.''

FULL SENATE TO GET NEW HAMPSHIRE TAX DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ At the rear of the room where the finance
committee of the New Hampshire Senate meets, there is an enormous
steel vault that once served as the state's treasury, but now sits
empty with its massive door ajar.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the finance committee came up empty, rejecting its last
option to find the nearly $1 billion needed to solve New
Hampshire's school funding crisis by the court-imposed April 1
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the committee said ``No'' to a sales tax, a
statewide property tax, legalization of video slot machine
gambling, increased liquor taxes and a bill calling for interim
funding to buy time and keep the state's schools open past June.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the matter will move to the full Senate. On Monday,
senators will question the sponsors of the plan rejected Friday, an
historic income tax bill that passed the House earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday promises to be chaotic as that proposal, the so-called
Hager-Below plan, and many others resurface for debate. The senate
president, however, has promised that a vote to send a tax proposal
over to the House will be held no later than Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Most senators acknowledged that were it not for Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen's pledge to veto an income tax, the Hager-Below plan would
pass and become law. It calls for a $6 statewide property tax
levied on second homes and business property and a 4 percent income
tax that would exempt the first $28,000 earned by a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   This week, teachers in Claremont, the property-poor town that
lent its name to the lawsuit threatening to topple the state's tax
structure, received pink slips warning them they would be out of a
job by summer.
</P>
<P>
   No one, 15 months after the court ordered the state to find a
constitutional way to fund schools, knows what that plan will be.

HERE'S LOOKING AT YOU, CINEMATOGRAPHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Lighting, camera movement, frame composition and
lens choice make up the true language of motion pictures.
Cinematographers are the essential artists who design those
pictures. And this year's nominees brought us a treasure trove of
indelible images.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Remi Adefarasin (``Elizabeth''): The British cinematographer
oversaw the mesmerizing, second-unit desert photography for the
Oscar-winning ``The English Patient'' before going on to make this
study of the Virgin Queen's rise to power a dazzling display of
moody shadows, precision illumination and carefully deployed camera
pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rembrandt's paintings really summarized the whole look we were
going for. They have pools of light that fall down and bathe the
main protagonists, but we didn't want it to look theatrical, like a
spotlight was falling on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, the sets were deliberately made dark, so it would be
easier for me to keep the light off. That way, you could see that
you were in a real environment, but the light could be pinpointed
on where the story was without overcooking it. We didn't want it to
be so stylized that you felt like you were being manipulated.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Richard Greatrex (``Shakespeare in Love''): A BBC-trained
cameraman who also shot ``Mrs. Brown'' with director John Madden,
Greatrex tried to create a realistic environment for
``Shakespeare's'' farcical goings-on while providing unobtrusive
illumination for its large cast of declaiming characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's shots are always exceedingly elaborate, so you try to
create a lighting style that can cope with that, which often takes
rather a lot of doing. A shot very rarely holds still; it develops
from close-up into wide and back into close-up again, and from one
room into another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is to give space to the actors that allows
them to feel free. I try not to tie actors up with `you've got to
hit this mark because this light's here.' I think an essential part
of the storytelling is to permit actors to concentrate on being the
characters and not have to think about all these terrible
technicalities all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Conrad Hall (``A Civil Action''): This is veteran director of
photography Hall's eighth Oscar nomination; he won the award for
``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'' His brief on ``A Civil
Action'' was to help director Steven Zaillian pare down a highly
technical, complicated and lengthy corporate malfeasance lawsuit to
its dramatic basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our story involves living rooms, bathrooms, hallways,
kitchens, that kind of thing, which is a lot different than forests
or mountains or oceans or costumes. It was particularly interesting
to try to find a look for the essence of the story, which is about
trying to find the truth about whether polluted well water poisoned
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was like the difference between clear water and
polluted water. I tried to find the clarity of image that would be
representative of a search for the truth. The clear, crisp imagery
we tried to create helped to reinforce the sense of that search.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Janusz Kaminski (``Saving Private Ryan''): Kaminski won an
Oscar for ``Schindler's List,'' his first collaboration with
director Steven Spielberg, and was also nominated for their third
film together, ``Amistad.'' Many feel that his visualization of the
D-Day invasion in ``Saving Private Ryan'' is the most realistic
combat footage ever staged.
</P>
<P>
   ``My aim was to make the viewers feel like they were active
participants in the invasion of Normandy. And I felt I succeeded in
making the camera an active participant as well, rather than just
being an objective observer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read somewhere that the operators were let free and they
just ran around the beach with cameras. That's simply impossible to
do, because you have the whole field prerigged with squibs and
explosives. Since those are going off all through the take, the
actors and cameramen had to rehearse their moves. It may appear
chaotic on the screen, but the operators were following carefully
choreographed action. Nothing happened haphazard; it was very much
calculated.''
</P>
<P>
   _ John Toll (``The Thin Red Line''): Toll earned Oscars for
shooting ``Braveheart'' and ``Legends of the Fall,'' and his ``Red
Line'' work recently won this year's American Society of
Cinematographers' outstanding achievement award. Toll's visuals
have been praised for their beauty and lending a formal coherence
to Terrence Malick's narratively diffuse World War II film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visual idea of all this violence occurring in such a
beautiful place was really striking. It's really a film about the
tragedy of war, and that really contrasted the horrible nature of
the combat on Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge was to re-create this event and to get inside
the heads of the characters in a way that, cinematically, felt very
natural. We wanted the audience to feel as if they were witnessing
these events and feel the emotions of the characters very close-up
and firsthand. We did it by trying to re-create the natural
circumstances of the war in that environment. You do that by using
the camera to tell the story; in our particular case, we were
really interested in almost putting the camera into the story
somehow.'' &QL;

FLOOD OF REFUGEES TRIES TO GET AWAY FROM SERB OFFENSIVE

<P>
   SRBICA, Yugoslavia _ His house is only half built, and there is
only one room that is habitable and warm, but Afrim Vojvoda, a
young farmer, and his wife, Shyhrete, put up 49 people when
refugees swarmed down the hill from neighboring villages two nights
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``At nine o'clock the first group came,'' Mrs. Vojvoda said,
sitting on the floor hugging her young daughter. ``They knocked on
the door, and I was terrified it was the police. Then another
family came at 10 o'clock, and then another at 2 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the last group was Fetije Xani, a 40-year-old mother
with six children in tow from the village of Poljance. They had
left home in a hurry, women and children and old people, stumbling
on foot through the dark the five miles to Srbica. ``I could not
see anything, the children were crying,'' Mrs. Xani said, touching
the head of her 6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus was set off when word came that Serbian forces were
advancing, she said. ``My brother-in-law came and said take the
children because the Serbs might come,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers had listened all day to shelling higher in the
mountains and when fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
ethnic Albanian guerrilla force, pulled back under heavy shelling,
the villagers decided to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the village left; no one stayed behind,'' Mrs. Xani said.
Her relatives sat crowded into the one room with a stove, along
with their hosts. The other 30 refugees had moved on to find
lodging with relatives or other families in the area.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of refugees on the move in Kosovo. A
spokesman for the U.N. High Commission for Refugees estimated that
20,000 have been displaced since Sunday, the bulk of them in the
mountain range just northwest of the capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Bajram Gashi, head of the local Mother Theresa aid office, said
he was struggling to cope with more than 5,000 refugees who have
arrived in Srbica in the last three days. Some 1,300 more were
staying in the village further up the road, and many more had
headed south.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his tiny office, heated by a wood stove, he spoke as
workers carried foam mattresses to waiting cars. ``The biggest
problem is shelter, a roof over their heads,'' he said. ``But there
other difficulties, keeping them warm. They need blankets and
stoves.'' He added that the fighting had knocked out the
electricity and water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a woman started shouting in the corridor. ``She is
asking for a stove and wood,'' he said. ``We might have one truck
of wood coming, but we have 5,000 people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in cellars, in unfinished houses,'' he
continued. ``People who are refugees themselves are giving shelter
to refugees. We have one family giving shelter to 80 people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The refugees in this region have been fleeing a major military
operation mounted by the Yugoslav Army over the last three weeks.
Combined army and police units have been shelling and burning
villages, steadily clearing the area of villagers and Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters who have tried to resist. The military has
advanced from east to west over the Cicavica mountain range,
traditionally something of a rebel stronghold. The movement, and
the arrival of a new column of forces with T-72 tanks in Srbica at
the beginning of the week, have succeeded in emptying the remaining
villages without any fighting. Poljance was the last village on the
western side of the mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian forces are now widely thought to be planning an
advance west, into the Drenica region, the heartland of the rebel
resistance and the base of its command headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion of the people is that the Serbs will make a push
on the eastern part of Drenica,'' Gashi said. ``They are frightened
of a new massive offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugees in Srbica are stuck in the middle. They have no
guarantee of safety, warned Gani Veseli, who has been organizing
shelter for refugees. The Serbian police are based in their station
in the center of town, and Yugoslav Army troops are in a disused
factory on the hill. Just 100 yards down the road is the first
checkpoint of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday the international monitors of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe have stood in between, their
bright orange vehicles parked along the road in what is essentially
no man's land.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of tension in the area,'' said Col. Lars
Finstad, the chief verifier in the area. ``But while they stay
where they are, things are more or less OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke just minutes before the order came for the monitors to
evacuate. Within hours there would be no more orange cars to
separate the two warring sides.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, rebel fighters were still guarding the entrance
to Poljance and some of the villages deeper in the mountains. They
have mined many of the roads as they have pulled back, but can put
up little resistance in the face of the Yugoslav Army's vastly
superior artillery and tank power.
</P>
<P>
   As the monitors prepared to evacuate Kosovo, William Walker, the
head of the mission, spoke to his local employees and warned them
that the violence could escalate with the departure of the
monitors. ``What comes next could be that the situation gets worse
before it gets better,'' he told them.

CRITICS CALL THE CLOSEST OSCAR RACES IN RECENT MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS AND GLENN  WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Daily News film critics Bob Strauss and Glenn
Whipp really have their work cut out for them this year. With most
of the Oscar races as close as they've been in a decade, our
usually confident prognosticators are experiencing a wee crisis of
arroga ... er, crisis of confidence this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean that Bob and Glenn don't have opinions.
Indeed, there's more to spout off about this year than ever.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: Whatever happens tonight, at least the odds are against
the academy embarrassing itself (that troublesome Elia Kazan life
achievement award excepted, of course). Most of the serious
contenders, at this point, seem pretty worthy. Some more so than
others, obviously, but at least everything won't go to ``Titanic''
again.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: And for that we can be thankful, although it really
wreaks havoc with our Oscar pool picks. But suspense is a good
thing. I can't remember the last time all the winners weren't a
foregone conclusion by the time of the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   This year, too, we have the added bonus of watching the show's
control-freak producers attempt to squelch all political
commentary. I can't wait to see the reaction shots they choose to
show when they hand Kazan his award. If there's one person standing
and clapping, you can bet they'll find him.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: Especially if it's Roberto Benigni. I predict that
they're so enamored with the demonstrative Italian cut-up, they'll
zoom in on him after EVERY award is announced.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to my first real prediction. Benigni wins best actor
for ``Life Is Beautiful,'' like he did at the Screen Actors Guild
Awards. Though the other nominees were just as good if not better,
Nick Nolte and Edward Norton were in films that were just too bleak
for academy sensibilities, Tom Hanks has won enough recently, and
Ian McKellen _ whose emotionally intricate work in ``Gods and
Monsters'' towers above the rest _ might make some radical gay
acceptance speech that, in the year of the Kazan controversy, the
academy just doesn't want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: Which is as good a reason to root for him as any, not
that I need any motive other than his memorable, haunting
performance in ``Gods and Monsters.'' But Benigni will win, and
that's fine. Once he finishes kissing presenter Helen Hunt's feet
and twirling her around the stage, his acceptance speech will make
everyone feel that life, indeed, is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   As for actress, it's probably between the two Elizabethan
performances. Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow both won Golden
Globes, but Paltrow took home the SAG honors. She also comes from
the more popular movie and has Miramax's vast and somewhat
oppressive promotional push behind her. If the corset crowd splits
its vote, Fernanda Montenegro could sneak in. But I doubt it.
British accents, not foreign dialects, have always been the choice
here.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: You're probably right, and that's a minor shame. Of all
the performances in the best actress category, ``Central
Station's'' Montenegro's stands out as being the least gimmicky _
no fancy costumes, no terminal diseases _ and the most stirringly
human. But Gwynnie gave a great, mind-bendingly multifaceted
performance in ``Shakespeare,'' and was luminous as all get out in
the bargain. She deserves the Oscar she's gonna get.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the supporting actress category seems a little
undernourished this year. I guess Kathy Bates has pulled ahead of
eight-minute wonder Judi Dench by virtue of being the only American
in the field, and her work in ``Primary Colors'' was quite, well,
colorful. The same can be said for Lynn Redgrave in ``Gods and
Monsters'' (although she channeled a bit too much of Mel Brooks'
black-and-white ``Young Frankenstein'') and Brenda Blethyn of
``Little Voice'' (though her garish performance was the acting
equivalent of an explosion at a paint factory).
</P>
<P>
   I'm going with homegirl Bates, although I'm personally not too
excited by anyone in this race.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: Blethyn's blare is still ringing in my ears, and I saw
the movie back in November. Why she's here and not Lisa Kudrow is
something I'll never understand. Maybe the British accent factor
... but it was so grating.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bates winning, yeah, sure, maybe. But I'll go with Dame
Judi and her glorious eight minutes. She didn't win last year for
``Mrs. Brown,'' and my guess is voters will try to remedy that
here.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting actor category might be the evening's biggest
free-for-all. Robert Duvall, like Dench, should have won last year
for ``The Apostle,'' so maybe the academy corrects its oversight
this time around. But then Ed Harris has never won,  &UR; !ital! &LR; period,
which is the ultimate oversight.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Shakespeare'' sweep could carry Geoffrey Rush _ minus those
hideous teeth _ to the podium, and if voters are in a sentimental
mood, maybe James Coburn gets his due. Billy Bob Thornton is the
most deserving of the bunch for his heartbreaking turn in ``A
Simple Plan.'' I'd give it to him, but something tells me that this
is finally Harris' year.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: I feel just the opposite. Loved Billy Bob, and I think
he'll win simply because his was a co-starring, not really
supporting, role that just gave the voters more to like. But I
slightly preferred Harris' portrayal of Hollywood megalomania in
``The Truman Show,'' as precise a piece of acting as any I've seen
_ but probably too close to home for a lot of academy members to
feel comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the director's competition, the only sure also-ran
is ``Truman's'' Peter Weir; if your film doesn't get a best picture
nomination, it's all but impossible to win this category.
</P>
<P>
   As for front-runner Steven Spielberg, his sure thing status
crumbled long ago. But it still seems incomprehensible that one of
the most impressive directing jobs of the decade could be
overlooked, despite the warm feelings many understandably have for
Benigni and ``Shakespeare's'' John Madden, whose movie about the
joys of writing and acting especially appeals to the academy's two
biggest voting blocs.
</P>
<P>
   Either of those two beating Spielberg could, I guess, be
acceptable. But if it turns out to be ``The Thin Red Line's''
insufferably artsy Terrence Malick, I'll organize a protest that'll
make the Kazan complaints look like a quilting bee.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: You won't be alone. One nominated writer nearly lost his
lunch when I told him I thought Malick would win in his category.
``That will really annoy me,'' he said. ``Because it's the only
truly awful screenplay in the bunch.'' My hunch is, he didn't like
the movie, either. Most simply found it artfully incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   However, many voters revere Malick and will want to give him
something for coming down from the mountain and making his first
movie in 20 years. So I think Frank will be the one doing the
protesting.
</P>
<P>
   As for director, Spielberg  &UR; !ital! &LR; is a sure thing, seeing as he
has the Directors Guild's seal of approval. And even though
``Shakespeare'' bested ``Ryan'' in terms of nominations, I think
the sword is mightier than the pen. ``Shakespeare'' is too light
for the academy to give it its most serious award. And ``Life Is
Beautiful'' will get its due in the foreign language category.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: I wouldn't be entirely confident about that. Remember,
to vote in the foreign language category, a member has to see all
five nominated films, and those who have the time to do that tend
to be elderly and female. They could identify with ``Central
Station'' more readily than ``Life Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, I wouldn't write the late-surging ``Life'' out of any
category _ except writing. Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard have the
original screenplay Oscar deservedly sealed and delivered for their
tirelessly clever ``Shakespeare'' script.
</P>
<P>
   In the other craft categories, I think the undeniably gorgeous
``Red Line'' has a shot at cinematography (though I'm rooting for
``Ryan''). Otherwise, they mostly get split between ``Shakespeare''
(art direction, costume design, musical or comedy score) and
``Ryan'' (film editing, makeup, sound, sound effects editing).
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: It is a pretty even split. And I think ``Ryan'' will win
the war-film cinematography battle, even though John Toll's
windswept tall grass shots were beautiful, if a bit redundant. The
two films are top contenders for dramatic score, too. I preferred
Hans Zimmer's mesmerizing work on ``The Thin Red Line,'' but on a
hunch, I'm going with that
 &UR; !ital! &LR; other World War II film, ``Life Is Beautiful,'' to win.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Bob, and you know it pains me to say this, I am in
complete agreement with you on your craft category picks.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: I salute your perspicacity. And if we're right, Oscar
math invariably has it that the top prize winner also gets the most
statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite all the drama and uncertainty of the past several
months, ``Saving Private Ryan'' is, as it has always been, the best
picture of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If, I emphasize, we're right.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: We're right. I think.

   They're King-Size Issues, Whatever You Call Him &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is a symbol so hallowed that only the person it represents
should determine its use? Can anyone wield such control over how
the print and electronic media refer to him? Such are the issues
raised by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince in a suit filed in
late February in New York against Uptown magazine, a fanzine
devoted to him.
</P>
<P>
   The Artist accuses Uptown of copyright and trademark violations
and piracy of intellectual property for using his symbol without
permission, said one of his lawyers, Michael Elkin of Thelen Reid &AMP;
Priest in Manhattan. He wants to halt publication of Uptown, which
is based in Sweden but has much of its circulation in the United
States, and any associated books in the works about him, as well as
to close down Uptown's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Hahn, a lawyer with Hanify &AMP; King in Boston who describes
himself as a ``major Prince fan,'' is representing Uptown pro bono
and calls the suit a battle over civil liberties. The Artist
himself distributed computerized copies of the symbol, Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that a person can change his name to a symbol, ask
everyone to use that symbol and then sue them for using it is
legally absurd,'' he said. ``This is a story about David and
Goliath. It's about freedom of speech, access to information,
copyright infringement. It's about an uncivil war between a major
pop musician and his fan base.''
</P>
<P>
   By threatening to sue, the Artist has shut down other Web sites
run by his fans, saying they were illegally distributing bootleg
recordings _ an accusation not made against Uptown. His lawyers see
the Uptown case as nothing more than an extension of those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not interested in shutting down the press or
publications,'' Elkin said. ``He simply would like for the
unauthorized use of his property interests not to be exploited.''

   When 10,000 Maniacs played its first show in September 1981, the
Dow Jones industrial average was in the 800s. Before a concert in
Ithaca last week, just a day after the Dow first inched over
10,000, the band talked about what its members called ``the other
10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, after 18 years, we finally understand what the Dow
is,'' laughed Dennis Drew, the group's keyboard player. ``My dad
handles all of my investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Group members said their popularity and record sales fluctuate
with the stock market. No word, though, on whether they will change
their name to 11,000 Maniacs to stay ahead of the Dow.

<P>
   Software and Web shopping sites aren't the only fast routes to
fortune for 30-year-olds. Just ask Marcia Kilgore, founder of Bliss
World, a spa and cosmetics company in New York that she created
just three years ago at age 27 and sold this week to LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton for a sum estimated to be well into eight
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kilgore did not set out to be a massage-and mud-mask mogul.
She was simply fed up with ineffective dermatologists and wanted to
cure her own pimples. Soon she was doing facials for clients she
had cultivated in her other incarnation, as a fitness trainer.
</P>
<P>
   From there grew Bliss Spa in Manhattan's SoHo as well as lines
of skin-care products and cosmetics. Now she will stay on with LVMH
as executive director of Bliss, retaining a minority stake.
</P>
<P>
   Her clients include Jennifer Aniston and Cindy Crawford. The
usual wait for the honor of having her fingers personally massage
less famous facial muscles is 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   After running her own show, Ms. Kilgore sees little difficulty
adjusting to a supporting role in a global corporation. ``The great
part about LVMH's approach to us is I don't have to work really
within a corporate structure,'' she said, adding that she would now
have more time for creative thinking. LVMH said much of the appeal
of Bliss was its young, energetic management.
</P>
<P>
   Women's Wear Daily estimated that LVMH would pay Ms. Kilgore up
to $30 million if Bliss, which it plans to expand worldwide with
more spas and increased cosmetics sales, met certain targets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kilgore, who said revenues were ``11 or 12 or 13 million''
last year, did not disclose the sale price but said the $30 million
estimate was high.
</P>
<P>
   Does the change mean she will pay more attention to the pores of
clients like Madonna? Hardly, Ms. Kilgore acknowledged. If a
celebrity insists on her personal touch on short notice, she could
give no guarantees, she said, but ``I would try.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21)  
 (af)  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deep within our psyches, many of us believe that good is
inevitably followed by bad. Maybe we've been influenced by
predictions like Joseph's in the Book of Genesis, that seven good
years in Egypt would be followed by seven so severe that ``the good
years will be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Dow Jones industrial average's flirting with 10,000, it
is a good time to re-examine this belief. What does history tell us
to expect over the next, say, 10 years? Will they be bad years for
the market, coming as they do on the heels of 10 fabulous years,
when the market has gained 19.1 percent a year, on average? Or is
that recent past meaningless?
</P>
<P>
   Though they may not realize it, many investors have already
answered those questions. Indeed, they assume that the recent past
is irrelevant. Many financial planners, as well as economists at
life insurance companies and actuaries at retirement plans, project
that stocks will produce gains at their long-term historical
average _ between 10 percent and 11 percent a year _ despite last
decade's outsized gains.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, history suggests otherwise, according to the
consensus of several finance professors I have consulted. When
measured over a several-year horizon _ say, five to eight years _
returns on stocks tend to regress to the mean. That means that
after several years in which stocks do better than their long-term
average _ as they have in the 1990s _ there is a better-than-even
chance that they'll underperform over the subsequent several years.
</P>
<P>
   But by how much will they underperform? Specific predictions are
hard to come by, because the data are insufficient to make
forecasts with much statistical confidence. But two economics
professors, John Campbell of Harvard University and Robert Shiller
of Yale University, have played out several ``what-if'' outlooks,
all of which have profoundly bearish conclusions. The findings are
even scarier in that they depend on just two seemingly innocuous
assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   The first assumption: Stocks will someday trade at their
historically average valuations. That means stocks will eventually
trade at an average price-to-earnings ratio of 14, in contrast to
31 today. That is unobjectionable, given that stocks have always
returned to their historical valuations, even if they take their
time in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The second assumption: Earnings per share at American companies
will not grow appreciably faster than the economy. That also seems
above reproach. Earnings per share may grow faster than the economy
for a year or two, but it's hard to imagine that they can do so
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Granted these two assumptions, how bearish should we be? It
depends on how long we assume it takes for stocks to return to
their historical valuations. If it takes 10 years, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index, inflation-adjusted terms, will end up 40
percent lower than it is today, according to the professors. And if
it takes less than 10 years, the index will have to fall even
further.
</P>
<P>
   Note that the two professors assume that P/E ratios will return
only to their historical average _ around 14. They aren't assuming
something far worse: the extremely low ratios seen at bear-market
bottoms _ about 6, for example, in December 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it may take longer than a decade for stocks to return
to their average valuations, but that is small consolation. Over
the last 130 years, it has never taken more than 20 years for
stocks to do so.
</P>
<P>
   According to the professors, even if it takes 20 years _ until
2019 _ the S&AMP;P 500, in inflation-adjusted terms, will nevertheless
be 20 percent lower then than it is today.
</P>
<P>
   What has to happen for the professors to be wrong? Stocks must
either remain at high P/E levels, or earnings per share must keep
growing faster than the economy _ not just for a year or two, but
for many years. Those are the twin hopes of investors who believe
we've entered a new era, one in which anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, those believers include investors with a lot to
lose: people who have but a few years until retirement, yet
confidently keep their money in stocks. &QL;

INVESTING WITH BRUCE E. BEHRENS AND LIAM D. BURKE: FLAG INVESTORS
COMMUNICATIONS TRUST

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21)  
 (af)  
 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce E. Behrens assumed command of a sleepy-sounding mutual
fund, Flag Investors Telephone Income Trust, at its inception in
January 1984. At the time, its shareholders probably had no inkling
of the breathtaking voyage ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The fund was conceived as a vessel for managing clients'
investments in eight companies born with the breakup of AT&AMP;T; the
original focus was on dividend income. But over the years, Behrens
has branched out into other areas of the fast-growing
communications industry, and he has shifted his focus from income
to total return.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the fund was renamed Flag Investors Communications
Trust to reflect the changes, which have paid off spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   Communications Trust boasts the best returns among
communications funds over the 3-, 5-, 10- and 15-year periods
through March 12, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial
publisher in Chicago. Last year, the fund returned 85.3 percent,
compared with 46.9 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's telephone
index and 28.6 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, 54, who is still the lead manager for the fund, is a
vice president of Alex. Brown Investment Management of Baltimore,
which is subadviser to the Flag Investors Funds. Liam D. Burke, 43,
has been an analyst for Communications Trust since 1994 and
Behrens' co-manager since 1997. The two men say they think alike
when it comes to betting heavily on particular stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just willing to allow things that we like and understand
and grow comfortable with to become bigger pieces of the fund,''
Behrens said. The fund holds just 33 stocks, with the top five
accounting for close to half of its assets: America Online, 20
percent; SBC Communications, 10.3 percent; MCI Worldcom, 8.7
percent, Ameritech, 4.5 percent, and Lucent Technologies 3.5
percent. (It has not held AT&AMP;T stock since 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   Behrens and Burke look for companies that have dominant or solid
positions in their markets _ and for agile managements that can
strengthen customer loyalty and achieve growth amid rapidly
changing technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a good management team, they can continue to
perform and adapt and change and use the technology as you go on,''
Behrens said.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless technology, digitalization and fiber optics are ``very,
very powerful technological changes'' that drive down costs and
give consumers vast new choices in communications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fund's Internet-related stocks is Novell, the
software company whose prowess in network management makes it a big
player in the Internet and telecommunications in general, Burke
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company was in ``complete disarray'' in the spring
of 1997, when it hired Eric E. Schmidt, then chief technology
officer at Sun Microsystems, as chief executive. At Novell, Schmidt
cut costs and ``refocused their strategy into doing a few things
very well,'' Burke said. Those included developing software to
solve networks' problems in adopting Internet protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Communications Trust first bought Novell stock in September 1997
at $9.50 a share. It closed on Friday at $26.1875.
</P>
<P>
   While the fund has several other Internet-related stocks, its
only ``pure'' Internet play is America Online, now at $119.25 a
share. That price could hardly have been imagined in August 1996,
when the fund first bought the stock at $3.90 a share. (Later that
year, it bought more shares for as little as $3.20.)
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Burke said, the market was concerned about America
Online's marketing costs, as well as competition from basic
Internet service providers. But management has successfully
differentiated America Online's brand and services and proved that
it was not in a ``vicious cycle of increasing costs to gain
additional subscribers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said America Online has become a ``global user
community,'' not just a service provider. He pointed to its ``buddy
lists,'' which tell users who among their friends are currently on
line and available for live communication.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens said he was not bothered by America Online's high
price-to-earnings ratio _ now 347.7 _ because revenues have been
growing at about 50 percent a year and profit margins ``are really
taking off.'' He is expecting another big increase in the stock
price this year, ``enough that it doesn't matter about being
precise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A more traditional holding for the fund is SBC Communications,
the rapidly growing Baby Bell based in San Antonio. SBC's
acquisitions have included Pacific Telesis and Southern New England
Telephone; it is also planning to buy Ameritech.
</P>
<P>
   The fund first bought SBC stock in 1984, at $5.70 a share. It
closed on Friday at $51. With a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.4,
``we frankly think it's very attractive now,'' Behrens said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects the price to increase as much as 20 percent
this year.

A SAFER WORLD FOR CORPORATE MEA CULPAS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Ga.)   (af)  
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was quite a headline: ``We Apologize!''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 25, the Colonial Pipeline Co. of Atlanta used that
large-type exclamation atop full-page advertisements in three
newspapers, taking responsibility for an oil spill in 1996 on the
Reedy River of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, which together cost about $100,000, were
part of a plea agreement the company reached with the Justice
Department to settle criminal charges of violating the Clean Water
Act. (The company also agreed to pay a $7 million fine.)
</P>
<P>
   The three short, contrite paragraphs of text in the ads were
spelled out word for word in the plea deal, but the company chose
on its own to add the headline.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture took Ruth McQuade, the government's lead counsel on
the Colonial case, by surprise. ``When I went down and bought the
paper, I said, `Holy Moses; this is quite impressive,' '' she
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But is the public too cynical to accept the sincerity of this
act of corporate contrition? After all, the company, the nation's
largest pipeline operator, had a lot to be contrite about: The
Associated Press reported that the pipeline rupture killed 35,000
fish and polluted a 23-mile-long stretch of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Griese, a spokesman for Colonial, which is owned by 10
large oil companies, said the company was merely trying to accept
responsibility. ``We wanted to communicate the message that we had
done wrong and that were going to make an effort to see that this
doesn't happen again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And from the outset, Ms. McQuade said, Colonial wanted to
cooperate with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1990s, few companies might have dared to run such an
ad, no matter how much they wanted to come clean. ``Historically,
the U.S. legal system was somewhat hostile to apologies, because
apologizing was equivalent to admitting error,'' said Lynn S.
Paine, a management professor at the Harvard Business School. ``You
were opening this huge Pandora's box of potential liability.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, new federal sentencing guidelines changed the
equation. In cases where corporate defendants were accused of
violating federal laws, management's efforts to prevent misconduct
or to take responsibility for it began to be taken into account
when culpability was assessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these new guidelines, you have an incentive rather than a
disincentive to apologize,'' Paine said.
</P>
<P>
   At least in Colonial's case, the change seems to have had the
desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exercise of a corporation trying to put moral emotion into
what is essentially a legal statement is a good idea,'' said Laura
L. Nash, director of the Institute for Values-Centered Leadership
at Harvard Divinity School. ``The word `apologize' even admits a
sense of shame and humility, which is extraordinary for a
corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   It was extraordinary enough for the public to take notice.
Pierre Ferrari, an Atlanta-based consultant and a director of Ben &AMP;
Jerry's Homemade, the ice cream company, stapled his business card
to a clipping of the ad, scrawled ``To CPC: Accepted'' across the
top and mailed it to Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so rare for a company to admit their wrongdoing and then
try to make amends,'' Ferrari said. ``I thought the ad was very
brave.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all readers were as quick to accept the apology as genuine.
``The words are there, but I don't know that they're enough,'' said
Tochie Blad, an environmental activist in Atlanta who has followed
the Colonial case and thinks even more remedial action is needed.
``The apology only becomes valid if they follow it up'' by
replacing the pipeline entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nash said she understands Ms. Blad's reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the question is, `Should we instantly exonerate them?' I'd
say no,'' Ms. Nash said. ``They have to prove their new reputation.
But there aren't a whole lot of mechanisms for corporate penitence,
which is needed to begin to regain trust. And this was a signal
that went straight for the jugular.''
</P>
<P>
   Paine said public policies that encourage apologies can also
devalue them. ``The danger is that they just become pro forma,
insincere and part of your public relations effort,'' he said.
``For the apology to be effective, it has to go along with the
corrective action and repair of the damages that have been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, will a jaded public buy it? It would be good to think
that Colonial Pipeline is sincerely apologetic. It would also be
good to think people can accept a sincere apology without insisting
on years of ``prove it'' behavior first. A wall of cynicism hardly
encourages companies that have strayed to take responsibility and
make amends.

 &HT;    Net adding varied group of users
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Internet's ability to turn people into
voices without faces makes it hard to see that the Net is becoming
more diverse.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new study by Forrester Research Inc., minorities
are getting onto the Internet at an enormously increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Cambridge, Mass., research company points to
factors such as cheaper home computers and increased Internet
access in schools as reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The company found that online penetration is heaviest among
Asian Americans with 64 percent. For African-American and Hispanic
American households, the news is in the growth.
</P>
<P>
   African-American access to the Internet _ whether it be at home,
school or work _ will rise 42 percent this year. That means 40
percent of African-American households will be online.
</P>
<P>
   A 20 percent increase for Hispanic Americans this year will mean
43 percent will be online.
</P>
<P>
   That is compared to an average of 44 percent of households
online next year for all groups.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester researcher Ekaterina Walsh headed the survey of 96,000
households.
</P>
<P>
   She said the survey found Asian Americans and African-Americans
had a high rate of technology optimism, even higher than Anglo
Americans, many of whom have had the Internet available to them
more readily because of income.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have people who are highly educated and very rich, but
who are very skeptical about technology,'' she said. ``There's a
greater chance that (minorities) will embrace a new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   While nobody is claiming that widespread adoption of the
Internet by minority groups is going to wave a magic wand that will
make sure we all just get along, the survey's results are promising
for the future of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increasing numbers of minorities on the Web,
Forrester says a technological gap _ one that separates those who
can afford the cost of Net access and those who can't _ still
exists. But after 2003, the company predicts, that gap will begin
to close as lower-income groups find ways of using the Internet and
the Net itself becomes ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   The Web, which started off on the promise of becoming a global
community, has become heavily English-based and has generally
lacked a true mix of cultural viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   As more members of minority communities arrive, the Internet
will bloom with richer, more diverse discourses and many more
specialized electronic resources for groups that haven't had them
before.
</P>
<P>
   And for the people who use the Internet, the near-limitless
freedom of communication and the economic opportunities the
Internet has opened up may become the ultimate tools for
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   A factor contributing to the increasing number of minorities
online is the U.S. government's authorization of almost $2 billion
to give low-cost Internet access to schools and libraries, with
priority going to lower-income and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The money comes from annual subsidies that can be used to defer
the cost of Internet service and wiring. The so-called education
rate, or E-rate, is funded by telecommunication companies that pass
the fees along to customers in cellular phone and long-distance
bills.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in prices for personal computers and for Internet
access has also played a hand.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research is quick to point out that the survey has
less to do with race than it does to factors often linked to
minority status _ income, education and optimism about technology.
</P>
<P>
   When income and education are no longer a barrier to access _
lower-income schools have begun to receive help from the government
to provide access and now some of the cheapest home computers cost
less than $500 _ the migration to the Internet becomes an issue of
how ready a group is to adopt technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, for all its hype, has not yet become a tool for
equality. But when people of any ethnic background, any income and
social strata can easily buy and sell online, find employment on
the Web and communicate globally though the Internet, another step
toward equality will be taken.

CARDINAL, BISHOPS VOW FIGHT AGAINST DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Cardinal Bernard Law, in thinly veiled reference to
Governor Paul Cellucci, said Friday that ``well-informed''
Catholics who support the deathy penalty are committing a sin.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented joint news conference, Law, the leader of
the Archdiocese of Boston, and the bishops of Massachusetts' three
other Catholic dioceses vowed to fight any attempts by the state
Legislature to restore capital punishment. Law is scheduled to
testify Monday at a state legislative hearing on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, a Roman Catholic, is a vocal proponent of the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachings of the church are very clear,'' Law said. ``For
a well-informed Catholic to support capital punishment, it would be
morally wrong. And if one knowingly rejects the teachings of the
church it is wrong, morally evil and a sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to reconcile Cellucci's position on the death penalty with
the governor's faith, Law said: ``It's very difficult for me to
understand how Catholics can come to that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who graduated from a Catholic high school before going
on to receive two degrees from Boston College, took issue with
Law's statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I mean that's his opinion,'' Cellucci told reporters at
the State House. ``There's an awful lot of Catholics in
Massachusetts and an awful lot of them support the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time Law and Cellucci have tangled over
issues involving Catholic teaching and public policy. In January
1991, Law said Cellucci should not be allowed to speak at Hudson
Catholic High School, Cellucci's alma mater, because the
then-lieutenant governor supported abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's comments represented some of the most pointed
comments the Cardinal has made specifically on the death penalty in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   As religious leaders from several denominations gear up for
battle on Beacon Hill, Cellucci, who was a death penalty opponent
until about a decade ago, said he is trying to make the state safer
for all citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to do what I think is right for Massachusetts,'' he
said. ``I happen to believe that putting the death penalty on the
books will deter a certain amount of horrific violent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Law, Bishop Daniel Reilly of Worcester, Bishop Thomas
Dupre of Springfield, Jerome Somers, chairman of the board of the
Union of American Hebrew Congregations, and several other Jewish
and Christian clergy are scheduled to testify against capital
punishment on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   While the current head count in the Massachusetts house is
close, death penalty opponents believe they have a one-vote margin.
However, there are five vacancies that will be filled by special
elections in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the death penalty are urging House Speaker Thomas
M. Finneran to hold a vote while they still have an edge, rather
than risk the uncertainty of five separate elections.
</P>
<P>
   For Cellucci, who made restoring the death penalty a top
priority during his run for governor last year, the upcoming death
penalty debate represents an important political test.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, a death penalty bill appeared headed for victory
in the Massachusetts House after the outrage generated by the
sexual violation and murder of 10-year-old Jeffrey Curley of
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   But a last-minute vote switch by Representative John Slattery, a
Peabody Democrat, killed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   While the Catholic Church has always opposed the death penalty,
the bishops said Friday that after the defeat of the death penalty
bill two years ago, they and other religious leaders wanted to step
up their efforts to stymie any political momentum in favor of
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not soft on crime,'' Bishop Sean O'Malley of Fall River
told reporters inside Law's Brighton residence. ``At the same time,
there is a growing concern that innocent people have been accused
and convicted of captial crime. It's very likely that we've
executed innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has written and spoken extensively on his
opposition to capital punishment, as a violation of the church's
responsibility to promote a culture of life. During his recent
visit to St. Louis, John Paul won clemency for a man on death row
in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci said he believes the death penalty will save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can save life of one police officer . . . by putting the
death penalty back on the books, then we should do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Catholic bishops argued that the death penalty promotes
a mentality of vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet no amount of revenge can bring back a loved one,'' the
four bishops said in a statement. ``Capital punishment does not
provide genuine solace to those burdened by the loss of murdered
loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Council of Churches, an ecumencial
organization representing 15 Protestant denominations, released a
statement Friday denouncing the death penalty as a ``contradiction
of both values of our Christian traditions and the principles of
humane government.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement, which has been sent to all state legislators,
also was signed by Bishop Methodios, the Greek Orthodox bishop of
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capacity to place offenders in custody and keep
them from being a threat to public safety,'' the council of
churches' statement said. ``Thus, the death penalty adds no
protection for our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Samuel Chiel, rabbi emeritus of Temple Emanuel in Newton,
noted that in the Bible the death penalty is mandated for 36
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But later, as the Jewish religion evolved, Chiel said, rabbis
became convinced that the death penalty could be erroneously
applied. So they came up with enough restrictions to make it
virtually impossible to apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish religious law effectively suspended the death penalty
two thousand years ago, the first such legislation in history,''
Chiel said.

RIGID NEW MOTOR VEHICLE TESTS TO BEGIN IN OCTOBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts motor vehicles will undergo rigorous new
emissions tests starting this October, under a plan to reduce smog,
the state announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's 4.2 million motor vehicles would face the
tests every other year, in addition to an annual safety inspection.
Owners would pay $23 for an inspection sticker annually whether
they had the emissions test or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emissions from cars, trucks and buses represent more than 40
percent of all'' smog-causing chemicals, said Environmental Affairs
Secretary Robert Durand. ``The new inspection and maintenance
program represents a giant step forward in reaching the vital goal
of . . . clean air in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   But service station owners, who had lobbied for the fee to be
increased from the current $15 to at least $35, warned that the
state may have difficulty recruiting the necessary 1,200 to 1,500
service stations into the program unless fees are increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're deeply disappointed,'' said Roger Montbleau, president
of the New England Service Station and Automotive Repair
Association. He said that garages will have to pay $700 per month
to lease testing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said garage owners may change their minds after
reviewing the program's details, including a $3.16 raise in the
portion of their take-home fee, plus free training and other
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The new testing ends the state's four-year battle with federal
officials to improve its vehicle inspection program. It will become
final after statewide public hearings next month.
</P>
<P>
   The new equipment, called a dynamometer, checks chemical
emissions under simulated road conditions, rather than while idling
as the current tests do. As a result, dynamometers will detect
additional polluting cars that will have to be repaired before
owners obtain new stickers.
</P>
<P>
   However, cars built before 1984 and cars less than two years old
will be excused from the additional emissions tests, which state
officials say take about 12 minutes. State officials also said Gov.
Paul Cellucci would submit a bill next week to reduce safety checks
to every other year as well.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and business groups applauded the new program.
Brian Gilmore of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts called
it ``a low cost and convenient way for Massachusetts residents to
make an important contribution to cleaner air for all.''

 &HT;    CLINTON TRIES TO SHUT, LOCK DOOR ON SCANDAL YEAR
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his first full-fledged news conference in nearly
a year, President Clinton on Friday delved with evident relish into
problems in Kosovo and China and skimmed over questions about the
controversy, sex scandal and impeachment that consumed his White
House for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Invited to discuss whether he leaves a legacy of lying for
American children, the president gave a tacit admission that he
hadn't told the truth about his affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky. ``I think that what young people will learn
from my experience is that even presidents have to (tell the truth)
and there are consequences when you don't,'' he said in the East
Room.
</P>
<P>
   However, he brushed that failing aside, saying that ``there will
be a box score, and there will be that one negative.'' Emphatically
slicing the air with his hand, he asserted that there will be
``hundreds and hundreds of times when the record will show that I
did not abuse my authority'' and added that ``scores and scores''
of allegations had not been proved.
</P>
<P>
   With a barbed comment for his political foes and the press, he
added, ``I would hope that there would be a higher regard for
truth-telling by all people in public life and all those who report
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that bitter referral, the president declined to
answer questions stemming from the turbulence that nearly cost him
his job. He did not give a direct response to the charges of rape
leveled against him last month by Juanita Broaddrick in a televised
interview, relying on the denial of the 21-year-old assault issued
by his lawyer, David Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a statement made by my attorney,'' Clinton said.
``He speaks for me, and I think he spoke quite clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   The president deflected that question and related ones with a
kind of ``Rose Garden'' defense, citing his earlier White House
garden remarks in which he promised to turn his full attention to
``the American people'' after the Senate acquitted him in the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, Clinton declined to defend his about-face on the
Independent Counsel Act, which he signed in 1994 and which his
administration now opposes. Clinton said that because he was a
target of an independent counsel, he would leave it to others to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he felt betrayed by former aides such as George
Stephanopoulos and Dick Morris, who have both written critical
accounts of his administration, the president ducked the question
by saying he had read neither book, nor any articles about them.
``So I have absorbed no pain, `` Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by press corps gadfly Sarah McClendon to say ``why you
think the people have been so mean to you,'' the president
responded with a joke about a man who fell into the Grand Canyon
and was hanging by a twig whose roots were slipping. Clinton said
the man asked, ``Lord, why me?....And this thunderous voice says:
'Son, there is just something about you I don't like.' ``
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton was expansive on other subjects:
</P>
<P>
   Defending his administration's record amid charges that the
Chinese stole nuclear secrets from a U.S. weapons lab in the mid
1980s, Clinton said he was unaware of any leaks on his watch. He
dismissed a report by the Fox News Channel that China also obtained
technology for electromagnetic pulse weapons from several nuclear
labs during Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of my knowledge, no one has said anything to me
about any espionage, which occurred by the Chinese against the
labs, during my presidency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On prospects that first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will run for
the Senate from New York, he said, ``I really don't have a clue''
on her decision but said she would be a ``magnificent senator.'' He
added that she had always urged that they move to New York after
the presidential term.
</P>
<P>
   On recent ridicule aimed at Vice President Al Gore for claiming
that he had fathered the Internet, Clinton said that his heir
apparent had been ``one of the major architects for America's
progress in technology'' and had been ``integral to the good
things'' of the administration. Clinton added that Gore has, in
fact, been too ``reticent'' to brag about his accomplishments.

MLS BEGINS FOURTH SEASON AMID HIGH EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fourth season of Major League Soccer could go far in
determining whether soccer can become the country's fifth major
sport. MLS, which begins play Saturday and concludes with the Nov.
21 championship game at Foxboro Stadium, has so far exceeded
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But the era of spectacular gains and breakthrough attendances
seems over. Opening day attendances for five games are expected to
range from 10,000 to 25,000, down from the extraordinary debut
numbers in 1996 (when six different teams averaged 20,000). The
novelty aspect of MLS is ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some would say we have become the fifth major sport already,
and some say we will never be that,'' MLS commissioner Doug Logan
said Friday. ``But that kind of talk is just a way of blowing off
steam. What we are doing is establishing and institutionalizing the
sport of soccer after a number of starts and stops and failures.
And we are well on the path to doing that. We've done a remarkable
job but there is still a long, long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, MLS has proved many doubters wrong. The league has
established a fan base, satisfied most of its sponsors, brought the
US into the global sports realm on a more regular basis, and
provided a basis for the national team, which has regained
credibility under former D.C. United coach Bruce Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, the quality was not there,'' Logan said.
``Four or five weeks into our first season, when play was a little
on the rough side, if you had said our teams would be able to take
on all comers in the Americas and win, it would have been difficult
to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we are into the real world. There is no such thing as a
breakthrough, but there is persistence and modest incremental
gains. I'll be happy if our attendance goes up, since we've made
Saturday nights the heart of our season, the television ratings go
up a little bit, and the play is better. A year ago, I would say we
had two pretty good teams. Now, we have four pretty good teams and
if, at the end of this season, we have six pretty good teams,
that's progress.''
</P>
<P>
   But D.C. United, the MLS champion in 1996 and '97 and runner-up
to Chicago last year, proved itself by defeating Brazil's Vasco da
Gama to win the InterAmericana Cup last year.
</P>
<P>
   United has been the flagship team of MLS, playing an attacking,
skillful style with a blend of US players under the leadership of
Bolivian midfielder Marco Antonio Etcheverry. Arena constructed the
team, guided it through three successful MLS seasons, compiling a
remarkable 14-2 playoff record. Arena is a tough act to follow for
former Revolution coach Thomas Rongen, who will be without John
Harkes (Revolution) and Tony Sanneh (Hertha Berlin).
</P>
<P>
   The United defense appears to be set with Carlos Llamosa and
Eddie Pope inside, flanked by Jeff Agoos on the left and
Argentinian Diego Sonora, acquired from the MetroStars, on the
right. Etcheverry has been MLS's outstanding performer for three
years, supported by role players such as Ben Olsen and Richie
Williams and the occasionally spectacular Jaime Moreno. But
United's lack of depth was costly in the MLS Cup final last year
against the Chicago Fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire won the championship and US Open Cup ``double'' in its
first season, emphasizing the lack of quality in MLS and showcasing
the motivational and tactical abilities of coach Bob Bradley,
assistant to Arena in 1996 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago also displayed an overdependence on veterans Roman
Kosecki and Peter Nowak, plus defenders Lubos Kubik and Francis
Okaroh.
</P>
<P>
   There will be less foreign influence in MLS, since the league
has unwisely changed the limit on non-US players from five to four.
The idea was to save money and provide more opportunities for US
players, but this also reduces options to add bargain-basement,
diamond-in-the-rough discoveries such as the Sierra Leone striker
Unisa Conteh, who had impressed in training with the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The league has provided a venue for US coaches, but has produced
only two proven winners in Arena and Bradley. Curiously, seven of
the 12 MLS coaches are foreign-born.

RACES LOOK LIKE THE CLOSEST IN RECENT MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS AND GLENN  WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Daily News film critics Bob Strauss and Glenn
Whipp really have their work cut out for them this year. With most
of the Oscar races as close as they've been in a decade, our
usually confident prognosticators are experiencing a wee crisis of
arroga ... er, crisis of confidence this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean that Bob and Glenn don't have opinions.
Indeed, there's more to spout off about this year than ever.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: Whatever happens tonight, at least the odds are against
the academy embarrassing itself (that troublesome Elia Kazan life
achievement award excepted, of course). Most of the serious
contenders, at this point, seem pretty worthy. Some more so than
others, obviously, but at least everything won't go to ``Titanic''
again.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: And for that we can be thankful, although it really
wreaks havoc with our Oscar pool picks. But suspense is a good
thing. I can't remember the last time all the winners weren't a
foregone conclusion by the time of the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   This year, too, we have the added bonus of watching the show's
control-freak producers attempt to squelch all political
commentary. I can't wait to see the reaction shots they choose to
show when they hand Kazan his award. If there's one person standing
and clapping, you can bet they'll find him.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: Especially if it's Roberto Benigni. I predict that
they're so enamored with the demonstrative Italian cut-up, they'll
zoom in on him after EVERY award is announced.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to my first real prediction. Benigni wins best actor
for ``Life Is Beautiful,'' like he did at the Screen Actors Guild
Awards. Though the other nominees were just as good if not better,
Nick Nolte and Edward Norton were in films that were just too bleak
for academy sensibilities, Tom Hanks has won enough recently, and
Ian McKellen _ whose emotionally intricate work in ``Gods and
Monsters'' towers above the rest _ might make some radical gay
acceptance speech that, in the year of the Kazan controversy, the
academy just doesn't want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: Which is as good a reason to root for him as any, not
that I need any motive other than his memorable, haunting
performance in ``Gods and Monsters.'' But Benigni will win, and
that's fine. Once he finishes kissing presenter Helen Hunt's feet
and twirling her around the stage, his acceptance speech will make
everyone feel that life, indeed, is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   As for actress, it's probably between the two Elizabethan
performances. Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow both won Golden
Globes, but Paltrow took home the SAG honors. She also comes from
the more popular movie and has Miramax's vast and somewhat
oppressive promotional push behind her. If the corset crowd splits
its vote, Fernanda Montenegro could sneak in. But I doubt it.
British accents, not foreign dialects, have always been the choice
here.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: You're probably right, and that's a minor shame. Of all
the performances in the best actress category, ``Central
Station's'' Montenegro's stands out as being the least gimmicky _
no fancy costumes, no terminal diseases _ and the most stirringly
human. But Gwynnie gave a great, mind-bendingly multifaceted
performance in ``Shakespeare,'' and was luminous as all get out in
the bargain. She deserves the Oscar she's gonna get.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the supporting actress category seems a little
undernourished this year. I guess Kathy Bates has pulled ahead of
eight-minute wonder Judi Dench by virtue of being the only American
in the field, and her work in ``Primary Colors'' was quite, well,
colorful. The same can be said for Lynn Redgrave in ``Gods and
Monsters'' (although she channeled a bit too much of Mel Brooks'
black-and-white ``Young Frankenstein'') and Brenda Blethyn of
``Little Voice'' (though her garish performance was the acting
equivalent of an explosion at a paint factory).
</P>
<P>
   I'm going with homegirl Bates, although I'm personally not too
excited by anyone in this race.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: Blethyn's blare is still ringing in my ears, and I saw
the movie back in November. Why she's here and not Lisa Kudrow is
something I'll never understand. Maybe the British accent factor
... but it was so grating.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bates winning, yeah, sure, maybe. But I'll go with Dame
Judi and her glorious eight minutes. She didn't win last year for
``Mrs. Brown,'' and my guess is voters will try to remedy that
here.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting actor category might be the evening's biggest
free-for-all. Robert Duvall, like Dench, should have won last year
for ``The Apostle,'' so maybe the academy corrects its oversight
this time around. But then Ed Harris has never won,  &UR; !ital! &LR; period,
which is the ultimate oversight.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Shakespeare'' sweep could carry Geoffrey Rush _ minus those
hideous teeth _ to the podium, and if voters are in a sentimental
mood, maybe James Coburn gets his due. Billy Bob Thornton is the
most deserving of the bunch for his heartbreaking turn in ``A
Simple Plan.'' I'd give it to him, but something tells me that this
is finally Harris' year.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: I feel just the opposite. Loved Billy Bob, and I think
he'll win simply because his was a co-starring, not really
supporting, role that just gave the voters more to like. But I
slightly preferred Harris' portrayal of Hollywood megalomania in
``The Truman Show,'' as precise a piece of acting as any I've seen
_ but probably too close to home for a lot of academy members to
feel comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the director's competition, the only sure also-ran
is ``Truman's'' Peter Weir; if your film doesn't get a best picture
nomination, it's all but impossible to win this category.
</P>
<P>
   As for front-runner Steven Spielberg, his sure thing status
crumbled long ago. But it still seems incomprehensible that one of
the most impressive directing jobs of the decade could be
overlooked, despite the warm feelings many understandably have for
Benigni and ``Shakespeare's'' John Madden, whose movie about the
joys of writing and acting especially appeals to the academy's two
biggest voting blocs.
</P>
<P>
   Either of those two beating Spielberg could, I guess, be
acceptable. But if it turns out to be ``The Thin Red Line's''
insufferably artsy Terrence Malick, I'll organize a protest that'll
make the Kazan complaints look like a quilting bee.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: You won't be alone. One nominated writer nearly lost his
lunch when I told him I thought Malick would win in his category.
``That will really annoy me,'' he said. ``Because it's the only
truly awful screenplay in the bunch.'' My hunch is, he didn't like
the movie, either. Most simply found it artfully incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   However, many voters revere Malick and will want to give him
something for coming down from the mountain and making his first
movie in 20 years. So I think Frank will be the one doing the
protesting.
</P>
<P>
   As for director, Spielberg  &UR; !ital! &LR; is a sure thing, seeing as he
has the Directors Guild's seal of approval. And even though
``Shakespeare'' bested ``Ryan'' in terms of nominations, I think
the sword is mightier than the pen. ``Shakespeare'' is too light
for the academy to give it its most serious award. And ``Life Is
Beautiful'' will get its due in the foreign language category.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: I wouldn't be entirely confident about that. Remember,
to vote in the foreign language category, a member has to see all
five nominated films, and those who have the time to do that tend
to be elderly and female. They could identify with ``Central
Station'' more readily than ``Life Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, I wouldn't write the late-surging ``Life'' out of any
category _ except writing. Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard have the
original screenplay Oscar deservedly sealed and delivered for their
tirelessly clever ``Shakespeare'' script.
</P>
<P>
   In the other craft categories, I think the undeniably gorgeous
``Red Line'' has a shot at cinematography (though I'm rooting for
``Ryan''). Otherwise, they mostly get split between ``Shakespeare''
(art direction, costume design, musical or comedy score) and
``Ryan'' (film editing, makeup, sound, sound effects editing).
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: It is a pretty even split. And I think ``Ryan'' will win
the war-film cinematography battle, even though John Toll's
windswept tall grass shots were beautiful, if a bit redundant. The
two films are top contenders for dramatic score, too. I preferred
Hans Zimmer's mesmerizing work on ``The Thin Red Line,'' but on a
hunch, I'm going with that
 &UR; !ital! &LR; other World War II film, ``Life Is Beautiful,'' to win.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Bob, and you know it pains me to say this, I am in
complete agreement with you on your craft category picks.
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS: I salute your perspicacity. And if we're right, Oscar
math invariably has it that the top prize winner also gets the most
statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite all the drama and uncertainty of the past several
months, ``Saving Private Ryan'' is, as it has always been, the best
picture of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If, I emphasize, we're right.
</P>
<P>
   WHIPP: We're right. I think.

CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK STRUGGLES WITH LEADERSHIP ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ Two years ago, Gov. George Pataki gave the trustees
of the chronically troubled City University of New York a new
chairwoman, and a mandate to steer the university in a new
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Less than five months later, the trustees got a golden chance to
carry out that mandate when Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds resigned
after repeated attacks from the board.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 20 months since, the opening the trustees created has
turned into a yawning gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the board failed to find a permanent chancellor. It
is not even interviewing candidates, the search process having
broken down last summer. And other top executives at the university
have drifted away one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Five of CUNY's top jobs are now filled with temporary
appointees: there is an acting chancellor, an acting deputy
chancellor, two acting vice chancellors and an acting dean for
student services. The presidencies of 5 of its 17 undergraduate
campuses are open or about to open, and at least two more
presidents have been seeking other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The departures have come as CUNY has experienced problems on
other fronts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Student enrollment has fallen. This semester's total of
193,505 students is off about 2 percent from last year, and down 9
percent from the 1994 peak of 212,634.
</P>
<P>
   _ The university is in severe financial straits. Despite rising
costs, its budget has risen little since the early 1990s after
inflation is taken into account, and state and city support has
fallen. Both the governor and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are refusing
to pay for faculty salary increases that are in the union contract
for next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ CUNY has come under fire, from the governor and mayor among
others, over academic standards they say are far too lax.
</P>
<P>
   _ The trustees themselves are sharply divided, lacking both
strong leadership and the confidence of elected leaders in Albany
and New York City. Last year Giuliani went so far as to appoint his
own task force, led by the former Yale president Benno C. Schmidt,
Jr., to investigate CUNY and draw up a plan for the future,
including recommendations on privatizing some of its functions. The
report is due next month.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY, the largest urban university in the United States, was
once a beacon in public higher education, and in some ways it still
burns brightly. But in other ways it is an institution under siege,
buffeted by political forces and stretched to its budgetary limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to characterize what happened before as
higher-education nirvana,'' said Patrick M. Callan, president of
the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, in San
Jose, Calif. ``But CUNY is now caught in the middle of a partisan,
ideological circus.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual that the trustees are political appointees. At
CUNY, the governor appoints 10 of the 17 trustees and the mayor
five. There is one faculty trustee and one student trustee.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual is the mayor's and governor's close involvement
in shaping CUNY's policies _ and in choosing a new chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the trustees' search committee forwarded three
candidates for chancellor to the governor and the mayor last summer
that the movement to find a permanent chancellor stalled. The list
did not include Peter Salins, the provost at the State University
of New York, who was said to be the mayor's and governor's first
choice. The mayor and the governor never called in the candidates
for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually boards are meant to be a buffer from the politics,''
said Joseph Burke of the Rockefeller Institute of government in
Albany. ``Here it is more like they are a conduit for the
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the governor is happy with the trustees' progress,
his chief of staff, Bradford J. Race, said on Thursday. In
particular, ace commended the passage of a hotly debated measure in
January that will bar students from bachelor's degree programs if
they need remedial work in reading, writing or mathematics,
although they can still enroll in the community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy the remedial battle seems to be over,'' Race said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the governor's office was pleased with CUNY's
chairwoman, Anne A. Paolucci, whom Pataki had attacked after he
grew dissatisfied with the slow pace of change.
</P>
<P>
   But as the trustees themselves note, much of the board's
progress has come in close, hotly contested votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still a very contentious board,'' said Herman Badillo, a
mayoral adviser who is the board's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paolucci denies that anyone outside the board is affecting
policy. But others on the board say the mayor has been a key force
in drawing up policies like the one on remedial education. The
mayor's press office did not respond to several requests for
comment about CUNY.
</P>
<P>
   And some board meetings have been so contentious that police
officers have been called to stand guard. At several meetings,
students, faculty members and other protesters _ including a state
assemblyman _ have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Christoph M. Kimmich, the mild-mannered historian who was
appointed interim chancellor in November 1997 and had expected to
return to his job as Brooklyn College's provost long ago, has tried
to provide a calming influence and a sense of direction amid the
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall he worked with the trustees to draw up a five-year
budget proposal for Albany, rather than the usual one-year request.
This month, he led college presidents and other top administrators
on an off-campus retreat to discuss long-term planning. The
trustees may try a similar retreat later this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of my tenure, we need to set targets and engage
people in forward planning process and make sure things do get
done,'' Kimmich said. ``It may not be the norm for someone who is
in a temporary position, but I don't think we can wait.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   He has earned the respect of both faculty members and trustees,
as well as others outside CUNY, including the governor's office,
which says he has done an excellent job. Still, there is a constant
awareness that he and many of his staff are caretakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we don't like Christoph Kimmich; he's done an
unbelievably great job under the circumstances,'' said William P.
Kelly, provost at CUNY's graduate center. ``But how can you plan
when you don't know who is going to be in charge in a year or
two?''
</P>
<P>
   Badillo said the interim appointments also color the way the
university is perceived on the outside: ``You have to have a new
chancellor for the governor and the mayor to have confidence in
CUNY,'' he said. ``An interim chancellor doesn't do it, because he
doesn't have the authority to move.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The trustees set up a committee to find a new chancellor in late
1997. With the help of a search firm, the committee conducted
interviews and last summer had produced a short list of finalists:
David Adamany, the former president of Wayne State University,
Richard H. Ekman, the secretary of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
and Warren H. Fox, the executive director of the California
Postsecondary Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
   What was most notable about the list, however, was that it did
not include the the mayor's and governor's candidate, Salins.
Although CUNY's search committee interviewed Salins, trustees on
the committee said last summer that his presentation went poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Neither CUNY's bylaws nor state or city law calls for the
governor or mayor to approve the appointment of a chancellor.
CUNY's trustees hold that power. Although the chairwoman called the
forwarding of the three candidates' names to the Mayor and the
governor last summer a courtesy, other trustees say it is one more
sign of the governor's and mayor's close involvement in CUNY
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three candidates, Adamany, has since withdrawn, and
there have been no meetings of the search committee since.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paolucci, who heads the search committee, would not comment
on the events so far, but said that the search firm is supposed to
be finding more names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good candidates,'' she said, ``but we want to build up
the list. It is a very important job.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the panel say they have heard nothing about the
search's resumption, but they and others wonder if they can even
find a plausible candidate who will want the job. Some college
presidents who were approached said the position was just too
filled with political land mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you get the kind of leadership you want when the
position begins to look like a municipal appointee?'' Callan asked,
referring to Giuliani's role in prescribing policy. ``The person
has got to be accountable, but not in the same way as a municipal
employee.''
</P>
<P>
   But Race, Pataki's chief of staff, said he did not think
candidates should be scared away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, anyone who takes one of these positions takes it
knowing it is a public institution, and that public officials have
a right to express their views,'' he said. ``I don't think that
should discourage anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the turmoil at the top, the university has continued to
function, often in impressive ways: the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching named a Queens College professor the
state's 1998 Teacher of the Year, the third CUNY faculty member in
four years to be so honored. Two CUNY students recently won
prestigious Marshall Scholarships for study in Britain. And City
College was designated as the new home for a biomedical research
center being created by 10 New York medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Campuses are also moving ahead on new educational initiatives.
Manhattan Community College, for example, has begun to offer a
degree in multimedia programming and design. And the trustees
recently approved a new masters degree in creative writing at
Hunter College, although they sought repeated assurances that it
would not increase costs.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY is also working to improve student preparation so more
students can pass its placement tests when they arrive. It has
expanded its ``College Now'' program to 50 high schools, so 10th,
11th and 12th graders can take CUNY's placement examinations and
receive remedial help before they graduate. The university is also
expanding its intensive immersion programs for students who fail
the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they are encouraged that current applications are
running 2 percent ahead of last year and that applicants to the
senior colleges, which are raising their own entrance requirements,
are better prepared than a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The mood on campuses is varied. While some students and faculty
applaud the attempts to remake the university, and see the turmoil
as the cost of making sweeping changes, others say they are worn
down by the constant attacks on their university, using words like
``battle fatigue'' and ``numbness'' to describe how they feel.
</P>
<P>
   Some who follow CUNY politics predict that no serious chancellor
candidate will be put forward until summer, when Pataki has the
opportunity to make new appointments to the board, solidifying
control.
</P>
<P>
   But Race said the governor's office has no such plan, and added
that he believed that the CUNY board was pressing ahead with its
search.
</P>
<P>
   Although he expressed admiration for Salins, he said the
governor had no particular candidate. ``I know Peter well, and he's
doing a great job at SUNY,'' Race said, ``but I would have an
interest in anybody with his qualities who expressed an interest in
the job.''

CLINTON SAYS `THRESHOLD HAS BEEN CROSSED' IN SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Preparing the American public for military action
in the Balkans, President Clinton said Friday that the ``threshold
has been crossed'' for the use of force against Serbia to prevent
further bloodshed in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' Clinton said at an afternoon news
conference at the White House, ``if we and our allies do not have
the will to act, there will be more massacres. In dealing with
aggressors in the Balkans, hesitation is a license to kill. But
action and resolve can stop armies and save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke as ominous signs spread across Europe that NATO
military strikes against Serbian targets could begin within days.
Peace talks between Serbian officials and Kosovar Albanian
nationalists broke down in Paris as the Serb side refused to sign a
peace accord accepted on Thursday by the ethnic Albanian majority
in Kosovo. Western governments began evacuating monitors and
nonessential personnel from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Friday that it was dispatching additional
combat aircraft to the region in anticipation of a series of air
strikes designed to reduce Serbia's ability to move against Kosovar
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent the bulk of his day Friday making a case for U.S.
participation in NATO-led military strikes in the Balkans, meeting
with a large contingent of members of Congress in the morning and
speaking extensively on the subject with reporters Friday
afternoon. He also met with his senior foreign policy advisers to
review plans for the possible air strikes, including the timing of
action, sequence of strikes and targets involved in the planned
Balkan campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders emerged from the White House meeting still
skeptical about the reasons for U.S. involvement in the
hostilities. Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, said
the Senate would debate administration policy in Kosovo early next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the president now recognizes the need to say
to the American people exactly what's at stake here, why would an
action be taken, what would those actions be and what are the
risks,'' Lott said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said that he told the president that
the United States should not initiate a bombing campaign against
Serbia unless President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia engages in a
systematic assault on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton argued at the news conference that Milosevic had
already perpetrated numerous massacres and other atrocities, in
Kosovo and earlier in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the threshold has been crossed,'' Clinton said,
citing the mass killing of more than 40 Kosovar Albanian civilians
in the village of Racak in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the troops that have been massed, and what we know
about their plans, and what they have publicly said about them, I
would hate to think that we'd have to see a lot of other little
children die before we could do what seems to be, to me, clearly
the right thing to do to prevent it,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He added later, ``I do not believe that we ought to have to have
thousands more people slaughtered and buried in open soccer fields
before we do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the rationale for the use of force goes beyond
humanitarian concerns.
</P>
<P>
   He said that a raging conflict in Kosovo could send tens of
thousands of refugees streaming across borders and potentially draw
Albania, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey into the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a conflict with no natural boundaries. It threatens
our national interests,'' Clinton said. ``If we don't act, the war
will spread. If it spreads, we will not be able to contain it
without far greater risk and cost. I believe the real challenge of
our foreign policy today is to deal with problems before they do
permanent harm to our vital interests. That is what we must do in
Kosovo.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton faced pointed questioning on Kosovo Friday, both in his
meeting with congressional leaders and in the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked why Milosevic should take American threats
seriously now, after Clinton and other Western leaders had backed
down from earlier threats and allowed numerous negotiating
deadlines to pass. He was asked why NATO delayed action even though
Milosevic has carried out a continuing campaign of repression
against Albanians, Bosnian Muslims and other minorities in former
Yugoslav provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should take this seriously because we were serious
in Bosnia,'' Clinton said. ``My intention would be to do whatever
is possible, first of all, to weaken his ability to massacre them,
to have another Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the peace talks between the Serbians and the ethnic
Albanians were extended at the request of the parties, not because
of American irresolution. And he noted that Russia has consistently
opposed NATO military action against Moscow's allies in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and European leaders have enlisted Russian support for
peace efforts in Kosovo, but Moscow has steadfastly refused to
endorse any threat of force against Belgrade. The issue is certain
to arise when Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian prime minister, visits
Washington beginning next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The House last week narrowly voted to approve Clinton's plan to
send American troops to Kosovo to enforce a peace accord if all
parties reach an agreement. The United States would supply about
4,000 soldiers to a 28,000-person NATO peacekeeping force if a deal
is reached.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans have complained that the administration is
wading into a quagmire with no clear means of exit and without
sufficient public support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are going to be killed,'' Sen. Robert Bennett,
R-Utah, said in a speech on the Senate floor Friday. ``They are
going to come home in body bags, and they will be killed in a war
that Congress has not declared.''

HONG KONG ECONOMY LOSES MORE GROUND IN LAST QUARTER OF 1998 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By   MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Confirming a dismal earlier prognosis, Hong Kong
said Friday that its economy shrank an estimated 5.7 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1998 and 5.1 percent over the whole year.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first full-year decline in economic output since Hong
Kong began keeping records in 1961, and it extends Hong Kong's
worst recession since World War II. Such news has become numbingly
familiar in the 17 months since the Asian crisis struck this
once-vibrant commercial center.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised economists was that Hong Kong's economy continued
to lose a lot of ground in the most recent quarter. Despite a
rebound in the stock and property markets, consumer spending
plummeted 9.3 percent. That was nearly as bad as the 10 percent
decline in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth quarter was a lot worse than we were expecting,''
said Ian K. Perkin, the chief economist at the Hong Kong General
Chamber of Commerce. ``The domestic spending figures were
dreadful.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the government attributed the weakness in
consumer spending to the unemployment rate of 6 percent _ also a
record high _ and to incomes, which are being frozen or cut by
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Perkin said the weak spending boded ill for this year, because
the government has pinned much of its hopes for an economic revival
on consumer confidence. In its recent budget, Hong Kong forecast
that domestic spending would grow 2.5 percent in 1999, fueling an
overall growth rate of five-tenths of a percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong will need a huge recovery in the second six months
of the year to meet those goals,'' Perkin said. He noted that
retail sales, exports and investment spending were all down so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Perkin said he would not revise his forecast that Hong Kong's
economy would contract another 1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a pattern, Hong Kong's stock market
disregarded the bleak news _ rising nearly 4 percent, to 11,082.
Analysts said investors were encouraged by strong performances on
Wall Street and in Tokyo. They were also anticipating cuts in local
interest rates, which tend to strengthen the value of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The government called the stock market's robust performance
proof that the economy was healing, despite the continued weakness
in spending. The spokesman also noted that the contraction in gross
domestic product in the fourth quarter was less steep than in the
third quarter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its 1999-2000 budget, Hong Kong hopes to resuscitate local
confidence with several high-profile spending projects. The most
prominent is Cyberport, a $2 billion office park and residential
complex for technology companies. The government is also in
advanced negotiations with Walt Disney Co. to build a theme park on
Hong Kong's Lantau Island.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts warn that the talks with Disney could founder. And
the Cyberport project faces opposition from big property owners,
angry that the government awarded the project to a company
controlled by the son of Hong Kong's most prominent tycoon, Li
Ka-shing.
</P>
<P>
   Some lesser tycoons complained that they were cut out of the
project. A few even charged the government with cronyism _ a rare
accusation in Hong Kong, where all the property developers
benefited more or less equally from the tremendous increase in real
estate values throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Tsang, the financial secretary of Hong Kong, denied that
the government had shown favoritism in awarding the project to the
Pacific Century Group, which is controlled by Richard Li. The
developers are demanding that they be allowed to bid on at least
the residential part of the complex.

 &HT;    CLINTON: SERBS HAVE CROSSED 'THRESHOLD,' WARNS OF 'RISKS' WITH
NATO STRIKES
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim.
 &HT;    Moving in both the International and Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Serbs in Kosovo have already crossed the
''threshold'' that would trigger NATO air strikes, President
Clinton said Friday, warning that the alliance is united and poised
to attack to prevent further civilian deaths and a widening Balkan
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed, however, that Serbs may still avoid military
action by agreeing to a U.S.-brokered peace plan that would place
28,000 NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to put a single American pilot into the air. I
do not want anyone else to die in the Balkans. I do not want a
conflict,'' Clinton told reporters at a White House news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Clinton, with some 40,000 Serb troops and police
backed by hundreds of tanks already massing in or near Kosovo, NATO
has all the justification it needs to strike. The alliance will not
wait for further atrocities to be committed before it acts to avert
a widening humanitarian disaster there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that whatever threshold they need to cross has been
crossed,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have massed their troops, they have continued to take
aggressive action, they have already leveled one village in the
recent past and killed a lot of innocent people,'' Clinton said.
``I do not believe that we ought to have to have thousands more
people slaughtered and buried in open soccer fields before we do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing the nation for possible casualties, Clinton conceded
that American pilots could face formidable Serb defenses and a
hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unquestionably, there are risks in military action, if that
becomes necessary,'' Clinton said. ``U.S. and other NATO pilots
will be in harm's way. The Serbs have a strong air-defense
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Those threats, Clinton said, must be weighed against the risks
of inaction in a region that has already provided stark lessons to
those who would hope to avert military action with endless
diplomacy and appeasement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake: if we and our allies do not have the will to
act, there will be more massacres,'' Clinton said. ``In dealing
with aggressors in the Balkans, hesitation is a license to kill.
But action and resolve can stop armies and save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned further that allowing the Kosovo crisis to simmer
could set off related conflicts in neighboring countries. He
mentioned Macedonia, Albania, Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced we'll be dragged into this thing under worse
circumstances, at greater cost,'' he said, ''if we don't act.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks -- part of his first solo White House
news conference since last April -- as Kosovo peace talks in Paris
collapsed in the face of Serb intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, as the State Department ordered non-essential
personnel to evacuate the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade and some 1,400
international monitors began making their way out of Kosovo as a
precaution against military strikes, Clinton briefed congressional
leaders on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the brink of a very grave situation,'' House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters after the two-hour White
House meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be going to bombing pretty soon,'' said Sen. Joe
Biden, D-Del.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va.,
said he expected a full debate on U.S. action in Kosovo early next
week, a further suggestion that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic may have a few more days to consider the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the meeting added momentum towards the Senate
supporting the president and NATO in this action,'' said Warner.
``Credibility of NATO is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Warner, ``It is my expectation we will have a strong debate
next week and, hopefully, come to a consensus as how best we can
support our president.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The only hope for averting NATO action, Clinton said, is for
Milosevic to sign on to the peace agreement signed Thursday by
Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to be working on this all weekend,'' Clinton said,
without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a southern province of 2.2 million people -- 90
percent ethnic Albanians and the other 10 percent Serb -- in
Serbia, one of two remaining states that make up Yugoslavia. For
the past year, rebels with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) have
challenged the authority of Serb forces, which have retaliated
against villages and civilians in fighting that has left more than
2,000 dead and some 230,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, warned in October
that it would not tolerate continuing Serb military activity in
Kosovo. Clinton authorized, at that time, the use of U.S. forces as
part of any NATO air strikes initiated against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has since said, and reiterated Friday, that he was
prepared to strike Serbs if they rejected the peace agreement, as
they did on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO planners have provided target sets for more than 350
warplanes -- half of them American -- standing by to strike Serb
military and communications positions if ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton avoided any discussion of the timing of possible air
strikes. He is scheduled to meet next Wednesday with Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have speculated that he might prefer to defer strikes
until after that meeting, out of consideration to Russia, which
opposes military action against the Serbs, which have close
historic links to the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   White House security officials, however, said NATO action would
be dictated by conditions on the ground, not by political
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can prevent the use of force, that's the preferred
course,'' said one such official, speaking on background. But, this
source stressed, ``NATO's response will be driven by (Serb)
intransigence and the reality of conditions on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also made clear that he has no deadline in mind for
removing NATO peacekeepers from Kosovo -- should they ever be
deployed there. Such a force would include roughly 4,000 Americans,
under current plans, and Clinton declined to specify a time limit
on their deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just tell you that I think that we have tried to limit
our involvement, we have tried to limit our mission, and we will
conclude it as quickly as we can,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get in the position in Kosovo that I was in in
Bosnia where the Pentagon came to me with a very honest estimate of
when they thought we could finish, and we turned out to be wrong
about that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in December 1995,
vowing that their mission would be over a year later. While the
numbers are down sharply, U.S. peacekeepers remain in Bosnia, where
they help other NATO troops police an uneasy peace. There is no
indication that the mission would end anytime soon.

   ``I'm convinced we'll be dragged into this thing under worse
circumstances, at greater cost,'' he said, ''if we don't act.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks -- part of his first solo White House
news conference since last April -- as Kosovo peace talks in Paris
collapsed in the face of Serb intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, as the State Department ordered non-essential
personnel to evacuate the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade and some 1,400
international monitors began making their way out of Kosovo as a
precaution against military strikes, Clinton briefed congressional
leaders on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the brink of a very grave situation,'' House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters after the two-hour White
House meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be going to bombing pretty soon,'' said Sen. Joe
Biden, D-Del.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va.,
said he expected a full debate on U.S. action in Kosovo early next
week, a further suggestion that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic may have a few more days to consider the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the meeting added momentum towards the Senate
supporting the president and NATO in this action,'' said Warner.
``Credibility of NATO is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Warner, ``It is my expectation we will have a strong debate
next week and, hopefully, come to a consensus as how best we can
support our president.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The only hope for averting NATO action, Clinton said, is for
Milosevic to sign on to the peace agreement signed Thursday by
Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to be working on this all weekend,'' Clinton said,
without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a southern province of 2.2 million people -- 90
percent ethnic Albanians and the other 10 percent Serb -- in
Serbia, one of two remaining states that make up Yugoslavia. For
the past year, rebels with the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) have
challenged the authority of Serb forces, which have retaliated
against villages and civilians in fighting that has left more than
2,000 dead and some 230,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, warned in October
that it would not tolerate continuing Serb military activity in
Kosovo. Clinton authorized, at that time, the use of U.S. forces as
part of any NATO air strikes initiated against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has since said, and reiterated Friday, that he was
prepared to strike Serbs if they rejected the peace agreement, as
they did on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO planners have provided target sets for more than 350
warplanes -- half of them American -- standing by to strike Serb
military and communications positions if ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton avoided any discussion of the timing of possible air
strikes. He is scheduled to meet next Wednesday with Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have speculated that he might prefer to defer strikes
until after that meeting, out of consideration to Russia, which
opposes military action against the Serbs, which have close
historic links to the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   White House security officials, however, said NATO action would
be dictated by conditions on the ground, not by political
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can prevent the use of force, that's the preferred
course,'' said one such official, speaking on background. But, this
source stressed, ``NATO's response will be driven by (Serb)
intransigence and the reality of conditions on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also made clear that he has no deadline in mind for
removing NATO peacekeepers from Kosovo -- should they ever be
deployed there. Such a force would include roughly 4,000 Americans,
under current plans, and Clinton declined to specify a time limit
on their deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just tell you that I think that we have tried to limit
our involvement, we have tried to limit our mission, and we will
conclude it as quickly as we can,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get in the position in Kosovo that I was in in
Bosnia where the Pentagon came to me with a very honest estimate of
when they thought we could finish, and we turned out to be wrong
about that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in December 1995,
vowing that their mission would be over a year later. While the
numbers are down sharply, U.S. peacekeepers remain in Bosnia, where
they help other NATO troops police an uneasy peace. There is no
indication that the mission would end anytime soon.

&HT;       ONE PHILLY REP. TO ATTEND CIVILITY RETREAT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine   c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, MARCH 19 -- There won't be any bipartisan bonding
amongst Philadelphia area lawmakers at this weekend's ``civility''
retreat for U.S. Congress members and their families in Hershey,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Only one member of the Philadelphia delegation, Republican
Congress member Jim Greenwood, plans to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by the Philadelphia-based Pew Charitable Trusts, the
retreat was designed to help members of Congress from both parties
understand each other.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Curt Weldon, and Democratic Reps. Joe Hoeffel,
Chaka Fattah, Bob Borski, and Bob Brady, were not scheduled to show
up for the weekend activities.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than half of the 435 members of the U.S. House of
Representatives were expected at the retreat, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there is some impeachment-related tension,'' said
Niko Yen, a spokesperson for Greenwood. ``Knowing him (Greenwood),
he probably went to the retreat to help bridge that gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Yen said Greenwood had no reaction to his colleagues' absences.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's up to them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So what could keep members of the Philadelphia delegation from a
free weekend of bonding in their home state? Spokespeople for the
Congress members gave the following reasons:
</P>
<P>
   Borski: ``family commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady: ``a number of constituent obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Fattah: ``scheduling conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel: ``planned to attend, but came down with the flu.''
</P>
<P>
   Weldon: ``is attending a firefighters conference instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope the retreat will help Congress members work
together on pending issues like Social Security and Medicare
reform.
</P>
<P>
   But Weldon's spokesman Pete Peterson said some lawmakers don't
need to go to Hershey to learn how to work in the spirit of unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Weldon) typically works in a bipartisan effort anyway,''
Peterson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Libya told the United Nations on Friday that it
would hand over the two suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing for
trial in the Netherlands by April 6.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Libya appeared to accept all the other conditions
the United States and Britain have said they wanted met before they
would consider lifting the economic sanctions the Security Council
imposed on Libya in 1992 because of its refusal to surrender the
two men.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter delivered on Friday to the United Nations, Libya's
leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, agreed that the suspects would be
tried under Scottish law by Scottish judges sitting in the
Netherlands. Any prison sentences imposed would be served in a
Scottish jail under U.N. supervision. Libya would post a consul to
Scotland who would have free access to the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are wanted for the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight
103, killing 270 people, while it was flying over the Scottish
village of Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan offer was first disclosed earlier on Friday by
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, who has acted as a
mediator in the dispute, during a speech in the Libyan capital of
Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also conveyed in the letter delivered Friday to the
U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, by Libya's representative,
Abuzed Omar Dorda, who said it contained all the points made by
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Dorda confirmed that the two suspects, Libyan intelligence
agents Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, would
be handed over to the secretary-general or his representative.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British diplomats expressed satisfaction with President
Mandela's account of the Libyan offer but made plain that after so
many years of Libyan evasion, that nothing short of the surrender
of the two men would satisfy them.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration would take a close look at the
letter, a State Department spokesman said, but added that, ``What
we are going to be looking for is the actual turnover of the
suspects.'' Annan welcomed Mandela's announcement in a statement by
his spokesman, saying, ``The secretary-general is greatly
encouraged by this development and the necessary arrangements will
now be initiated by the Secretariat.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan thanked Mandela, as well as Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi
Arabia, who also served as a mediator with Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Mandela, apparently reading from a copy of the letter
to Annan, said on Libyan television that Gadhafi would ``ensure
that the two suspects would be available for the secretary-general
of the United Nations to take custody of them on or before 6 April
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``we are particularly hopeful that these
undertakings will put the secretary-general in a position to
expedite his report to the Security Council to have sanctions
against Libya finally lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter goes on to say that Libya expects economic sanctions
to be suspended as soon as the two suspects reach the Netherlands.
They are to be lifted permanently 90 days later if Annan has
reported to the Security Council that Libya has complied fully with
all demands.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Libya also affirms its opposition to ``all forms
of terrorism'' and pledges ``cooperation with the investigation,
the procedures and trial within the framework of Libyan laws and
legislation.'' And it offers to pay compensation to the victims'
families if the suspects are convicted.
</P>
<P>
   But in return, Libya requested that the Security Council adopt a
resolution making the terms of this agreement binding on all
parties to the dispute _ possibly because it fears that the United
States or Britain, as permanent Security Council members, might
veto the lifting of sanctions after the suspects are surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Friday night whether the Security Council would
go along with this request. But Dorda insisted Friday that this was
not a new Libyan condition for surrendering the suspects, but just
something that it favored.
</P>
<P>
   Libya had long resisted handing over the suspects, insisting
they would not get a fair trial in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Britain and the United States agreed to Libyan
proposals for a trial in a third country. Libya said it would be
willing to turn over the men over for a trial by Scottish judges in
the Netherlands, but then sought assurances that sanctions would
actually be lifted, and that the men, if convicted, would not serve
their prison sentences in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Gadhafi told the Libyan Parliament that Libya had
received ``all the guarantees'' it needed through South Africa and
Saudi Arabia.

 &HT;    CLINTON TRIES TO SHUT, LOCK DOOR ON SCANDAL YEAR
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington category
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his first full-fledged news conference in nearly
a year, President Clinton on Friday delved with evident relish into
problems in Kosovo and China and skimmed over questions about the
controversy, sex scandal and impeachment that consumed his White
House for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Invited to discuss whether he leaves a legacy of lying for
American children, the president gave a tacit admission that he
hadn't told the truth about his affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky. ``I think that what young people will learn
from my experience is that even presidents have to (tell the truth)
and there are consequences when you don't,'' he said in the East
Room.
</P>
<P>
   However, he brushed that failing aside, saying that ``there will
be a box score, and there will be that one negative.'' Emphatically
slicing the air with his hand, he asserted that there will be
``hundreds and hundreds of times when the record will show that I
did not abuse my authority'' and added that ``scores and scores''
of allegations had not been proved.
</P>
<P>
   With a barbed comment for his political foes and the press, he
added, ``I would hope that there would be a higher regard for
truth-telling by all people in public life and all those who report
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that bitter referral, the president declined to
answer questions stemming from the turbulence that nearly cost him
his job. He did not give a direct response to the charges of rape
leveled against him last month by Juanita Broaddrick in a televised
interview, relying on the denial issued by his lawyer, David
Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a statement made by my attorney,'' Clinton said.
``He speaks for me, and I think he spoke quite clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks brought a sharp rejoinder from Republican
National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing short of outrageous for Mr. Clinton to suggest
that his perjuries and obstructions of justice don't count because
he claims he's racked up a high 'box score' in other areas,'' said
Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it was disappointing to say the least that the president
refused to take this opportunity to address the charge'' that he
sexually abused Broaddrick in Arkansas 21 years ago, the Republican
chairman said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton deflected the Broaddrick question and
impeachment-related issues with a kind of ``Rose Garden'' defense.
Citing his promise given there last month, he said was turning his
full attention to ``the American people'' now that the Senate has
acquitted him.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, Clinton declined to defend his about-face on the
Independent Counsel Act, which he signed in 1994 and which his
administration now opposes. Clinton said that because he was a
target of an independent counsel, he would leave it to others to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he felt betrayed by former aides such as George
Stephanopoulos and Dick Morris, who have both written critical
accounts of his administration, the president ducked the question
by saying he had read neither book, nor any articles about them.
``So I have absorbed no pain, `` Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by press corps gadfly Sarah McClendon to say ``why you
think the people have been so mean to you,'' the president
responded with a joke about a man who fell into the Grand Canyon
and was hanging by a twig whose roots were slipping. Clinton said
the man asked, ``Lord, why me?....And this thunderous voice says:
'Son, there is just something about you I don't like.' ``
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton was expansive on other subjects:
</P>
<P>
   Defending his administration's record amid charges that the
Chinese stole nuclear secrets from a U.S. weapons lab in the mid
1980s, Clinton said he was unaware of any leaks on his watch. He
dismissed a report by the Fox News Channel that China also obtained
technology for electromagnetic pulse weapons from several nuclear
labs during Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of my knowledge, no one has said anything to me
about any espionage, which occurred by the Chinese against the
labs, during my presidency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On prospects that first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will run for
the Senate from New York, he said, ``I really don't have a clue''
on her decision but said she would be a ``magnificent senator.'' He
added that she had always urged that they move to New York after
the presidential term.
</P>
<P>
   On recent ridicule aimed at Vice President Al Gore for claiming
that he had fathered the Internet, Clinton said that his heir
apparent had been ``one of the major architects for America's
progress in technology'' and had been ``integral to the good
things'' of the administration. Clinton added that Gore has, in
fact, been too ``reticent'' to brag about his accomplishments.

 STORY ORIG. SENT FOR March(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The pressure will be on again in October _
this time more than before.
</P>
<P>
   For the next eight months, Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano will
prepare his team for the only games that matter _ the Major League
Soccer playoffs. That's when jobs will be on the line, particularly
his.
</P>
<P>
   The season begins Saturday with a game against Colorado at the
Rose Bowl, but the challenge will last long after that.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has proved to be Major League Soccer's most dominant
franchise during the regular season. It set nearly every team
record imaginable a year ago _ most goals, least goals allowed,
most victories, most points and longest winning streak. In three
years, the Galaxy has captured two Western Conference
regular-season titles and reached the championship game once, in
1996. But that's where the hoopla ends.
</P>
<P>
   There was no championship in 1996, just a 3-2 overtime loss to
D.C. United after the Galaxy blew a 2-0 lead midway through the
second half. In 1997, the Galaxy was swept by Dallas in the first
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A huge favorite to reach the final in 1998, the Galaxy was swept
by eventual champ Chicago in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year we want to win the championship . . . we expect to
win the championship,'' Zambrano said. ``Every year we have come up
short. We will forever be expected to win. If you don't, you have
to pay the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   To add to the pressure, this may be the Galaxy's least
attractive team yet, at least while it embraces a youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   If disgruntled playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos misses any matches
because of his contract dispute with the league, a mixed group of
young and veteran Americans will hold the team's future in their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, 31, a holdout since training began in February,
reported to training camp Monday. However, he will leave town today
if a new contract isn't worked out, said his agent, Corey
Clemetson.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy is already without three other foreigners who were on
the club last season. Guatemala's Martin Machon, apparently at odds
with Zambrano, was loaned to Santos in Mexico in the last year of
his MLS contract, essentially ending his MLS career. Ecuador's
Wellington Sanchez was sold to an Ecuadoran club and Mexican
striker Carlos Hermosillo is expected to miss two months while he
finishes his season in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations were raised under the new ownership of Philip
F. Anschutz, who purchased the club for $26 million in October. The
Galaxy will have to move forward with an inexperienced midfield of
Clint Mathis, Joey Franchino, Daniel Hernandez and veteran Danny
Pena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a competitive disadvantage (not having foreigners),
without a doubt,'' Zambrano said. ``We've already begun playing
with Clint and Daniel. It's not going to be the same Galaxy team,
but it doesn't mean it's going to be a less attractive team.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, expected to play a big role this season, has seen
valuable time on the U.S. National team under new coach Bruce
Arena. He said he and the others are ready to show that the Galaxy
can win with a predominantly American lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play; a lot of people overlook the American players,''
Mathis said. ``This is a huge opportunity to see what kind of
talent we have, especially against other teams with plenty of
foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the only question anyone cares about is, can this
team win a championship?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to say, can I win with a team that is all
Americans, I tell you a resounding yes,'' Zambrano said. ``Can we
win a championship? That's another question. That's another
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a saying in soccer that young players win games, but
experienced players win championships. I think with very few
exceptions in the history of soccer that has been true. Sometimes a
young team can win because of exuberance and dynamics, but at the
end of the day you need that experience that a bona fide foreign
player can give you to make that difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ecuadoran coach, in his second full season after guiding
L.A. to an MLS-best 24-8 record in 1998, says he isn't conceding
the season by any means. The Galaxy may lack foreign experience
until MLS allocates foreign-born players, but it has a wealth of
American experience.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is led by former U.S. National team defender Paul
Caligiuri and U.S. defender Robin Fraser, coupled with outside
defensive attackers Greg Vanney and Ezra Hendrickson.
</P>
<P>
   Though the midfield is young, U.S. Player of the Year Cobi Jones
is on the front line along with Welton, coming off his finest
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just a bunch of young kids. We have a proper
balance, which is why I won't say this team can't win a
championship,'' Zambrano said. ``This season will serve as a
gaining of experience for a lot of our young guys who haven't had a
full season. Mathis, Franchino, Hernandez, Jolley, none of these
guys have had a full professional season under their belt.''

BOMB IN CAUCASUS KILLS 58, INJURES MORE THAN 100

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In one of the most devastating acts of violence in the
volatile North Caucasus region, a powerful bomb ripped through the
central pavilion at a downtown market in the city of Vladikavkaz on
Friday, killing 58 people and wounding more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Top law-enforcement officials, who left Moscow to go to the
scene, said the explosion was ``unequivocally a terrorist act.'' A
grim President Boris Yeltsin, offering condolences to the victims'
families in a special television message, vowed to wage a merciless
campaign against those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing, coming on the heels of yet another brazen
kidnapping in nearby Chechnya and other violent episodes in the
region, was a reminder of how little control Moscow has over its
southern borderlands, which have been exhausted and impoverished by
wars and lawlessness since the breakup of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing was in the capital of northern Ossetia, which was
the scene of ethnic clashes between Ossetians and the Ingush in the
early 1990s that culminated in mass evacuations of Ingush and
lingering bitterness, with the situation exacerbated by criminal
gangs and an easy access to weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no indication Friday who was responsible for the
explosion, and no group claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes from the market shown on Russian television Friday
night looked like a massacre, with dismembered bodies strewn across
bloodied rubble. According to reports, 15 people were killed
instantly when the bomb went off at 11:40 a.m., near a stall where
two long lines of shoppers had formed to buy potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just come out of the cellar when a powerful explosion
went off,'' said one resident, interviewed Friday night on
television. ``I sat down, and when I got up again, I saw such a
horrible picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Vladikavkaz put out an urgent appeal for blood
donations, as the city's hospitals struggled to cope with the
steady flow of victims brought in from the market, most with
shrapnel wounds. Two of the wounded were children, television news
reported Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The timing and location of the bomb suggested that it had been
deliberately set to cause maximum damage and death. It was meant to
be ``intimidating and was aimed at destabilization,'' said
Alexander Zdanovich, spokesman for the Federal Security Services.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported seeing two young men running out of the
central pavilion shortly before the bomb went off. Both Sergei
Stepashin, Russia's interior minister, and Federal Security
Services chief Vladimir Putin arrived at the scene Friday afternoon
to start the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Vladikavkaz is near Russia's border with Georgia, and about 30
miles from Chechnya, the breakaway region that has been engulfed by
banditry and kidnappings since its 1996 victory in a war with the
Russian army. The violence in Chechnya has caused international
concern, particularly after kidnappers cut off the heads of four
employees of a British telecommunications firm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aslan Maskhadov, president of Chechnya, issued a statement
expressing condolences for those killed in Vladikavkaz, and
offering to assist in the search for the criminals. Maskhadov and
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov had been scheduled to meet
soon to discuss cooperation in the region, particularly regarding
kidnapping and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Gennady Spigun, the representative of the Russian
interior ministry in Chechnya, was recently seized by gunmen who
took him off a plane on the runway at Grozny, the Chechen capital,
an act that worsened Moscow's relations in the region. In response
to the kidnapping, Stepashin, the Russian interior minister,
threatened to punish Chechnya's rebel warlords, and to impose
economic sanctions against the region if Spigun was not released.
Two weeks later, the general is still being held, reportedly for a
huge ransom, but Moscow has not followed up on its threats.
</P>
<P>
   Regional leaders have sought increasingly to take power in their
own hands, in some places organizing vigilante groups, in others
sidestepping federal laws. Chechnya itself, which has declared its
independence from Russia, has adopted the Islamic legal system, or
Sharia, and recently staged a public execution, even though Russia
has formally dropped the death penalty to comply with European
human rights standards.
</P>
<P>
   Regional leaders have implored Moscow to come up with a coherent
policy for the region, and to carry it through. ``Does Russia have
any policy in the Caucasus?'' Maskhadov, the Chechen president,
asked in a recent interview in the Moscow newspaper Komsomolskaya
Pravda. ``I have always wanted to find this out from Russian
leaders and never got any coherent answers.''

NATO PLANS THREE-PHASE ATTACK ON YUGOSLAV MILITARY TARGETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Will update later with further details.) 
(See also KOSOVO-TALKS, KOSOVO-REFUGEES, KOSOVO-CLINTON) 
(js) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's plans for attacking Yugoslavia include a
series of missile and air strikes, beginning with attacks against
air defenses and escalating to more sustained strikes on tanks and
other heavy weapons, NATO and Clinton administration officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The initial strike, involving mostly cruise missiles, would be
``short and intense,'' in the words of one official.
</P>
<P>
   It would aim to knock out Yugoslavia's network of land-based
missiles and anti-aircraft weapons, which would clear the way for
strikes by U.S. and NATO fighters and bombers. But the initial
attacks are designed to persuade the Yugoslav leader, President
Slobodan Milosevic, to end his crackdown in Kosovo province before
additional strikes begin.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic continues to resist, the officials said the second
and third phases are designed to destroy much of the heavy weaponry
_ tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery batteries _ that
Yugoslav army and police forces have used to destroy villages and
drive civilians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes would be intended to ``level the playing field''
between the Yugoslav forces and the ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo. ``It would be very difficult for him to continue to do what
he's doing once you've leveled the playing field,'' one NATO
official said of Milosevic. ``If you don't have artillery, it's
really hard to bomb villages.''
</P>
<P>
   Any NATO attack appeared to be at least days away. It was not
clear Friday what would prompt the NATO attacks. At his news
conference Friday, President Clinton said, ``I think that whatever
threshold they need to cross has been crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said they expected at least one last effort at
diplomacy. While many officials described NATO's plans as if
strikes were inevitable, others said there was still a chance that
Milosevic might back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that the history of Milosevic's behavior is
to blink when faced with a real threat,'' one senior Pentagon
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington declined to discuss the military
planning in detail, citing the need for operational secrecy. But
their willingness to discuss NATO's plans broadly appeared to be an
effort to demonstrate the administration's resolve in the face of
Milosevic's continued resistance to a peace settlement.

when the final word was written on his legacy, he would have one
strike against him _ for lying _ but ``hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds'' of plusses for the times that he was truthful. He also
said that he did not have ``a clue'' whether his wife, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, would run for the Senate from New York. But he said
publicly for the first time that she had long planned to move to
New York when he left office, although he implied they would be
spending a lot of time apart because he would be in Arkansas at his
presidential library. He said they were ``working'' on their

Three juries acquitted Kevorkian. One case ended in a mistrial. On

A DANGEROUS SELECTIVITY ABOUT RULES OF GLOBAL TRADE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In peacetime, Washington starts trade wars. First
there was the Battle of the Bananas, still being slugged out across
the Atlantic. Then came the gleaming edge of steel, a fight that
pits the workers of Weirton, W.Va., against their counterparts in
Brazil, Russia, Japan, Korea and China. For this week, the White
House has scheduled a beef over hormone-treated meat.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the rhetoric here in recent weeks, it would be easy
to conclude that there is a theme to these epic struggles:
enforcing the rule of law around the globe. All nations, the White
House and Congress proclaim, must learn to live by the trading
guidelines established under international treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes this argument has the ring of sincerity about it. At
other moments, like some last week on Capitol Hill, it smacks of
disingenuousness and even rank political hypocrisy. Usually there's
a little of both.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the issue that has turned NATO allies into economic
enemies: yellow fruit. The Clinton Administration argues that this
only looks like a laughable argument over a product neither grown
in America nor picked by American workers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they acknowledge somewhat sheepishly, Washington is doing
the bidding of Carl H. Lindner, the chairman of Chiquita Brands.
Lots of industries complain about their treatment abroad, but
Lindner, a big contributor to Democrats and Republicans alike, has
been more skilled than most in getting the political establishment
to take up his cause _ no easy task when barely a single American
job is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Lindner has a legitimate complaint. The World
Trade Organization has consistently ruled that Europe discriminates
against bananas grown in Central America, where Chiquita has long
held sway, and in favor of those grown in Caribbean countries that
were European colonies not long ago. Europe has openly defied the
rulings, tinkering with its banana imports but never solving the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the administration decided to hit Europe where it
hurt, slapping 100 percent tariffs on luxury goods, including _
this is where it really gets nasty _ pecorino cheese. You could
feel the chill in Zabar's.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has spent far more time on the banana
issue than one might expect of the leader of the free world, says
the real issue is the rule of law. ``If we're going to have a
global trading system and a system for resolving disputes,'' he
said recently, then Europe is going to have to learn to obey WTO
decisions. ``I think most people in Europe believe we shouldn't
have won, but sometimes we lose cases we think we shouldn't have
lost,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He meant to be lecturing the Europeans, but the message hasn't
exactly sunk in on Capitol Hill. American lawmakers, like their
European counterparts, believe it is vital to obey the rules _
except, of course, when they run counter to American economic
interests; then they are an intolerable interference with American
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   That explains how the House, in an overwhelming 289-141 vote on
Wednesday, passed some of the most protectionist legislation in 60
years. It directed the administration to limit steel imports from
other nations by any means necessary _ quotas, tariffs or
``voluntary'' agreements with other countries. The House bill is
unlikely to become law, but it sent a clear message heard around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone in Congress knows that setting unilateral import
limits violates the treaty that established the WTO four years ago
_ a treaty the Senate ratified. But the logic that won the day
belonged to George Becker, the president of the United Steelworkers
of America, who said a series of White House steps to punish
countries that ``dump'' low-cost steel in the American market was
not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steelworkers and steel communities hold dear the notion that
America's trade policies should benefit Americans first,'' Becker
said. ``That may be a novel idea in some quarters, but it was a
winning idea today in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   America first is a thrilling campaign line, but Republicans and
Democrats alike recognize the likely reaction: counter-retaliation,
in equal disregard of the WTO's rules. It is one of the rare issues
on which Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Dick Armey, the
House majority leader, actually agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dangers of drifting _ or in this case, racing _ toward
protectionist policies are very real,'' Armey said. ``Let's not kid
ourselves. It will not make anything better; in fact, it will make
things much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a warning worth remembering this week as American
negotiators try to strike a deal with China on its entry into the
WTO. Why would America want a country that may be stealing weapons
designs, and is certainly imprisoning dissidents, inside the
organization that sets the world's trade rules and judges who is
violating them? Not as an act of charity, but to enmesh China's
leaders in a system that sets some standards of international
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But which is more powerful, the standard or the example? When
Beijing is faced with deciding whether it must comply with
unpopular rules that may cost its workers jobs, it is likely to
look closely at how Washington handles the same problem.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The era of wide-open day trading in stocks, when any
investor with money and moxie can sit down in an office and lose
both, may be ending as suddenly as it dawned. Regulators, rightly
worried that many day traders don't understand the risks of the
practice, are starting to rein in the day-trading firms.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange proposed a rule
change to the Securities and Exchange Commission that would close a
regulatory loophole used by many such firms registering as
Philadelphia exchange members. And next month, for the first time,
the exchange will send teams of auditors to members' offices to
conduct examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves grew out of a pattern observed lately by the
Philadelphia exchange. Day-trading firms were flocking to join the
exchange, making it their regulator, rather than the National
Association of Securities Dealers, for example. As of Feb. 17, the
exchange counted 2,318 people day-trading at member firms, an
increase of more than 1,300 since last June.
</P>
<P>
   Why the stampede? Unlike its regulatory peers, the Philadelphia
exchange has not required its off-floor traders to pass the NASD's
Series 7 exam. That tough test comprehensively covers the
characteristics of different investments, the securities laws, the
proper way to figure margin requirements and other intricacies of
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the exchange has asked members to complete a five-page
application and to submit copies of their fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   The day-trading firms may also have chosen the Philadelphia
exchange because its examinations staff is decidedly smaller than
the NASD's. The firms, many of them set up as limited liability
companies, consider the people who trade with them professionals,
not customers.
</P>
<P>
   This allows them to get around customer protection practices
like insuring that an investment strategy is suitable to a person's
financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the exchange's proposed rule, any trader associated with a
member firm would have to pass the Series 7 exam.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer S. Frucher, chairman and chief executive of the exchange,
said the change addresses the worry that day traders know too
little about investing. ``We felt that people who did not have
sufficient background as traders were being enticed to come in and
risk large sums of money without education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big day-trading firms that belong solely to the
Philadelphia exchange is Bright Trading of Las Vegas. The firm has
300 traders in 28 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bright, a principal, says the firm welcomed the rule change.
Bright said the firm was not an NASD member because it did not deal
with retail investors. When traders call, ``we do an interview,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see if they're qualified,'' he said. ``We insist they go
through a training program.''
</P>
<P>
   But a former customer of Bright Trading has told regulators that
was not his experience. Even though he had no background in finance
and had only five months' investing experience, Bright Trading
considered him a professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people need to be protected from themselves,''
Frucher said. ``If the firms that are enticing people to come in
and trade aren't going to do it, the exchanges are.''

AN ACTIVIST SHAREHOLDER TAKES ON THE WORLD

<P>
   Robert A.G. Monks, money manager and shareholder rights
proponent, has long been a sort of Lone Ranger of American
investing, charging in to exhort companies to change their ways in
the name of helping shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, profligate managements abroad are starting to pay heed to
Monks, who is 65. The Lens Fund, the institutional investment
vehicle he runs, is being folded into Hermes Pensions Management, a
British concern with 40 billion pounds ($65.3 billion) under
management that is owned by a giant pension fund, BT Pension
Scheme.
</P>
<P>
   He will help oversee investing at Hermes Lens International,
which will be a holding company for the Lens Fund, soon to be
renamed to reflect its new status.
</P>
<P>
   After the deal's closing, which is imminent, the Lens fund will
have a big-name backer. With new asset contributions from Hermes
and extra marketing, the fund's assets under management will likely
rise to about $220 million, from $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Hermes Lens International will oversee UK Focus, a
joint fund of Hermes and Lens which Monks already helps manage. It
has been active since last October and has about 150 million pounds
in assets. Monks said Hermes Lens International would manage a
family of funds, with new offerings in Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Monks, at an age when others ponder retirement, choose
this new effort? Because it is a mission. ``What I do is make power
accountable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With its extra resources, the United States fund plans to step
up its activities. There is plenty of corporate mismanagement
about, Monks said; he contends that the strong economy has hidden
many sins, which will eventually come to light.
</P>
<P>
   One red flag is executive pay levels. Monks said excessive
compensation signals that a company's board is not truly
independent of its management.
</P>
<P>
   Monks' brand of activism amounts to a kind of value investing.
Lens buys large positions, typically under 5 percent, in a few
underperforming companies and then tries to persuade their
managements to make changes that Monks expects to benefit
shareholders. If they won't, he rallies others with proxy fights or
takes his arguments to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Lens' investing style pays. In six years of operation, through
Dec. 30, 1998, it returned 25.1 percent a year, on average,
compared with 20.5 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index.
</P>
<P>
   Monks ``is the founder of the modern corporate governance
movement and certainly its most effective advocate,'' said Richard
Schlefer, the director of corporate governance at TIAA-CREF, the
giant retirement fund.
</P>
<P>
   Lens now owns shares in six United States companies, and, this
month, Monks started a campaign for a board seat at Juno Lighting,
a lighting fixtures manufacturer based in Des Plaines, Ill., in
which Lens has a 6.7 percent stake. Lens began buying Juno shares
in October 1997, at just over $18.
</P>
<P>
   There are two problems at Juno, Monks said: Nearly half of its
assets are in cash and only one of its five board members is an
independent outsider. Juno did not return phone calls last week
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis early last year, Lens stated its belief that Juno
stock could rise to $31 a share if it put its cash to work. Juno
shares closed on Friday at $20.875.
</P>
<P>
   One successful investment has been Reader's Digest Association.
Given its declining profits and lack of independent outside
directors, it seemed an ideal stock pick for Lens. Although a pair
of charitable foundations control the company as holders of the
voting class of shares, Monks felt that Lens could influence the
situation, so the fund started buying shares in December 1997 at
just over $23 for each A share.
</P>
<P>
   He has been pleased with the actions of the new chief executive,
Thomas O. Ryder, to add independent directors, sell some noncore
assets and reduce costs. Monks had figured the stock was worth $34
a share when he started buying; it is now at $34.875. Lens has
taken some profits on the position.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the UK Focus fund holds eight stocks. One is Mirror
Group, a media conglomerate whose chief executive, David
Montgomery, recently resigned after UK Focus led a campaign seeking
his ouster because shareholders had lost confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   The fund started buying Mirror shares in October at about 140
pence ($2.28). They closed on Friday at 204 pence.

 A SHIFTING LANDSCAPE AT THE iVILLAGE OFFERING  
 (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)

<TEXT>
<P>
   A good deal or not? That is the vexing question investors were
asking last week about the initial public offering of iVillage, the
No. 1 on-line network for women.
</P>
<P>
   As of last Monday, iVillage was set to go public at a price of
$12 to $14 a share. With some 23.2 million shares outstanding, that
would have given it an initial market value of as much as $324.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, iVillage's lead underwriter, Goldman, Sachs,
raised the expected range to $22 to $24 a share. That would have
given iVillage a value of as much as $556.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, the first trade was at $95.875, valuing the
company at $2.22 billion. (The company sold 3.65 million shares,
and they closed on Friday at $80.125).
</P>
<P>
   Valuing any Internet stock is frustrating. But in iVillage's
case there are a couple of extra worries. First is a lawsuit,
brought in January by a former employee over terms of an employment
contract. Two weeks ago, a former chief financial officer of the
company filed a declaration in the suit in which she accused
iVillage of ``inappropriate'' accounting.
</P>
<P>
   There is also new competition. Since last fall, Microsoft, the
Conde Nast unit of Advance Publications and others have either
entered the women's Internet market or increased their presence.
Most worrisome is a joint venture announced in January by the
Hearst Corp. and Women.com Networks. The two operated the second-
and third-most popular Web sites for women. (Hearst's half was
Homearts.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Given Friday's closing price, Steven Tuen, director for research
at IPO Value Monitor, a research firm in New York, said there would
be profit-taking over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts think iVillage can make it in the long haul. And
that, for those who didn't get in on the initial offering, may be
what matters most.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Bronson, an analyst for IPO Monitor, a research firm based
in Los Angeles, said: ``iVillage was the first to market in the
category. They have a sterling underwriter; they have built some
strong strategic partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   Though networks for women typically provide access to experts on
topics like cooking and careers, iVillage's strategy has been to
offer women a place to chat among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it has worked. According to iVillage's prospectus,
the company had 170,000 registered members at the end of January
1998, but 960,000 by December. And iVillage managed to more than
double its sales last year, to $15 million, from $6 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix, a New York firm that tracks Internet traffic,
estimated that iVillage had 3.16 million visitors in January,
compared with 2.37 million for Homearts and 1.68 million for
Women.com. And iVillage signed a promotional contract with NBC last
fall that analysts say will give it a huge visibility boost.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many Internet sites, where revenues are generated by
potentially fickle advertising and sponsorships, iVillage finds a
growing percentage of its revenue _ currently 17 percent _ coming
from the sales of products like baby items, books, horoscopes and
chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to use part of its offering proceeds to expand
its majority ownership position in iBaby Inc., an on-line retailer
of baby items.
</P>
<P>
   Still, iVillage is no widows-and-orphans stock. Losses are
growing, to $43.7 million in 1998 from $21.3 million a year
earlier. And they will continue for the foreseeable future, the
prospectus says.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, competition will probably intensify. According to
Media Metrix, the combined ``reach'' of Women.com and Homearts _
the portion of Web users in the United States that visited their
sites at least once _ was 6.5 percent in January; iVillage's reach
was 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining revenue growth may also turn into a challenge.
Despite healthy prospects for the on-line market for women, Ms.
Bronson thinks it is unlikely that iVillage can keep doubling
revenues annually. So after the stock's initial pop, iVillage
investors had best do the traditional thing and keep a close watch
on the company's competitive position.

TWO IMAGES OF POLAROID, BUT WHICH IS SHARPER?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talking with outside observers and then with management about
the Polaroid Corp.'s travails is like living a corporate version of
``Rashomon,'' full of wildly different perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   The outsiders _ meaning analysts and a handful of former
Polaroid executives _ say long-expected new products like
pocket-sized and single-use cameras are too few and are coming too
late to bring in much revenue this year. Polaroid's chief
executive, Gary T. DiCamillo, says the company's new products are
flying off store shelves overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders also say Polaroid, which started a new-venture group a
few years ago to great fanfare, has now scrapped it, shelving most
of its projects for lack of cash to support and develop them.
DiCamillo's take: ``We are still a new-product company, but our
new-product machine is located throughout the core business
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   And the outsiders say the same crying need for cash has Polaroid
selling businesses that it was lauding just a year ago as exciting
sources of growth. DiCamillo says instant photography products,
particularly those aimed at younger consumers, are doing so well
that management does not want to be distracted by anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The products we are focusing on are more successful than our
wildest dreams,'' DiCamillo said. ``The marketplace is giving us
clear indications of what will fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the retail marketplace is flashing green lights, but the
Wall Street marketplace has pretty much grounded Polaroid. Though
it was able to raise $275 million through a recent debt offering,
the company had to pay 11.5 percent interest, not much better than
junk bond rates.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid's stock, trading in the 30s in July, sank as low as $17
in January and now seems mired in the low 20s, closing Friday at
$20.625.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like benefits from new products are just not going to
accrue until 2000, so it's just too early to warm to the stock,''
said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid certainly is having a tough time financially. In the
United States, new bare-bones inventory policies at Wal-Mart Stores
and other discount retailers have cut deeply into Polaroid's
shipments of film. Emerging markets have gone from great hopes to
nightmares: sales in Russia fell below $20 million last year, from
$200 million in 1995, while growth has stopped in South Korea and
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polaroid's products suddenly became unaffordable there,'' said
a recently dismissed executive, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 1998 results showed the damage: $1.8 billion in
sales, down 14 percent from 1997, and $44.5 million in operating
profit, less than a quarter of the 1997 figure. ``Clearly, the
numbers we reported are not the ones we had in mind,'' DiCamillo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not. In July, with much hoopla, DiCamillo announced
that various Polaroid executives would be buying stock. Those who
did, however, have lost a small fortune by now. ``I can't imagine
that they knew they were doing a kamikaze number,'' said Michael W.
Ellmann, an analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But there are financial bright spots, too. Polaroid has excess
real estate on its books that could bring more than $50 million in
much-needed cash. Domestic cost-cutting programs are on target, and
plants are being shifted to China and other low-wage nations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say toy retailers have been impressed with inexpensive
cameras, unveiled last month, that feature children's icons like
Barbie and the Tasmanian Devil.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame Gary for husbanding his assets when he's
holding such really good cards on the consumer side,'' said Ulysses
Yannas, an analyst with Mercer, Bokert, Buckman &AMP; Reid who is one
of Polaroid's few Wall Street fans.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even some critics see promise in the new products. ``I
had thought Polaroid was circling the drain, but now I think
there's hope,'' said B. Alexander Henderson, an analyst with
Prudential Securities Research. Even so, he said, he cannot justify
recommending the stock.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid can already point to some overseas successes. The
Pocket Camera, which takes miniature photos and is meant for
children and teen-agers, was introduced in Japan last spring and
has sold so well that the company has had trouble keeping stores
supplied _ which explains why it has not been rolled out in Europe
or North America, DiCamillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Joycam, another low-cost camera that uses instant film
originally made for Polaroid's expensive failure, the Captiva
single-lens reflex camera, is also selling out in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And the company is now test-marketing a small printer that turns
out photographic-quality prints of images from digital cameras or
the Internet. ``This is just the first of many digital hybrid
products we'll be introducing,'' DiCamillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts say the flow of new products is agonizingly
slow. Polaroid's single-use instant camera, expected early in 1998,
did not reach stores until late fall. (DiCamillo says the camera
was delayed so that Polaroid could simultaneously introduce an
inexpensive reusable camera of similar design.)
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid led analysts to expect the Pocket Camera to hit
American shelves last year; now, it is unlikely to appear until
August, if then. Two products, a single-use 35mm camera that gives
thumbnail-sized instant proofs and an electronic instant camera,
have been postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid has been slow to introduce a new self-service kiosk
called Make-A-Print Express to compete with the popular Image Magic
machines from Eastman Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts doubt that Polaroid is cheerfully giving up the
four businesses it recently announced plans to sell: graphic arts,
holography, polarizers and sunglasses. ``As recently as May, Gary
was still seeing sunglasses as a valuable potential growth
engine,'' Ellmann said.
</P>
<P>
   To hear insiders tell it, DiCamillo had the same enthusiasm for
the new-ventures group. Hamang Dave, a vice president responsible
for incubating and eventually spinning off new businesses, quit
last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a dozen companies ready to spawn, but Polaroid was in
no shape to take the early years of losses that any start-up
company entails,'' said Dave, who is working on his own start-up,
an Internet training company called TrainingNet.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors, meanwhile, are circling Polaroid's core business.
Fuji Photo Film of Japan, for example, is blanketing Europe with
new instant photo products. Thomas Shay, a Fuji spokesman, said
Fuji has no plans to market instant products in the United States,
but analysts wonder if it is just a matter of time before it does.
</P>
<P>
   And DiCamillo may be racing the clock, himself. His contract
expires in November 2000, and though analysts do not think the
company is in play just yet, takeover rumors are heard often.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gary hasn't convinced the board that he's really got
something here, they'll be peddling this company by the end of the
third quarter,'' Yannas predicted.
</P>
<P>
   If it is not in better shape by then, would anyone want to buy
it? ``Polaroid is a megabrand,'' Yannas said, ``and that alone
would be enough to get $25 a share.''

LILLY TO STOP DEVELOPING MIGRAINE DRUG  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Japan)   By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. announced Friday that it would end development
of an experimental migraine drug that had been billed as a
promising new method to treat the monster headaches.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts applauded the move _ the market for migraine
drugs in the United States is one of the industry's most
competitive _ shares of Lilly extended their slide of the last two
weeks, falling 1.5 percent, or $1.375, to $87.4375.
</P>
<P>
   The recent slump is a sharp reversal from the first two months
of the year, when Lilly's stock was among the biggest gainers in
the pharmaceutical sector. Since reaching a 52-week high on March
5, the shares have fallen 10.2 percent. For the year, Lilly is down
1.62 percent, compared with a 5.7 percent gain for the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement had a greater impact on Synaptic
Pharmaceutical Corp. of Paramus, N.J., which had been developing
the migraine compound with Lilly. Synaptic shares plunged 44.3
percent, or $5.1875, to $6.50. The migraine drug was one of
Synaptic's leading compounds.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lilly said Friday that the migraine drug was
dropped because of toxicity seen in animal studies. He said,
however, that Lilly and Synaptic Pharmaceutical would continue to
collaborate on other uses for that class of drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, Lilly is very strong,'' said Sergio Traversa, an
analyst with Mehta Partners. ``The company is very picky about the
drugs it develops. The company has done nothing wrong. This is just
a bad period.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad period began two weeks ago, when The Wall Street Journal
and other newspapers reported that the Federal Trade Commission had
expanded an inquiry into the trade practices of several drug
companies, Lilly among them.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the inquiry, the commission is looking at Lilly's
licensing arrangement with Sepracor to sell a purified version of
Prozac, Lilly's popular antidepressant, people involved in the
investigation said. The investigation is still in its early stages,
these people said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, S.G. Cowen Securities lowered its 1999 sales
estimates for Prozac to $2.93 billion from $3.05 billion. While
many analysts said it was too early in the year to make such a
projection, Lilly's stock tumbled 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A Lilly spokesman said Friday that the company did not comment
on the movement of its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent slide in Lilly's stock, most analysts remain
bullish on the company.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when most major pharmaceutical companies are looking
at possible merger opportunities, Lilly does not need such a deal,
many analysts say, because of its strength in drugs in the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most promising drugs are Actos, a diabetes pill made
by Takeda Chemical Industries in Japan, which Lilly will market in
the United States and another drug to treat diabetic macular edema
and retinopathy.
</P>
<P>
   Provided that the diabetic pill is approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, some analysts estimate that the drug's sales may
reach $2 billion. It is unclear what money Lilly will receive for
Actos through its arrangement with Takeda.

CLINTON PREPARES AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR POSSIBLE AIRSTRIKES 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton tried to prepare Congress and the
American people Friday for possible NATO airstrikes against Serbian
forces in Kosovo after peace negotiations collapsed between ethnic
Albanian rebels and the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   Although he gave no indication of when military action might
occur, his remarks suggested it could be imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put a single American pilot into the air. I do
not want anyone else to die in the Balkans. I do not want a
conflict,'' Clinton said, acknowledging that U.S. planes could be
shot down if they try to penetrate a ``strong air defense system''
maintained by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's military.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton suggested that the loss of U.S. lives would
be justified in order to stop what he said would certainly be
``more massacres'' of innocent civilians if the United States and
its allies fail to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``In dealing with aggressors in the Balkans, hesitation is a
license to kill. But action and resolve can stop armies and save
lives,'' Clinton said during his first extended solo news
conference in 11 months. He warned Milosevic to return to the
negotiating table or he would do ``whatever is possible'' to weaken
his ``ability to massacre'' innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now only President Milosevic stands in the way of peace,''
Clinton said, noting that the ethnic Albanians have signed on to a
peace deal to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the atrocities committed in Bosnia by Serb forces before
NATO took action there, Clinton said he would not wait until ``we
have thousands more people slaughtered and buried in open soccer
fields before we do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the immediate humanitarian concerns, Clinton also sought
to justify military action as necessary to prevent the ethnic
conflict in Kosovo from spilling over into Europe, which he said
would inevitably draw the United States into war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a conflict with no natural boundaries. It threatens
our national interests,'' he said, noting that America's future in
large part depends on a ``stable, humane and secure Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton laid out his justification for action after a two-hour
meeting at the White House with 31 members of the House and Senate,
who urged him to seek congressional approval before ordering
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the lawmakers, including Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas, left the meeting convinced NATO is on the verge of acting
because of Milosevic's refusal to sign a peace agreement with
Kosovo Albanian separatists. The agreement would authorize
commitment of up to 28,000 allied ground forces to Kosovo as
peacekeepers. Pentagon officials have said that 4,000 U.S. troops
would be part of that mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what Milosevic is planning ... If Milosevic
starts to take human lives that is going to provoke a very swift
response,'' Hutchison said in a Senate floor speech following the
White House meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is sobering time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has set a debate Monday and Tuesday on Kosovo,
including an amendment by Hutchison that would prohibit funding of
U.S. involvement in a peacekeeping mission until Clinton presents
Congress with a plan, complete with a deadline for ending it.
</P>
<P>
   Although most lawmakers left the White House meeting still
unconvinced that military action is necessary, they called it a
``positive step'' that the president sought their advice. Emerging
from the meeting, they urged Clinton to do more to inform the
American people of what is at stake in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a high potential of American men and women coming home
in body bags,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. ``The American
people don't understand what's going on over there or the magnitude
of our involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said he could not support military
action unless Milosevic's forces begin ``a very significant
massacre'' of civilians in Kosovo. To act before then, he said,
would amount to an invasion of a sovereign nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to initiate an action such as bombing Serbia is really
an act of war, and I don't know that it has reached the threshold
where we should be taking that type of military action against
them,'' Nickles said.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference, Clinton said the Serbs had already
crossed that threshold by continuing to kill innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to do what we can to prevent further atrocities,''
the president said.``I hate to think we would have to see a lot of
other little children die before we can do what seems to me to be
clearly the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of lawmakers did offer conditional support for
airstrikes, contending that the credibility of NATO is on the line.
They asked Clinton to seek congressional support first, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the brink of a very grave situation,'' said House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``Can NATO stop massacres right in
their own back yard? Can NATO ignore some of the tests of history
in ignoring what's going on? I don't think NATO can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said, ``The outcome of non-action is
clear: Milosevic will engage in ethnic cleansing, the number of
refugees will be in the magnitude of tens of thousands, the region
will be destabilized, and our interests will be badly hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic continued his massive buildup of military power on the
Kosovo border Friday that Pentagon officials estimate at 40,000
troops. NATO began beefing up its own forces in the region and all
non-essential U.S. Embassy personnel are being evacuated from the
Serbian capital of Belgrade. International observers in Kosovo,
including 126 Americans, also were ordered out in anticipation of
NATO action. A State Department spokesman said evacuations likely
would be completed by the end of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered several
more fighter aircraft and refueling planes to the region to join
200 U.S. aircraft already on standby.
</P>
<P>
   Up until Thursday, Clinton was still hopeful that Milosevic
would sign on to a Washington-brokered peace accord that would give
the Kosovars limited autonomy as part of Serbia and allow NATO
forces to enter Kosovo as peacekeepers. But representatives of the
Belgrade government walked out of the meeting Friday in Paris,
calling the agreement a sham and vowing never to allow foreign
forces on what they consider to be sovereign ground.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's strong words, most lawmakers said they believe
he may put off action until next week in order to give the
Russians, who have long been allies of the Serbs, and a group of
European diplomats one last chance to convince Milosevic to accept
the peace agreement.

STATUE TO HONOR WOMAN WHO RAN UNDERGROUND RAILROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Under the cloak of darkness, Harriet Tubman would
arrive on Beacon Hill, a woman with a bounty on her head _ wanted
more dead than alive for spiriting slaves to freedom in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of the Underground Railroad, Tubman spoke here often,
a small woman who commanded the attention of men during a time when
women were supposed to sit and listen. Her fiery words galvanized
abolitionists, both black and white. After Emancipation, she
continued to return, speaking on behalf of women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   When old age kept her from the lecture circuit, her voice fell
silent. Though she is one of a few black historical figures
recognized by most Americans, there are few tributes to her.
</P>
<P>
   But, in Boston's South End, where a statue of her will rise in a
tiny park that bears her name, Tubman is making history again.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-foot-tall bronze sculpture memorializing Tubman will be
the first statue on city property recognizing an African-American
woman. It is also the first on city-owned property honoring a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high time,'' said Mildred Farrell, executive director of
the Boston Art Commission. ``It's a blessed event, not just because
it's a woman but because it's a woman of color in a neighborhood
known for its diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the city breaks ground on the park, now a fenced grassy
area the size of a half court, with concrete steps that descend to
an empty pit.
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance of the park, the statue of Tubman will beckon
visitors. Clutching a Bible, Tubman stands astride, her eyes toward
heaven. Her outstretched hand summons five adults, including a
mother cradling an infant, all following her on the journey to
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Sculptor Fern Cunningham, an art teacher who lives in the city's
Dorchester neighborhood, spent three years creating the statue,
which is now being bronzed at a Johnston, R.I., foundry.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the park, a 1913 statute called
``Emancipation'' will be installed _ the only monument in America
to freed slaves created by a black artist, Meta Warrick Fuller. It
depicts a freed man and woman emerging from a tree trunk near a
weeping figure which represents humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller described her work this way: ``Humanity (is) weeping over
her suddenly freed children who, beneath the gnarled fingers of
fate, step forth in the world, unafraid. The Negro has been
emancipated from slavery, but not from the curse of race hatred and
prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Though African-Americans have made strides in the decades
following the Civil Rights struggle, taking up issues of
institutional racism that Emancipation left undone, the fact that
it took until 1999 for the city to memorialize a black woman speaks
volumes about what America views as historically significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at African-American heroes, people who have been
important to our history to our development, they have been largely
ignored,'' said Cunningham, who spent months studying Tubman's
legacy. ``The problem with American history is that the history is
founded upon the destruction of the lives of certain people. The
clash is created in how we shall interpret history.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it's difficult for Americans to recognize Tubman as a
hero, because she stands in contrast to leaders like George
Washington and Thomas Jefferson, both of whom owned slaves. In
Jefferson's case DNA testing suggests he fathered children with one
of his slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the American dilemma: Who is a hero?'' Cunningham
said.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial to Tubman, she said, is also overdue in other parts
of the country. Cunningham said there are small statues honoring
Tubman in Auburn, N.Y., where she lived before she died in 1913,
but few elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   When her statue, ``Step on Board,'' is dedicated June 20 it will
be the largest Tubman monument in the country.
</P>
<P>
   While Tubman's statue is the first of an African-American woman,
and the first of a woman on city-owned property, there are two
other statues honoring women in Boston, both, however, are on state
property. Both remember women as victims.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the east wing of the State House, a statue remembers
Mary Dyer, who was hanged in 1660 for being a Quaker. Another
statue, on the south lawn, pays tribute to Anne Hutchinson, who was
banished for her religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Tubman, unlike Dyer and Hutchinson, will be remembered for
winning her battles, said Frieda Garcia, president of the Harriet
Tubman House of United South End Settlements, a community center in
the South End. Garcia said Tubman outfoxed the bounty hunters,
sneaking more than 300 fugitives from slavery in Maryland to
freedom in Canada, and inspiring the abolitionist movement to
continue the struggle. She lived a long life, passing away at 92.
</P>
<P>
   Tubman's tenacity and emboldened spirit is what Cunningham
strived to capture in her sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intially I thought of having her sitting down, but the more I
read about her, I thought she should be standing, and in motion,
she should be pulling people along,'' Cunningham said. ``I wanted
to convey the emotion and tension of her moving people along.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HARRIET TUBMAN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Her date of birth is unknown, but 1820 is widely believed to
be the year of her birth. She was born a slave in Maryland on a
Dorchester County plantation.
</P>
<P>
   --Tubman died March 10, 1913 in Auburn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   --Born Araminta, she changed her name to her mother's name,
Harriet. Her achievement in freeing slaves earned her the names
``Moses'' and ``General Tubman.''
</P>
<P>
   --She has been described as an abolitionist, nurse, preacher,
reformer, and spy.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1844, she married a free man named John Tubman.
</P>
<P>
   --She escaped from slavery to Philadelphia for fear that her
family would be separated after the plantation owner died.
</P>
<P>
   --She returned in 1850 to free those family members she left
behind. Within two years she helped 11 men, women and children to
freedom in the North along the Underground Railroad. Over time she
successfully helped 300 black men and women escape.
</P>
<P>
   --She established The Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged and
Indigent in Auburn, N.Y. after serving as a nurse during the Civil
War.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1869, she was remarried to Nelson Davis, a Civil War
veteran, and continued to devote herself to numerous projects for
black people and the suffrage of women.

A CELTICS CHECKLIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Celtics practiced in Manhattan Friday, at a place
called Basketball City. It was a perfect match. No city produces
more outrageous tales per minute than this one. And, really, no
basketball team is in flux as much as the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   You thought you had your Celtics checklist memorized by now,
right? You know: painfully young team . . . not much size . . .
awful on defense . . . shaky on free throws (they missed 10
Thursday against the Bucks). But there are five new ones to add.
</P>
<P>
   --Popeye Jones may need additional surgery on a knee that has
already been surgically repaired. ``He never got the knee back to
100 percent,'' Rick Pitino said of Jones, who didn't play for the
Celtics last season because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament.
Jones talked about not being psychologically prepared to play and
Pitino agreed. Now it is more than psychology. Pitino said he isn't
sure yet if there is something structurally wrong with Jones's
knee. He does know that Jones was able to play only six minutes
against the Bucks and has continued to limp on the court.
</P>
<P>
   The team placed Jones on the injured list Friday. He will miss a
minimum of five games. Rookie guard Marlon Garnett was activated.
</P>
<P>
   --Paul Pierce will definitely not play against the Knicks and
may miss Sunday's game against the Bulls. The reason is a left
ankle sprain that the rookie originally suffered 10 days ago.
Pierce aggravated the injury in the Milwaukee game. Even before the
injury, Pierce had caught some criticism from Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to learn to be a triple threat,'' Pitino said Friday.
He wants Pierce to be aware of the right time to shoot, pass, and
drive to the basket. Longtime Celtics fans may remember the good
old days of February 1999, when Pierce was drawing raves for his
balanced game. But a couple times this season, Pierce has received
such forceful talking-tos from Pitino that the rookie has been
nearly brought to tears.
</P>
<P>
   With Pierce out Saturday, Pitino will most likely put Greg Minor
_ who has been playing very well lately _ into the starting lineup.
Minor practiced with the first unit Friday. He could play either
small forward or shooting guard, depending on whom he guards,
Latrell Sprewell or Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
   --Pitino says he has a team of poor listeners.
</P>
<P>
   When you first look at that sentence, the temptation is to go
into your local bookstore and hand the Celtics some self-help
literature. Something such as ``How To Listen Well for 48 Minutes''
might be appropriate. But Pitino says the problem is not a
sociological one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a team of freshmen and sophomores, they don't
listen as well as a team of juniors and seniors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are definitely the freshmen and sophomores of the
NBA. They rarely see teams with comparable youth. So imagine how
stunned they must have been toward the end of their practice Friday
at a place called Basketball City. That's when a group of squealing
middle-schoolers invaded the courts accompanying that of the
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   --The NBA standings don't have a category to measure the
Celtics' listening skills. But the standings do indicate the team
is afflicted with a phobia. Fear of the road. They've lost seven
consecutive games away from home.
</P>
<P>
   What's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could tell you,'' Ron Mercer said. ``I guess we need
to take care of the ball better and play better down the stretch.
We really don't have any excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics play at Madison Square Garden, where they haven't
won there since the first 100 days of Bill Clinton's presidency.
Their road record this year is 3-11. The only glimmer in that
record is that only 10 road games remain. That means there are 18
games at home, where the Celtics are 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   --The Celtics have not truly practiced all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't practice,'' Pitino said, ``we prepare for games.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of spending two hours focusing on defending the
pick-and-roll, the Celtics essentially have extended scouting
sessions of their upcoming opponents. They take a break Monday, and
then play Tuesday and Wednesday. There is no time for practice.
Just games. And this month, the games haven't been much fun for
anyone wearing green and white.

PARIS JOURNAL: AN EDUCATEUR EN CHEF GETS TAUGHT A THING OR TWO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Trying to change the education system in a country that
fears any change is a thankless job, Claude Allegre, the feisty
French minister of education, says with some exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching and research in geophysics, his real profession for
most of the last 35 years, were much more fun, he said over lunch
with a group of foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes twinkling behind professorial rimless spectacles, hands
clasped around his ample middle, Allegre, 61, looked like a man
with a taste for work and joie de vivre. If schools could just
teach children how to appreciate both those things, he said, they
would be doing their job.
</P>
<P>
   But since his old friend Lionel Jospin, the prime minister,
picked Allegre in 1997 to run the large French education
bureaucracy, he has become one of the most vilified politicians in
France.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't mince words with his fellow teachers in the national
system. When he took the minister's job, he said, he saw his task
as cutting out the fat. That put the more than 1 million teachers
on their guard.
</P>
<P>
   But when he criticized them for excess absenteeism and said it
was a scandal that so many did not show up after summer vacation,
some declared open war.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``Allegre out'' graffiti are plastered all over the Latin
Quarter. Some 4,000 teachers took to the streets of Paris last
month to demand his resignation, and one of the biggest secondary
school teachers' unions has called for a national demonstration on
Saturday against legislation he has introduced to change the way
French high schools, or lycees, prepare students for a university
education.
</P>
<P>
   Allegre takes it all in stride. ``Not all teachers hate me,'' he
said. ``They see that the profession is in a period of great
change, so they are anxious and defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The French press often takes him to task for provocative
statements, but he can't seem to help himself. ``I said once that
English is no longer a foreign language,'' he recalled with a
laugh, ``and did I get into trouble for that!''
</P>
<P>
   It was an iconoclastic remark in a country where crusading
against inroads from English is a sacred duty. ``I do my bit every
time I massacre the language by trying to speak it,'' he said
modestly, in French.
</P>
<P>
   Allegre, a professor's son, studied at the faculty of sciences
of the University of Paris and in fact knows English well. He got a
postdoctoral scholarship to the California Institute of Technology
in 1964 and knows his way around places like Harvard and MIT. He is
also a member of the American Academy of Sciences and several
American professional organizations.
</P>
<P>
   British and American higher education, he says, is the envy of
the world. ``Universities are the American education system,'' he
said. ``The rest isn't so good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our education system is still one of the best in the
world, alas,'' he said, meaning the French system, ``because the
others have deteriorated even more than ours has.''
</P>
<P>
   But because, as he put it, ``the lycee was the sickest part of
our system,'' he began consulting teachers, parents and students
soon after taking office about how to change the syllabus that
leads up to the ``bac'' _ the baccalaureate diploma, without which
no university study is possible. To get it, students have to pass a
rigorous final examination that has been an annual spring ordeal
dreaded by millions of families.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, 65.5 percent did pass it. Now, partly because of
juvenile delinquency and alienation among minority students of
North African heritage, 62 percent receives the bac.
</P>
<P>
   But, Allegre pointed out, 20 years ago, only 34 percent got it.
Most of the rest dropped out at 16 and entered the labor force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we generate more young unemployed people than any other
society in Europe,'' he said. ``The lycee broadened its syllabus
and extended the school day, but lowered its standards and
neglected the fundamentals. `Close' isn't a good enough standard,
but that's all a lot of teaching aims for.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegre's plan to change the system was announced in final form
early this month. If approved by the French legislature, it would
among other things institute individual tutorials in small groups
for first-year lycee students having trouble with mathematics or
French. Schools in disadvantaged areas would have priority.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the plan would create interdisciplinary
independent study groups, guided by teachers, for students in the
last two years of the three-year lycee cycle, with increased use of
computers and information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Special instructors _ artists for art courses, native speakers
for languages _ would supplement the work of regular teachers. And
new fields like physical and sports education would appeal to
students turned off by the traditional curriculum of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is to get teachers to help students,'' Allegre
said. ``In America and Britain that's understood.'' Here, the
tradition always was that teachers taught, and students had to
figure out for themselves how to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great global challenge to education nowadays,'' he
said, ``and no country has really figured out the answer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Allegre said jokingly, he seizes any opportunity he
can to teach physics. He was alluding to a running feud with the
satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine about a television appearance
he made last month.
</P>
<P>
   He had used the occasion to illustrate the inherent difficulty
of mastering physics: If a beginning student was asked which would
fall faster, a tennis ball or a heavy metal ball the same size
dropped at the same time, he said, the answer would usually be the
metal ball. ``The truth is,'' he said, ``that they land at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the newspaper said Allegre was technically
right, but only if the two balls were falling in a vacuum. Air
resistance would slow down the tennis ball, it said, so the
smoother, metal ball would indeed land first.
</P>
<P>
   Allegre says he does not read newspapers but was alerted by his
staff and sent a handwritten note to the editor, who published it
on March 3. ``One of your journalists thought he'd be smart and
give me a physics lesson,'' the minister's note read.
</P>
<P>
   The acrimony continues in print, but Allegre says he doesn't
mind. ``I'm sure all the Canard Enchaine's readers have plunged
into their physics books and are learning a lot,'' he said with a
laugh.

c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere outside the surreal economic world where 23-year-old
entrepreneurs become $25 million executives lies the economy of
everybody else, where smart people with good ideas struggle for
years and then are never heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   At the junction of those worlds lies the prospect of good
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money Hunt,'' a public television program produced in
Connecticut, has figured that out. By aiming a camera at people who
by their very nature can talk endlessly about their ideas and then
pitting them against each other, the producers have created 30
minutes of sometimes corny, yet compelling, television. The program
is now broadcast in most major markets around the country (55
stations over all).
</P>
<P>
   The format is simple. Two entrepreneurs pitch their businesses
to the show's two hosts and a guest executive _ someone like Guy
Kawasaki, a longtime software executive at Apple Computer, or Brian
Maxwell, the founder of Powerbar, maker of food bars marketed to
athletes, who started a $100 million company in his kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurs are grilled on their business plans, and then
the guest executive picks a winner. The prize is an on-air
presentation of the executive's business card, handed over as if it
were a gold cup, and a promise of an hour of his or her time
whenever the winner wants to ask for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait until I have some crucial question,'' said
Cora G. Yang, of IQ Foods, a company in Downers Grove, Ill.,
moments after winning her match at a recent taping. (Ms. Yang,
whose company makes V.G. Burger vegetarian burgers, defeated Debra
Root of Mrs. Malibu Gourmet Natural Foods, a Malibu, Calif., maker
of low-fat peanut butter.) ``It's like having a fairy godmother,''
Ms. Yang said. ``I'm not going to squander it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Money Hunt'' is riding the explosion of entrepreneurship in
the American economy. For the 26 guest slots in its new season, the
program received about 1,000 applications on its Internet site
(www.moneyhunt.com). Its producers say they are negotiating
agreements that would allow local versions of ``Money Hunt'' to be
made in Japan, Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   All this for a program that had a quiet start. It first appeared
on a public access cable channel in Connecticut in 1996 and moved
to public television a year later. But even though it now has major
sponsors like Pricewaterhousecoopers and Yahoo Finance, ``Money
Hunt'' still has a ``Wayne's World'' feel to it.
</P>
<P>
   The program was created by Cliff Ennico, a lawyer who once
worked on Wall Street, and Miles Spencer, an investment banker,
friends who live near each other in Fairfield County, Conn.; the
headquarters are in an office attached to Spencer's home.
</P>
<P>
   The nautical-themed set was designed by Spencer's wife; his
mother, a former soap opera extra, sometimes operates a camera. And
in keeping with the entrepreneurial theme, Spencer's dog is named
Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The men in charge made themselves the program's hosts, but it
doesn't take long to observe that television is their second
language. They are often awkward, and their one-liners seem forced.
In acknowledgment of their lack of TV experience, they have hired a
coach to help develop their on-air personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Ennico, 45, who looks like a college English professor, is the
funny one. Spencer, 35, with all the smoothness and confidence of
the guy who sold you your Mercedes, is the serious one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Louis Rukeyser,'' said Wai Wah Chin, an adviser to
the program and a senior vice president of Charterhouse, an
investment firm in Manhattan. ``In the early stages they were
thinking of doing something with a gong, but I think they were
joking.''
</P>
<P>
   But the attraction of ``Money Hunt'' has nothing to do with its
creators' personalities; it comes in those intense few minutes when
they are peppering an entrepreneur with questions. It is obvious
that the hosts have done their homework, and even though they are
smiling, they can be merciless.
</P>
<P>
   To a clothing designer: ``Your plan calls for $70 million in
sales in 2002. Isn't that a little aggressive?'' and ``How do you
control quality if so much of your production is sourced out?''
</P>
<P>
   To an executive of an Internet company: ``You appear to have a
significant reliance on service revenue versus licensing fees. Do
you see that as a potential inhibitor to the growth of the
company?''
</P>
<P>
   And to the founder of another Internet company: ``What's your
competition on the Internet?'' After an uncomfortable silence and
the answer that there were about 2,000 similar sites, Spencer said
of the man's concept, ``I'm not really buying any of it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the guests seem to enjoy the confrontation, saying it is
similar to making a presentation to venture capitalists, although
it's over much faster. They often parry the questions with answers
that once again explain how great their ideas are.
</P>
<P>
   During a week when ``Money Hunt'' is being taped, entrepreneurs
come in from all over the country, and because three shows are
usually taped at a time, there are six entrepreneurs going in and
out of the Norwalk, Conn., studio all day. These people don't just
nod hello to one another. They gather in the greenroom and talk
about their businesses, bragging about their products and handing
out brochures like grandparents passing around pictures of their
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You want people to catch your fervor,'' explained Allen
Miller, who was appearing on the program and is the founder of
Corporate Carrier Networks, an Irvine, Calif., company that sells
back-office software to telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   When the guest executive arrives, it's as if Bill Gates had
walked into the room, because here is someone who was once where
they were and is now where they so desperately want to be. Forget
about a vague prospect of an hour of his time later; here's the guy
now.
</P>
<P>
   In a room full of entrepreneurs, nobody's shy. Ms. Yang and her
husband, Mark Barnekow, the chief executive of their natural foods
company, talked to Maxwell of Powerbar about how to instill the
entrepreneurial spirit in employees. The three of them shared
stories of developing their products in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never get the opportunity to sit with Brian like
this,'' Ms. Yang said. ``It's worth its weight in gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Root, who had whispered, ``Don't worry, I'm going to hit him
up,'' shortly after Maxwell arrived, leaned forward in her seat and
told him why her peanut butter would be wonderful in a Powerbar. He
listened politely.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell shrugged off the attention, saying he was happy to offer
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the other side of the table 12 years ago,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Scott, a co-founder of Nantucket Nectars and another of the
new season's guest executives, did not mind being pounced on,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I am when there are people who can be helpful to
me,'' acknowledged Scott, whose venture turned a fruit drink recipe
into a multimillion-dollar company. ``I don't have any incredible
insights. I've just been through the battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is almost an extension of the action in the greenroom.
It moves fast and sometimes everybody tries to talk at once. The
questions and answers come so quickly that the guest executive,
whom the show calls a mentor, sometimes has to struggle to get in a
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we started rolling, I saw that I would have to dive
in,'' Maxwell said of the program on which he appeared. ``There
weren't any gaps. It made for pretty good television.''
</P>
<P>
   After both entrepreneurs have been grilled and have stepped off
camera, but are still well within earshot, the hosts and mentor
discuss the companies as Siskel and Ebert used to discuss movies:
agreeing, disagreeing, sometimes rolling their eyes at each other.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of offering thumbs up or thumbs down, Ennico and
Spencer defer to the mentor for the verdict. Maxwell picked Ms.
Yang. Scott, in his guest appearance, chose Chris Lohring of
Tremont Brewery in Boston, saying he felt he could help Tremont
more, even though the company it was up against, the on-line Kosher
Grocer Inc. of Brooklyn, had more short-term potential.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Alexander, co-founder of Kosher Grocer, said later that
she didn't think Scott understood her business. Still, she left the
show feeling encouraged and has since received e-mail from Spencer,
offering advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two hosts favored my business plan, but the mentor didn't,
which is a very realistic reaction to anybody's business plan,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Cowsert not only didn't win in his recent appearance on
the program; he had to sit on the set and explain why his company
went bust. Cowsert had been on the program last season and been
beaten by an electricity reseller. Now the hosts had invited him
back for a bit of show and tell, cautioning other entrepreneurs on
what to avoid. (``He was in a train wreck,'' Spencer confided
before the taping.)
</P>
<P>
   Cowsert's company, Newstar Collaborative Technologies in St.
Louis, had developed teleconferencing software and was doing pretty
well until Microsoft and Netscape Communications got into the
business. Now Cowsert is, well, doing something else, but he said
he was happy to go over some do's and don't's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always tell the pioneers by the arrows in their
backs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ennico said people have gone on the show with some unusual
ideas. He remembers a man who wanted to set up an Internet site
where people could mix and match existing music to make customized
compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded great; he really had his technology down,'' Ennico
said. ``There was one problem. He didn't have a deal with the major
record companies, and he couldn't understand why they wouldn't be
interested. Our mentor had to explain, in no uncertain terms, why
they wouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurs say they hope their appearance on the program
will attract investors, but that doesn't seem to happen often. CMS
Technologies of Livonia, Mich., which provides tracking and
security systems for computer networks, said that after the
appearance of one of its executives, an order was placed by a
Princeton University official who had been watching the program,
but no investors called.
</P>
<P>
   Investors did contact Doug Monahan, founder of Sunset Direct, a
computer sales and marketing company in Austin, Texas, but he
turned them down. He did, however, hire Pricewaterhousecoopers, a
Money Hunt sponsor, as his accountant after the show.
</P>
<P>
   Lucinda Duncalfe, chief executive of the Destiny Software Corp.,
a Conshohocken, Pa., company that creates Internet systems for the
financial services industry, said she heard from only a few
individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venture capitalists don't look at TV for deal flow,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Petersen of Rhino Naturals, a company in Los Angeles
that makes liquid dietary supplements, said he did hear from an old
school friend after appearing on the program.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We've met with a dozen investors since we taped the show, and
I've asked if any of them saw it, and they all said no,'' Petersen
said. ``So I don't know who's watching it except my high school
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Haney, who is on the advisory board of a group in
California that invests in nascent companies, said when asked about
the program: ``I never heard of it.'' One executive at a venture
capital firm in the San Francisco Bay area, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said he had seen ``Money Hunt'' but dismissed it as
an infomercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you're going to come across an insomniac investor who's
up at one in the morning, but you're not going to attract important
investors,'' he said, referring to the program's midnight Sunday
time slot on KQED, a public television station in San Francisco.
The program is seen in the New York area on WLIW, Channel 21, at
12:30 P.M. Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Bachemin, the program publicist for KQED, said that about
14,000 households tune into the program, although many may be
taping it. The main audience, she figures, is other entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty good for midnight,'' she said of the audience.
``The programmers think it's because the Bay area is such an
entrepreneurial area. They want to see what other entrepreneurs are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom O'Malia, director of the Greif Entrepreneurship Center at
the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern
California, said he had seen the program and felt that it provided
a valuable service by spotlighting entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the focus on money disturbed him. As a prerequisite
for starting a business, he said, money is overrated, and many
entrepreneurs fall into the trap of handing over too much of their
businesses to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all read about the heroes that made it, but many try to go
from the minor leagues right to the major leagues,'' O'Malia said.
``They go right into the money business instead of being
entrepreneurs. Of all the myths of entrepreneurship, perhaps the
greatest is that you need a lot of money to start a company. You
don't. I mean, Apple started with $1,600.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Money Hunt,'' of course, is all about money, and the show is
itself an entrepreneurial enterprise. As one mentor said moments
after a taping finished, ``Someone should do a ``Money Hunt'' on
`Money Hunt.' '' Spencer certainly has plans to expand the
television franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be a puddle of a man if I don't end up with commercial
distribution of this enterprise,'' he said, suggesting that ``Money
Hunt'' could be shown on the Fox network before football, on CNBC
on the weekends or on CNN. ``We're a little public TV show now, but
that's just where we'll be from.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he sees potential beyond television. The two hosts
have written a book about entrepreneurs, still untitled, for Harper
Collins; it is due out in the fall. Spencer also would like to find
a way that he and Ennico might profit from one of the program's
most valuable assets: the information on all those applications
from entrepreneurs that is sitting in their computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are some of the fastest-growing companies in the United
States,'' he said. ``It's a heck of a data base, and the most
attractive option is assigning the deals to pools of capital.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though many entrepreneurs reported little response from
potential investors to their appearances on the show, Spencer said
he was already getting calls from investors about some of his
guests and was using his investment banking skills to match the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I skim the cream,'' he said. ``Last year I generated six
figures in fees. I'm very opportunistic, but there's always another
bus coming in two minutes. Right now, I have buses lined up.''

LOWER STANDARDS FOR ATHLETES? A NO BRAINER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've got another Proposition for Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the test scores of these so-called ``deprived''
athletes when they are leaving college.
</P>
<P>
   Buckwalter is the federal judge who threw out the NCAA's
Proposition 16 college entrance requirements for athletes, saying
``African-American and low-income student-athletes have been
disproportionately impacted'' by the standards on classroom grades
and standardized test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 48, which evolved into Prop. 16, was adopted in 1986
and placed tougher entrance requirements on athletes. The ruling
attempted to limit schools from accepting any athlete as long as he
or she could play.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge has his way (the NCAA is appealing) there would be
no limits as to how low a college could go academically to bring in
an athlete at the Division 1 and 2 levels.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has been using the Wonderlic testing system for years to
mentally evaluate college players eligible for the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Wonderlic Personnel Testing company has been used by close
to 40,000 businesses around the nation. The average score is a 22.
</P>
<P>
   The average score of an NFL player this year is 15.
</P>
<P>
   The average score for a custodian is 14. A 15 is well below
average intelligence. And these are the results of players who have
been on college campuses for four years, supposedly learning.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those with scores 15 or lower _ even with four years of
college _ cannot read. The Wonderlic test is timed, and you have to
be able to read quickly.
</P>
<P>
   These results seem to dispute the judge's theory that these
students, who are under Prop. 16 standards, would go to college and
do well.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   All lowering the standards will do is make a bigger mockery of
college athletics than already exists.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This past week, I went out to dinner with one of the top general
managers in the NFL, a man who has scouted football talent on just
about every college campus in the country. The subject of the
basketball scandal last week at Minnesota came up, where a woman
tutor revealed she had written papers and taken tests for players
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does everyone seem so surprised?'' the GM said. ``It
happens in just about every school that plays big-time sports in
America. These kids don't study. They don't do their own papers.
Someone else is taking tests for them. It's a joke. Some of them
come to us and can't read or write. What have they been doing for
four years?''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've coached players,'' said one of the most veteran coaches
in the NFL, ``who couldn't read or write. These are the guys that
have a tough time getting a driver's license, because they can't
read the book. They don't know how to open a bank account or write
a check, or what a mortgage is. It's a shame. Most of them are good
kids. I believe in trying to educate the `D' student, but the
question is how do you do it? They cannot handle the load of a
typical college student. So you have to find something for them
that they can use later in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, those are the lucky ones. The ones with a chance to play
pro football, or pro basketball, make some money, and have some
kind of life. What happens to the average players who have nowhere
to go when they are finished?
</P>
<P>
   The players would be better served if the colleges had to
guarantee that they would be able to read, write, and have at least
some minimal nonathletic skills before they leave school. Make them
take a version of the Wonderlic test. If they fail, the number of
scholarships allowed that school would be reduced in subsequent
years.
</P>
<P>
   How about the student who doesn't play sports? Parents are
paying $30,000 per year in some top schools, and these kids have to
earn their way, while the athlete is given the tests ahead of time,
and some secretary or manager in the athletic department writes the
athletes' term papers?
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago a defensive lineman, now playing in the AFC
East, came out of a junior college after two years, played one
season in college, didn't go to class, and was drafted the next
spring. Ditto for an offensive tackle who played at Florida State.
I remember Deion Sanders saying he never attended a single class
his entire final year at Florida State, and yet he played every
game.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago in this space, we reprinted a part of Derrick
Lewis's deposition in the Reggie Lewis lawsuit. Derrick Lewis
played for Northeastern for four years, admitted under oath he
didn't have any life skills, and ``rarely'' went to class. How was
he allowed to stay in college for four years if he rarely went to
class? How did he stay eligible to play basketball?
</P>
<P>
   Big-time college sports, football and basketball, are an
academic joke at many big-time schools. They are continued solely
to make money. Bringing in more kids who are less qualified isn't
going to make things better, either for the school or the athlete.
In almost every case, he won't have an education when he leaves,
either.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Reggie Lewis case: can his lawyers be serious
when they say they are looking for upwards of $100 million in
damages, because that is what Lewis would have made the rest of his
life as a former Celtic captain and a potential coach in the NBA?
Someone should ask former Celtic captains of the past how much
money that title made for them in the future. Zip. And as for
Reggie being a future NBA head coach, that's a laugh. Reggie was
too laid-back and easygoing to ever be a head coach in the NBA or
anywhere else. Lewis died during a workout at age 27 of a heart
attack. The medical reports say his heart condition was
deteriorating. There was no way he was going to play or coach at
the NBA level with a heart condition that was so serious he
couldn't survive a workout.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though Instant Replay passed easily at the NFL meetings in
Phoenix this week and will be reinstated next year, several coaches
are waiting to see what happens to the ``whistle'' call.
</P>
<P>
   When the league was using Instant Replay as an officiating tool
years ago, the ``whistle'' became the popular cop-out for tough
calls on the field. The game officials got out of situations by
claiming ``the whistle blew'' before the play in question
concluded. There was no way to prove it didn't. For example, in
this year's Green Bay-San Francisco playoff game (won by the
49ers), Jerry Rice fumbled in the closing seconds. Green Bay
recovered and should have won. But the officials missed the call.
Instant replay could have overturned the call. However, the
officials later said that the whistle blew before the recovery,
obviously to take some sting out of the bad call. The inadvertent
``whistle'' would have overruled replay in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One small step for man, one costly leap for Max Lane. Word is
the Patriots guard had to come up with $600,000 out of his own
pocket to settle his end of the Paradise Club mosh-pit incident.
That's after-tax money, which means Lane has to make about $1
million to be left with the $600,000 to pay the injured woman . . .
Here's what is wrong with sports today. The NFL owners spent a
total of 27 hours in meetings over 3 1/2 days this past week. Two
of those hours were on football. The rest on money.

   WASHINGTON _ How about the liver and onions for $2.25? Or fried
whiting, the most expensive entree on the menu, for $3.95? For
dessert, the pudding will set a diner back only 65 cents, or he can
splurge, with homemade rhubarb pie for $1.65.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see, I had liver and onions, mashed potatoes with gravy,
the pineapple-lettuce salad and lemon meringue pie,'' said John
Kendrick, a retired professor at George Washington University who
has been eating at Sholl's restaurants since he moved to Washington
in 1941. ``For all that, I think I paid $5.45. Maybe it was $5.50
but no more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   For home-style cooking, reasonable prices and a friendly
atmosphere, there is nothing else in the nation's capital quite
like Sholl's Colonial Cafeteria at 20th and K Streets downtown. As
an old-fashioned slide-your-tray-along-and-keep-the-line-moving
kind of place, there may be few like it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, in a month or two, the last of the Sholl chain of
cafeterias, serving institutional cuisine for 71 years, might
follow the automat and tailfins into cultural oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington's economic fortunes and downtown rental rates
rise, the owners of the office building where the last Sholl's _
there once were eight of them _ has operated for 20 years are
asking for a 20 percent rent increase above the current $20,000 a
month, by early summer, to bring Sholl's more in line with other
businesses in the neighborhood. Sholl's 10-year lease expired this
month.
</P>
<P>
   The demand has not only forced George Fleishell, 71, the
cafeteria's majority owner and nephew of the founders, Evan and
Gertrude Scholl, to contemplate closing the cafeteria, it also has
brought sadness and defiance among devoted customers, some of whom
have formed a group to fight to keep the cafeteria open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is totally outrageous,'' said Jim McGrath, a retired
analyst at the Library of Congress and chairman of the Save Our
Sholl's Committee, who describes his mission as ``a labor of love
and a labor of anger.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath has called for another strategy session on Saturday
morning at the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treatment these people are getting is beyond belief,'' he
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McVay, a senior managing director for the company that
manages the building, Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, said through a
spokeswoman, Sheila Peck, that policy precluded him from discussing
negotiations in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the ambiance and affordability of Sholl's, and
its place in Washington's culinary history _ the Trumans, Nixons
and Carters ate at Sholl's _ few people might care about its
closing. But Fleishell and his predecessors always have
demonstrated a certain civic conscience, keeping prices low enough
for the poorest of residents while attracting high-priced lobbyists
and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a place like this in the city,'' said Robert Cutts,
an official with the Federal Communications Commission who was
eating lunch with his wife, Barbara. ``It would be a loss to the
city if it closed, if for no other reason than people of modest
means can come here to get a good meal and be treated with respect,
the same as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The same expectations also have kept Sholl's popular with people
like Ted Barnhill, a professor of finance at George Washington.
Barnhill eats lunch at Sholl's several times a week, drawn by the
simplicity and wholesomeness of the food. ``If you want to eat
hearty,'' he said, ``this is a great place.''
</P>
<P>
   But low prices can only account for so much. Tastes and trends
change. Washington's downtown is rife with ethnic and fast-food
restaurants, and Fleishell said he had noticed a precipitous
decline in the number of meals served over the years. Since the K
Street cafeteria opened 20 years ago, he said, the lunch crowd, for
example, has dropped to 600 people from 1,800.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have raised some prices on occasion,'' Fleishell said.
``One of the most popular things used to be filet of haddock, at
$2.95. Now, it's too expensive to handle. I'd have to charge $7.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what anyone can do to save Sholl's remains a question.
Harold Brazil, a member of the City Council, said he might write a
letter to the owners. Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., who first visited as
a student at American University, is serving as honorary chairman
of the Save Our Sholl's Committee to call attention to the
situation. McGrath said friendly persuasion might encourage the
building owners to lower the rent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Albert B. Krachman, Fleishell's lawyer, concluded that it might
come to public embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the outflow of support, the landlords should see this
as a chance to get a great public image, contribute to the
community and become a hero,'' Krachman said. ``Or they could close
a public institution that's been around for 71 years, put people
out and be regarded as an oppressive pariah.''

HIGH-STAKES GAME FOR CONNECTICUT WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ So what if the Iowa State women's basketball team
is the underdog? Don't say the Cyclones have nothing to lose, or
that they should just be happy just to be in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of talk drives Iowa State coach Bill Fennelly crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never understood the theory that you have nothing to lose,''
he said Friday. ``You have a game to lose. I don't understand that
mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for University of Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma,
who said, ``I hate it when teams say they have nothing to lose. We
have a national championship to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   So both teams know the stakes are high Saturday when they face
off in the NCAA Mideast Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-seeded Iowa State (24-7) last weekend beat Santa Clara
and Oregon to advance to the game against the University of
Connecticut (29-4). It is only the third time that 19th-ranked Iowa
State has played in the NCAA tournament, and the first time the
Cyclones have made it to the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Huskies, ranked No. 4 nationally, have been to
the NCAA tournament 11 straight times and have a 6-0 record in
Sweet 16 games. They moved into the regionals with an 86-84 win
over Xavier Sunday, where freshman Tamika Williams scored the final
2 points.
</P>
<P>
   Fennelly, said his team is inspired by that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Xavier played loose, they played to win,'' he said.
``We've looked at that tape a lot, and that's given our kids some
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And with no seniors on its roster, confidence is what Iowa state
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Fennelly is banking on the shooting of sophomore guard Stacy
Frese, who leads the team in scoring (17.3 points per game) and
free-throw percentage (.838), and leads the NCAA with 49 percent
3-point shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have great guard play to win at this level,''
Fennelly said, adding that Frese's toughness means as much as her
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   During a game in late November, she severely sprained an ankle
during the first half, but came back to play in the second half
(she missed the next four games). In a Big 12 tournament game two
weeks ago, Frese got knocked in the head, and the trainer told
Fennelly that the guard would be out for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I look down the bench and she put herself back in the
game,'' he said. ``It's like a running back who gets tackled and
lays there you don't think he's going to get up, then he gets up
and runs for 30 yards for a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Frese said she's aware that she'll be the prime target for the
Huskies, who are known for attacking the top scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, teams have been doing that to me all season, but if they
try and take me out, I'll just try and get the ball to the other
people who are out there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fennelly said he's also looking out for UConn's offense, led by
junior Shea Ralph (17.2) and Big East player of the year Svetlana
Abrosimova (16.8 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want our offense to be their offense,'' he said. ``I'm
not worried about length of time to bring the ball up, and the
shots, I'm worried that when we turn the ball over, it's a layup
drill for them.''
</P>
<P>
   If UConn wins, it would be the sixth season in a row that
Auriemma has led his team to at least 30 wins. But he said that's
not a record he cares about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we've only been in the Final Four two of the past five
years,'' he said. ``So if we win and it's 30, and we lose Monday,
I'm not going to be a happy camper.''
</P>
<P>
   The second Mideast Regional game pits No. 2 seed and ACC
champion Clemson against No. 3 seed Georgia. Clemson, ranked 10th
nationally, set the school record for wins with a 26-5 record this
season. Georgia, which is making its 16th trip to the NCAA
tournament, is ranked 12th nationally. Its leading point scorers
are sophomore guards _ and twin sisters _ Coco (19.1 points per
game) and Kelly Miller (18.1 points per game).

COMMENTARY: IN CREDIBILITY GULCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last year the United States and NATO have repeatedly
warned and threatened Slobodan Milosevic. Stop your assaults on the
people of Kosovo, we have told the Yugoslav president, or we will
carry out air attacks on Serbian forces there and elsewhere in
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has treated the threats contemptuously, as bluffs. And
that is what they have been so far. The record is an object lesson
in how not to conduct policy, with heavy costs:
</P>
<P>
   _ The credibility of the United States, in particular that of
President Clinton, has been severely damaged in the world.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO's credibility has also been badly hurt. Its leaders will
gather in Washington a month from now to celebrate its 50th
anniversary; but unless the Kosovo humiliation has somehow been
reversed, it will be a strange celebration.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 90 percent of Kosovars who are of ethnic Albanian origin
have paid a terrible price in human terms. Hundreds of thousands
have been displaced from their homes. Many of their villages have
been destroyed by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The policy failure is the more remarkable because Clinton
ignored the overwhelming lesson of past dealings with Milosevic.
That is that you must act immediately when he starts killing
people, or things will get worse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 President Bush and his secretary of state, James Baker,
did nothing when Milosevic's army shelled Croatian cities. Their
empty excuse was that it was a matter ``for the Europeans'' _ who
of course would not act without American leadership. Milosevic went
on to the murderous war in Bosnia, with Bush and then Clinton
dithering until, finally, the Dayton peace conference was convened.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic began his killing in Kosovo one year ago, when Serbian
artillery and tanks pulverized several villages. At that point
action by the United States and NATO _ limited bombing _ would have
stopped him. But there was only empty talk, so he turned the screw
further.
</P>
<P>
   Last June NATO sent its planes over Macedonia and Albania, which
border Kosovo, in a demonstration that was supposed to impress
Milosevic. But again he called the bluff.
</P>
<P>
   In October NATO was ready to use force. But we accepted instead
a promise by Milosevic to observe a cease-fire on terms negotiated
by Richard Holbrooke. Milosevic never complied with the terms.
Starting at Christmas, the Serbs escalated the killing, including a
terrible massacre of civilians. Now they have large additional
forces ready to attack.
</P>
<P>
   By bluffing and delaying, Clinton has greatly increased the cost
of any eventual intervention. A year ago limited bombing would have
been enough. Then the plan became heavy bombing. Now it calls for
NATO ground forces, including 4,000 Americans, to keep the peace if
and when Milosevic agrees to our proposal for Kosovo autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose he does not agree. Suppose he is prepared to suffer
heavy bombing. Suppose he retaliates with even more savage attacks
on Kosovo Albanian civilians. What do we do then?
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said that American ground forces
will go into Kosovo only if there is a permissive environment. What
is our plan if the environment is one of Serbian political and
military resistance?
</P>
<P>
   After the folly of the last year, there is no easy option. But
the worst would be to do nothing. That would intensify terror in
Kosovo. It would threaten to destabilize all of the Balkans. And it
would devastate the credibility of NATO and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will have to say more than he did at his press
conference Friday to convince Congress and the American public of
the cost of doing nothing in Kosovo. He will have to convince us,
too, that he has, and will carry through, a serious, long-term
policy directed at the source of evil over many years: Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has responded to our diplomacy in the past only when
we were serious about the use of force. Holbrooke got him to Dayton
because our bombs were falling on the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hesitation is a license to kill,'' Clinton said at his press
conference. It is better for him to learn that late than never.

UCONN FACES BIGGEST LITTLE HURDLE TO FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ You're Jim Calhoun. You're 40 minutes away from taking
your UConn team to its first Final Four appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous years when teams such as Duke, North Carolina,
and UCLA had blocked your path, all that is standing in your way is
a small, 4,500-student Jesuit school from Spokane, Wash., that the
tournament committee thought was only the 10th-best team in the
NCAA West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   At every press conference the past two weeks, the question
always centers on what you haven't done _ not what you've
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   You smile when the failures in regional finals are mentioned
rather than all the wins _ an average of 26 a year for the past 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   You smile some more when it is mentioned that this looks like
your best chance to reach the Final Four, since you have the best
team in the region. No one questions that.
</P>
<P>
   You know that no team in the regional can beat you. You've known
that since the bracket was announced two weeks ago. You know that
you will have to lose Saturday's final against Gonzaga rather than
the Bulldogs winning it.
</P>
<P>
   You know that you won your first two tournament games as
expected against Texas-San Antonio and New Mexico, and things
looked even better when you came here last Sunday in what has been
an extended spring break vacation/business trip.
</P>
<P>
   But then you look at the bracket, and you can only shake your
head. Facing you is Iowa, which not only is a very good team but is
on a crusade because its coach, Tom Davis, has been told that he is
no longer needed and has turned into the grand old master of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   You hold your breath and get past that game, carving out a tough
78-68 win, you don't see a 10th-seeded team in your future. You see
Cinderella in sneakers. Instead of being the focus of sympathetic
cheers, wishing you well in your bid to overcome this invisible
barrier, you are now Goliath against David.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asks if this is some sort of test that fate has planned
for you.
</P>
<P>
   You sit back, smile, and nod your head. ``Let's put it this
way,'' you say, ``if we get there (to the Final Four), I think I
can skip purgatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Calhoun's No. 1-seeded Huskies take care of business as
expected against Gonzaga, there are places that some people will
want to send Calhoun that Dante himself might fear to tread.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night's victory over Iowa in a game that had World
Wrestling Federation overtones, Calhoun said he got a call from
former assistant Howie Dickerman (now the coach at Central
Connecticut), ``Howie said the entire state was humming,'' said
Calhoun, who also said he was not sure what that actually meant.
</P>
<P>
   All of it, of course, is in anticipation of what most people
think will be UConn's 32d victory in 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun and the Huskies have had to fight the perception that
they merely have to show up at America West Arena and the coveted
Final Four berth will be handed to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perceived as a David-and-Goliath game,'' said Calhoun.
``It's perceived, but it is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Said guard Khalid El-Amin, ``We have heard of Gonzaga. We saw
them in the power ratings all year.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn has been ahead in those same ratings all season, which is
why there are such high expectations it can accomplish what it
couldn't do in 1990, when Duke's Christian Laettner made his
game-winning shot; or in 1994, when a pair of missed foul shots by
Donyell Marshall could have won the Sweet 16 game against Florida;
or in 1995m when eventual national champion UCLA beat them in the
West Regional; or last yearm when North Carolina beat them in the
more-than-friendly confines of the Greensboro (N.C.) Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun was asked what he had learned from all of those
experiences, all of those disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to make sure that Christian Laettner doesn't get
into the game,'' said Calhoun, just warming up. ``I learned to make
your foul shots at the end of the game and don't get involved in
overtime. I learned that you don't get involved in a shootout with
UCLA and don't go to Greensboro if you get a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides that, I didn't learn anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Satuday afternoon, with the country watching and most of it
rooting against him and his team, Calhoun will learn if he is as
lucky as he is good, and if he is going to finally get to the Final
Four.

FOREIGN POLICY DOMINATES AT CLINTON PRESS CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the possibility of NATO air strikes grew more
likely Friday, President Clinton began laying out the case for
military action in Kosovo, declaring that ``hesitation is a license
to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that US and NATO pilots would be put in
harm's way if such steps are taken, he said, ``Make no mistake, if
we and our allies do not have the will to act, there will be more
massacres.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came at his first solo news conference with
the White House press corps since April in what was a postscript to
a scandal-ridden year and an example of how the climate in
Washington has changed in the five weeks since his acquittal by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy matters dominated the hourlong exchange, but
among the few nuggets Clinton offered was that his wife suggested
more than a year ago that they move to New York after his term as
president. And concerning speculation that First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton might run for the Senate from New York, the
president said, ``I literally don't have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he and Mrs. Clinton were ``working hard'' to repair
their marriage strained by the sex scandal. ``We love each other
very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fielded about two dozen questions ranging from lessons
he has learned after lying about an affair with Monica S. Lewinsky,
to accusations of Chinese espionage at US nuclear laboratories, to
the ridiculing of Vice President Al Gore over his claims that he
invented the Internet, to his reaction to criticism from former
aides who say they no longer think he is fit to be president.
</P>
<P>
   On Kosovo, Clinton blamed the possibility of military action on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosovic, who has not signed a peace
agreement accepted this week by Kosovo's Albanian rebels. ``Only
President Milosevic stands in the way of peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have massed their troops. They have continued to take
aggressive action. They have already leveled one village in the
recent past, killed a lot of innocent people. I do not believe that
we ought to have thousands more people slaughtered and buried in
open soccer fields before we do something. I think that would be
unfortunate, if we said we have to have a lot more victims before
we can stop what we know is about to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing his personal distaste for a possible military action
in Kosovo, Clinton said: ``I do not want to put a single American
pilot in the air. I do not want anyone else to die in the Balkans.
I do not want a conflict. I would give anything to be here talking
about something else. But a part of my responsibility is to try to
leave to my successors an environment in Europe that is stable,
humane and secure. It will be a big part of America's future.''
</P>
<P>
   On the impeachment crisis, the president, reminded of the George
Washington allegory on the importance of truth-telling, said he
hoped young people will learn from his experience that even for
presidents ``there are consequences when you don't'' tell the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   He called his lying ``one negative'' in his box score. ``And
there will be the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times when
the record will show that I did not abuse my authority as
president, that I was truthful with the American people, and scores
and scores of allegations were made against me and widely
publicized without regard to whether they were true or not. Most of
them have already been actually proved false.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he said, ``I would hope that there would be a higher
regard for truth-telling by all people in public life and all those
who report on it. I think it would be a very good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton refused to go beyond his attorney's previous denial
that he allegedly raped an Arkansas nursing home operator more than
20 years ago when he was the state's attorney general. The woman,
Juanita Brodderick, recently came forward to tell her story.
``There's been a statement made by my attorney,'' the president
said. ``He speaks for me, and I think he spoke quite clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had ``absorbed no pain'' from highly critical
books written by his former aides, including a recent one by former
senior adviser George Stephanopoulos, because he had not read them
or any articles about the books. However, he said, ``I very much
value the loyalty and service I have received from the overwhelming
majority of the people who have worked here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended his adminstration's handling of suspected
Chinese espionage at US nuclear labs in the 1980s. On Thursday, he
ordered a review of the security threat in the wake of suspicions
that China stole nuclear weapons technology from Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Of the FBI investigation, begun in 1996, he said, ``It is my
understanding that the investigation has not yet determined for
sure that espionage occurred. That does not mean that there was not
a faulty security situation at the lab. The security procedures
were too weak for years and years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   He also defended US dealings with China, saying, ``Our
relationship is not perfect, but I think it is the correct
course.'' And he denied that the administration was slow to act or
that its response was influenced by contributions from
Chinese-Americans to his reelection and other Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   On Gore, Clinton defended his vice president, who has been
taunted for claiming he invented the Internet and opening his
presidential campaign in Iowa without mentioning his priviledged
upbringing in Washington as the son of a senator, but instead
talking about how he slopped hogs, drove mules, built homes and
cleared land by hand with a double-bladed ax.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came a lot closer to inventing the Internet than I did,''
Clinton quipped. ``As far as his boyhood home,'' the president
added, ``I know what you're saying. You're saying, well, he went to
St. Alban's and his daddy was a senator. But it's also true that he
is from East Tennessee and he did learn to do all those things on
the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton passed up the chance to reflect on his feelings about
the impeachment process. ``I think it's best for me not to focus on
that now,'' he said. ``It seems to me that anything I say or do, or
any time I spend ... on that will detract from my ability to be an
effective president.''

   But asked why people had ``been so mean'' to him, Clinton
laughed and told a joke about a man who is walking along the Grand
Canyon and falls off, but sees a twig and grabs it, and then sees
the roots of the twig start to come loose. The man asks the Lord
why him, and ``this thunderous voice says, `Son, there is just
something about you I don't like.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Turning more serious, he said, ``Whatever happens, I have been
blessed in my life. Most of us leave this life further ahead than
we would be if all we got was justice...I wouldn't trade anything
for having had the opportunity to be president and do the work I
have done.''

GARCIAPARRA TROUBLED BY SORE ARM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ It may be nothing more than a spring-training
sore arm. If this were the regular season, Nomar Garciaparra says,
he would have been playing shortstop Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But because the player in question is The Franchise, Sox camp
was at full alert, awaiting word on Garciaparra's status.
</P>
<P>
   While the Red Sox played the Cincinnati Reds here, Garciaparra
stayed back in Fort Myers, where he received treatment and played
catch. Garciaparra has now gone eight games without playing
shortstop, and while he told the team's medical staff Friday that
he was ``encouraged'' by how he felt after his session of light
throwing, according to club spokesman Kevin Shea, he has an
appointment to see team doctor Arthur Pappas this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably won't know anything till (Saturday),'' manager
Jimy Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be all right. In my mind he's going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's condition to date has been described as biceps
tendinitis, a not uncommon malady. Garciaparra told reporters
Friday he felt a ``sharp pain'' when he threw.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Garciaparra may have hurt himself on a relay throw
from left field a week ago Thursday against Toronto. That was the
indication he got from team trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember seeing the relay throw, he had good stuff on it,''
Williams said. ``I don't know if he had a good grip on the ball or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra did not play last weekend, but returned to the
lineup Monday as the team's designated hitter. With the Reds a
National League opponent, no DH was used Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox trainers are not permitted to discuss injuries,
deferring all questions to Pappas. Dr. Tim Kremchek, the Reds'
medical director who is Harvard and Tufts-trained, agreed to speak
about biceps tendinitis in general terms, cautioning that he does
not know the specifics of Garciaparra's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biceps tendinitis in an infielder is not an uncommon
problem,'' Kremchek said. ``And sharp pain would not be
inconsistent with the condition. He could have strained it, then it
got inflamed. Eight days would be a long time to be out with biceps
tendinitis in the regular season, but during spring training it
means nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, if that's the case, and he's hitting and
DHing, I doubt it's very serious. It can't be that bad. I'm sure
Dr. Pappas will take a look at him, and probably with rest and
exercise he'll do well.''
</P>
<P>
   If Garciaparra says he'd be playing if this were the regular
season, that's probably true, Kremchek said. ``But why take that
chance in March?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra said Friday he has given no thought to seeking a
second opinion. Club spokesman Shea said that if Garciaparra feels
the need to do so, the club would be supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Garciaparra missed 16 games with a separated right
shoulder, injured when he dived for a ground ball in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Williams preferred to take an optimistic stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some time yet,'' Williams said. ``Think about the
type of kid he is, who he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We open up two weeks from Monday. We've got time. His legs are
fine, he's been hitting. We'll take care of this. It's not as if he
wasn't throwing in that last game. It's not like he came out of the
game.''

   PARIS _ The collapse of the Kosovo peace talks in Paris has
brought NATO and the Serbs once again to the brink of open war.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE monitoring organization _ fearful that the Serbs might
take their unarmed personnel hostage in the event of a NATO
bombardment _ ordered all staff to leave Kosovo at once.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo delegation to the Paris peace talks, which signed the
autonomy agreement on Thursday night in the absence of the Serbs,
was Friday on its way to NATO headquarters in Brussels for a
briefing on the air offensive that might be opened against Belgrade
by next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   American and French diplomats suggested last night that the
Serbs would be given until Wednesday to change their minds and sign
the agreement, which would give Kosovo Albanians their own
parliament and constitution and a strong measure of local autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   But the fierce rejection of the agreement by the Serbian
President, Milan Milutinovic, who said that the Yugoslav armed
forces would fight Nato to defend their country if it came under
attack, appeared to rule out any 11th hour change of heart in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO sources in Paris said that initial air strikes _ using up
to 50 cruise missiles _ would probably target communications
centers, anti-aircraft missile defenses, military barracks and
special police headquarters inside Kosovo, after which the Yugoslav
President, Slobodan Milosevic, would be given 24 hours to agree to
sign the autonomy agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to comply would lead to strikes against military targets
around Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, and the French
Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, yesterday ``solemnly'' warned the
Belgrade authorities against any military offensive against Kosovo
Albanians and threatened the ``gravest consequences'' if the
monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe were prevented from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   However, threats have been so over-brandished by Cook and
Vedrine over the past two months that the only thing likely to
persuade Milosevic to accept 28,000 NATO peacekeeping troops inside
Kosovo would be advice from his own military commanders to give
way.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Yugoslav President's recent purge of the army
hierarchy, that is unlikely to be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Vedrine's warnings do not have a ring of steel about
them. ``The (peace) negotiations have not succeeded,'' he said.
``It was agreed at NATO several weeks ago that if we found
ourselves in this situation _ and unfortunately we've reached this
point _ there would be consultations between members of the Contact
Group on the former Yugoslavia...and the NATO Secretary-General
(Javier Solana)...After these consultations...we will take a
political decision at the highest level to possibly take action.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued in Paris and London, Cook and Vedrine said
the Kosovo delegation's signature on the autonomy agreement meant
they had ``seized the opportunity'' of peace. The Yugoslav
delegation, on the other hand, had ``tried to unravel'' the
accords.
</P>
<P>
   In the original Rambouillet talks last month, Milutinovic had
accepted the autonomy clauses but rejected the military
implementation agreement which called for the NATO force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris last week, he proposed substantial amendments to the
autonomy proposals to which he had earlier agreed _ while still
refusing to countenance foreign troops on Serbian territory.
</P>
<P>
   As Western embassy staff in Belgrade were packing their bags
Friday for the second time in as many months, the 1,375 OSCE
verifiers were preparing to leave Kosovo as soon as possible _
which in practice means by road convoy Saturday morning. &QL;

BATTLE ERUPTS FOR CONTROL OF GUCCI GROUP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ A battle for the famed Italian fashion house Gucci Group
NV erupted Friday when a wealthy French takeover investor agreed to
pay $3 billion for a 40 percent stake to rescue it from a hostile
bid for control by French luxury goods maker LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton SA.
</P>
<P>
   But LVMH responded to the deal between Gucci and Francois
Pinault, whose various holdings include France's biggest department
store, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute; Converse sneakers, and Samsonite
luggage, by making an offer for all of Gucci that would value the
company at $7.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The drama that ricocheted in moves and countermoves through the
day pitted two of France's most powerful and most unconventional
capitalists against each other for control of Gucci, the hot item
in the global fashion world. It illustrated the new no-holds-barred
corporate dueling that is overtaking Europe as companies
consolidate to meet the challenges of globalization and a unifying
European market.
</P>
<P>
   The share price of all three companies rose to record levels.
Gucci's share price rose as much as 6.8 percent, to 68.25 euros,
worth $75 at the current exchange rate. LVMH rose as much as 4.2
percent, before settling at 232.10 euros, after it announced a bid
for all of Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   At stake for LVMH and its chairman, Bernard Arnault, was not
only the potential loss of Gucci, which it has been seeking control
of since January, when it announced it had acquired a 34.4 percent
stake. Arnault also faces the possibility of a strong new
French-controlled luxury group competitor built around Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   For Pinault, the deal would not only be a lifeline extended to
Domenico De Sole, the Gucci chief executive, who has been seeking a
defense against LVMH, but would also be the latest move in
Pinault's push beyond the bounds of the businesses of department
stores, books, records and mail order sales. That expansion reached
a new level last year, when Pinault paid $1.2 billion to acquire
Christie's, the venerable London auction house.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The skirmishing began early Friday, when Pinault announced it
would pay $3 billion, or $75 a share, for a 40 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pinault said it had paid $1 billion for the
beauty products units of Sanofi SA, including the Yves Saint
Laurent fashion house and Van Cleef &AMP; Arpels and Oscar de la Renta
perfumes. Pinault plans to sell those brands to Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Serge Weinberg, chief executive of Pinault-Printemps-Redoute,
said the plan was to use Gucci as a platform for the formation of a
big new luxury goods group. The group would be run by Gucci's De
Sole, and its fashion designer, Tom Ford, who would use the $3
billion received for the new Gucci shares to make further
acquisitions, Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci, which is based in the Netherlands for tax reasons but has
its operations in Italy, had sought to repel an LVMH takeover by
offering employees stock options that would have diluted LVMH's
share to about 25 percent. LVMH challenged the move in an Amsterdam
court, and the court froze both companies' voting rights pending a
final decision in April.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gucci and LVMH had agreed to send representatives to
Amsterdam Friday to resolve their differences. De Sole had insisted
that LVMH make a bid for all Gucci shares, but on Thursday Arnault
ruled that out, saying Gucci's earnings results, while excellent
given the weak market for luxury goods, made it too risky. A lawyer
for Gucci presented LVMH representatives with a press release
announcing the Pinault bid.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH officials expressed surprise and anger at Friday's
announcement. In Amsterdam, James Lieber, who was to represent LVMH
at the planned talks with Gucci, reacted angrily. ``Gucci has once
again taken action that has created a hostile environment,'' he
said. He said LVMH was examining its options and would contest
Pinault's offer before a Dutch court.
</P>
<P>
   Then later Friday, LVMH unexpectedly struck back, announcing a
bid for all Gucci shares. LVMH said it was willing to pay a ``full
and fair price,'' and people close to the company said that was
about $85 a share. At such a price, LVMH would pay $4.9 million for
the shares it does not own.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH said, however, that its offer was contingent on the
cancellation of Pinault's offer for 40 percent of Gucci and
Pinault's purchase of Sanofi's beauty brands.
</P>
<P>
   That counteroffer raised the possibility of an all-out battle
for control of Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably, it's war,'' said Jean-Marie L'Home, who follows
luxury goods at BNP Securities in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Pinault in Paris said the company would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   De Sole, who left Paris Friday evening for London, issued a
statement saying that Gucci's board would evaluate the LVMH offer
at a meeting Sunday, when it was supposed to approve Gucci's
results for the 1999 fiscal year, which will be published Monday.
De Sole, who earlier described himself as ``ecstatic'' over the
Pinault deal, said of the LVMH counteroffer: ``This is a matter for
the board.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the offer by Pinault had pushed Arnault into a
corner, leaving him with no alternative to a full bid, despite the
reservations expressed on Thursday, or face the likelihood that he
would become a noninfluential, minority shareholder in a powerful
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Arnault's counterbid puts the ball back in Gucci's court. People
familiar with Pinault said there was little likelihood Pinault
would make a counteroffer for all of Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   News of Pinault's move sent shivers through the luxury goods
world.
</P>
<P>
   Pinault, 62, is a tough, self-made businessman who enjoys buying
up promising companies and increasing their value. He does not shy
from a good battle and follows his tastes with his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   A connoisseur of wine, he acquired the Chateau Latour domains in
the 1980s. He is also a major buyer of 20th-century art, and has
dotted his summer property in Brittany with contemporary sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Pinault and Arnault have much in common. Both employed a mix of
savvy and ruthlessness over the last decade to assemble a
conglomerate of companies whose value they have increased by
eliminating overlaps in manufacturing and distribution, rigorously
controlling costs, and spending heavily on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But while Arnault has vaulted himself into the exalted position
of arbiter of global luxury tastes, putting particular energy into
high-end fashion houses like Dior, Christian Lacroix, Givenchy and
Kenzo, Pinault has made high-profile acquisitions in the world of
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, he has acquired France's leading
department store group, Au Printemps, and took control of La
Redoute, the big mail-order house, and FNAC, a book and record
store chain.
</P>
<P>
   His holdings in the United States include Converse and
Samsonite. Last year, he sold a stake in Vail Associates Ski Resort
in Colorado to help finance the Christie's acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   De Sole, born in Italy but now a U.S. citizen, was once a
partner in Patton &AMP; Boggs, the Washington law firm, and has worked
with Gucci for 14 years. Ford is an American who left Perry Ellis
to become Gucci's designer. Gucci, under their aegis, has gone from
success to success. Its fourth-quarter profits, released Thursday,
soared 62 percent, to $68.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   French analysts suspected that bad blood between Arnault and De
Sole had reached such levels that LVMH might try to oust De Sole
but make an attractive enough financial offer to keep Ford.

   PARIS _ Western governments prepared for military confrontation
and possible hostilities with Serbia on Friday, ordering
international monitors out of Kosovo and blaming Slobodan
Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia, for blocking peace talks on
the province.
</P>
<P>
   Once the monitors' withdrawal has been completed, probably this
weekend, the way would be clear for NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be going to bombing pretty soon,'' Senator
Joseph Biden, Democrat of Delaware, said Friday in Washington after
President Bill Clinton briefed congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders apparently decided that they have no alternative
to military action when they faced the combination of Serbian
refusal to sign the peace plan and a buildup of Serbian forces in
and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France, in a phrase reminiscent of
air strikes last year on Iraq, said Milosevic was ``solely
responsible'' for drawing punishment on his country.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said air strikes could start early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders have long threatened military action against
Serbian military targets in Kosovo and in Serbia itself if
Milosevic became the sole obstacle to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   NATO strikes reportedly will be designed to cripple Serbian
military strength and compel Milosevic to accept the settlement
signed by the ethnic Albanians before the Paris talks ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
   No further ultimatium to Milosevic will be issued, European
officials said, explaining that their governments had convinced the
Clinton administration late Thursday that any new diplomatic
deadlines could impair Western determination and worsen the
military situation on the ground in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The observers' departure could trigger military escalation in
the province, and possibly tempt the Serbs or extremist ethnic
Albanians to try seizing hostages among the 1,800 unarmed civilian
observers working there under the auspices of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has a 12,000-member extraction force under French command
in neighboring Macedonia poised to rescue monitors in an emergency,
but Serb forces have mined roads leading through the frontier
mountains and could threaten a relief bid that relied on
helicopters, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing the urgency of intervention, General Wesley Clark, the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) supreme commander, warned
Friday that another humanitarian tragedy was under way in Kosovo as
more civilians were forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   This crisis, he said, was caused ``entirely by an escalation of
Serbian military and police activity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buckle your seat belts for the next few days,'' Christopher
Hill, the U.S. diplomat who led the international mediation effort,
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy, five of
the six nations involved in the Contact Group that sought to impose
a political solution, agreed that the talks could not resume until
the Serbs accepted the peace plan proposed by the group.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, alone in the Contact Group, insisted that the talks were
only suspended, a stance that fit with Moscow's insistent
opposition to NATO's plan for punitive air strikes against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   No timetable had been set for air strikes, Hill said, but French
officials said that they expected NATO's secretary-general, Javier
Solana, to get the green light for action quickly, perhaps as early
as Sunday, when NATO ambassadors are due to meet in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   French and British determination was echoed in Bonn, where a
German official said: ``My government is certainly not dragging its
feet and sees no point in an ultimatum when developments on the
ground seem so ominous.''
</P>
<P>
   But all these officials shared the concern voiced by a French
policymaker, who stressed the military risks and political
uncertainties confronting the United States and its European allies
as they ``cross a threshold into a confrontation with no guarantees
about the timing or nature of its outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials agreed, noting the contrast with Bosnia, where
cruise missile strikes quickly persuaded the Bosnian Serbs to
accept a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   NATO now is targeting regular Serbian forces, the core of the
former Yugoslav Army, in their homeland, with air defenses _ and an
apparent desire to fight.
</P>
<P>
   General Clark warned Friday that the NATO campaign would ``not
be a one- or two-bomb affair.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO commanders were urging governments to compress the original
plans, which called for a phased campaign to allow for a
negotiating pause, into new orders allowing General Clark to
escalate quickly to overcome Serb resistance without needing fresh
authorizations from allied governments.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, NATO officials acknowledged, the initial missile
attacks and even subsequent bombing could allow Serbian forces to
step up their attacks on the Kosovar guerrillas and drive out the
ethnic Albanian population from wider areas. Already, Serbian
forces were being concentrated in and around Kosovo for what could
be ``a vast and violent onslaught,'' General Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more worrying for NATO planners is the question of how long
Western public opinion would support military action if Milosevic
succeeds in riding out the military punishment while simultaneously
tightening his grip on power _ as Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader,
has managed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders are hoping that Milosevic will knuckle under
once NATO starts destroying the Serbian military infrastructure
that is part of his power base. But prolonged Serb resistance and
continued fighting in Kosovo could confront the alliance with
problems for which there is no immediate military answer.
</P>
<P>
   No allied government has publicly envisaged sending its ground
forces into Kosovo to impose a cease-fire. &QL;

KEVORKIAN TO FACE MURDER CHARGES IN A TRIAL THAT BEGINS MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich)  (js) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Four times, prosecutors have tried to prove that Dr.
Jack Kevorkian, the man who says he has presided over more than 130
suicides, committed a crime when he helped seriously ill people
die.
</P>
<P>
   Four times, they have failed. Three juries acquitted Kevorkian.
One case ended in a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, prosecutors will try again. It is a trial that people
on both sides of the debate over euthanasia and assisted suicide
see as a potentially defining showdown over whether such acts
should be considered criminal or whether they are the entitlement
of the terminally ill.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, several key things are different.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the previous trials, where Kevorkian was accused of
violating laws prohibiting assisted suicide, this time he is being
charged with first-degree premeditated murder. That makes the
stakes higher for both Kevorkian and the state.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike his previous trials, indeed unlike the vast majority
of murder cases, the jury will actually see Kevorkian doing the act
that prosecutors contend is murder. They will watch a videotape,
already broadcast nationwide on the CBS news program ``60
Minutes,'' that shows Kevorkian injecting a fatal solution of
chemicals into 52-year-old Thomas Youk, who suffered from
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here they have Kevorkian directly causing the death of Mr.
Youk,'' said Larry Dubin, a law professor at University of Detroit
Mercy, who noted that in previous cases, Kevorkian was essentially
accused of helping people kill themselves, rigging up a device that
would let people pull a string and release the chemicals
themselves. ``The prosecution proving that Kevorkian committed this
act is very easy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean it will be easy to persuade a jury to convict
Kevorkian of killing Youk last September at the Youk home in
Waterford Township, a Detroit suburb. Indeed, experts say that in
some ways, the murder charge puts the prosecution at a greater
disadvantage than in previous cases.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, some say, the state may be able to make the case that
what Kevorkian did matches the black letter definition of murder,
intentionally causing someone's death. And in a murder case,
whether the person consented to being killed is legally irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   But emotionally, will jurors agree that arranging the death of a
desperately ill man who wanted to die is an act that warrants a
murder conviction, one that could result in a sentence of life
without parole?
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds are very high that a jury will say this is just
disproportionate, it's out of all proportion to what he did,'' said
Yale Kamisar, a law professor at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The initial charges against Kevorkian, brought in November after
60 Minutes broadcast the videotape Kevorkian made of Youk's death,
also included criminal assistance to a suicide, a charge that would
have given a jury a less severe option.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this month, prosecutors decided to drop the assisted
suicide charge, leaving only the murder charge and a much lesser
charge of delivery of a controlled substance. Kevorkian's license
to practice medicine has been revoked in Michigan and California.)
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' decision followed a ruling by Oakland County
Circuit Court Judge Jessica Cooper that an assisted suicide charge
would allow the defense to present testimony about Kevorkian's role
in ending people's pain and suffering. Such testimony would be
inadmissable with a murder charge, she ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a calculated risk, of course,'' said David G. Gorcyca,
the Oakland County prosecutor. ``But that kind of testimony has
proved lethal to our case in the past. In the previous trials, the
defense has entered testimony from physicians and family members
about the condition of the victim, such factors as choking on your
own saliva. What you had is jurors, even male jurors, crying. To
overcome that kind of emotional testimony at trial is almost
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   David Gorosh, one of Kevorkian's lawyers, said precluding such
testimony ``prevents us from presenting a fuller picture to the
jury.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the jury would have other ways to learn about
Youk's condition, including the videotape, which shows him
struggling to speak and breathe, hardly able to lift his hand.
Gorosh said the defense would argue, as it has in previous trials,
that Kevorkian's intention was not to kill, but to end a person's
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas Youk, death was inevitable for him,'' Gorosh said.
``But he didn't want to die. He simply asked Dr. Kevorkian to help
him ease his suffering, end his pain if he could. When you ask a
jury is this murder, when you think of what is murder, this is not
it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One unanswered question that could greatly influence the trial
is whether Kevorkian, 70, will be representing himself or whether
his lawyers will be handling the case. So far it has been a mix of
both.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, Kevorkian filed his own appeal, seeking
to have the murder charge dismissed or delayed based on the Ninth
Amendment to the Constitution, which says that rights not otherwise
addressed by the Constitution are reserved for the people.
Kevorkian contended the amendment means the government cannot force
someone in severe pain to continue to suffer. The appeal was
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Gorosh said that against his advice, Kevorkian has said he
wanted to deliver the closing argument in the case and to
cross-examine one of the key witnesses, the Oakland County medical
examiner, with whom he has had a long-running feud.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Gorosh said the judge indicated that either
Kevorkian or his lawyers should represent the defense during the
entire trial. Gorosh said he and Kevorkian had not yet reached a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to persuade him that the lawyers should try the
case,'' said Gorosh. ``He's an incredibly charming man, he's as
honest as the day is long, and I think jurors would appreciate
that. That said, a criminal trial is a complicated thing. How to
proceed tactfully with witnesses, with the judge, within the
confines of the rules of evidence. Although Dr. Kevorkian is quite
brilliant, he isn't schooled in the law.''

   PARIS _ Western governments prepared for military confrontation
and possible hostilities with Serbia on Friday, ordering
international monitors out of Kosovo and blaming Slobodan
Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia, for blocking peace talks on
the province.
</P>
<P>
   Once the monitors' withdrawal has been completed, probably this
weekend, the way would be clear for NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be going to bombing pretty soon,'' Senator
Joseph Biden, Democrat of Delaware, said Friday in Washington after

OPEC EXPECTED TO PRESENT UNIFIED FRONT AT ANNUAL MEETING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sometimes the best way to avoid a family brouhaha
is to spend as little time together as possible.
</P>
<P>
   That's the apparent thinking behind OPEC's series of meetings
where its quarrelsome members have privately agreed in a series of
meetings to reductions cutting output by 2 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   As a result when oil ministers from the OPEC cartel meet in
Vienna next week for their spring meeting, they aren't likely to
have to endure the squabbling between the group's two largest
producers _ Saudi Arabia and Iran _ that has characterized past
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, representatives from the 11-member Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries are expected to rubber-stamp terms
reached between OPEC's largest players and some key, non-OPEC
producing nations that has pulled prices up from the depths.
</P>
<P>
   That expectation has helped propel crude prices 10 percent in
the last 10 days. On Friday, oil for April delivery rose 24 cents
to close at $15.24 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC's primary task in Vienna, then, will be to shore up support
among the group's smaller members, present a united front to the
world, and get out of town fast. Some analysts are expecting a
meeting that will last only a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've already agreed on everything,'' said John Lichtblau,
chairman of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation. ``The less they talk, the (fewer) chances there are for
disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   They have reason to make some painful concessions _ oil prices
have been wallowing at depressed levels since late last year,
causing severe, economic woes for countries dependent on crude
exports.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the oil ministers will be asked to ratify an accord
spearheaded by OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia. It includes cuts from
non-affiliated producers Mexico, Norway and Oman.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached at The Hague earlier this month, would
require the OPEC countries _ excluding Iraq, whose exports are
still controlled by United Nations sanctions _ to trim their
production by about 1.7 million barrels a day or about 7 percent
starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
   To further smooth the waters before Vienna, ministers from four
OPEC nations from the Persian Gulf region _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
United Arab Emirates and Qatar _ as well as non-OPEC member Bahrain
are scheduled to meet Saturday in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the
United Arab Emirates, to discuss the proposed cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, oil analysts seriously believe the parties will
fully comply with the 2 million goal, which would pare world
supplies by about 2.7 percent. But the markets have been persuaded
the pact will provide for a sizeable cut of at least 1 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saudi Arabia, U.A.E., Kuwait and Venezuela will deliver a
million barrels, and the others are all varying degrees of
unlikelihood,'' noted one industry source, who asked not to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to cut 2 million barrels is very ambitious, even
excessive, said Leo Drollas, chief economist for the Centre for
Global Energy Studies in London. If such a plan were fully
implemented ``it would lead to some serious tightening of the
market later this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rothman, senior energy futures analyst for Merrill Lynch
in New York, said if only 1 million barrels were taken off the
market ``inventories, which are quite excessive, could get worked
down fairly aggressively over the course of the year and be back
down to near-normal levels by the end of '99. This, of course,
means cuts being sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   If the OPEC countries were to comply with, say, 75 percent of
the production cutbacks that would be enough to send oil prices
rising to $18, even $20 a barrel by the fourth quarter, said Nizam
Sharief, director of energy policy for Hornsby &AMP; Co., a
Houston-based energy risk management services firm.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has already pushed up prices at the gasoline pump and
for heating oil in areas of the country where that's the fuel of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   April heating oil rose 0.99 cent to 40.69 cents a gallon; April
unleaded gasoline rose 0.61 cent to 47.64 cents a gallon; April
natural gas rose 1/2 cents to $1.699 per thousand cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in May
rose 8 cents to $13.45 per barrel on the International Petroleum
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts give considerable credence to the accord because it was
orchestrated by OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, at no small sacrifice to
the kingdom. Saudi Arabia is risking losing some market share in
order to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the specter of government revenues plunging by a
third this year if crude prices did not recover _ Saudi Arabia
loses about $2.5 billion for every $1 drop in the price of oil _
the kingdom has agreed to take the biggest cut, a
585,000-barrel-a-day reduction.
</P>
<P>
   That's a dramatic move for Saudi Arabia, since it will push the
kingdom's production below 8 million barrels a day for the first
time since the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``They broke the sacred floor,'' said Raad Alkadiri, country
analyst for the Petroleum Finance Co. in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To bring OPEC's second largest producer, Iran, on board, the
Saudis accepted a key Iranian demand that Tehran be allowed to cut
back from a starting point of 3.6 million barrels a day, rather
than from 3.3 million barrels a day as the Saudis would have
preferred.
</P>
<P>
   On previous occasions, the Saudis have tried to cut a deal
before an OPEC meeting without rival Iran present.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``they had a lot of squabbling over the starting
point for cuts,'' Drollas said. ``So this time they were astute
enough (to realize) unless they brought Iran on board, they would
not get very far with OPEC.

<P>
   ``But the cost of this, the price they had to pay, is to accept
the Iranian position regarding the cuts last year,'' Drollas said.
</P>
<P>
   These concessions, however, are also an indication of Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah's commitment to having good relations with
Iran, Alkadiri said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, debt-laden Iran _ depending on oil exports for
about 85 percent of its hard currency _ has been bludgeoned by the
low crude prices even more severely than the Saudis. Last year,
Iran renegotiated its loans for the second time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Other OPEC members, of course, are struggling as well.
</P>
<P>
   Petroleos de Venezuela, Venezuela's state-owned oil company,
announced plans this week to sell $1 billion worth of bonds. Energy
Minister Ali Rodriguez, in a television interview, said the oil
company ``needs an urgent loan of $900 million because it doesn't
have the money to pay its suppliers,'' Bloomberg reported from
Caracas Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Nigeria, the government's financial position is stark,
according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ``Spending this
year will be only half of that two years ago and by far the lowest
of the entire decade.''
</P>
<P>
   While higher oil prices prompted by production cutbacks will
help the economies of the oil producing nations for a short term,
they will not solve these nations' underlying economic problems,
argues Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, the Washington-based economic bail-out reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message to oil producers, wherever they are, is clear: do
not delude yourselves,'' Camdessus said in an interview with the
French newspaper Les Echos. He said they must work to reform their
economies and diversify away from oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil prices will perhaps rise but in real terms the increase
will not be significant,'' he said.

   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter wants to keep employees from
practicing arbitrage in the over-the-deli-counter market at its Two
World Trade Center cafeteria in Manhattan. It seems that some
workers would ask for extra sandwich fillings but not always
mention them to the cashier.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would go up to the sandwich maker and say, `Can you add
a little of that? Add a little more?''' said Keith Waters, an
assistant vice president in charge of dining. The cashiers could
only see the sandwiches from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   The company's response: sandwiches by ATM. Since December,
employees have had to enter sandwich orders on a computer
touch-screen. Out come detailed receipts, listing extras like
coleslaw or sun-dried tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   People, not machines, actually make the sandwiches, while
employees get sodas and other items and head to the cash registers.
The cashier charges for all the sandwich ingredients listed on the
receipts, and only then do employees pick up their orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Waters said, ``we can account for items employees were
ordering but they weren't paying for, like bacon on a turkey
sandwich.'' The computer kiosk was part of an overall redesign of
the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Far from bristling over the new system, Waters said, employees
are just as happy ordering from a touch screen instead of a person.
``Most of our employees use their computers every day,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   Forty foundations, including Ted Turner's, held an urban-sprawl
conference in Miami in January. And a new nonprofit group, the
Sprawl Watch Clearinghouse (www.sprawlwatch.org), has been formed
to provide information and advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea behind this is that there has to be a regionally
designed response to metropolitan growth-related issues,'' said
Peter Bahouth, executive director of the Turner Foundation in
Atlanta.
</P>

   Other participating foundations included the Heinz Endowments of
Pittsburgh, the James Irvine Foundation of San Francisco and the
John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Joyce

   A New Web Site for Buffett Followers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone who follows the doings of Warren E. Buffett, the
acclaimed value investor and the chief executive of Berkshire
Hathaway, is familiar with his enduring bets on companies like
Coca-Cola, American Express and Gillette. These and other big
holdings are disclosed in Berkshire's annual reports.
</P>
<P>
   What isn't disclosed in those reports are a score or more of
Berkshire's much smaller investments. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has long exempted Buffett from revealing these holdings
until at least a year after they were acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new Web site operated by Today's Value Investor, a
newsletter in Hammond, Ind., is devoted to trying to track such
holdings, using data culled from Berkshire's SEC filings. The Web
site lists the ``presumed holdings'' of Berkshire Hathaway as of
Dec. 31, 1997; these stocks may have been sold long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stocks listed on the site, at www.tvinvestor.com, are
such current or former holdings as Torchmark, an insurer; Arrow
Electronics, an electronics distributor, and UST, a chewing tobacco
company. None of the ``presumed holdings'' account for more than
0.5 percent of Berkshire's market capitalization, at least in the
amounts indicated in the SEC filings.
</P>
<P>
   What use is the information? Timothy P. Vick, the newsletter's
editor, said he believes that tracking such positions can provide
insights into Buffett's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still an avid hunter,'' Vicks said. ``For people to
categorize Warren Buffett as a buy-and-hold investor is wrong.''

   Another Way to Win With Amazon.com Stock &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soaring Internet stocks may be hard to puncture in the
marketplace. But that doesn't mean they can't be deflated on the
Web. Global Investor Bookshop, a British online bookstore
specializing in financial publications, is trying to do just that
with a new Internet competition tilting at its much bigger rival,
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Entrants are asked to guess the stock price of Amazon.com on
April 30, 1999; the prizes include a ride in a hot-air balloon,
champagne breakfast included.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's keen David-and-Goliath competition at play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hurts Amazon, I'm delighted; they're a competitor,''
says Philip Jenks, 35, managing director of the privately held
Harriman House, the owner of Global Investor, which went on line as
a mail-order bookstore in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Investor's Web site includes a tongue-in-cheek
summary of Amazon's history, intended to illuminate the gap between
its bottom line and its blossoming stock price.
</P>
<P>
   The site also draws thinly veiled comparisons between the
Internet stocks of today and companies set up in 1727 during the
South Sea Bubble. One of them, Global Investor notes, declared its
corporate purpose as ``carrying on an undertaking of great
advantage, but nobody to know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition drew about 300 entries in its first two days,
Jenks said. Apart from the balloon trip, the contest offers 100
runner-up awards that include `'a panic button for your computer's
key-board _ for when the balloon pops.''
</P>
<P>
   Global Investor is a modest David, indeed: It says its annual
sales are around $1.6 million, compared with Amazon's 1998 sales of
$610 million. The contest deadline is midnight Greenwich Mean Time,
April 23.

   A Rush to Index Funds &QL;

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that over the last few years, mutual funds that
track the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index have been on a roll,
outperforming their actively managed peers by wide margins. This
year, however, investors are really taking notice.
</P>
<P>
   Through March 17, an astonishing 68.4 percent of the new net
cash flow into equity funds has gone to large-capitalization index
funds, according to Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, a
data company in Arcata, Calif. In dollar terms, $13 billion of the
$19 billion that flowed into equity funds was earmarked for
large-cap index funds.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period last year, just 16.4 percent of total
equity fund flows were into large-cap index funds, or $6.8 billion
of the $41.3 billion total.
</P>
<P>
   ``New investors are making a pure market play,'' Adler said,
adding, however, that strong inflow into a fund category could
quickly reverse. &QL;

CLINTON'S OTHER LEGACY IS BIG-TIME FUND RAISING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING for all needing)  
 (ATTN: Colo., N.J., Texas, Ark., Calif., Fla., Ohio, Nev., N.H. )  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's impeachment appears to have a
silver lining, or at least a green one.
</P>
<P>
   Republican efforts to remove the president from office have
prompted a spurt in campaign donations to Democratic coffers, with
much of the giving inspired by the president himself as he
crisscrosses the country, blames Republicans for trying to bring
him down and thanks his supporters for standing by him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was impeached by the House on Dec. 19 by the House
and acquitted by the Senate on Feb. 12, single-handedly has raised
more than $9 million since mid-January. He has attended more
fund-raising events this year (13) than he has held Cabinet
meetings (1) or met with foreign heads of state (7).
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very big draw, probably our biggest ever,'' said Roy
Romer of Colorado, general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. ``When they see him being attacked in a partisan way as
he was all last year, people rise up and say, `I'm coming to the
table with twice what I gave before.' Receipts are double what we
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer said that Democrats were in ``Alamo syndrome,'' which he
described as fighting back against attacks on the president. As a
recent direct-mail letter from the committee to prospective donors
put it: ``Now is the time for key Democrats to rally around the
president and our party. Otherwise, nothing stands in the way of
the GOP's slash-and-burn tactics. The last Congress focused almost
entirely on investigating instead of legislating.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight weeks, Clinton has raised money for all three
Democratic campaign committees, those of the national party, the
Senate committee and the House committee. He has helped raise money
for two state parties, in New Hampshire and Arkansas, and for two
members of Congress. In one evening earlier this month he brought
in $2 million for Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey
Democrat, who prominently defended him during the impeachment
process. Torricelli is not up for re-election until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, two Democratic fundraisers said that the president
raised ``very little'' money in the first few months of 1997,
estimating that the first quarter's total was less than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The president's calendar is chock-a-block with more events, and
aides say it will only become more crowded as the 2000 campaign
draws closer. He is scheduled to attend Democratic National
Committee fundraisers next week in Cincinnati, Las Vegas and Los
Angeles. Two weeks later he heads for lunch in Detroit and dinner
in Boston to raise money for a joint committee promoting Senate and
House candidates in 2000. That committee alone is scheduling
Clinton for about eight more events this year, with a goal of his
personally bringing in $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The national party still is more than $6 million in debt, but
Romer said that erasing the debt was a lower priority than
organizing the party at the grassroots level to help Democrats
recapture the House and try to pick up seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Such a frenzy of fundraising is unusual for a lame-duck
president. ``He's out raising money like he's running for another
term,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a public
policy group. ``With all the fundraising the president keeps doing,
it may well be that Clinton's legacy is going to be as the greatest
big-money fundraiser in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans typically raise more than Democrats, and Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said that
his committee alone had raised about the same amount of money so
far this year as the president had for all Democratic committees.
But, he said, ``We'd much rather see the president working as the
president and dealing with policy than being in campaign mode.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton speaks at these events, usually for 10 or 15
minutes after dinner, he frequently strays to topics like his
political survival. At the Torricelli dinner, where singer Gloria
Gaynor entertained the crowd, Clinton joked that he was trying to
decide which of her anthems to take as his theme song: ``I Will
Survive,'' or ``Never Can Say Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   His purpose, aides say, is to thank supporters for sticking by
him, to repay what aides describe as his personal debt to members
of Congress who defended him, and, increasingly, to make a point of
what he perceives as his persecution by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, he pulled in half a million dollars for the
Democratic National Committee at a fundraising dinner in Stuart,
Fla.. After the Drifters sang their paean to loyalty, ``Stand By
Me,'' the president said: ``I thought about how the American people
have stood by me through thick and thin. This country has got to
get over believing that our political life is about beating each
other up and hurting people instead of lifting people up and
bringing them together.''
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke Tuesday in Florida, he took with him two
Democratic congressmen from the area, Reps. Peter Deutsch, who may
run for the Senate seat being vacated by Republican Connie Mack,
and Alcee L. Hastings, a former federal judge who, Clinton pointed
out, had been impeached in 1988 and removed from the bench. Unbowed
by his impeachment, Hastings went on to run for public office and
win a seat in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Gary, a Florida trial lawyer who was the host for the
event, said that the donors, many of them African-American, found
the president an inspiration. ``He has refused to be denied, he has
been down but not out, he has been a fighter, and has had, as we
say in the church, to climb the rough side of the mountain,'' Gary
said. ``When you see all he's been through and that he never
considered throwing the towel in, that's inspiration for a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent the previous weekend in his hometown of Little
Rock, Ark., where he helped raise money at a state party dinner
featuring former Sen. Dale Bumpers, who gave the closing speech
last month in Clinton's impeachment trial. He also visited
Texarkana, Texas, where he raised $500,000 for Rep. Max Sandlin,
who served as a deputy whip during Clinton's impeachment in the
House in December and helped hold the Democrats together.
</P>
<P>
   At these events and others, the word ``impeachment'' did not
pass from the president's lips. Instead, he used the word
``Constitution'' as code to convey his argument that his lying
about his affair with a White House intern did not rise to an
impeachable offense as described in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time in the last year when a lot of people just worried
which way the political winds were blowing,'' Clinton said at the
$1,000-per-person dinner for Sandlin, ``that guy was telling people
to read the Constitution of the United States of America.'' The
audience responded with a big applause.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Moore figured that his career was in great shape. In 1988,
after five years as manager of the Acme Corrugated Box Co. plant in
Philadelphia, he had broken the union while keeping production
humming. Revenues were soaring, as were profits, even as half the
local competitors went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Acme's owner, Burton Cohen, said he wanted Moore, then 43, to
stay around. To help insure that, he gave Moore an executive
deferred compensation plan, also known as ``golden handcuffs,''
that would pay $50,000 annually for 10 years once Moore turned 65.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, when Moore was 51, he was dismissed. And his golden
handcuffs turned to dross. Acme's lawyer, Kenneth D. Kleinman,
explained that to collect, Moore had to be employed at the company
on the day he turned 65.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge, while sympathetic to Moore's situation, has
ruled that he has no recourse against Acme under the nation's
pension laws. And therein lies an important lesson for managers
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is simply this: A 1974 law designed to protect pension
benefits does not cover everyone. Indeed, Labor Department records
show that an exemption intended to apply to sophisticated senior
executives has been stretched to envelop hundreds of thousands of
lower-level managers like Moore, who has a ninth-grade education.
</P>
<P>
   The law, the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act, or
ERISA, was passed after Congress heard horror stories about people
who worked their entire adult lives for companies, only to be let
go just before retirement age so that they could be denied
benefits, or to get nothing because their employers went broke.
People covered by the 1974 law cannot be given the kind of deal
Acme gave Moore.
</P>
<P>
   The law required companies to put money regularly into pension
funds that were protected from creditors if a company failed. At
employers' insistence, though, an exception was made for so-called
top-hat plans.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed owners, executives and some top sales people to
have additional deferred compensation plans that were not funded in
advance _ under the theory that these people did not need
government protection.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said that he signed every form put in front of him,
including one that appears to transfer some of his rights to the
company. And he never consulted a compensation lawyer, who could
have advised him that the handcuffs were worthless unless Moore was
still on the job on a specific day in the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taking care of their factory, and I figured that they
would take care of me,'' Moore said, explaining why he never sought
legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The federal district judge who heard the case in Philadelphia
last year, Raymond J. Broderick, said from the bench that he was
deeply troubled by the way Moore was dismissed with nothing but a
handshake after 12 years. Writing later in his formal opinion, the
judge said Moore ``proved himself an effective plant manager at
Acme,'' with glowing performance reviews and only mild criticism.
</P>
<P>
   According to Moore, plant revenues during his tenure grew from
$2 million to $16 million, while the number of workers fell by more
than half, creating bountiful profits. His last written review, in
1993, praised his ``truly outstanding job of running the plant''
and said that under his leadership, ``the plant has become our
major sales tool.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, the plant had also survived a strike by the box
workers' union and moved to new facilities in Bensalem, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   But over the next two years, Broderick found, Acme came to
believe that Moore had reached the limits of his ability. On Feb.
26, 1996, he was dismissed. At the time, Acme offered Moore a
$50,000 settlement, but he rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   In carving out an exemption from the pension law, ``Congress
assumed that top-hat plan participants would be financially
sophisticated enough to negotiate their own `golden parachutes' in
the event of early termination,'' Broderick wrote in his opinion.
Nonetheless, he added, ``Moore, perhaps blinded by his loyalty to
Acme, had no legal entitlement to any monies upon his early
termination.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moore's lawyer, Robert Freidel of Turnersville, N.J., is
appealing the case to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals,
contending that there was a pattern of deception by Acme in its
dealings with Moore. The appellate court is expected to hear the
case late next month.
</P>
<P>
   Acme's lawyer, Kleinman, of Stevens &AMP; Lee in Reading, Pa., said
Broderick ``is very sympathetic to people he considers the
underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is an individual who had worked for the company for
12 years and was terminated,'' Kleinman said. ``But even this judge
found that as a matter of law Moore had no claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Salwen, the owner of the Executive Compensation Corp. in
New York, which advises executives on their pay packages, said
cases like Moore's illustrated how little attention workers in
their 40s and even early 50s paid to the full terms of their
retirement plans, whether the details were plain or complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area that cuts across the whole of Corporate
America and one in which there has been a void of regulation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Salwen warned that abuses invite more regulation. For now,
though, Labor Department officials said that they have received few
complaints about retirement plans that fall outside the pension
laws.

   When Not to Mix Deals With Gemutlichkeit &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Headed for Europe to break bread and make deals? Make them over
lunch in most countries, but over breakfast or dinner in Italy. But
in Germany, don't even think about a business breakfast; in fact,
you might want to skip mixing food and business altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That advice emerges from a survey of 1,508 European business
executives; the poll was conducted by Harris Research for United
Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the survey was more serious in theme: European
executives were found to be much less optimistic about their
companies' near-term prospects than they were a year ago, for
example, and most expect to lay off workers in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also included a few work-style questions. One
asked respondents to name the settings outside the office where
they were most likely to discuss business with their most valuable
customers.
</P>
<P>
   On that topic, more national quirks were seen: Entertaining
clients at home was popular only in Italy. Belgians were the only
respondents who much favored talking shop at a cultural event. Only
1 in 20 European executives mentioned a round of golf or other
sports, and those who did were mainly British. Dutch executives
shared Germans' aversion to power breakfasts but were happy to do
lunch.
</P>

A UNIVERSITY EXAMINES THE CRUCIFIX AS ART AND SYMBOL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``To draw, paint or sculpt the crucifixion is a terrifying
experience,'' Charles McCollough says, ``for the artist must feel
some bit of the horrible pain and humiliation of being hung up to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   A crucifix by McCollough is one of the most powerful among the
contemporary renderings of Jesus' crucifixion on exhibit in the
atrium of the Bunn Intercultural Center at Georgetown University in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence there is the outcome of a widely publicized
skirmish at the Roman Catholic university's campus that has been
difficult to fathom, even by a regular visitor, like this writer,
who teaches on the campus two days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a student noticed that many of Georgetown's
classrooms did not have the crucifixes that were once a familiar
fixture, although in no official way an obligatory one, in Roman
Catholic college and university classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The student expressed her distress in a letter to the
university's president. Not satisfied with his polite but
non-committal response, she wrote a blistering article in a
conservative campus publication, using phrases like ``treacherous
acts of betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   The crucifix question soon was burdened with issues that went
well beyond whatever purely devotional concerns might have been at
its origin. Did their absence symbolize an abandonment of
Catholicism by the university? Did the demand for their replacement
symbolize a threat to the university's diversity and intellectual
openness? Was the whole tug-of-war over a central Christian image
an offense to authentic religiosity?
</P>
<P>
   The administration insisted that there had never been a policy
against crucifixes. They had never been put in some newer buildings
and never replaced after renovations in others. The student request
would be taken under advisement, the administration said, but
nothing precipitous would occur, especially while the university
was engaged in a number of other discussions of how to reflect its
Catholic identity.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative groups, both religious and political, from outside
the campus began to line up behind the crucifix cause. Jewish and
Muslim leaders on campus said that they welcomed a Catholic
university being rich in Catholic symbols.
</P>
<P>
   For the news media, the story was irresistible. Classroom
crucifixes were as concrete an expression of Catholicism as was not
eating meat on Friday had once been. What hung on the walls of
Georgetown's classrooms was certainly more interesting than what
went on within them.
</P>
<P>
   University officials finally acted. The classrooms would get
their crucifixes, and not the traditional mass-produced models, but
esthetically rich versions from different cultures and Christian
traditions. The campus, moreover, would engage in a serious
examination of the crucifix as a symbol with meaning in both
Christianity and world culture.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, timed for this season of Lent and ending on Easter,
is a stimulating starting point for that examination. Twenty-five
contemporary artists, from different religious traditions, have
depicted the crucifixion in wood carvings, stone and metal
sculptures, oil paintings, textiles and other materials.
</P>
<P>
   McCollough's body of Jesus, about five feet in height, is a
striking departure from more conventionally naturalistic or
symbolic figures he has executed. In a note accompanying the work,
the sculptor, who also is an ordained United Church of Christ
minister, describes finding a piece of dogwood, a species whose
cross-shaped flowers with blood-red tips have linked it
symbolically with the crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   This particular piece had roots that, turned upright, have
become carved arms, their knotted elbows wrenched painfully out of
shape and their gnarled and broken fingers curled around the
wrought iron nails pinning them to a rough oak cross. The narrow,
roughly carved body is naked in humiliation. The head is bent
forward but staring more than drooping; the mouth is a gaping hole
of agony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to overemphasize the true brutality of this death
by torture,'' McCullough says. ``It is important, I believe, to
represent the crucifixion as state murder, not an abstract notion
of death in general.''
</P>
<P>
   The examination will go beyond the exhibit. On March 29, the
Monday of Holy Week and two days before Passover, an afternoon
liturgy will be followed by an evening of lectures and discussion
by Chaim Potok and the Rev. James Flanigan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Potok, far better known as the author of novels about
Hasidic Jewry than as a rabbi, published ``My Name Is Asher Lev.''
Asher Lev is an artistic prodigy driven to use the crucifixion as a
symbol of torment but thereby sealing his separation from his
Hasidic upbringing and his observant Jewish family.
</P>
<P>
   Flanigan is a professor of art at the University of Notre Dame
and a member of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, the religious
order that founded the university. A sculptor with several
crucifixes in the Georgetown exhibit, he has been curator of the
collection of works at Notre Dame's Snite Museum of Art by Ivan
Mestrovic, the eminent Croatian sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers will engage one another and the audience with their
perspectives on the crucifix as art, religious object and cultural
force.
</P>
<P>
   Do the crucifixes hanging in the classrooms of many Catholic
colleges and universities have any impact on the students or the
campus ethos? Will the handsome crucifixes recently installed at
Georgetown be practically invisible by May, paid less notice than
the safety signs on maximum room occupancy and certainly less heed
than those reading no smoking?
</P>
<P>
   That is a natural polling project for campus journalists.

 BOB CATO, DESIGNER OF '60s ALBUM COVERS, DIES AT 75    By NICK RAVO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bob Cato, a ground-breaking graphic designer who
helped turn the record album cover into an important form of
contemporary art, died Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He
was 75 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said his
wife, Kate Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   During 10 years as an art director and the vice president of
creative services for CBS-Columbia Records, Cato created or
supervised some of the most memorable record-album covers of the
1960s. It was his idea to put the work of the underground
illustrator R. Crumb on Janis Joplin's ``Cheap Thrills.''
</P>
<P>
   Some covers featured his own photography, for instance on Miles
Davis' ``Miles'' album. Cato employed some of the era's most
influential painters, designers and photographers for other covers,
among them Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg. He also worked with
musicians ranging from Thelonious Monk to the Band to Johnny Mathis
to Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   For his cover designs, Cato was awarded two Grammys by the
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. They were for
Barbra Streisand's ``People'' (1964) and for ``Bob Dylan's Greatest
Hits'' (1967). In 1997 the recording academy awarded Cato its
President's Merit Award.
</P>
<P>
   Cato was involved in the conception and sometimes even the
naming of recordings. When Ms. Joplin came to see him about the
packaging of a record she had completed with Big Brother and the
Holding Company she rapidly agreed that Crumb, the underground
comic artist, could provide a look raw enough to match the music.
</P>
<P>
   But the singer also wanted an equally inelegant title, which she
insisted should be ``Sex, Dope and Cheap Thrills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The title didn't seem quite right to me,'' Cato wrote years
later in an unpublished memoir.
</P>
<P>
   Cato suggested to Ms. Joplin that the words ``sex'' and ``dope''
on the cover would limit the record's radio airplay, and
recommended using only the last two words for the title.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joplin agreed, saying, ``Well, I've always settled for cheap
thrills, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Cato was born in New Orleans in 1923, the son of Ysabel Soto, a
teacher who immigrated to the United States from Cuba, and Robert
Bailey Cato, an executive. At the age of 15, on a family trip to
Mexico City, he met and began studying art with the painters Pablo
O'Higgins and Jose Clemente Orozco.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons from an
earlier marriage, Eric, of Brooklyn and Marc, of Southampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, during which Cato, a Quaker, was imprisoned
as a conscientious objector, he moved to Chicago, where he studied
briefly under the Bauhaus designer Laszlo Moholy-Nagy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 he went to Philadelphia to study with the art director
and designer Alexey Brodovitch. After Brodovitch was hurt in a car
accident Cato became his driver and cook, and subsequently became
his assistant at Harper's Bazaar, where Brodovitch was transforming
magazine and fashion design with an innovative mixture of open
space, sharp typography, photography and Modernist art,
characteristics that would define Cato's own work over the next
several decades.
</P>
<P>
   Through the late 1940s and the 50s Cato was an art director at
Junior Bazaar, Theater Arts, Dance and Glamour magazines while
continuing to paint and exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 he began his association with the recording industry, at
CBS/Columbia Records. He remained there for a decade. After short
stints at McCall's magazine and at Revlon, he returned to the music
business, as vice president for creative services at United Artists
Records and Films in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   During his 50-year career, Cato taught at the School of Visual
Arts and the Rochester Institute of Technology. He also served as
an art director for consumer-products companies.
</P>
<P>
   Cato devoted much of his last 10 years of work to fine art,
photography and producing books, including ``Joyce Images'' (1994),
a collection of photos and art devoted to James Joyce.

2 BODIES FOUND IN TRUNK OF BURNED CAR; 3RD TOURIST STILL MISSING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MI-WUK VILLAGE, Calif. _ There was still hope Thursday when the
rental car of three missing tourists was found after a month of
searching. But Friday, just hours after relatives appeared on news
shows to say they remained optimistic that the women would turn up,
authorities announced here that two bodies, burned beyond
recognition, were found in the car's trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund, 42, her daughter Julie, 15, of Eureka, and Silvina
Pelosso, 16, a family friend from Argentina, had been missing since
Feb. 15, according to authorities, who said they were last seen at
the motel where they had stayed in El Portal during their
Presidents' Day Weekend trip to Yosemite National Park. A passerby
stumbled upon their rental car Thursday, nearly three hours away
from the motel.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are searching for a third victim around the vicinity
where the car had been dumped, about 300 yards off of Highway 108,
in ski country northeast of Sonora. James Maddock, the FBI agent in
charge of the investigation, said that the car had been left by
someone familiar with the area. The car had been hidden, off a road
accessible only by narrow, muddy logging roads obscured by thick
woods. Everything in the car, Maddock said, was consumed by fire.
The car was identified by its rear license plate.
</P>
<P>
   Maddock said that the FBI would be investigating the case as a
double homicide, while authorities searched for the third victim.
</P>
<P>
   For four weeks, nothing was known after the women disappeared
except that Mrs. Sund's wallet had been found on Feb. 19 off a
highway in Modesto, two hours from the motel where the three were
last seen.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, the families of the missing set up a
headquarters at a Holiday Inn in Modesto and news crews camped out,
waiting with them for the mystery to be solved. For more than a
month, Mrs. Sund's husband, Jens, and parents as well as Silvina's
parents, who flew here from Argentina once they found out their
daughter was missing, submitted to numerous interviews to keep the
case in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sund's family, wealthy real estate developers, offered a
$250,000 reward for the trio's safe return _ adding $50,000 a few
days ago for information leading to the rental car. Friends
organized a rally in Modesto last Sunday attended by 1,400 people,
many of them relatives of missing or murdered children. Hundreds of
volunteers papered the state with flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Jens Sund stayed away from the scene, at his
family home in Eureka with his three younger children. Mrs. Sund's
parents, Francis and Carole Carrington, made brief, tearful remarks
in Modesto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you a week or two weeks ago that I would cry when the
time came, and the time is now,'' Mrs. Carrington said, sobbing.
``But we still need your help because we need to find the animals
that did this. Because there are terrible people out there. And we
don't want them to do this to anyone else's daughter and
granddaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrington broke down, before composing himself to say: ``What I
was trying to say is we're supposed to die before our children and
our grandchildren. This is the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund had planned the trip to Yosemite National Park for
her and her 15-year-old daughter Julie, 15, to spend with the
visiting exchange student who would soon be returning to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Feb. 16, they planned to join Mrs. Sund's husband
and the couple's three younger children in San Francisco. Sund
would take Silvina and the younger children to the Grand Canyon,
while Mrs. Sund and Julie would fly home to Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   But the women never made it to Modesto, where they were supposed
to turn in their rental car and fly to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning days, the FBI said that the women had last been
spotted on Feb. 16, by people who remember them asking for
directions to a part of the park. Later, the FBI said that those
sightings were unconfirmed and that the last confirmed sighting was
the night of Feb. 15, when the women had dinner at the restaurant
attached to the Cedar Lodge in El Portal.
</P>
<P>
   The car was found Thursday almost three hours away, on a
winding, narrow road at a spot locals know as a dumping ground for
refrigerators, washing machines and stripped and stolen cars.
Maddock said that the FBI and local officials with the Tuolumne
County Sheriff's Department had begun to question nearby neighbors
and business owners.
</P>
<P>
   But in this tourist-driven countryside, residents say they have
been talking for weeks. In the nearby town of Twain Harte,
shopkeepers said they had called the FBI to report seeing the women
Feb. 16, the day after their last confirmed sighting. But, they
said, they could not get through on the FBI hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Mann, owner of the Cedar Cottage gift shop in Twain Harte,
told reporters Friday that she believes Mrs. Sund and the two girls
visited her shop the afternoon of Feb. 16. ``It was them,'' she
said, adding, that she remembers it was Tuesday because the shop is
usually closed on Tuesdays, but that she opened it because
Presidents' Day weekend had been so busy. She said she got through
to authorities last week.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Louise Guthmiller, the owner of a gas station about a mile
from where the rental car was found, told The Stockton Record that
she believes she sold the women a small amount of gas, but didn't
remember the day or date. Maddock of the FBI refused to comment on
these reported sightings. ``We've got some very good tips in the
last 24 hours,'' he said, ``tips that have identified people that
we're taking a hard look at.''
</P>
<P>
   He refused to elaborate or to answer questions about two men,
one of whom worked at the restaurant attached to the motel, who are
being held on unrelated charges in the Mariposa County Jail near El
Portal.

WITNESS'   STORY SHIFTS WITH LANGUAGE, CRASH INVESTIGATORS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ As they wound down their investigation at the scene of
Monday's deadly crash of an Amtrak train and a truck loaded with
steel, federal investigators said Friday that a language barrier
might have caused them to misunderstand the description of the
accident by their first witness.
</P>
<P>
   They now understand the witness to have said that he did not see
the truck drive around a crossing gate before it was struck by the
train.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, federal investigators told reporters that the
witness had said he had seen the truck zigzag around the gates, but
Friday the investigators said the witness was saying that he did
not see the truck go around the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the Spanish-speaking witness might not have
changed his story, but might just have been misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people were killed, and 116 injured, in the accident at a
crossing near Bourbonnais, Ill., about 50 miles south of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   No federal official would explain publicly what caused the
confusion. The National Transportation Safety Board issued only a
brief written statement, saying that ``any characterization of
witness statements up to this point would be one person's
interpretation and not the position of the safety board.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators say they have ``a number of people'' who
have said they saw the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, safety board
investigators said the first witness, a Spanish-speaking restaurant
worker from Chicago, called Amtrak on Wednesday night, saying he
had been two cars behind the truck. In an initial interview, with
questions and answers in English, the investigators understood the
man to say that he saw the truck drive around a crossing gate.
</P>
<P>
   In a later, formal interview on Thursday evening, with questions
and answers translated by a state police officer, investigators
understood the man to say that he did not see the truck drive
around the gates. ``He said it the first time, and not the second
time,'' one investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   The man said he did not know whether the truck went through
flashing lights, which are designed to begin seconds before the
gates come down, and about 25 to 30 seconds before the train
arrives.
</P>
<P>
   The witness said he was in the area because he got lost looking
for an automobile dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, John R. Stokes, 58, of Manteno, Ill., has said
he did not drive around the gates and did not see the warning
lights until just before impact. His driving record since 1968,
released Friday by the state, shows nine accidents, six license
suspensions, two tickets for driving with a suspended license, and
two tickets for driving without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   He was driving on Monday with a probationary permit. The state's
attorney has begun a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer of the train has not been interviewed because he
remains sedated.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever those potential witnesses have to say, investigators
said that they rely much more heavily on physical evidence. So far,
the physical evidence suggests that the truck driver zigzagged
around the gates, perhaps because he could not see a train coming.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence cited by investigators: The tips of the crossing
gates are damaged. Damage on the locomotive suggests that the truck
and train were not at right angles. Tire trucks in the mud suggest
that someone drove around the gates, but have yet to be matched to
the truck involved in the accident.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Friday that when the final
word was written on his legacy, he would have one strike against
him _ for lying _ but ``hundreds and hundreds and hundreds'' of
pluses for the times that he was truthful.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he did not have ``a clue'' whether his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, would run for the Senate from New York. But
he said publicly for the first time that she had long ago suggested
they move to New York when he left office, although he implied they
would be spending a lot of time apart because he would be in
Arkansas at his presidential library. He said they were ``working''
on their marriage, which has appeared stressed over the last year
in the wake of revelations about his extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   At his first full-dress news conference in nearly a year, held
in the formal East Room of the White House, Clinton ranged over an
array of foreign and domestic issues for an hour. He sprang to the
defense of Vice President Al Gore for Gore's overdrawn references
in his personal biography, and he deflected a question about
whether he felt betrayed by former aides who have criticized his
fitness for the presidency. His tone was generally conversational,
but he became visibly testy when he was asked whether his ``legacy
will be about lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who admitted last year that he had lied when he denied
having an affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, said
that telling the truth was important. ``And even presidents have to
do that, and there are consequences when you don't,'' he said in an
understated reference to his impeachment on charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice, on which he was acquitted five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But then he tensed and his voice rose with anger as he asserted
that on balance, he had a strong record and that reporters needed
to be careful about telling the truth too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a box score, and there will be that one
negative,'' he said, referring to his lying under oath. ``And then
there will be the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times when
the record will show that I did not abuse my authority as
president, that I was truthful with the American people, and scores
and scores of allegations were made against me and widely
publicized without any regard to whether they were true or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those allegations, he said: ``Most of them have already been
actually proved false. And it's very hard to disprove every false
allegation against you. But we have had more success frankly than I
was afraid we would when we started. So I would hope that there
would be a higher regard for truth-telling by all people in public
life and all those who report on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined Friday to discuss one of those allegations _ by an
Arkansas woman, Juanita Broaddrick, that he sexually assaulted her
in 1978 while he was state attorney general. His lawyer has denied
it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he wanted to devote all of his time to the
nation's business and would therefore refer all such questions to
his lawyers. Pressed as to whether he could not simply deny the
allegation, Clinton ignored the question and quickly moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been available only briefly to reporters since the
impeachment ordeal began more than a year ago. Friday's news
conference was one in a series of steps the White House has taken
to thaw the icy relations with reporters that have marked his
tenure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He has held two off-the-record dinners with reporters, and his
spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the president would now conduct news
conferences on a more regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   His aim Friday was to present himself as back to business, and
he generally avoided being drawn into the past. ``I think it's best
for me not to focus on that now,'' he said when asked for his
reflections on being impeached.
</P>
<P>
   He was more comfortable with the topic of his wife's political
ambitions, though he said he was clueless on what she would decide.
``The people she is talking to must know more than I do, because I
literally don't have a clue,'' he said. ``If you asked me today
whether I thought it was more likely or not that she would run or
not run, I could not give you an answer. I just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that long before either of them knew that Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the state's senior Senator, would vacate his seat, she
thought they should move to New York. Friday he seemed to be trying
to pre-empt criticism that Mrs. Clinton was a carpetbagger and had
no ties to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who has given few hints about his
post-presidential plans, said of his wife: ``She thought we should
move to New York when I left the White House, knowing that I would
spend a lot of time at home in my library and with the work there,
but that we would also establish a home in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   He also offered an explanation for why she would be a good
representative for New York, saying: ``She cares so much about the
issues, especially those that have a particular impact on New York,
including the education and economic issues that would be very
important to the people there.''
</P>
<P>
   He defended Gore's recent claim to have created the Internet and
his suggestions that he spent a rustic boyhood as a farm hand in
Tennessee. He actually grew up in Washington, the son of a senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly what he said or exactly how it has been
characterized, but he has been for 20 years one of the major
architects of America's progress in technology,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as his boyhood home, I think _ I know what you're
saying,'' Clinton said. ``You're saying, well, he went to St.
Alban's and his daddy was a senator. But it's also true that he is
from East Tennessee and he did learn to do all those things he did
on the farm.'' He said Gore was by nature shy but that he needed to
share his life experiences with voters, and it was hard to do this
without seeming to brag too much.
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside a question about whether he felt betrayed by
books highly critical of him by former advisers George
Stephanopoulos and Dick Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absorbed no pain,'' he said, ``since I haven't read
either one of the books.''

 &HT;    Bush's online polls make unlikely links
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's presidential exploratory
committee on Friday unplugged a Web site link that led from its
home page to one that included photos of aborted fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee felt it best not to link our site with that
particular site,'' said committee spokeswoman Mindy Tucker, adding
that Bush officials had been unaware of the ``other items''
contained on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Until its removal, the link was part of a Bush effort to pile up
votes in online presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
   One of those polls shut down temporarily this week after
accusing Bush backers of stuffing the cyber ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is a quarter-step short of being an official
presidential candidate, is using his exploratory committee's Web
site (www.georgewbush.com) to lead people to online polls run by an
assortment of folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cast your vote for Bush and encourage your friends to do the
same!'' the Bush site says in urging supporters to participate in
polls at six other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the Bush camp views the online polls as ``another
way to voice support for Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Bush group was notified Friday by the Austin
American-Statesman, one of the online polls linked to Bush's site
was one run by Linda Clements of Palmetto, Fla., who also used it
to share photos of her family, its pet pigs and a healthy dose of
her political philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Bible-thumpin', pew-jumpin', Jesus-lovin',
devil-shovin', blood-bought, red-hot, soul-redeemin', shoutin',
screemin', overcomin' child of God,'' Clements says on the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   The photos of aborted fetuses on her site are accessed through a
connection that says: ``Blob of tissue? See real abortions for
yourself and you decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Clements could not be reached for comment Friday after the Bush
committee Web site removed its link to her site. Bush backers were
accused of not playing by the one-visit, one-vote rules set by the
operators of another online poll entitled Elections USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of cheating that has been going on is simply
unbelievable,'' said a note posted on the site last week when the
poll was suspended. ``Three hundred votes for G. Bush and 200 for
A. Gore within the last eight hours? Who are we kidding? What's
next, 5,000 votes in one hour?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, voting resumed with this warning:
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends, I've resumed the poll hoping (against hope) that this
time there will be less cheating by those few passionate voters who
made me suspend Vote 2000 a week ago.

 &HT;    SXSW provides annual adrenaline to Austin clubs
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When South by Southwest debuted in 1987, the
most common response from skeptical club owners was ``What can the
festival do for me?'' Thirteen years later, many of the
participating clubs now find themselves asking, ``What would we do
without South by Southwest?''
</P>
<P>
   Like kids anticipating Christmas, clubs count on getting
everything they want during these five days in March, enough to
offset the struggles of winter business and the slow months
anticipated through the summer. The enabling relationship between
SXSW and struggling clubs is another sign of how much Austin has
changed through the '90s, as a techno-booming economy has put a
premium on space available for development and turned the local
economy topsy-turvy. For clubs in critical condition, SXSW isn't a
bonus; it's life support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire club business counts on South by Southwest to get
us through the year,'' said Mike Henry, co-owner of the Electric
Lounge. ``You struggle tooth and claw to break even the rest of the
year, but you can bank on South by Southwest. It's a huge gift, and
you always know exactly when it's coming. We would have closed
years ago if it weren't for South by Southwest, and I know we're
not alone in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Its survival threatened by rising property values on the
development-hungry west side of downtown, the Lounge might not last
through next year's conference. Though business has improved at the
intimate, eclectic showcase room during every year since the club
opened in 1993, costs have skyrocketed along with property values.
Rents have more than tripled, but club attendance hasn't, and cover
charges can't. Competition for top touring acts and a dearth of
local headlining talent that regularly fills a room also have
escalated the price of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, space was not at a premium, and you could
find a good raw space that you could make your own,'' said Henry.
``And now, everything is gobbled up for development. The only
people who are winning the club battle are the people who came into
it with money. Our biggest obstacle is that we have always been
extremely undercapitalized, and that used to be the norm with
Austin clubs. We were all pretty much in the same boat. And now
that's definitely not the case; Stubb's and Direct Events (which
runs La Zona Rosa, the Backyard and the Austin Music Hall) have
changed the face of things around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the club business is typically a high-stakes gamble,
SXSW is practically risk-free. The festival books the talent, pays
the costs and reaps the benefits from sales of conference badges
and wristbands. Each year, the fest attempts to match attractive
showcase lineups with the venues made available by club owners
interested in participating. Instead of paying high prices for
talent with no guarantee of a return at the door, the clubs see
their bonanza from bars that are busier than at any other time of
the year, swarmed with industry revelers downing Celis and Shiner
as if the local beers were an exotic elixir for an insatiable
thirst. For the Electric Lounge, as for so many participating
venues, March bar revenues were almost as great last year as
February and April combined (February, $42,051; March, $73,339;
April, $36,550).
</P>
<P>
   With the Lounge operating two stages throughout the conference _
its tented Electric Pavilion was introduced in desperation after
the club's fire in '93 and proved so popular it has remained a SXSW
perennial _ South by Southwest is usually sufficient to offset a
significant amount of debt. Yet rumors continue to circulate that
this year's windfall will be too little, too late, and that after
SXSW, the Electric Lounge will pull the plug.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our baby, and we're doing everything we can, but we
can't continue to operate as a nonprofit business,'' said Mark
Shuman, one of the club's founding co-owners, who sees smaller
entertainment businesses victimized by the city's commitment to
``smart growth.'' ``The way that the city is trying to develop
downtown, there is a layer of businesses that is being ignored. The
city of Austin touts itself as the `Live Music Capital of the
World,' but they give tax breaks and incentives to large
corporations without giving anything to the music businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The venerable Liberty Lunch finds itself in a similar crunch,
with development on the verge of devouring city property in what
was considered a marginal space for commercial development. Though
the club has benefited from an affordable city lease and is
receiving city assistance in negotiations for a suitable space,
owner J'Net Ward mourns the fact that this will be its last SXSW at
its current location.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad,'' said Ward. ``This whole year, everything has
been `this is the last time.' I get very teary-eyed, maybe
depressed, but then I think maybe the new club will be better. And
if I get the deal I'm working on now, the new building will be
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town on Red River Street _ where Liberty Lunch hopes to
move _ Stubb's booms on the east edge of the downtown entertainment
district. As the centerpiece of a strip previously notorious for
drug traffic and street crime, the club has developed into a top
SXSW attraction since it opened for the festival three years ago.
At the time, the venue was little more than an open lot, with a
restaurant and indoor staging that wasn't ready for business until
almost a month later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it was just a big gravel pit back there, and it was
like we were building a big movie set for the conference,'' said
co-owner Charles Attal with a laugh. ``We were still hammering in
stairs that day, and then we opened the doors, and people rushed in
for the Fugees. It was kind of overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, Stubb's has been better prepared. In
addition to nightly showcases, the restaurant's calendar is filled
with industry parties, as many as three each afternoon. Such
parties can be more lucrative than the evening shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties are where the big money is,'' Attal said. ``We're
downtown in the middle of everything, and people from out of town
love to eat barbecue. This is always a great place for all the
(talent and booking) agents to meet and a good chance for me to
hang out with them a little bit. I've been able to make agent
contacts just because of South by Southwest, and this business is
all about getting to know them and working with them. I don't care
if you have a piece of grass with no stage; if you're in with the
agent, you're going to get the show.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the calendar turns to March 2000, Stubb's likely
still will be flourishing, competing with Direct Events for top
touring attractions. If the Red River negotiations continue to
progress, Liberty Lunch will find new life in partnership with
Stubb's, with the Texas Music Museum and even the Austin Rehearsal
Complex mentioned as part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   And the Electric Lounge?
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not in good conscience say what is going to happen,''
said Henry, ``except that when we close, they'll have to drag us
kicking and screaming out of here.'' &QC;

 &HT;    Texas tobacco lawyer ordered to justify $260 million award
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The federal judge supervising Texas' $17.3
billion tobacco lawsuit settlement has ordered Houston attorney
Marc Murr to prove the validity of Murr's $260 million arbitration
award because it apparently violated the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   Murr's claim for fees in the tobacco case was sharply criticized
by other attorneys involved on both sides and by lawmakers who
helped negotiate disputes over the settlement proceeds and attorney
fees. He has been called the ``stealth lawyer'' because few of the
principals in the case ever saw Murr work the case. Former Attorney
General Dan Morales has said Murr provided valuable
behind-the-scene advise to Morales during the case.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge David Folsom of Texarkana ordered Murr to
prove his case in a hearing May 6. That hearing will follow another
hearing on Attorney General John Cornyn's request to dismiss Murr's
claim. ``The judge on his own raised an issue we did not raise, as
he's entitled to do,'' Cornyn said, ``which we welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Murr nor his Austin attorney, Roy Minton, could be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Bill Ratliff (R-Mount Pleasant), who as Senate
Finance Committee chairman helped negotiate competing claims to the
tobacco settlement last year, said Folsom's order ``bodes well'' if
it means Murr will be tossed out of the federal court case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to have to convince a state court and in
that case, I would agree with the attorney general that the
Legislature ought to decide it,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   In his order, Folsom pointed to a claim by Minton that Murr's
arbitration had been conducted according to Folsom's order. But the
judge said the three-person panel evaluating Murr's claim did not
bnclude an arbitrator Folsom was supposed to select.
</P>
<P>
   The three arbitrators were chosen by Murr and Morales, who had
hired Murr, a friend, as a behind-the-scenes advisor in the tobacco
suit. When the arbitration award became public in December, Morales
explained that the manner in which arbitrators are chosen could be
changed under the agreement, as long as Murr and Morales approved.
</P>
<P>
   Murr has been a controversial figure in the tobacco case since
his role as Morales' advisor was first publicly disclosed near the
end of negotiations that culminated in the settlement in January
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Morales hired Murr in October 1996, seven months after filing
the lawsuit, for a 3 percent cut of the state's recovery. In
January 1997, a second contract set the fee as ``reasonable'' but
not specifying a percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Folsom's referred to his order of Jan. 22, 1998, that outlined
how arbitrators for Murr's claims would be picked when he wrote:
``This Court has never selected any panel member for such an
arbitration.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Murr panel awarded him 1.5 percent of the state's
$17.3 billion recovery, or $260 million over 25 years, in October.
The first public notice of the award came in December when Murr
used it to argue for a share of legal fees the tobacco companies
were paying in a national arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The national arbitrators awarded him $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Only Murr and Morales presented evidence to support his claim to
the arbitrators they chose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been concerned about the lack of an adversarial hearing
before the `state' arbitration panel,'' Cornyn said. ``They went in
arm-in-arm and were singing off the same sheet of music.''

CLINTON SAYS `THRESHOLD HAS BEEN CROSSED' IN SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change ``Milosevic of Serbia'' to ``Milosevic of
Yugoslavia'' in 8th graf. No other changes.) (Eds: See also KOSOVO-U.S., KOSOVO-TALKS, KOSOVO-REFUGEES) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Preparing the American public for military action
in the Balkans, President Clinton said Friday that the ``threshold
has been crossed'' for the use of force against Serbia to prevent
further bloodshed in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' Clinton said at an afternoon news
conference at the White House, ``if we and our allies do not have
the will to act, there will be more massacres. In dealing with
aggressors in the Balkans, hesitation is a license to kill. But
action and resolve can stop armies and save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke as ominous signs spread across Europe that NATO
military strikes against Serbian targets could begin within days.
Peace talks between Serbian officials and Kosovar Albanian
nationalists broke down in Paris as the Serb side refused to sign a
peace accord accepted on Thursday by the ethnic Albanian majority
in Kosovo. Western governments began evacuating monitors and
nonessential personnel from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Friday that it was dispatching additional
combat aircraft to the region in anticipation of a series of air
strikes designed to reduce Serbia's ability to move against Kosovar
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent the bulk of his day Friday making a case for U.S.
participation in NATO-led military strikes in the Balkans, meeting
with a large contingent of members of Congress in the morning and
speaking extensively on the subject with reporters Friday
afternoon. He also met with his senior foreign policy advisers to
review plans for the possible air strikes, including the timing of
action, sequence of strikes and targets involved in the planned
Balkan campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders emerged from the White House meeting still
skeptical about the reasons for U.S. involvement in the
hostilities. Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, said
the Senate would debate administration policy in Kosovo early next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the president now recognizes the need to say
to the American people exactly what's at stake here, why would an
action be taken, what would those actions be and what are the
risks,'' Lott said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said that he told the president that
the United States should not initiate a bombing campaign against
Serbia unless President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia engages in
a systematic assault on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton argued at the news conference that Milosevic had
already perpetrated numerous massacres and other atrocities, in
Kosovo and earlier in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the threshold has been crossed,'' Clinton said,
citing the mass killing of more than 40 Kosovar Albanian civilians
in the village of Racak in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the troops that have been massed, and what we know
about their plans, and what they have publicly said about them, I
would hate to think that we'd have to see a lot of other little
children die before we could do what seems to be, to me, clearly
the right thing to do to prevent it,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He added later, ``I do not believe that we ought to have to have
thousands more people slaughtered and buried in open soccer fields
before we do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the rationale for the use of force goes beyond
humanitarian concerns.
</P>
<P>
   He said that a raging conflict in Kosovo could send tens of
thousands of refugees streaming across borders and potentially draw
Albania, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey into the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a conflict with no natural boundaries. It threatens
our national interests,'' Clinton said. ``If we don't act, the war
will spread. If it spreads, we will not be able to contain it
without far greater risk and cost. I believe the real challenge of
our foreign policy today is to deal with problems before they do
permanent harm to our vital interests. That is what we must do in
Kosovo.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton faced pointed questioning on Kosovo Friday, both in his
meeting with congressional leaders and in the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked why Milosevic should take American threats
seriously now, after Clinton and other Western leaders had backed
down from earlier threats and allowed numerous negotiating
deadlines to pass. He was asked why NATO delayed action even though
Milosevic has carried out a continuing campaign of repression
against Albanians, Bosnian Muslims and other minorities in former
Yugoslav provinces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should take this seriously because we were serious
in Bosnia,'' Clinton said. ``My intention would be to do whatever
is possible, first of all, to weaken his ability to massacre them,
to have another Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the peace talks between the Serbians and the ethnic
Albanians were extended at the request of the parties, not because
of American irresolution. And he noted that Russia has consistently
opposed NATO military action against Moscow's allies in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and European leaders have enlisted Russian support for
peace efforts in Kosovo, but Moscow has steadfastly refused to
endorse any threat of force against Belgrade. The issue is certain
to arise when Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian prime minister, visits
Washington beginning next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The House last week narrowly voted to approve Clinton's plan to
send American troops to Kosovo to enforce a peace accord if all
parties reach an agreement. The United States would supply about
4,000 soldiers to a 28,000-person NATO peacekeeping force if a deal
is reached.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans have complained that the administration is
wading into a quagmire with no clear means of exit and without
sufficient public support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are going to be killed,'' Sen. Robert Bennett,
R-Utah, said in a speech on the Senate floor Friday. ``They are
going to come home in body bags, and they will be killed in a war
that Congress has not declared.''

   LOS ANGELES _ The University of California's board of regents
decided Friday to guarantee a place in the prestigious public
university system for the top 4 percent of the state's high school
students.
</P>
<P>
   The rule, which will take effect in the fall of 2001, was one of
the most frequent promises that Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, made
in his campaign last year. It was seen by some people as an effort
to get around the affirmative action prohibitions that voters
approved in 1996 and to reverse the decline in the number of black
and Hispanic students being admitted to the system.
</P>
<P>
   But the rule is expected to result in only a tiny increase in
black and Hispanic students, officials at the University of
California said Friday. The rule will add about 3,600 students of
all ethnic backgrounds to the pool of eligible applicants, but less
than half of them are expected to enroll. About 43,000 freshmen
enrolled in the system last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a decent but not significant number of minorities''
in the expanded pool, said William Bagley, a regent and lawyer from
San Francisco who voted for the new rules. ``But it will be helpful
for those of us who think diversity is important.''
</P>
<P>
   The percent of black students who meet the university's
eligibility requirements will increase by just eight-tenths of 1
percent, to 3.6 percent from 2.8 percent. That would be an increase
of 161 students, half of whom would be expected to enroll. The
eligibility rate for Hispanic students will go to 4.7 percent from
3.8 percent, an increase of 716 students. The eligibility for Asian
students will go to 31.5 percent from 30 percent, and for white
students it will go to 14.4 percent from 12.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will probably help disadvantaged white children more than
any other group,'' said another regent, Howard Leach. ``It is
totally unrelated to affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagley, the regent from San Francisco, said there were more than
800 high schools in California and that some of them ``supply
literally zero students to our campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The board approved the new rules Friday after a subcommittee
recommended the change in a 13-1 vote on Thursday. The sole
dissenter was Meredith Khachigian, a regent from San Clemente.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to hold the schools accountable for providing the
courses and teaching to make students eligible for the
university,'' Ms. Khachigian said Friday. ``I felt this gave them a
pass. I'm concerned about students coming to the university and
competing with students who have a higher level of preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward Connerly, the regent who led the fight against affirmative
action, voted for the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought this 4-percent plan was a Trojan horse to
resurrect racial preferences,'' he said. ``But the more I looked at
it, the more I thought it was based on merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jaffe, a political scientist at the Claremont
Graduate University, said the new admission rule was ``by and large
a symbolic gesture'' without the remedial and financial aid
programs to make sure students from poor, inner-city high schools
and their rural cousins can compete with their more advantaged
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jaffe said a student in the top 4 percent from a big urban
school, where the books and buildings are old and the history
teacher has to teach biology, is not the same as a student ranked
in the top 4 percent at a suburban school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any bridge programs to help the 4 percent who
qualify from poor, impoverished families and school districts,''
she said. ``The bridges have all been burned. If you really want to
bring these students up to speed, it will take will and money _
quite a bit of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Genethia Hayes, the executive director of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference in Los Angeles, said much more money must be
spent to improve education in the lower grades. Otherwise, she
added, ``we are preparing these kids to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What this plan allows people to do,'' Ms. Hayes said, ``is to
get off the hook of really having to do something about inequitable
sharing of educational resources, both human and capital.''
</P>
<P>
   She called the policy ``a silver bullet kind of thing.'' Still,
she said, it is a positive step.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jaffe agreed, adding that as modest as the 4-percent policy
is, it would never have passed under former Gov. Pete Wilson, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new rule does send a message, and it's a positive
message,'' Ms. Jaffe said. ``It's a message of opportunity and that
there is a concern that the university be somewhat representative
of the diversity of the state. But I worry that it will raise false
hopes.''

 &HT;    Office Depot head gets 14% pay raise, plus bonus
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ Office Depot Inc. boosted Chief Executive
David Fuente's base pay by nearly 14 percent to $1 million last
year as the company's performance continued to surpass
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Fuente received a bonus of just more than $2
million in 1998 _ up from almost $1.8 million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Fuente also received options to buy 1 million shares of Office
Depot (NYSE: ODP) stock at $29.59 a share, according to the
company's proxy, filed Friday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Fuente's other compensation, which included medical and life
insurance and an automobile allowance, amounted to $215,180. Based
on Friday's closing price of $36 a share, Fuente's total
compensation package was worth $9.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   His 1997 compensation package, worth more than $11 million when
it was disclosed, included stock options set at prices in the $13
to $16 range.
</P>
<P>
   The office products retailer, which has more than 700 stores,
showered executives with options that year in an effort to retain
them after the collapse of its agreement to be bought by rival
Staples Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Office Depot's performance has exceeded projections.
The giant retailer last month reported earnings of $1.24 a share
for 1998 _ a penny above the market consensus.

 &HT;    Greenspan gives thumbs up to safer derivatives
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ It was equivalent to the
win-one-for-the-Gipper speech, only for futures traders.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan gave a pep talk Friday to about 500 traders
attending the International Futures Industry Conference at the Boca
Resort &AMP; Club. An overflow crowd forced hotel staff to hastily add
seats behind breakfast serving tables for everyone to hear the
chairman of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   And they weren't disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan endorsed the way futures dealers have reduced the risk
of financial derivatives in response to the Orange County, Calif.,
debacle five years ago. Derivatives derive their value from other
financial instruments. That is, an investor bets on the future
value of another security and if he is right, he makes a profit.
</P>
<P>
   When Orange County filed for bankruptcy protection in 1994,
largely because of poor investments in derivatives, and Procter &AMP;
Gamble surprised Wall Street with huge losses from derivatives that
same year, these investments were decried as too risky.
</P>
<P>
   But like the savings and loan scandal that blew up in the early
1990s, the derivative disaster of the mid-1990s forced the futures
industry to add more protection for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's speech was something of an industry vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Greenspan's appearance showed he is well aware of the
importance of the futures industry . . . and its ability to manage
risk, '' said Thomas Donovan, president of the Chicago Board of
Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan pointed out that derivatives were a major factor in
the rise in the noninterest earnings of large banks in the past
decade, and that banks are applying the same capital reserve
requirements to them as they do to loans and other credit risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dynamic speech. It was basically aimed at regulators,
and the position of the Fed is that everything is A-OK,'' said
George Gero, a director on the New York Mercantile Exchange board.
``It was a lovely speech.''

SAUDI ARABIA TO LET IRAQIS CROSS BORDER, MAKE PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA
 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ A dispute between Iraq and the United
Nations that threatened to prevent Iraqis from making the annual
pilgrimage to Mecca was resolved Friday when Saudi Arabia said it
would pay the Iraqis' expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Iraqis were allowed to cross into Saudi Arabia as a
result of the decision and were beginning a 1,200-mile journey to
the holy city of Mecca, birthplace of Mohammed, where hundreds of
thousands of Muslims from around the world gather each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis had spent days stranded on the border, bused there by
the Iraqi government to dramatize the standoff. And like another
action earlier this week, the move seemed to have succeeded in
using religion as a political lever.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how pilgrimage costs of Iraqi Muslims should be
paid has bedeviled the United Nations throughout the more than
eight years in which it has enforced economic sanctions against
Iraq because of its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the sanctions committee, composed of the same 15
nations that sit on the U.N. Security Council, agreed that some of
the oil money that Iraq is allowed to spend on imports like food
could also be used to subsidize the pilgrimage. To maintain strict
control over the money, it developed a system that required Iraqi
pilgrims to exchange vouchers for cash once they crossed into Saudi
Arabia. Iraq rejected the plan.
</P>
<P>
   It also rejected a compromise proposed by the Security Council,
in which the Red Cross or another independent agency would
distribute the funds. This resulted in the deadlock broken by Saudi
Arabia Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Iraq, apparently in violation of the U.N.
sanctions against air travel, sent more than 300 elderly pilgrims
to Mecca aboard three aircraft. Saudi Arabia briefly confiscated
two of the planes, but after members of the U.N. sanctions panel
failed to agree on whether the religious journeys were in fact a
violation, the Saudis allowed the pilgrims to stay and the planes
to return to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Under a quota system to avoid the dangers of overcrowding, which
in the past has led to deadly stampedes, each Muslim country has
the right to send 1,000 pilgrims per million of population. That
gives Iraq a total of 23,000, and Iraqi authorities along the
border were reported to have said that 18,000 Iraqis crossed into
Saudi Arabia Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq have been uneasy since
the Persian Gulf War of 1991. But Saudi Arabia has always put its
religious obligations ahead of political differences.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been criticized by Muslims around the world if it
had been perceived as turning pilgrims away. The official Saudi
news agency quoted Prince Nayef, the interior minister, as saying
that King Fahd had decided to pay the pilgrims' costs, which are
expected to amount to about $2,000 per person.

NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE AGREEMENT REDUCES NEWLY SENTENCED IRA
GUERRILLAS
</HEADLINE>

   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Four Irish Republican Army guerrillas
convicted of terrorist crimes were sentenced Friday to a total of
400 years in prison by a judge in Belfast, Northern Ireland. But
under the terms of the Northern Ireland peace agreement approved
last year, they will be freed by July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The four men were silent as they were sentenced by Sir Robert
Carswell, the chief judge of the British province. But they laughed
and waved to friends as they were led out of court.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Bernard McGinn, 41, was sentenced to life for his
involvement in the murder of Stephen Restorick, the last British
soldier to be killed by the IRA before it called a cease-fire in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier's mother, Rita Restorick, said outside the court,
``I feel justice has been done, but at the same time we have a
problem about early release.'' About 300 Catholic IRA and
Protestant paramilitary prisoners have already been released early
under the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The other three men were sentenced for the killing of two other
soldiers and involvement in the deaths of two civilians in a
bombing in London.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland remained tense at nightfall after two nights of
clashes between Catholics and Protestants and the police in
Portadown. The disorder erupted after the killing of a prominent
Catholic lawyer, Rosemary Nelson, by Protestant paramilitaries on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics said the disturbances were provoked by Protestants
pounding on drums on the night of St. Patrick's Day. The
Protestants, of the patriotic Orange Order, said they were merely
celebrating the holiday. The Catholics said the drumming was
deliberate provocation on the eve of Ms. Nelson's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers were attacked on Wednesday and Thursday nights
by young Catholics throwing gasoline bombs. The police responded by
firing plastic bullets. There were no serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night Catholic political leaders, including Martin
McGuinness, the chief negotiator for Sinn Fein, the IRA political
wing, called for an end to the violence.
</P>
<P>
   He and Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, had just returned
from Washington, where meetings with President Clinton and with the
Protestant Unionist leader David Trimble apparently failed to
settle the dispute over the disarmament of the IRA and Protestant
guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders are facing an April 2 deadline for settling the
disarmament problem. The dispute is threatening the final approval
of the return of home rule to the new Northern Ireland Assembly by
the British government.

 &HT;    Atlanta's emerging black celebrity scene
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 21.
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Through the rose-colored glasses sitting low on his
nose, Bunmi Jinadu is looking out for the rich and fabulous. That's
his job.
</P>
<P>
   The bald-headed Nigerian was hired by musical millionaires Sean
``Puffy'' Combs and Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid as VIP coordinator for
Justin's, their newly opened Atlanta restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   When teen heartthrob Usher Raymond drops in from Alpharetta
(Ga.), it's Boomy _ everyone calls him that _ who makes sure
there's a good table in the private dining room. And if the kitchen
is closed when rapper Gip of Goodie Mob and his vocalist-girlfriend
Joi show up, Boomy squares it with the chef so the couple doesn't
drive home to East Point (Ga.) on an empty stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Boomy aims to please every diner on his watch, regardless of
creed, color or Hollywood agent. But the prime objects of his
pampering are metro Atlanta's black glitterati, a growing cast of
African-American celebrities who are putting down roots, hanging
out their shingles and searching for the perfect place to see and
be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is a very who's-who kind of place,'' Jinadu says,
sitting at the restaurant's wood-and-marble bar. ``The people we're
dealing with are important, successful people who want to feel
there's a place for them to feel special.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot spots such as Justin's are cashing in on a little-noticed
facet of metro Atlanta's phenomenal growth. Black VIPs are being
drawn here by, among other things, the city's progressive image and
the handful of high-powered entertainment figures who also have
chosen to put down roots. Celebs have decamped from established
glam capitals such as New York and Los Angeles and joined
home-grown worthies who can afford to live elsewhere but choose to
remain in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Take 1970s musical stars. Metro Atlanta is home to legends
Curtis Mayfield, Jean Carne, Tamiko Jones and Peabo Bryson. The now
Pip-less Gladys Knight no longer lives in her hometown, but she
owns a restaurant downtown.
</P>
<P>
   There's an even longer A-list of fresher faces, including R&AMP;B
artists and hip-hop acts who can correctly use ``jiggy'' in a
sentence (but never would): Monica, Mase, Outkast, EPMD's Erick
Sermon, Chuck D. of Public Enemy, Phife Dog of Tribe Called Quest,
Todd ``Too Short'' Shaw, TLC , Da Brat and 112.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond music, Atlanta's black celebrity elite includes actors
Bill Nunn (``He Got Game''), Raven-Symone (``The Cosby Show''),
Taurean Blacque (``Hill Street Blues''), Tichina Arnold
(``Martin''), Emmanuel Lewis (``Webster''), as well as stand-up
comedians Joe Torry and George Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Poet Maya Angelou is a part-time Gwinnett Countian, while
full-time Atlantan Pearl Cleage insists that she's not a celebrity,
even though her appearance on ``Oprah'' last October propelled her
debut novel to best-sellerdom.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur (Ga.)-born movie star Chris Tucker has a comedy
nightclub in Midtown, and Michael Jackson's brother Marlon has a
gospel music production company near downtown. Crooner Keith Sweat
owns a restaurant/nightclub in Atlanta; basketball great Earvin
``Magic'' Johnson has a multiplex near Greenbriar Mall (metro
Atlanta); and rap impresario Jermaine Dupri's So So Def record
label is based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing champion Evander Holyfield is living extra large at his
$20 million mansion in Fayette County, and he'll become the city's
best-known pugilist-restaurateur next month when he opens a swanky
new eatery in Sandy Springs.
</P>
<P>
   And if any of them need legal advice, they can dial locally to
reach O.J. Simpson lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr., who opened a law
office in downtown Atlanta last month.
</P>
<P>
   Black celebrities' reasons for relocating to Atlanta are often
similar to those cited by lesser-known transplants: lower housing
costs, better weather and a slower pace than other large cities.
Some also cite the area's role in the civil rights movement and as
a place where blacks have long played major political and social
roles.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Raymond says one of the first stops his parents made when
they moved from Chattanooga was to take the family for a visit to
historic Auburn Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Martin Luther King's home and the museum, because
it was worldly knowledge that was right here in Atlanta, and they
wanted me to know about my history.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor Nunn was born in Pittsburgh but moved to Atlanta to attend
Morehouse College in 1970, when, he says, the city was ``like
Mayberry with a couple of skyscrapers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in school I met (former Mayor) Maynard Jackson, and
one of my instructors was (former Fulton County Commission
Chairman) Michael Lomax,'' Nunn says. ``I didn't think about it
consciously at the time, but I'm sure it had an effect on me,
seeing these people who were doing things in politics for the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors make Atlanta special for celebrities. Bryson, who
moved here from Greenville, S.C., in 1971, says Atlanta has an
intangible advantage that show-biz types consider priceless: a
mostly paparazzi-free culture that's not ga-ga for celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta offers you a high level of anonymity,'' he explains.
``If your truck is dirty, you can go out and wash it without
signing a bunch of autographs. It gives you a sense of normalcy. It
keeps you grounded in a way New York or Los Angeles doesn't
allow.''
</P>
<P>
   Recording artist and producer Perri ``Pebbles'' Reid moved to
the Atlanta area with her husband, producer Antonio Reid, in the
1980s. Despite their divorce and a messy squabble with TLC, the
locally-based, platinum-selling recording act she once managed,
Reid says she's staying put.
</P>
<P>
   ``In L.A. there is no way you can get land like you can get
here, even if you are a celebrity,'' Reid says. ``Celebrities are
buying homes on top of celebrities there, because there's so little
land.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid recently sold her Alpharetta house in the exclusive Country
Club of the South subdivision to Raymond. She has since started a
religious ministry and moved farther north, ``where there are
horses in the back yard and it's peaceful. I can concentrate on
things of God and not things of man.''
</P>
<P>
   Among her friends and nearby neighbors is Morris Day, the
flamboyantly foppish one-time protege of the Artist, formerly known
as Prince. Day left Los Angeles and moved to north Fulton two years
ago with his wife and children because he saw qualities missing
from other large cities he visited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking around for a while, and one of the things we
like was the culture of the city and the number of progressive
blacks who are doing things professionally,'' Day says, adding that
he also hangs out with vocalist Tony Rich, who lives in the area.
``You drive through Atlanta and you see upper-middle-class black
children playing basketball in their yards. You don't find that
kind of environment in too many other cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another attraction for black celebrities: Although Atlanta
may not fixate on VIPs, the fact that so many entertainment movers
and shakers live here has elevated the city's image as a place
where show business dreams can come true. And where a VIP can
mingle with other VIPs.
</P>
<P>
   Singers such as Inoj and Trina Broussard have relocated to make
a creative connection with hit-making producers Dupri, Daryl
Simmons, Dallas Austin and Organized Noize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to further my career, and there were a lot of black
entrepreneurs doing business here,'' says Broussard, who lives in
Stone Mountain (Ga.). ``It was like a gold rush. Atlanta has really
blown up.''
</P>
<P>
   Broussard said she rarely goes out socially, but when she does
it's to restaurants and nightspots such as Justin's, the Shark Bar
in Midtown and Sylvia's near Atlanta City Hall downtown_ popular
haunts for black celebrities and those who like to be near them.
</P>
<P>
   Sacha Jenkins, music editor for Vibe magazine in New York, said
Atlanta is generating an industry buzz that has not gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every other month we're down in Atlanta writing
about some artist,'' said Jenkins, whose magazine is preparing an
article on Dupri, the hip-hop impresario. ``There is a strong black
pop presence down there, with serious artists who are making some
serious dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell beams when discussing the area's
glitzy constellation of black stars, and he says he's personally
rolled out the welcome mat for many of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a phenomenon we're proud of, because in essence these
celebrities are voting with their feet, and their dollars,''
Campbell says. ``People are comparing Atlanta today to the Harlem
Renaissance in the 1920s,'' he continues, perhaps hyperbolically.
``They're also calling it the New Motown.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, cautions author Lawrence Otis Graham. Graham, whose
new book, ``Our Kind of People'' (HarperCollins, $25), explores
America's black upper class, says celebrities can be cultural
carpetbaggers with little long-term connection to the cities they
call home. A celebrity boom can go bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit was a perfect example during Motown's heyday,'' Graham
says. ``Berry Gordy and all his artists were the biggest thing in
the city, but the black establishment couldn't count on them. Sure
enough, they moved to Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the movement is to Atlanta. Or from a small
house in one part of the area to a big one in another, trendier
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Music producer Dupri grew up in Fayette County, across the
street from boxer Holyfield's house and not far from rapper Chuck
D. He lives with his mother in that same house in an
upper-middle-class subdivision, and the only hint that there's
anything different about their home is the fleet of gleaming
Mercedes, Bentleys and Porsches parked neatly in the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Dupri is moving soon. He recently bought a house in Atlanta,
near the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just outgrown this place,'' he says. ``In Buckhead it
will be easier if I'm hanging out at Phipps Plaza with Mase or I
want to go to Justin's with Mariah Carey.''

 &HT;    Cultivating seed traditions of yesteryear is growing at a swift
pace
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The seeds of spring are here, spilling out of wire
racks at local gardening centers and hardware stores like
tantalizing promises of a rich and tasty growing season. Fat green
beans bursting at the seams. Flowers so bright they could twirl up
the credits of a technicolor movie. Bright red tomatoes, just like
the ones Granny sliced for that plate that was always in the middle
of the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   But as you reach for those little paper packets, take a second
look at what you're putting in your basket, and ultimately in your
garden. If the seed package looks like an ad out of a 1910 farmer's
almanac with sepia-toned drawings, antique lettering and cozy
colors lifted from the pages of an old Dick and Jane book, you are
taking part in what has become one of the hottest trends in
gardening _ heirloom seeds.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, dozens of independent seed companies have
emerged specializing in heirloom varieties. For the third year in a
row, Burpee's mail-order company is offering an heirloom catalog.
Spokeswoman Eileen Caetano-Isola of the Web site
http://www.garden.com reports that 10 times as many heirloom
seedlings have been sold this year than were sold in 1998 and that
requests for information on seed cultivation have also grown.
</P>
<P>
   Heirloom seeds are vegetable and flower varieties that are at
least 50 to 100 years old, although commercial growers disagree
hotly on the definition. Like fine china or old photos, these are
the horticultural world's version of priceless antiques. They are
not hybrids, i.e., plants such as Big Boy tomatoes or Blue Lake
pole beans, bred for years by growers to resist disease and produce
consistent shapes and sizes. Because heirlooms are open-pollinated,
which means the plant can reproduce itself ``true to type'' through
natural pollination methods, unlike hybrids that are usually
sterile, growers can save and use the seeds from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heirlooms are varieties that are often no longer available in
the commercial seed trade,'' says gardening guru Renee Shepherd,
founder of the California-based Renee's Garden. ``They have been
saved because they usually have stories attached to them, human
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps that's the greatest appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Heirlooms often come with a history, a story about where they
originated and what makes them unique in family or folklore (hence
the nostalgic marketing).
</P>
<P>
   For example, the most famous heirloom is the Brandywine tomato,
a seed dating back to 1885 that is grown by an Amish community in
Chester County, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great big, pink beefsteak _ one ugly dude,'' says Lin
Harris, horticultural writer for Ferry-Morse seeds. ``It's not
disease resistant. It (ripens) awfully late, but it's a
conversation piece. And it really has a good flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd tells of the ``Mortgage Lifter'' tomato, which
supposedly came down through a family ``who sold so many of the
plants they were able to pay off their mortgage.'' She also sells a
Purple Hyacinth bean vine, said to have been grown in Thomas
Jefferson's garden at Monticello. Ferry-Morse has stumbled upon the
Lazy Wife Bean (let's leave that one to the imagination).
</P>
<P>
   Southern culture, because of our agricultural tradition, is full
of heirlooms, although the seeds might not have ever been called by
that name. Denise Smith, owner of GardenSmith greenhouse and
nurseries in Jefferson, says the perfect example of a Southern
heirloom was ``Mr. Bryant's Tomatoes,'' a heritage variety she
sells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Bryant was a little man in town who saved his tomato seeds
every year, and we would raise flats and sell them,'' Smith says.
``All the people in the community knew they could come out here and
get Mr. Byant's tomato. It was an old Oxheart, a big lumpy tomato
that looked like an ox heart you get at the meat counter. We had
people call from all over the Southeast because it tasted better
than the stuff at the store. It tasted like a real tomato, not a
big red water balloon, even though a lot of the time the plants
were ugly or had cracks. The seeds had passed from his family from
the late 1800s. He died, but we have still have a version of the
Oxheart.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern cowpeas are another example of vegetables with history
and endangered tradition. Today, only a handful of varieties are
available through commercial catalogs, although Southern tables
were rarely without a big bowl of shelled peas that were as
different from garden to garden as the families who raised them.
Many have been passed down through the generations. (Smith recalls
that in her hometown of Americus, everyone got ``Mr. Easterland's
peas.'') But, sadly, many varieties have also been lost as
Southerners left the farm for the microwaved comfort of suburban
kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Heirloom flowers, perhaps, offer even more variety than
vegetable seeds _ Victorian-era sweet pea, aster, marigold,
hollyhock, nasturtium. Burpee, which has produced perhaps the most
ambitious and widely available heirloom line for 1999, sells these
individually or grouped in a collection called ``Grandmother's
Flower Sampler.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to want the English look or the cottage
garden look _ short, fat, skinny, floppy,'' Smith says. ``I think
it's a reaction to the commerciality of the greenhouse industry and
long-distance shipping to garden centers where everything was bred
to be 8 to 10 inches tall in the flower bed. Instead of little rows
of soldiers in front of your house, people are wanting sweeps of
color and mixed containers spilling over and climbing _ a garden
that's a little wild. And you can get that with heirlooms.''
</P>
<P>
   However, aesthetic appeal isn't the only force behind the
growing interest in heirlooms. The renaissance of these seeds
actually began back in the 1970s as a result of
environmental/political causes. Most point to Kent Whaley as the
godfather of the movement. In 1975, with a handful of purple
morning glory seeds passed down from his grandfather from Bavaria,
he started Seed Savers Exchange in Decorah, Iowa. Part of the
back-to-nature movement of the time, Whaley and others were
apparently concerned over the eroding genetics of flowers and
vegetables, conglomerate control of food sources and dwindling
diversity in the food supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to find other people who were keeping varieties,
and discovered there was a tremendous heritage out there that was
being lost,'' Whaley says. ``We started networking these people
together to prevent the loss of history and culture.'' Today Whaley
produces a 40-page catalog with more than 297 heirloom varieties,
although he says Seed Savers has researched over 11,000.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, some point to the coming of the millennium as an impetus
in the growing heirloom movement. ``Some people seem to be worrying
about things like food supply more,'' Harris says. There's even a
plan for a Y2K garden on the Internet, although seed expert
Shepherd finds that kind of hysteria ``repugnant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that has a lot to do with why heirlooms are big
this year,'' she says. ``It has more to do with the restaurant chef
movement, which has picked up on putting lots of diversity and
color in what they are serving. Vegetables are moving to the center
of the plate, and so there has been a lot of interest from the food
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with heirlooms can be an adventure, like transplanting
flower bulbs from the family homeplace, or finding a dusty bag of
seeds in your great uncle's garden shed and watching them grow. But
heirlooms can also be a challenge. They are not necessarily as easy
to cultivate as the old standbys, the hybrids. Because different
climates and conditions affect how they grow, heirlooms can also
vary greatly from one part of the country to another _ you may not
necessarily end up with a plant that looks like the one of the
front of the seed package.
</P>
<P>
   Most growers concede that if you're looking for a dependable,
hearty plant, go with a hybrid. But if you like to experiment in
the dirt, or want a unique connection to the past, give heirlooms a
try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, a lot of it is about nostalgia,'' Smith says. ``I think
what has happened is we have moved from people who grew up in the
Depression and maybe lived their entire lives on the farm, to a
younger generation of plant enthusiasts who remember going to
Grandma's in the summer. Sure, it's a fad. People don't know
exactly what an (heirloom) plant is going to do. But that's part of
the fun.''

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Self-assessment tests on Internet helpful but
limited
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ever felt younger _ or older _ than your actual age in
years?
</P>
<P>
   The Internet offers a quick and simple way to find out whether
you may be right: Online self-tests assess everything from your
medical history to how fast you drive, then determine your overall
health outlook and compute the age you resemble, compared to the
average American.
</P>
<P>
   These health risk assessments provide users with a good general
overview of their health status, as well as an indication of how it
could be improved.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Internet as a whole, these self-tests shouldn't be
taken as gospel. Most health assessment Web sites have a disclaimer
reminding users that the questionnaires aren't diagnostic tools,
and that people should seek a doctor's advice for medical
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, (health assessment tests) are helpful in making
people aware of possible problems they may have,'' said Dr. Kelleen
Fitzgerald, an internist and clinical instructor at Emory
University . ``They should almost always be followed up with a talk
with your physician, so the physician can help the patient put it
in context.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests generally include basic multiple-choice questions
about weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, family medical
history and substance use. They may also ask about other lifestyle
behaviors that can affect risk of disease, injury or death, such as
not wearing a seat belt or having multiple sexual partners.
</P>
<P>
   After the user fills out the questionnaire, the answers are run
through a program that calculates overall health status and life
expectancy based on population-based studies of health risk
factors. For instance, a 35-year-old man might find that his health
outlook resembles that of a 32-year-old average American.
</P>
<P>
   But that information isn't necessarily useful _ the average
American may not take optimal care of his health. Study after study
shows Americans don't exercise regularly, and most consume 30
percent or more of their diet in fat. So being better than average
isn't necessarily laudable.
</P>
<P>
   The information also can be inaccurate, Fitzgerald warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how they can make that assessment without
actually seeing the patient,'' she said. ``That would not be
something I would feel real comfortable putting much belief in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might placate somebody who is overweight and lives a
sedentary lifestyle,'' Fitzgerald added. ``If (a health assessment
test) tells them they're really 30, then they're not going to go to
the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   She also pointed out that most risk factors are broad
generalizations based on statistics from large medical studies, and
may not be applicable to each individual.
</P>
<P>
   Some health risk tests deliberately err on the side of caution,
to avoid mistakenly inspiring confidence. The risk assessment tests
offered by the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart
Association, for example, each have fewer than 10 questions _ but
they're enough to send up a red flag if the answers merit it.
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what these tests are designed to do: Alert
people to potential problems and educate them about risky
behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   The American Diabetes Association's Diabetes Risk Test is on the
Web at http://www.diabetes
</P>
<P>
   .org/ada/risktest.asp. The American Heart Association's quiz on
cardiac disease risk factors is at http://www.americanheart
</P>
<P>
   .org/risk/quiz.html.
</P>
<P>
   HealthCentral, an online health information service at
http://www.healthcentral.com, gives users the option of performing
a full-length self-assessment that takes roughly 10 minutes, or any
one of several two-minute mini-profiles. The shorter profiles cover
a variety of topics, including fitness, nutrition, stress
management, alcohol and substance use and sexual health.
</P>
<P>
   The health risk assessment provided by Greenstone Healthcare
Solutions, a health-care management database provider, at
http://www.youfirst.com is one of the most detailed and
comprehensive on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The site creates a lengthy individualized report that warns
users about risky behaviors as well as educates them about the
importance of certain health parameters, such as cholesterol and
blood pressure. The report also reminds people about regular
screenings and immunizations they should receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had epidemiologists and physicians help create (the
site),'' said Shelly Schabes, project manager at Pharmacia Upjohn,
Greenstone's parent company.
</P>
<P>
   The YouFirst site receives about 15,000 hits a month, and so far
2,500 users have completed the health assessment test, Schabes
said.
</P>
<P>
   A unique aspect of the YouFirst site is that it allows users the
option of anonymously saving their health information under a
password so they can periodically retake the test and gauge their
improvement. The information could prove useful for employers
interested in tracking workers' health behaviors, Schabes said.

   ATLANTA _ THE OSCARS
</P>
<P>
   Five critics from diverse religious backgrounds offer their
thoughts on this year's nominees for Best Picture, focusing on the
moral, ethical and spiritual implications of each movie.
</P>
<P>
   The critics rank the finalists in relation to one another, with
1 being the highest and 5 the lowest, judging each movie's moral
message and how well it is conveyed.

   Theodore Baehr, an ordained Episcopal priest, is chairman of the
Christian Film and Television Commission and publisher of
Movieguide magazine.

<P>
   LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of a
concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game.
</P>
<P>
   SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (R)
</P>
<P>
   An American Army captain (Tom Hanks) leads a squad of men behind
enemy lines after D-Day to rescue a private who has lost all of his
brothers in battle. The film is known for its brutal opening D-Day
landing scene.
</P>
<P>
   THE THIN RED LINE (R)
</P>
<P>
   Legendary director Terrence Malick puts his unmistakable stamp
on the drama of an Army division's struggle to capture Guadalcanal
from the Japanese during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (R)
</P>
<P>
   Poor, overworked Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish
his play ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win
the hand of noblewoman Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) in this witty
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ELIZABETH (R)
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
ruthless ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore ``Ted'' Baehr/Life is Beautiful
</P>
<P>
   The movie is extremely morally acceptable. It's an incredible
job at looking at the most difficult topic, which is the Holocaust,
but in a way that can reach a broad range of people. There's no
excessive violence. There's no tricks of the trade _ sex, nudity or
violence. It's incisive, creative film-making that makes it a
classic film on the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 1
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan It's probably more redemptive than ``The
Thin Red Line'' in that Capt. Miller (Hanks' character) is willing
to lay down his life for someone he said that he may not even like.
But its violence takes it out of our recommended category.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 2
</P>
<P>
   The Thin Red Line It explores psychologically the same issues as
``Saving Private Ryan.'' Certainly some of its conclusions are not
some we'd come up with. But it asks the right questions and it does
have a lot of prayer and soul searching.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 3
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare in Love It doesn't fit our standards. Although it
has an extremely witty script, the movie reduces Shakespeare to the
lowest common denominator. I'm not saying the movie isn't clever,
but it removes all of the nobler instincts from Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking. No. 4
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth It's our last choice. The real Elizabeth was willing
to go to the gallows for her Protestant faith and was quite a
theologian in her own right. It is far from historically accurate.
There was a tremendous religious dialogue that was going on that
the movie ignored.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking. No. 5
</P>
<P>
   Ed McNulty/Life Is Beautiful The whole element of the use of the
imagination to protect innocence in the face of overwhelming evil
is powerfully portrayed. I think you have to take it like a
spiritual fable or parable. Once you can do it, the whole film just
falls into place. I think the moral message is the power of the
imagination, that it can defeat the power of evil to do harm to our
souls.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 2
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan It is a wonderful parable of sacrifice. It's
a fitting tribute to a generation that made the sacrifice of
liberating Europe in their own blood. I linked it to what Paul once
wrote, ``Remember you were bought with a great price.'' Ryan
realizes this when he breaks down near the end in the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 3
</P>
<P>
   The Thin Red Line It raises important questions of morality and
meaning and dares to say that even amid the brutality there is a
spark of the eternal and divine. We weren't given a Sunday school
lesson. Part of Malick's greatness is that he leaves it to viewers
to come to their own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 1
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare In Love I think it's wonderful entertainment that
shows the linkage of romance and creativity, that love can unlock
the closed gates of the creative mind. If ``Romeo and Juliet''
wasn't written that way, the film shows that it should have been.
The one moral qualm I had is the fact that Shakespeare was married.
I do have moral reservations that the film didn't even deal with
the adultery.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 4
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth It's a wonderful film that shows the progression of an
unsure woman dependent on the advice of others becoming her own
person. But it sheds little light on the terrible religious wars of
that time.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 5
</P>
<P>
   Henry Herx/Life Is Beautiful I think it's the most creative of
the films. It uses comedy seriously. It is one of those films where
I doubted whether it was possible to see anything humorous in such
tragic circumstances. And yet (Roberto Benigni) brings life and
hope and a sense of triumph of the spirit in the worst of
circumstances. It's a marvel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 1
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan It's celebrating all of those virtues such
as country, God and family. It doesn't take a look back at World
War II from today. It tries to recapture what the perspective was
like in the 1940s. It didn't have resonance, a longer view of what
it all meant. It's locked within its time and place. It's a
considerable achievement but it's limited because of that.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 2
</P>
<P>
   The Thin Red Line This one takes a longer view, which is very
introspective. It has an anti-war stance that ``Private Ryan''
doesn't. It presents an alternative view of sacrifice and the
tragedy of war that's represented by a just war. I think it's
off-putting. There are many people who are not on the same
wavelength as Malick. I don't think it quite works.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 3
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare in Love It is very literate. It's very playful but
it is sexually explicit. It's amazing that the film depends on
Joseph Fiennes' performance but he's not up for an Academy Award. I
don't think it's terribly deep but I like it a lot.

   Elizabeth Elizabeth is full of flash and fury. I think it misses
what that period was all about. The drama is all in the background
rather than in the people. The people are reduced to stereotypes.
It doesn't get across a sense of the religious dimensions of the
power struggle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 5

<P>
   Michael Medved/Life Is Beautiful It makes two important points _
that's why so many people love this film. One is the importance of
childhood innocence and the idea that childhood innocence is
important even in the horrendous circumstances of a death camp. The
second message is that the role of husband and father is the
highest calling to which any man can aspire. That's a particularly
welcome message.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 2
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan The moral message of the film has to do with
sacrifice to a larger cause, the importance of brotherhood and
companionship. There are six or seven points in the movie where it
takes a very clear stand for humanity, even in the face of
horrendous killing. It showed tremendous moral complexity.
Sometimes you may do the right thing, and still not be rewarded for
it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 1
</P>
<P>
   The Thin Red Line It's ``Private Ryan'' on mushrooms. It does
generate some of the same messages as ``Private Ryan'' _ the
importance of commitment to comrades. But the idea of a commitment
to a higher cause is completely lacking. They could have called it
``The Long Red Line.'' It seemed to go on and on and didn't seem to
know where it was going.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 3
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare In Love I liked it enormously as a movie but it
raised no deeper moral questions. Next to ``Private Ryan'', it was
my favorite movie of the year, but when you think about it, the
message it sends is both seductive and destructive, the idea that
nothing really matters other than artistic success.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 4
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Its nomination makes absolutely no sense. There were
values, ideas and larger elements that the real Queen Elizabeth
cared about, but this movie reduces her to an ambitious, utterly
selfish and self-absorbed lady who turns her victimizers into
victims. It's a mafia movie transferred to the 16th century .
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 5
</P>
<P>
   Holly McClure/Life Is Beautiful Roberto Benigni spins a
slapstick farce about the Holocaust and how an Italian Jew tries to
convince his little boy that the concentration camp they've been
sent to is part of a game. The heart, overcoming spirit and
precious appreciation for the gift of life is a true reflection of
how light will always shine in darkness.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 3
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan The movie gives this country a glimpse of
what the American spirit and patriotism was like back when this
country was unified as ``One Nation Under God.'' This is not only a
movie about war, but about the price of freedom. Its faith message
is woven into the attitudes, behavior sacrifices and decisions
these men made.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 1
</P>
<P>
   The Thin Red Line I equate watching this movie to be about as
exciting as watching paint dry and equally as emotionally stirring.
It blends war, sex and the psychological effects of killing into
one long and boring movie that asks a lot of questions about God
but unfortunately doesn't show the true side of God.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 5
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare In Love This is a well-written, well-acted, romantic
tale about Shakespeare and his inspiration for love. Unfortunately,
the sexual promiscuity prevails over anything spiritual and the
godly Elizabethan morality prevalent at that time is replaced with
love and lust.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ranking: No. 4
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth It's not only about dirty politicians, corrupt
government and sex but it's about the decision to worship God with
freedom. Elizabeth proved that by making personal sacrifices and
putting God first, He elevated her to a place of prominence in
history.

 &HT;    White cleric ministers to a black congregation in East Atlanta
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bishop Michael D. Spires, ``the blackest white
minister in Atlanta,'' is about to show his church a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   The choir at the Church of Atlanta Lighthouse has already driven
the congregation to a frenzy when Spires takes the pulpit on a
recent Sunday morning. An elderly deacon does a creaky jig in the
aisle. A plump woman collapses, sobbing in the arms of ushers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people afraid to shout because they don't want to mess up
their dress,'' Spires, 58, barks while pacing the pulpit. ``Some
people don't want to shout because they don't want to mess up their
weave!''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Spires beckons to a woman in the audience to join him.
He tells the congregation that she was once in a coma. He prayed
over her in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   After the visit, Spires says he received a call on his car phone
from a doctor reporting something strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went into the room,'' Spires says, ``she was sitting in
a rocking chair eating food and I said, `Save me some, girl!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd erupts in shouts of joy. The woman, Josephine
Summerlin, 61, buries her head against Spires' chest and cries.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is still in the miracle-working business!'' Spires yells
over the congregation's exaltations.
</P>
<P>
   The church's drummer kicks off a soulful groove. The saxophonist
starts wailing. Spires nods at his co-pastor, and they both execute
a graceful 360-degree dance turn as the choir hits its chorus,
singing, ``So glad I found him, Jesus saves.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene could be the highlight reel of any black Pentecostal
Sunday service in metro Atlanta except for one detail _ Spires is
white and his congregation is virtually all black.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 26 years, Spires has been a pulpit pioneer, leading
this nondenominational black church in a working-class section of
East Atlanta. He has endured death threats, taunts from white and
black people. He's even had to overcome his past, _ being raised in
a segregated Southern town in a family that had ties to the Ku Klux
Klan.
</P>
<P>
   The experience has profoundly changed Spires. Almost all of his
friends are black. People who hear him on his weekday radio show
think he's black. Spires even gets uncomfortable now when he's in
an all-white setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I start looking for black people,'' Spires said. ``The
question comes to my mind. Why am I the only one here? It kind of
makes me think, `How am I going to act around these people?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Spires say, however, that he is no Michael Bolton
of the pulpit _ a black wannabe who thinks the culture of
African-Americans is exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Ross, a black Atlanta political pollster, has watched
Spires interact with black ministers and church members for two
years. He has been so impressed by Spires and his ministry that he
will award the pastor the 18th annual Pioneer Achievement Award
next week for the ``indelible'' mark he has had on Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Spires will be the only white of the 15 honorees at the March 27
event. Other honorees include U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.); and
Robert Benham, the chief justice of Georgia's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's genuine, consistent and for real,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Spires does not define himself as a racial bridge builder.
``When I stand on the platform and preach Sunday morning, I'm not
looking at black people,'' he said. ``I'm seeing souls.''
</P>
<P>
   `Get your own church'
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonder that Spires even has a church to preach in. The
church was on the verge of closing when he first took over.
</P>
<P>
   When Spires arrived at the Church of Atlanta Lighthouse in 1966
as an assistant pastor, the church was split roughly between
black-- and white-- . Over the next several years it became
predominantly black. By 1972, the white founder of the church, Al
Rowan, decided to move North.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 20 members remained. But Spires volunteered to take
over the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of questions from whites,'' said Doris Spires,
56, the pastor's wife. ``People would ask, `Why would you want to
go and pastor a black church?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks had questions, especially for Spires' co-pastor, Charles
Smith. ``Why are you with this white man? Why don't you get your
own church?'' Smith recalled hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The first service started with a whimper. There were 23 people
in the church, compared to about 500 at its peak during the
mid-'60s. The offering came to $35.
</P>
<P>
   Spires went to work. He invited popular black preachers such as
T.D. Jakes of Dallas to hold revivals at his church. He met with
black pastors to build friendships. Smith's presence also helped
retain black church members who were uncomfortable with a white
pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My presence here is to bridge a number of gaps,'' Smith said.
``We still have people who have difficulty with this relationship.
There are a number of cases where people have probably approached
me because they felt more comfortable relating to me because I'm
black.'' In the early years, some of the criticism became personal,
laced with racism. Spires received anonymous letters from white
people who called him a ``n-lover,'' and threatened his wife, and
their two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own people turned their back on me,'' Spires said.
</P>
<P>
   So Spires turned his ministry toward the African-American
community. His church started taking food and clothes to black
people in nearby housing projects. He preached among blacks in
Jamaica, Nigeria and the Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen him around anybody white except ourselves,''
said the Rev. Teresa Spires, his 36-year-old sister.
</P>
<P>
   The running joke at the Church of Atlanta Lighthouse is that
somewhere along the way Spires actually became black. His sermons
are peppered with black slang. During a recent sermon on adultery,
Spiers used words such as ``tail-shaker'' and ``hootchie-momma'' to
describe a temptress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of of co-workers who listen to him on the radio
who didn't realize he was white,'' said Joyce Jones, a Lighthouse
member for 18 years. ``I've heard some of them say he's the
blackest white minister in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   A stocky man, who wears a goatee and a long, black leather coat,
Spires said he's not trying to act black. ``If you move from one
country to another, after awhile, you start talking in their
dialect or their brogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He does admit, however, that he prefers to preach before black
congregations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a man's got any preach in him, black people can pull it
out,'' Spiers said. ``Their reaction to a sermon inspires a
minister to go on and do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is a palpable bond between Spires and his
congregation that seems to have little to do with color. A sermon
can't go by without Spires calling a member from the stage to share
a hug or an inspirational story. The church now has about 1,000
members, but the services feel like a family reunion as people mill
about, exchanging warm greetings and hugs. ``When I go there, I
don't think, `Wow, look at all of these black people,' '' said
Wanda Villafranco, one of about 10 white members who regularly
attend the Church of Atlanta Lighthouse. ``I'm thinking, `Wow, all
of these people love me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Spires knows what it means to be an outcast. He grew up as one
in Clinton, S.C. His father, Grady Spiers, was an alcoholic who
physically abused his mother. An older brother died at 10, and a
younger brother was rendered mildly retarded after a bout with
scurvy. As a boy, Spiers got into constant fights while defending
his younger brother from taunts.
</P>
<P>
   He left school at 14 to work in the town's textile mill, joining
his mother and father who also worked at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   It was his grandmother, Rosa Spires, who gave him faith and
taught him tolerance. Though Clinton was segregated _ Spires had no
black friends in his youth _ his grandmother treated everyone
equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black people came by our house and she'd give them food,''
Spires said. ``She'd give them clothes. She treated all people
alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Spires' father also shaped him. The older Spires experienced a
conversion when Michael was a teenager. He stopped drinking and
became a preacher at tent revivals. Even though Grady Spires was an
``old Georgia farmer'' who, along with his relatives, supported
groups like the Klan , he said racism never ``made sense'' to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A human being is a human being,'' said Grady Spiers, now 84.
``We all suffer alike. We're all happy alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by his father and grandmother, Spires said he knew when
he was six that he wanted to be a preacher. It's a calling that
runs in his family. His sister Teresa runs Rescue Atlanta, a street
ministry for ``pimps, prostitutes, and HIV patients.'' A younger
brother, Reggie, is a Christian songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come through hardships,'' Teresa Spires said. ``We know
what it's like for people to look down on you. We've been given a
calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Spires' calling was also inspired by something else _ a tent
revival he attended in Columbia, S.C., during his youth. Police
placed a rope in the middle of the tent to keep white and black
worshippers apart, but it collapsed during the climax of the
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows why, but the rope fell,'' Spires said. ``God was
moving. People had their hands lifted. All of a sudden, we looked
and everybody had stepped into the other people's section. We were
embracing one another. We were crying. We could feel each others
need, pains and victories. We never put that rope back up again.''
</P>
<P>
   That tent revival was more than an inspirational moment. It was
a prelude to the life he now lives, Spires said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time when we have to take the ropes out of our
lives and let people in,'' Spires said. ``We got too many barriers.
We hold people back. God wants us to be free. God wants us to love
one another.''

 &HT;    A gardener needs to take time out and just sit a spell
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like ants and bees, gardeners doggedly embrace the
work ethic; tirelessly, we hunt and gather, building spaces fine
and tidy. But unlike the insects, we humans know there comes a time
for what a friend calls ``some serious butt time.'' That's why I
always make sure my garden has plenty of sitting places _ benches,
chairs, rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Year-round sitting is as important to me as year-round blooming.
And with the shank of the sitting season imminent, I pay as much
attention to my seating as I do to my pruning. Will this rotten
wood last another year? Should I scrape and paint that wrought iron
or call it artfully aged?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, parking on a seat is a necessary counterpoint to all
the hauling and toting and lifting and digging and watering we
gardeners do; enjoying is as important as toiling. At the same
time, I get a lot of work done during those sitdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you can just think better when you're sitting: Umm, an
empty spot here. I must get to the nursery as soon as I'm finished
sitting. And, looking at plants when I'm seated provides a valuable
perspective. Valuable because I want my space to be a sitting
garden as well as a strolling garden. Thus, sitting is checking
whether I'm succeeding. Ahhh, that maple has gotten out of hand and
in my face. I'll prune it as soon as I finish sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Few garden activities are learned overnight; I had gardened for
years before I realized the importance of garden sitting. Too busy
with the traditional work of gardening.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, however, I've come to liken seats to plants,
recalling their origins, enjoying the memories they evoke.
</P>
<P>
   My first garden bench was born in 1990 in Sugar Hill. A retired
postal worker made it with pride and skill in his garage workshop.
Oak, with a back shaped like half a sun, it has served well in its
corner of the brick wall out back, and after almost a decade of
rains and freezes and blazing summers, it wobbles a bit. I will not
banish it until it falls down in a rotted heap.
</P>
<P>
   A bench with a metal back and wooden slats for its seat came a
year or so later, discovered at a Decatur furniture shop. I
replaced the wood about five years ago. Then, last year, in a fit
of whimsy, I sprayed red paint on the oval designs in the bench's
back _ to Lyn's dismay.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she encouraged my spray cans and me to lively
up two black, wrought-iron chairs and a table on the side porch.
So, for a year now, the small group has stood by the kitchen door
wearing streaks and swirls of red, green, brown, purple, gold. OK,
to appreciate the look, you have to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Out front, a big old oak swing dominates. There's nothing like a
porch swing to encourage and reward viewing a garden. Sit there and
gently move back and forth, looking at the azaleas, listening to
the chain's easy squeak and rattle, and you know this has to be an
essential part of the gardening experience.
</P>
<P>
   These sitting places are in Atlanta. My McCaysville (Ga.) garden
just got its first bench, one with no back, so Lyn and I can sit
facing Fightingtown Creek or swing around and face the garden.
McCaysville won't have nearly as many manmade garden seats as
Atlanta. But those big rocks _ round or flat _ sprouting around the
land sit and fit just right.

 &HT;    Welcoming the first day of spring
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is the first day of spring; it officially arrives
at 8:46 p.m. On the first day of spring, also referred to as the
vernal equinox, the sun rises due east and sets due west; day and
night are of essentially equal length. This season, spring will
last 92 days, 18 hours and 3 minutes until summer begins on June
21, say Fernbank Science Center astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   SPRING BREAKS: It may be spring this weekend, but last weekend
it was still winter, cold, gray and dreary.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chattahoochee National Recreation Area, though, wildlife
and wildflowers brightened the overcast weekend, says naturalist
Jerry Hightower. On his ramblings, he spied a grey fox and a
Cooper's hawk in the Island Ford Unit. White-tailed deer, great
blue and green herons, red-shouldered and red-tailed hawks, swamp
rabbits and tracks of mink, raccoon, otter, beaver and muskrat were
seen in the Jones Bridge Unit.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the red blush of red maple blooms, the white
blossoms of serviceberry and the purple petals of a few early red
buds can be seen along the river. Yellow-flowered trout lilies and
blue- to lavender-flowered hepatica are still blooming in the West
Palisades Unit.
</P>
<P>
   And all along the Chattahoochee people are seeing the white,
pink or purple flowers of fruit trees, the yellow of daffodils, the
purple of periwinkle and other introduced flowers from the many old
homesteads, some dating to the early 1800s. ``While not native,
their beauty is certainly a part of the river's cultural history,''
Hightower said.
</P>
<P>
   Spring guided walks in the recreation area begin next Saturday
with a floodplain forest hike in the Powers Island Unit. For a
schedule of the free walks send a stamped, self-addressed
legal-size envelope to 8615 Barnwell Road, Alpharetta, GA 30022.
</P>
<P>
   Other wildflower walks are being held at several state parks in
coming weeks. One is scheduled for April 9-11 at Unicoi State Park
near Helen. Visitors may see in bloom foamflower, anemone,
trillium, Indian pink, various violets, buckeye and spring beauty.
For more information, call 706-878-3983.
</P>
<P>
   Another walk is scheduled for April 10 at Panola Mountain State
Park near Stockbridge (Ga.). Panola is a large granite outcropping
similar to Stone Mountain (Ga.). The rock face hosts many unusual
plants, including diamorpha and sandwort. Visitors also may see
alum, atamsco lily, stonecrop, dogwood, bloodroot, toadflax and
yellow hawkweed. Pre-registration is required, and there is a $2
per person fee. For more information, call 770-389-7801.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these flowers are blooming now in Callaway Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   FIELD NOTES: Penelope Malone of Lake Forrest Drive in Atlanta
says the annual invasion of cedar waxwings took place at her home
the other day when a flock of about 25-50 birds landed on her
American holly tree and stripped ``every single red berry'' in 15
minutes. ``Every year for the past 18 years they've come,'' Malone
says.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Georgia Native Plant Society have spent a lot of
time recently rescuing trout lilies from a development site near
Alpharetta (Ga.). ``There must be 10,000 trout lilies there,'' says
Jeane Saylor Reeves of the society, which tries to save plants that
would be destroyed by construction.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE SKY: The moon will be first quarter Wednesday evening in
the south as it gets dark, says Fernbank astronomer David Dundee.
Venus and Saturn are in the west just after dark; Saturn sets in
the west about three hours later. Mars, which is steadily
brightening during March, rises out of the east before midnight.

AFTER BROADCAST OF PROSECUTOR IN SEX TAPE, YELTSIN FIRES CHIEF OF
STAFF
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Less than two days after his government's television
network shocked pretty much everyone by broadcasting a videotape of
Russia's chief prosecutor in bed with two women, President Boris
Yeltsin dismissed his chief of staff Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing wisdom was that the dismissed official, Nikolai
Bordyuzha, had become the fall guy for the devastating failure _ so
far, anyway _ of the government's campaign to force the resignation
of the prosecutor general, Yuri Skuratov.
</P>
<P>
   But so much of Russian politics is subterranean that it is
difficult even for seasoned political observers to divine what is
happening. A number of political leaders were quoted Friday night
as saying that Yeltsin tends to fire at will, especially when
emerging from a long illness, and that Bordyuzha was simply in the
wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, 68, looking puffy and speaking in an especially labored
manner, abruptly left a Moscow clinic on Thursday after weeks of
off-and-on hospitalization for an ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   His early release seems to have been set off by the Skuratov
affair, a bizarre sex-and-videotape scandal that threatens to
weaken whatever slim grip Yeltsin still holds on the reins of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov, a favorite of Communists and ultranationalists who
oppose Yeltsin, has a less than stellar record of rooting out
official corruption. His resignation a month ago, ostensibly for
health reasons, had been seen as a fairly routine Yeltsin
housecleaning.
</P>
<P>
   But it roared back into public view this week, when Skuratov
decided to stay in office and Russia's normally docile upper
legislative house, the Federation Council, voted overwhelmingly to
back him over Yeltsin's objection. Yeltsin is powerless to dismiss
Skuratov without the council's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov asserted that dark forces in Yeltsin's government had
wielded an incriminating videotape to blackmail him into resigning
because his inquiries into official corruption threatened their
power.
</P>
<P>
   While not naming names, he cited current and former Cabinet
ministers and an industrial magnate who could only be Boris
Berezovsky, a supposed billionaire who is a sometime Yeltsin ally.
Yeltsin dismissed Berezovsky this month as secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, the loose alliance of member
states of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov has said he is pressing forward with inquiries into
Kremlin misdeeds, as well as into the secret taping of his affair.
But he has carefully refrained from direct attacks on Yeltsin. The
two men met on Thursday, but the substance of their talk has not
been made public.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast of part of the videotape on the RTR network on
Wednesday night has raised doubts about Skuratov's fitness as
prosecutor, but even graver doubts about the government's motives
in releasing it.
</P>
<P>
   Many here have seen the move as a sign of desperation on the
part of Yeltsin or his allies. The Federation Council, a
comparatively cautious group of regional leaders, has been one of
the last bulwarks of support for Yeltsin's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Its refusal to accede to the resignation of Skuratov could be
read as a near-fatal blow to Yeltsin's presidential power and a
further lift for Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has emerged
as the country's de facto ruler in recent months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Byzantine depths of Russian politics, Yeltsin's actions
Friday evening can also been seen as a strike against Primakov's
rising power. For Bordyuzha was seen as a Primakov ally, and the
man who is to replace him _ Alexander Voloshin, a Bordyuzha deputy
_ has been closely tied to Berezovsky in business deals. Berezovsky
and Primakov are political enemies as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems Berezovsky's coming back,'' said Anders Ausland, an
expert on Russia at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
in Washington. ``Voloshin is one of the people Berezovsky has been
pushing for prime minister instead of Primakov. And everybody's
ganging up on Primakov now, because he's looking too strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The only clear loser in this dark-of-night battle appears to be
Bordyuzha, a former military official who may or may not have been
responsible for releasing the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   As the crisis grew earlier this winter, Bordyuzha checked into a
Moscow hospital complaining of heart problems, a practice so common
among members of the Russian upper class as to be almost routine.
He left only this week, just before Yeltsin dismissed him.
</P>
<P>
   The English-language newspaper Moscow Times suggested Friday
that Yeltsin had ordered Bordyuzha to leave his sickbed. Under
Russian law, it is illegal to dismiss anyone under hospitalization.

NATO PLANS THREE-PHASE ATTACK ON YUGOSLAV MILITARY TARGETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS lede to change `escalate' to `widen to'; adds 12 grafs to
original text, with comments from Congress, background on attack
plans and details of U.S. weapons to be deployed in case of

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's plans for attacking Yugoslavia include
missile and air strikes that would begin with attacks against air
defenses and would widen to more sustained strikes on tanks and
other heavy weapons, NATO and Clinton administration officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The initial strike, involving mostly cruise missiles, would be
``short and intense,'' in the words of one official.
</P>
<P>
   It would aim to knock out Yugoslavia's network of land-based
missiles and anti-aircraft weapons, which would clear the way for
strikes by U.S. and NATO fighters and bombers. But the initial
attacks are designed to persuade the Yugoslav leader, President
Slobodan Milosevic, to end his crackdown in Kosovo province before
additional strikes begin.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic continues to resist, the officials said the second
and third phases are designed to destroy much of the heavy weaponry
_ tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery batteries _ that
Yugoslav army and police forces have used to destroy villages and
drive civilians from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes would be intended to ``level the playing field''
between the Yugoslav forces and the ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo. ``It would be very difficult for him to continue to do what
he's doing once you've leveled the playing field,'' one NATO
official said of Milosevic. ``If you don't have artillery, it's
really hard to bomb villages.''
</P>
<P>
   Any NATO attack appeared to be at least days away. It was not
clear Friday what would prompt the NATO attacks. At his news
conference Friday, President Clinton said, ``I think that whatever
threshold they need to cross has been crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said they expected at least one last effort at
diplomacy. While many officials described NATO's plans as if
strikes were inevitable, others said there was still a chance that
Milosevic might back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that the history of Milosevic's behavior is
to blink when faced with a real threat,'' one senior Pentagon
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington declined to discuss the military
planning in detail, citing the need for operational secrecy. But
their willingness to discuss NATO's plans broadly appeared to be an
effort to demonstrate the administration's resolve in the face of
Milosevic's continued resistance to a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   There are still significant diplomatic hurdles to overcome. The
North Atlantic Council, NATO's political authority, has so far only
given Secretary- General Javier Solana the authorization to launch
the first phase of strikes. It must authorize an expanded campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The council's ambassadors met in Brussels, Belgium, Friday, but
stopped short of that, despite pressure from the United States to
clear the way for a speedier escalation of the air and missile
strikes. ``We have to be able to move quickly,'' a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry
Shelton, spelled out the military plans in briefings with members
of Congress, on Capitol Hill on Thursday and at the White House
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Clinton made a strong case for
NATO action during Friday's briefing. ``He laid out the problems
with doing nothing, as well as the risks of doing something,''
Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   There is concern within the Pentagon and among Republicans in
Congress that NATO's plans do not have clear objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bomb, then what?'' said Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., who
also attended Friday's briefing. ``They don't know. They are
assuming he will cave in. But they do say they don't know for sure
that he will.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NATO's plans have evolved since October, when the alliance
threatened the use of force until Milosevic agreed to an interim
cease-fire in Kosovo. The original plan called for a more gradual
escalation of strikes, but with Yugoslav forces pouring into Kosovo
recently, U.S. and NATO commanders pushed for a more aggressive war
plan, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO estimates there are as many as 20,000 Yugoslav army troops
in Kosovo, with thousands more poised just outside the border. The
Yugoslav forces are believed to have 200 to 300 tanks, as well as
armored combat vehicles and artillery pieces.
</P>
<P>
   While an initial strike against air defenses would be relatively
short, a Pentagon official said it could take ``many, many days''
to destroy the heavy Yugoslav forces. Another senior administration
official said that even the later attacks would be limited to
military targets and would not include broader attacks on
Yugoslavia's civilian infrastructure like bridges or communications
lines.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has pledged to contribute 260 of about 430
aircraft to a NATO campaign against Yugoslavia, including a dozen
F-117 ``stealth'' fighters designed to evade radar, seven B-52
bombers equipped with air-launched cruise missiles and even two B-2
``stealth'' bombers, which have never before been used in combat.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered the return
of seven aircraft that had been dispatched to the region last month
and then withdrawn, including three EA-6B radar-jamming jets that
would be used to overcome Yugoslav defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft carrier Enterprise, with roughly 50 combat
aircraft, left the Mediterranean for the Persian Gulf earlier this
month, cutting short the American contribution of aircraft. But the
Navy still has four warships and two attack submarines in or near
the Adriatic Sea that, the officials said, would fire the bulk of
the cruise missiles in the first wave of strikes. Britain also has
a submarine in the region, newly equipped with U.S. cruise
missiles.

   Pemex reported 1998 losses of nearly $1.1 billion due to falling

that Pemex faced weakening competitiveness without reinvestment in
oil production.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It all started on a South Dakota driveway that
really wasn't a driveway at all. Turns out it was just a slab of
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   This was Becky Hammon's basketball court. She shared it with her
older brother Martin and the two would play for hours. No other
kids played because there weren't any around. Rapid City was 10
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought the little girl who spent those days on
that anonymous piece of concrete would go on to capture the
attention of a city, then a state?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel famous now, a little bit,'' said Hammon, an
All-American senior guard at Colorado State. ``I'm getting a little
taste of it. I can't go through a day without five or six people
stopping me somewhere and saying, `Good job.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hammon, whose second-seeded Rams (33-2) play UCLA tonight at the
Sports Arena in the Round of 16 in the women's NCAA Tournament,
arrives in Los Angeles as the toast of Colorado. She was named the
state's Sportswoman of the Year on March 7 and the Denver Post
declared her ``Everybody's All-American'' in a feature story the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   Hammon leads Colorado State in most categories, including
scoring average (22.9), assists (4.8) and steals (2.8). With 2,719
career points, she is the Western Athletic Conference's all-time
leading scorer, male or female.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becky runs the show for (the Rams),'' UCLA head coach Kathy
Olivier said.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Hammon IS the show.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State had never been in the women's Top 25 before
Hammon. The Rams rose to No. 4 this season.
</P>
<P>
   The average attendance for Colorado State's home games four
years ago was 741. Now, Moby Arena draws a little more than 4,200
for each game. A good percentage of the crowd is usually girls,
whose ages range from 7 to 13 and who universally idolize Hammon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fan base is really family-oriented,'' she said. ``But
we're pulling all sorts of crowds now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammon's height _ 5-foot-6 _ has something to do with her
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's short . . . she doesn't look like a basketball player,''
said teammate Katie Cronin, a senior forward.
</P>
<P>
   Hammon is undersized, but she is the focus of every defense.
UCLA is no different.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's their spark,'' UCLA guard Erica Gomez said. ``In order
to win, you have to play her very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammon was a little off her game in the Rams' first-round win
over Cal State Northridge; she was just 4 of 13 from the field but
made 16 free throws to score 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   But she came out against Southwest Missouri State in the second
round and put on a show. Hammon scored 30 points, had eight assists
and put on a dribbling display that would have made Curly Neal
proud.
</P>
<P>
   Before the tournament, Colorado State coach Tom Collen said
Hammon must be seen in person. Her performance just doesn't have
the same impact on videotape. Cronin, Hammon's roommate for two
years, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have tried and tried to stop her and obviously they
can't,'' Cronin said. ``That's why a lot of people root for her.
You really can't stop her. She's just amazing at what she does.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a ride Hammon has enjoyed for four years. She cherishes
every accolade, every standing ovation, every kid seeking an
autograph. After all, she's come a long way from Rapid City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just living a dream,'' Hammon said. ``If you believe in
yourself, have faith in God and follow your dreams and follow your
heart, dreams can come true. I'm living mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an awesome feeling.''

Carson Levit was a Dow watcher before watching the Dow was cool.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years ago, before his crackling soprano changed to its
current baritone, the precocious 13-year-old was going long on
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a popular investment strategy. Inflation was out of
control. Jimmy Carter was president. The Rust Belt was foundering.
And the Dow Jones industrial average was sputtering at 800.
</P>
<P>
   The market has come a long way since then. After hitting the
10,000 mark during Tuesday's trading, the Dow has nervously flirted
with the arbitrary benchmark. Yesterday, it soared as high as
10,085 before closing at 9,903.55, down 94.07 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Levit knows something about soaring Dows and milestones. Unfazed
by the prevailing pessimism of the late 1970s, he believed that the
stock market was poised for a bullish romp. And he backed his
conviction by wagering precious proceeds from his paper route to
buy and sell stocks in between math and English classes at Corte
Madera's Marin Country Day School.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the eighth grade, I would try to use the
telephones in the principal's office to call my broker and make
trades,'' Levit recalls. ``(And) teachers would then ask me for
stock tips.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the adolescent stock picker quickly spread from the
schoolyard to the pages of The Chronicle and beyond. From the
beginning, Levit had a knack for picking stocks that would go up.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, the sneaker-clad kid was a national talk-show
commodity, pontificating about the rising prospects of the Dow
Jones industrial average with the likes of Merv Griffin and David
Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be sitting on the couch on the set and my feet
wouldn't even hit the floor,'' says Levit, who now stands 6-foot-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all pretty exciting for a 13-year-old kid,'' he
remembers.
</P>
<P>
   You bet it was. Sharing &UR;  &LR; television green rooms with such pinups
as Bo &LR;   &LR; Derek and Brooke Shields made the affable teen the envy of
the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   But where the boy-trader really made his mark was by predicting
that the Dow would scale once-unthinkable heights. After Chronicle
staff writer Steve Rubenstein spotlighted him in a profile article,
Levit was asked to pen an article for the paper.
</P>
<P>
   That's when he went out on a limb to forecast that the Dow could
more than triple.
</P>
<P>
   In a bylined column published on Nov. 1, 1982, Levit wrote:
``The stock market has finally broken out of its three-year holding
pattern and is heading on a course that wouldn't make the Dow 3,000
seem unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Little did Levit know it would take 11 years for his vision to
come true. But ultimately, the Dow cracked 3,000. The kid was
right.
</P>
<P>
   Today, to the surprise of hardly anyone, Levit, now 33, oversees
investment portfolios worth billions. Since 1993, he has worked at
San Francisco's Dresdner RCM Global Investors LLC _ first as an
analyst and now as a portfolio manager.
</P>
<P>
   His primary responsibility is to oversee about $5 billion of the
$16 billion that RCM has invested in large capitalization stocks.
Much of the money that he manages belongs to pension plans and
endowments of big labor and corporate America. His clients include
Boeing, the Getty Foundation and the University of California at
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Levit co-manages one of RCM's fledgling mutual
funds, a $12 million large-cap growth fund that was launched and
seeded by RCM just two years ago. The young fund racked up a 44
percent return in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   John Leland, Levit's co-manager of the fund, a 27-year veteran
of RCM and a director of the firm, says Levit still seems to
possess some of that investing intuition that he demonstrated as a
youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much more intuitive than most people in _ or out _ of the
stock market,'' Leland says. ``And most of the great investors are
intuitive.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to tell whether Levit is a great investor because
he hasn't been tested in bad markets, Leland says, ``but I would
bet on him. In fact, I have bet on him,'' he adds, referring to the
billions the conservative firm has placed under Levit's control.
</P>
<P>
   One of the other things that impressed Leland and his RCM senior
brethren about Levit was that he used stock proceeds that he began
to mount as a teen to pay his way through Stanford University and
graduate school at the Wharton School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his experience was hands-on. During high school, he
fudged about his age to land a job at the Pacific Stock Exchange,
where he worked before going to school.
</P>
<P>
   What possessed such a young kid to get engrossed in the stock
market in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   During an unseasonably cool family vacation at Florida's Disney
World, the youngster caught pneumonia and was sentenced to recover
in his hotel room. On top of that, an ear infection prevented him
from flying back to California for days. When he went to the gift
shop to buy a book, there were only two choices: a tome on child
psychology and a primer on how to invest in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   You can guess which one he chose.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, in what now seems eerily prescient, the stock
market book he ultimately chose was authored by none other than
Claude Rosenberg, a founder of RCM _ the firm where he now works.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long after reading the book that Levit was looking for
a broker. In 1976, he took a $1,000 nest egg from his paper route
and plunked it down on the National Exhibition Corp. of Canada, a
company that nearly bought the San Francisco Giants. The investment
proved to be a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by his early success, Levit then diversified his
holdings. ``It was very simplistic. I'd be throwing a football
around and realized that it was made by AMF. So I would invest in
AMF,'' Levit recalls.
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, the stock was a winner. As were many of
his other early picks: Teledyne, Perrier and Texas Instruments.
Each of those companies was selling products that were riding huge
waves of popularity at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Levit's legend began to grow. He no longer relied solely on
instinct and began to bolster his stock picking with economic
research.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 15, Levit was espousing free-market theories
in articles written for The Chronicle and forecasting that the Dow
Jones industrial average would smash 3,000. Which, at the time, was
like saying gold would hit $2,000 an ounce today, he says. (Gold
currently is worth less than $300 an ounce.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What gave me optimism was that Silicon Valley was just getting
going, and I just felt that our economy was going to start growing
fueled by the growth of technology,'' Levit says.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as a diligent student of politics and economics, he
thought tax rates were destined to fall and that investments
pouring into 401(k) plans and defined contribution plans would
prime the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a lot of research and went to the library. It helped me
see through the bad economic times,'' Levit says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a real believer in Reaganomics,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Levit is two decades wiser, and he has been riding the bull
market since his first stock purchase in the eighth grade. The Dow
has climbed nearly 7,000 points further than his infamous
prediction. Does the Industrial index's flirtation with 10,000
really mean anything to him?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dow has become a dinosaur,'' Levit says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think the 10,000 mark will become a barrier or
impediment to additional growth in the market. And I don't think
we'll sit at this level for very long.''

Netscape Braces for Layoffs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By Jon Swartz
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
( &LR; c &LR; ) 1999, The San Francisco &LR;   &LR; Chronicle &QL; 
America Online _ which completed its $10 billion buyout of Netscape
Communications this week _ is expected to lay off up to a third of
the Internet pioneer's 2,500 employees next week, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The online giant reportedly will cut back Netscape divisions
that overlap with AOL's, such as sales and marketing. Netscape also
could endure losses in departments that develop software also made
by Sun Microsystems, another partner in the merger. Sun will
co-develop future versions of Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs at the Mountain View software company will number in the
hundreds, sources said. On Thursday night, TheStreet.com, an online
financial news service, reported a workforce reduction of 700,
citing unnamed sources close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   AOL spokesman Jim Whitney declined to comment, but said the
Dulles, Va., online service will ``make an announcement next week
on how the two companies will operate together.''
</P>
<P>
   A Netscape spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But one former Netscape employee, speaking anonymously, said it
was ``no surprise'' that AOL would wield the ax. ``That was a given
once they announced their intention to buy us,'' he said. ``Too
much overlap between the companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The impending cutbacks mark an unceremonious end to Netscape's
fairy-tale rise from scrappy startup to Internet icon _ as well as
an affirmation of AOL's growing clout.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, founded in 1994 by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Jim
Clark and Web golden boy Marc Andreessen, created the first Web
browser for navigating the Internet. But for the past two years,
the company steadily lost market share and was badly battered by
software giant Microsoft, which distributed its browser for free.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Netscape needed a major partner to pull out of its
tailspin, and it struck a deal with AOL last fall.
</P>
<P>
   With its acquisition of Netscape, AOL will reach a staggering 70
percent of all Net users. The company already is the largest
provider of Internet access, with 16 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Interactive Services President Barry Schuler has been
melding the operations of AOL and Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale has joined AOL's board of directors
but will not have any day-to-day responsibilities. Andreessen has
been named AOL's chief technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   Although both companies trace their origins to the Internet,
their cultures are very different.
</P>
<P>
   While AOL developed a reputation for savvy marketing and covered
its corporate walls with posters touting ``Valued Work Behaviors,''
Netscape was a freewheeling group of renegade programmers who named
their conference rooms after cartoon characters and stressed
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing AOL and Netscape duplicated were similar
jobs in several departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I surprised by the layoffs? No. There is a lot of overlap
in marketing and sales positions between the two companies,'' said
analyst Jim Balderston of Zona Research in Redwood City. ``The
buyer makes the call _ and in this case, AOL decided to make the
cuts.''

 &HT;    Sosa ready for Round 2
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ The squeals from memorabilia hounds patrolling the
other side of the wall confirmed that a batting-practice ball hit
by Sammy Sosa had reached the parking lot. It was a simple
acknowledgement that Sosa, whose 66 home runs in 1998 made him the
most revered runner-up in the history of the game, has his spring
swing in midseason form.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It's) like I picked up right where I left off last year,''
said Sosa, right fielder for the Chicago Cubs and the reigning
National League Most Valuable Player. ``No one can say what will
happen this time around, but if I can (maintain) this groove into
the season, things will be pretty interesting again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has maintained his optimism for 1999 despite the
season-ending elbow injury to pitcher Kerry Wood and the bulging
disk that sidelined closer Rod Beck for two weeks. He insists the
Cubs will contend for a postseason berth again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa also predicted another six-month home run derby with St.
Louis first baseman Mark McGwire, his newest best friend, whose 70
home runs won the record chase. Unlike McGwire, with his legendary
uppercut, Sosa is not a natural slugger. But he has, even at this
advanced stage of his career, finally mastered the art of
selectivity and made it his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   His strikeouts are down, his average is up, and his profile is
still rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of players who waste much of the natural
ability they possess,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. ``Sammy
finally harnessed his. Sometimes it takes a while to realize how
good you really are, you know? Now Sammy knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has been plenty good this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing only two-thirds of the Cubs' games, he has eight
home runs, including two each in his last two appearances.
Diamondbacks pitcher Todd Stottlemyre came so undone on Wednesday
after giving up his second long homer to Sosa that he cursed the
Chicago slugger between innings and was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of frustration might be epidemic for National League
pitchers in '99. Once a brooding player, who felt underappreciated
in the field and undervalued in the paycheck, Sosa has changed his
outlook, and opponents have been forced to look out ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I respected myself more than ever,'' he said.
``That has to come first. Maybe I carried a chip (on my shoulder)
too long. But when it came off, I was a better player and a better
person, and other people respected me then, too.''
</P>
<P>
   While last season's home-run chase mesmerized the nation, it
took a mental toll, Sosa said, but not enough to have kept him from
tours of Japan and Central America and a ton of banquets. The
rubber-chicken circuit has made him a little cheekier, but his body
is in good shape, and his mind is sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman knows last season was special and that Sosa isn't
likely to duplicate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for any particular numbers,'' Riggleman
said. ``It's such a game of statistics that I know the fans will
be, and the rotisserie leagues will be, so it will be an issue
externally. Internally, I don't think it will be. If you told me
Sammy will have an average Sammy Sosa year, I'd take it right now.
Whatever those numbers are, I'd take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Sosa joined the Cubs in '93, he has averaged 39 homers and
110 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully he'll have an injury-free year again,'' Riggleman
said, ``and when you look up at the end of September it's going to
have been a real good year. His physical talent will take care of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is excited by some lineup experiments that have sandwiched
him between Mark Grace and Henry Rodriguez _ Sosa has predicted the
latter will hit 40-45 homers this year.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he wasn't in the lineup when Chicago traveled to
face the Milwaukee Brewers, and the fans at Maryvale Baseball Park
in Phoenix jeered when they realized Sosa hadn't made the trip.
That's one reason Sosa can't wait for the regular season to begin.
</P>
<P>
   That's when everything is right in Sammy's world.

 &HT;    Miller twins getting a grip on emotions
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Kelly and Coco Miller bring an obvious zeal to
basketball, and the flip side of their openly displayed emotions
attracts virtually the same jaw-dropping notice.
</P>
<P>
   The talented All-SEC sophomore twins lead Georgia in scoring and
already are playing their way into the school'srecord books. But
when they push beyond the competitive edge coach Andy Landers loves
so much, it threatens to disrupt his carefully woven but fragile
team unity.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, which plays Clemson this afternoon in the Sweet 16 in
Cincinnati, clearly wouldn't be where it is without the Millers,
both of whom reached the 1,000-point plateau in exactly 57 games.
Coco leads the team with 19.1 points a game; Kelly is second at
18.1. Although they have matured considerably since their freshman
year, they still are prone to cry or grimace during games and
practices and at times argue heatedly with the equally
demonstrative Landers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with Kelly and Coco is an experience,'' sophomore
guard Kiesha Brown said. ``They're almost to the point of wanting
to be perfectionists, of wanting everything to be right. It leads
to frustration, and everybody knows what that's like.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Landers dismissed Coco from a practice session after
she talked back to him when he made her run laps. She had been
upset after being taken out of a scrimmage. And during a workout
earlier this week, Kelly attracted his wrath after making a mistake
on a fast-break drill and conveying her dismay with her sister.
After Landers yelled at her, he took Kelly aside and spoke to her
quietly during a water break.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life with the 5-10 guards from Rochester, Minn., who
carried a heavy burden last year when Georgia had only eight
scholarship players. The Millers, who play with a ferocious,
full-throttle style, admit that some of their problems stem from
being extremely hard on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate missing shots; I hate not doing things well,'' said
Coco, who after a practice incident was benched for the first half
of the Alabama game in January. ``I have to learn how to calm down
and keep things under control. I think I've done better with that
this year, but it has been tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said, ``I think I've done a better job of not letting
those things get to me. And I'm trying not to take personally what
the coaches are saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Landers sees some progress. ``They recognize that they're
growing,'' he said. ``Enthusiasm is a great thing. But emotion
isn't always positive. You want the enthusiasm your players to feed
off of to be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Their teammates say they understand the special nature of the
twins, who last year didn't interact much with other players,
either on or off the court. They still keep to themselves for the
most part, but they're starting to come out of their shell a little
bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made a tremendous improvement since last year,''
senior guard Pam Irwin-Osbolt said. ``Everybody has bad days. If
you're really hard on yourself, and the coach is on you, that makes
it even more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   With teammates picking them up and coaches working behind the
scenes to help them channel their drive the right way, the Millers
say they believe they're well on their way to putting their growing
pains behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Coco said, ``They know that I know what needs to be done.''

 &HT;    Penn, Barkley are on guards
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE _ Great guards almighty! That's the surest path to the
salvation of the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Come March, no one goes to hoop heaven without great guard play.
No one knows this better than Mike Jarvis, who, like his
counterpart Jim O'Brien, has reason for guarded optimism of the
most confident kind.
</P>
<P>
   Those reasons? Point guards Erick Barkley of St. John's and Ohio
State's Scoonie Penn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither team would be here without them,'' said Jarvis, who'll
watch his freshman Barkley lead the Johnnies against Ohio State
tonight in the NCAA South Regional final. ``In Scoonie and Erick,
you have two of the best point guards in the country. The main
thing that makes them great is the fact that team and winning comes
first, and the belief they have that they can win every game they
play.''
</P>
<P>
   That belief was doubly reinforced Thursday. In dismantling
Maryland 76-62, St. John's again relied on its newfound 2-3 zone,
its unselfish ball movement and Barkley. He led the Red Storm with
24 points and nine assists. While committing an uncharacteristic
six turnovers (the freshman has just 76 in 1,191 minutes and 36
games all season), Barkley played like anything but a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's doing a great job as a freshman, running that
team,'' said Penn.
</P>
<P>
   As a junior transfer who sat out last season after following
O'Brien from Boston College, Penn is doing a great job of
confirming his preseason prediction that Ohio State would return to
the NCAA's after last year's 8-22 bummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoonie Penn's a great floor leader,'' said St. John's forward
Lavor Postell. ``He keeps everybody under control.''
</P>
<P>
   And takes control when necessary. Like Thursday, when Penn
picked up his fourth personal with 13:23 left and sat down for more
than three minutes. When he returned, Auburn led 52-46 with 10:14
still to play. But Penn promptly hit a 3-pointer and a baseline
floater. He scored 13 of his 19 second-half points in the last 10
minutes to take Ohio State to a 72-64 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   In the Buckeyes' first two tournament wins, Penn shot just
7-for-27 from the floor. He was still hampered by a bruised
buttocks suffered in the last regular-season game. But after
starting out 1-for-6 against Auburn, Penn finished 9-for-14 and got
untracked when he knocked down a 3-pointer just before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great dribbler, he shoots well and he's a floor
leader,'' Barkley said of Penn, the Big Ten Player of the Year.

 &HT;    How St. John's stacks up against Ohio State
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   When; where: 6 p.m. today; Thompson-Boling Arena, Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   TV: CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Records: St. John's 28-8, Ohio State 26-8.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches: Mike Jarvis is 28-8 in his first season at St. John's,
281-149 overall; Jim O'Brien is 34-30 in two seasons at Ohio State,
269-247 overall.
</P>
<P>
   How they got here: St. John's, the third seed, crushed Samford
69-43 in the first round, gave Indiana its worst NCAA Tournament
loss 86-61, then ousted second-seeded Maryland 76-62 in the
regional semifinals. Ohio State, the fourth seed, beat Murray State
72-58 in the first round, blew out Detroit 75-44, then broke a
61-61 tie with nine consecutive points to upset top-seeded Auburn
72-64.
</P>
<P>
   Possible lineups: St. John's _ guards, Erick Barkley (6-1, Fr.,
13.2 ppg) and Bootsy Thornton (6-4, Jr., 14.7); center, Tyrone
Grant (6-7, Sr., 10.8 ppg); forwards, Ron Artest (6-7, Soph., 14.8
ppg) and Lavor Postell (6-6, Jr., 12.9 ppg). Ohio State _ guards,
Scoonie Penn (5-10, Jr., 16.7 ppg) and Brian Brown (6-3, Fr., 3.9
ppg); center, Ken Johnson (6-11, Jr., 6.3 ppg); forwards, Michael
Redd (6-6, Soph., 19.7 ppg) and Jason Singleton (6-5, Sr., 8.8
ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Ohio State has completed a remarkable turnaround from
year's abysmal 8-22 finish, and St. John's _ upset by Detroit in
the first round last year _ has flourished under new coach Mike
Jarvis. Both have won 11 of 13, each losing in its conference
tournament. Both have played terrific defense in the NCAAs
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: St. John's 73-71.

 &HT;    Cup regulars dominate Busch
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Winston Cup drivers continued to dominate the
Busch Series on Friday, taking four of the top five qualifying
spots for today's Diamond Hill Plywood 200 at Darlington Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin, who has won five of the last 11 Busch races here,
won the pole, covering the 1.366-mile oval in 29.523 seconds, an
average speed of 166.568 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Roush Racing teammate Jeff Burton briefly held the outside
pole, but he was relegated to the 42nd spot after wrecking his car
in the afternoon practice session.
</P>
<P>
   Cup regulars Dick Trickle and Geoffrey Bodine will start third
and fourth, respectively, with Kevin Lepage sixth.
</P>
<P>
   All 11 Cup drivers who attempted to qualify made the field.
Owner Joe Gibbs withdrew his entry after driver Bobby Labonte was
injured in practice. Nine Busch regulars, including Kerry
Earnhardt, failed to make the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of cars at the Busch and Winston Cup
races,'' Martin said. ``It's a tragedy whenever a regular has to go
home. My heart ached for some Busch guys, as well as guys like
Robert Pressley or Kyle Petty,'' who didn't qualify for a Cup event
at Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Martin posted his qualifying speed in the first of two laps,
then his Ford hit the outside wall coming out of turn 4 in the
second. ``I knew I couldn't run faster, but I tried to anyway,'' he
said. ``So I wrecked the car. I just refuse to go a long period of
time without doing something stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   PIT STOPS
</P>
<P>
   Five Craftsman truck drivers will be eligible to win a $100,000
bonus in the NAPACARD 200 at Evergreen Speedway in Monroe, Wash.,
on April 3, the 100th race in the five-year history of the series.
The eligible drivers are Ron Hornaday, Jack Sprague, Rick Carelli,
Butch Miller and Joe Ruttman, who have competed in every date.
</P>
<P>
   Cup regular Joe Nemechek was 18th in Busch qualifying in the No.
83 Chevy, which usually is driven by Wayne Grubb, who suffered a
broken shoulder blade at Atlanta last week. Grubb's brother, Kevin,
will replace Nemechek in today's race and will start last. ...
Jimmy Spencer was 24th in Cup qualifying, which was quite an
accomplishment after his No. 23 Ford caught on fire during the
morning practice session. Spencer was forced to use a backup car.
... Rick Bickle also went to a second car after wrecking in
practice, but he was 45th in qualifying and will try again in
today's second round.

 &HT;    Gordon tames track to win pole
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Jeff Gordon escaped the bite of Darlington
Raceway on Friday, sweeping the field in qualifying for Sunday's
TranSouth 400.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who has won five of the last seven Winston Cup races
here, took the pole with an average speed of 173.167 mph. It was
only Gordon's second pole at Darlington, even though he's tied for
third with four other drivers for overall victories at the track.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bobby Labonte, who broke his right shoulder blade during
a morning practice session, Gordon was able to stay away from the
high-banked walls of the 1.366-mile oval, which is loathed by many
drivers for its narrow straightaways and abrasive asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People try to scare you when you come here the first couple of
times,'' Gordon said. ``They told me that (this) place is fast,
it's high-banked and it's scary. They told me I was going to get a
`Darlington stripe.' I think I've respected it from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Multicar-owner Jack Roush, who has four cars in the first nine
spots, might have been the only one at the track happier than
Gordon. Roush drivers Johnny Benson and Mark Martin will start
second and third. They will be followed by points leader Mike
Skinner and John Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   Roush's other drivers, Kevin Lepage, Jeff Burton and Chad
Little, will start seventh, ninth and 22nd.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have an owner have five teams is an accomplishment in its
own,'' Benson said. ``But to have them all run fast is hard,
there's no doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson, winless in 98 career starts, was the biggest surprise.
He hadn't started higher than 26th in four races this year, and his
best finish was 16th at North Carolina Speedway on Feb. 21. At last
week's Cracker Barrel Old Country Stores 500 at Atlanta, there was
speculation Benson soon would be without a ride.
</P>
<P>
   He silenced his critics for now, claiming the outside pole with
an average speed of 172.541 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``That all started because of somebody else saying something,''
Benson said. ``We didn't really think it was a huge issue at the
time until they kept writing about it. We all know what we're doing
and that we're sitting in good shape. We just don't care about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mast and Bill Elliott earned their highest starting
positions of the season and will start sixth and eighth,
respectively. Rookie Tony Stewart earned his third top-10 position
at No. 10.

 &HT;    Feeling `hunted,' Kowal defends title
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia took another giant step toward a national
championship, and All-American Kristy Kowal likes the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Bulldogs held off a strong challenge from Stanford to
retain first place Friday at the NCAA women's swimming and diving
championships. Stanford fought past SMU for second place entering
today's finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big day for us. We swam well in the prelims and
everyone swarm hard tonight,'' said Kowal.
</P>
<P>
   Kowal emerged from her 100-yard breaststroke final with the
second-best NCAA time ever. She had tears, but not because she
didn't beat the record _ she actually holds the record that was set
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just incredibly happy. Somebody said it was tears of
sadness, but it wasn't,'' Kowal said. ``I was very nervous. Last
year, nobody knew who I was and there was no pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I came out tonight, I knew I was the hunted and I
just wanted to defend my title.''
</P>
<P>
   Defend it she did, and she'll try to defend her title in the
200-yard breaststroke tonight. She likes her chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think being in our pool helps us,'' Kowal said. ``I know
every inch of this pool and I am used to the (starting) blocks. So
it's an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kowal's voice was scratchy and hoarse, she said, from yelling
encouragement to her teammates. Asked if swimmers could really hear
the crowd, she said, ``definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially in the breaststroke,'' she laughed. She imitated
herself bobbing up and down under the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real loud, and then it gets quiet, and then it gets
loud.''
</P>
<P>
   SMU's Martina Moravcova, who picked up three first places
Thursday night, came back Friday night with another All-America
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Lady Mustang from Slovakia blistered the field with a
1:43.84 in the 200-yard freestyle for her fourth consecutive title
in that event.
</P>
<P>
   She also swam a leg on the Lady Mustangs' fourth-place finish in
the 200-yard medley relay. She has had a huge hand in SMU's 225.5
points.

 &HT;    Waiting for normalcy to return
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Wonder why your NCAA basketball bracket is a cruel
joke? Just come here to the land of the double-digit seed, where
there exist more feel-good stories than in a convention hall full
of vitamin salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where Oklahoma and Miami University ended up so
unexpectedly, practically uninvited guests to Friday's Midwest
Regional semifinals. Oklahoma is but the third seed this high
(13th) to get this far, attempting to become the only one to go
farther. And 10th-seeded Miami is simply the wrong one, there being
no acceptable beach and little local knowledge about making a
decent rum drink.
</P>
<P>
   There is something to be said for overachieving _ in moderation.
We can handle just about one Gonzaga per Sweet 16. But what to do
when you can't throw a rock without getting sued by at least two
teams that shouldn't be there?
</P>
<P>
   Friday was to be comeuppance time in the Midwest, but there were
no guarantees. You can state nothing with certainty, other than the
fact that a couple of pesky programs would happily get in the way
of a much-anticipated Kentucky-Michigan State showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, at this stage of the tournament, I'm just about
Cinderella-ed out. The term, already flogged into a coma, has lost
all meaning. When so many upsets happen so routinely, isn't it
about time to admit that there are a bunch of teams out there that
can win an important Division I college basketball game? With the
exception, of course, of any located in the state of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   When the surprise becomes the expected, then it is only a matter
of moments before up becomes down and John Tesh does rap.
</P>
<P>
   The spate of upsets in this tournament is the best argument yet
for moving the collegiate 3-point line back a foot or so, at least
to international distance. At 19 feet, 9 inches, the arc is just
too close. It is the equalizer, allowing more flukes, more
victories by ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Miami already has been around long enough to be a real danger.
The Y2K problem looms, but there is a more pressing concern _ that
of subjecting computer spell-checks to repeated doses of
``Szczerbiak.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm worried that if Miami's Wally Szczerbiak gets any more
exposure, both Tiger Beat and Playgirl are going to be asking for
courtside credentials in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these teams make good stories. Miami coach Charlie
Coles went through 34 years of coaching and one heart attack _ in
last year's Mid-American Conference Tournament _ to win as many as
two NCAA games.
</P>
<P>
   And Oklahoma hadn't won a tournament game in the five years of
coach Kelvin Sampson until this go-round.
</P>
<P>
   And it is kinda cool to hear the player introduction go
something like, ``At 6-8, from Chihuahua, Mexico, Eduardo Najera!''
The Sooners star proves that basketball has no permanent address.
</P>
<P>
   These stories have had their proper airing. Seemed to be about
time for other more irresistible forces to take over. For example,
there is one theory I've always held to in judging a basketball
matchup _ always go with the team with the most tattoos. And the
Sooners' opponent Friday, No. 1 seed Michigan State, had a roster
that looked like a battleship crew on leave.
</P>
<P>
   You keep waiting for normalcy to get a foothold on this little
tournament. Surely it must make itself known soon, just too late to
do anyone's brackets any good.

 &HT;    How Connecticut stacks up against Gonzaga
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   When; where: 3:40 p.m. today; America West Arena in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   TV: CBS
</P>
<P>
   Records: Connecticut 31-2, Gonzaga 28-6.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches: Jim Calhoun is 301-120 in 13 seasons at Connecticut,
551-257 overall. Dan Monson is 52-16 in two seasons at Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   How they got here: The top-seeded Huskies routed Texas-San
Antonio in the first round 91-66. They defeated New Mexico 78-56 in
the second round and Iowa, 78-68, in the third round. Gonzaga, a
No. 10 seed, upset seventh-seed Minnesota 75-63 in the first round
and second-seed Stanford, 82-74, in the second. They defeated
Florida 73-72 in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Starting lineups: Connecticut _ guards, Khalid El-Amin (5-11,
so., 13.5 ppg) and Ricky Moore (6-2, sr., 6.5 ppg); center, Jake
Voskuhl (6-11, jr., 5.8 ppg); forwards, Kevin Freeman (6-7, jr.,
12.8 ppg) and Richard Hamilton (6-6, jr., 21.2 ppg); Gonzaga _
guards, Quentin Hall (5-8, sr., 11.4 ppg) and Matt Santangelo (6-1,
jr., 12.7 ppg); center, Jeremy Eaton (6-11, sr., 12.1 ppg);
forwards, Richie Frahm (6-5, jr., 14.2 ppg) and Casey Calvary (6-8,
so., 9.4 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: It has been an inspiring ride for upstart Gonzaga, but
this is where the string of upsets ends. Iowa hung in against
Connecticut by outmuscling the Huskies. While Gonzaga is scrappy,
the Bulldogs rely too much on their perimeter shooting. UConn
defends the 3-pointer well. More important, the Huskies love to
push the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Connecticut, 84-67.

A GROWING MARKET IN HOT TECHNOLOGY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This is an added story)  
 (af)  
 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Criminals following the Willie Sutton rule _ go where the money
is _ are not knocking over banks, as Sutton did. They are raiding
shipments of computers, microchips and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The direct losses that technology companies attribute to theft
are $250 million a year, according to a new study, and the industry
is spending a further $750 million a year on insurance and security
measures.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of truck hijackings, armed takeovers, burglaries
and trucks that mysteriously turn up empty at their destinations
have plagued Silicon Valley for years.
</P>
<P>
   Police in San Jose, Calif., estimate that in recent years,
robbers have hit an electronics company once every five days, said
John O'Loughlin, director of security at Sun Microsystems. Such
thefts often involve goods worth $100,000 or more, while the
typical bank robbery nets only about $2,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of crimes in the mid-1990s prompted two industry
groups, the American Electronics Association and the International
Electronics Security Group, to hire the Rand Corp. to perform the
study, said to be the first attempt to quantify the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five companies were surveyed, representing 40 percent of
industry sales; they reported 1,700 incidents of theft in a
nine-month period in 1997 and 1998. Industrywide estimates were
extrapolated from the results.
</P>
<P>
   Losses to distributors, retailers and customers were not
measured, but the researchers guessed that they might run up to
four times what manufacturers lose, putting the total cost of
technology hardware theft as high as $5 billion a year in an
industry that shipped about $235 billion of hardware in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Rand researchers found that insurance covered only about 25
percent of manufacturers' losses because of high deductibles and
widespread self-insurance.
</P>

   Thefts of computers and components from trucks were by far the
most common crimes, usually occurring in transit. Some involved
hijackings; in others, goods were replaced with boxes of rocks
without the driver knowing. Fewer than 1 in 10 thefts occurred on
manufacturers' premises.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that stepped up security spending during the study
period saw their losses decline, the researchers found. One useful
measure: removing the company logo from trucks.

THE STORE WITH THE SECRET TO LURING ANGLERS AND HUNTERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mo., Maine, Calif., Texas, N.C., Fla., Ill., Va.,
Tenn. and Zimbabwe)   By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ On their way to a fishing tournament in
Oklahoma last June, the 12 members of Zimbabwe's national fishing
team stopped at this city of 150,000 on the edge of the Ozarks. The
reason? To visit Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World, a sportsman's
paradise whose inventory of fishing and hunting equipment is as
wide as all outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 4 million people _ Americans and foreigners
alike _ passed through the store's turnstiles, just beyond its log
cabin-like entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Many are dedicated to hunting and fishing, as are a good number
of the store's 350 employees. But many probably would not know a
spinning reel from spinner bait. They are drawn by the chance to
see for themselves the blend of unrivaled inventory and
showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Now the privately owned Bass Pro Shops Inc. is branching out,
betting that this store's success can be cloned.
</P>
<P>
   After 24 years with just one store, there are now Bass Pro Shops
in the suburbs of Atlanta and Chicago and in Fort Lauderdale and
the Florida Keys. Six more _ including one opening on March 25 in
Grapevine, Texas, near the Dallas-Fort Worth airport _ will open in
five states in the next 18 months. State development and tourism
agencies are begging for even more.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why. While the company has sold some of its
products at outdoors retailers around the country, Bass Pro's
300,000-square-foot flagship store _ the size of six football
fields _ has long been in a class by itself. It includes a
four-story waterfall, rifle and archery ranges, four aquariums, an
indoor driving range, a putting green and a 17,000-square-foot
Wildlife Museum with a world-class collection of stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   On the third floor, past the live snake exhibit, visitors can
have their hair cut at the four-chair barbershop and arrange to
have a fishing lure made out of the clippings. Or they can eat at
McDonald's or dine at Hemingway's Blue Water Cafe, which boasts a
30,000-gallon saltwater aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The store's incredible, it's so huge,'' said Jacque McClure of
Marina del Ray, Calif., who visited recently with her fiance. ``I
could easily have spent another day.'' As it was, she spent just
over $1,000 on fishing equipment and outdoor clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Larry and Karen Montoya drove two days from their home in
Lakeside, Ariz., spent $750 over four days at the store and then
drove back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen so much fishing equipment,'' said Montoya, who
owns Rock CD Music Warehouse in Lakeside. ``We want to go back this
summer,'' with their three children.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of never allowing a dull moment is designed to
create what John L. Morris, the company's 50-year-old founder,
refers to as ``excitement and entertainment.'' The store's design
developed from trips that he, his sister Susie Hunt, now executive
vice president, and other employees took to different stores years
ago to try to pinpoint their appeal. Their most memorable visit was
to L.L. Bean in Freeport, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, heck, if they can draw all those people to the middle
of nowhere,'' Morris said, ``we can do that in Springfield.'' They
now attract even more. L.L. Bean said its Maine store draws just
over 3.5 million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bass Pro's 4 million annual visitors explain why officials from
many cities and states have beaten a path to Morris' door, seeking
a Bass Pro Shops _ usually to no avail. ``Each store is a
significant investment,'' Morris said. ``We can't afford to make
many mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the site looks right, Morris is ready. He was impressed
from the start not only by the profit potential in Grapevine, just
off Highway 114 a short distance from Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport, but by the welcoming attitude of Grapevine's
mayor and City Council. So welcoming, in fact, that the road to
Grapevine has been renamed Bass Pro Drive.
</P>
<P>
   When Concord, N.C., landed its Bass Pro Shops last summer, Gov.
Jim Hunt predicted that it would create 300 jobs, attract millions
of visitors and generate revenues of more than $300 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the store is what attracts fishing fans from as far
away as Zimbabwe: Row after row of rods, reels, guns, decoys,
tents, campers and outerwear, as well as plastic bait for as little
as 27 cents and motor homes for up to $45,000. One floor rivals a
boat show, with speed boats, house boats, pontoon boats, fiberglass
boats and aluminum boats. Those last two, made by the Tracker
Marine Co., also owned by Morris, are the world's biggest sellers
in their class.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the new stores are as big as the original here,
the others are still huge, complete with waterfalls and aquariums.
</P>
<P>
   In slowly expanding, Bass is moving beyond the model of L.L.
Bean, built around its huge mail-order operation and one big store
in Maine. It is trying to make a bigger splash than its rivals,
like Cabela's and Orvis, which have added smaller retail stores to
supplement catalog sales.
</P>
<P>
   Morris was born and raised in Springfield, still a region of
lakes and woods _ and, naturally, hunting and fishing. He opened
the original store in a small corner of his father's liquor store.
But the other sites were chosen with a discerning eye for location
and partners with deep pockets and reputations for accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   The following are among those partners:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Mills &UR;  &LR; Corp., the Arlington, Va., mall developer. Bass Pro
is allied with Mills at Gurnee Mills near Chicago, in Grapevine
Mills, at Opry Mills in Nashville, Tenn., scheduled to open next
year and Katy Mills near Houston scheduled to open later this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Q. Hammons, the Springfield-based hotel operator. His
329-room Embassy Suites hotel in Grapevine will carry Bass Pro's
Outdoor World name in its title, as will his 250-room Embassy
Suites at Concord Mills in North Carolina scheduled to open this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Gaylord Entertainment &UR;  &LR; Co. of Nashville. Gaylord, the
owner of Grand Ole Opry and the Opryland Hotel in Nashville, will
build a $300 million Opryland Hotel next to Grapevine Mills, and
Morris will build a Bass Pro Shops at Nashville's Opry Mills. In
1993, Bass Pro and Gaylord formed a partnership, one Morris said
``positions us well for long-term growth.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the flagship store, Tracker Marine, and the
mail-order operation, which distributes 34 million catalogs a year,
his empire includes Big Cedar Lodge, a wilderness resort an hour
from Springfield, and American Rod and Gun, Bass' wholesale
division, which sells to some 7,500 dealers in more than 50
countries.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Fishing and hunting, in short, are big business. According to
the Fish and Wildlife Service, anglers spent $703 million in
Missouri in 1996, hunters $683 million. The 35.2 million Americans
who fish (27 percent of them women) spent $38 billion on
fishing-related expenses in 1996; the 13 million hunters (only 9
percent women) spent $20.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Bass Pro Shops has a 24-hour toll-free number for customers to
buy hunting licenses and freshwater or saltwater fishing licenses.
</P>
<P>
   When its prize mascot, Ethel, the biggest largemouth bass in
captivity, died in Bass' 64,000-gallon aquarium in 1994, it held a
memorial service that attracted so many people that the crowd
spilled beyond the store's 300-seat auditorium onto the sales
floor. The service was broadcast on cable television and many
commercial stations carried accounts of Ethel's demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day,'' said Martin MacDonald, Bass' director of
corporate relations, who presided over the service, ``visitors to
the store still call me Brother Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris also donated a parcel of land next to his store for a $40
million American National Fish and Wildlife Living Museum and
Aquarium, scheduled to open in two years. The museum is projected
to attract almost 1.5 million visitors annually, 69 percent from
out of state.
</P>
<P>
   To forestall conflict-of-interest accusations, the project has
been incorporated as a nonprofit corporation. While Morris is on
its 15-member board, so are current and former officials of the
Audubon Society and other conservation groups.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Morris continues to look for opportunities. ``I'd be
happy to add two or three stores a year, if we can resist the
temptation to grow faster than our ability to maintain our
quality,'' he said. Acknowledging that further expansion could
require taking the company public, he described that possibility as
``very tempting and maybe necessary,'' adding that ``the downside
is having to be responsible to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Another downside for Bass Pro Shops could be if hunting really
is falling out of favor, as is often said. That may be more
illusion than reality, since the number of hunters stayed roughly
level from 1991 to 1996. But hunters went afield 21 million more
days last year, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service, and, in
real dollars, spent 43 percent more for trips and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whatever the future of hunting, Morris said, ``fishing is
our heritage, and it's still the main thrust of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is not worried. ``I've been as lucky as you can get,'' he
said, ``being able to turn my hobby into a business.''

 (af)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER and GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seth Ruskin, a global equities trader in Florida who
is about to change jobs, made it a point to insist on one thing
from his new employer, Wanger Asset Management of Chicago. The firm
had only a few computer terminals providing the Bloomberg financial
data service, and he wanted to be sure he had one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's using it,'' he explained recently. Through the
Bloomberg service, he said, ``I'm in contact with everyone, and
it's so easy to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Federal Express created a new paradigm in the 1980s,
revolutionizing the shipping of documents and small items,
Bloomberg LP in the 1990s created one for the dissemination and use
of business and financial information. In the process, the company
changed the landscape of the $7 billion financial data industry,
marginalizing once-proud competitors like Dow Jones' Telerate
system.
</P>
<P>
   As much as any founder could, Michael R. Bloomberg shaped his
company in his own image. Beginning in the early 1980s with a
business that provided arcane financial data to bond traders, he
built a unique information powerhouse whose news reports are
published in newspapers worldwide, whose television programming in
102 countries and whose data flow to about 111,000 trading desks,
executive suites and newsrooms _ anywhere that instantaneous
financial information is in demand. In the process, the dapper
Bloomberg, now 57, became a billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   But what it takes to forge a revolution is not the same as what
it takes to govern. Bloomberg's challenge now is to guide his
company through its transformation into a corporate giant stable
enough to manage a huge, competitive business and nimble enough to
outsmart other entrepreneurs _ the men who would be Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the privately held Bloomberg LP is now coping with
the problems of a mature company. Cost controls have a new, high
priority. A lavish bonus system has been reined in. The sales force
has been beefed up as the company sets its sights on foreign
markets, where every gain will be hard won.
</P>
<P>
   All this as the eponymous Bloomberg box through which the data
flow is being phased out in favor of a personal computer-based
system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the changes, the company is still an unmistakable
reflection of its founder.
</P>
<P>
   Like the system he built, Bloomberg is enormously complex. He is
generous: The company pays well, and he is an active
philanthropist. He is also an obsessive worker, and numerous
employees complain of a punishing work schedule. He has been
aggressive in hiring women, but is not shy about using brusque
sexual language in the office. Though he can be tough in pushing
longtime associates aside, he is slow to dismiss anyone.
</P>
<P>
   As the company has grown to nearly 5,000 employees and has
expanded around the globe, Bloomberg has withdrawn slightly,
devoting more time to philanthropy and nurturing gossip about
possible political ambitions. At the same time, his company must
grow _ in many different directions at once _ if it is to maintain
its momentum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview at his Manhattan headquarters, Bloomberg,
dressed impeccably in his trademark dark suit, white shirt and dark
tie, said Bloomberg's future would depend on its ability to
reinvent itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is such that you have to constantly provide the
public _ whether the public is an institutional public or a retail
public _ with new things,'' he said. ``Partly because they get
bored. But also because the competitors out there, whether it's
better kinds of cereal or widgets or information or whatever it is,
they're doing it better.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Bloomberg watchers with two fundamental questions.
First, where will new growth come from, when the company must
confront the London-based Reuters Group PLC on its home turf
overseas and watch out at home for Internet-based services that
offer much less but come far cheaper?
</P>
<P>
   Reuters had worldwide 1998 revenue of $5 billion _ from
financial data systems and news, photo and video services _
compared with an estimated $1.5 billion for Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bloomberg had net installations of 19,800 systems,
just 500 more than the previous year, according to company figures.
The growth of its installed base was 22 percent _ hardly a poor
showing, but lagging behind the 1997 rate of 28 percent and the
1996 rate of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Bloomberg in the United States, I think they've reached a
peak,'' said Angela Wilbraham, an editor with Waters Information
Services of New York, a leading research organization in the
financial information and services field.
</P>
<P>
   The second question concerns the company's corporate culture,
which was forged in a period marked by hyperenergetic work
schedules, hypergrowth in data-processing capacity and a sometimes
hypercritical management. Can Bloomberg outgrow its adolescence and
achieve steady, if less spectacular, growth, while managing its
expanding work force in a more measured way?
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg is betting that the increasing complexity of the
financial world will inexorably bolster demand for a system like
his _ a system intended to make opaque financial data transparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If securities prices were all that mattered _ if everything
was open, high, low, close on the New York Stock Exchange _
Yahoo.com could do it fine, and we'd be out of business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the bruising corporate culture, Bloomberg said: ``Look, I
hope the company is better tomorrow than it is today. The world
changes. You become bigger. When you are a small company, you don't
have policies. As you get bigger, you get to be more, codified, if
that's the word.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to keep delivering new information _ data,
equations to analyze the data and real-time news _ is evident at
the company's headquarters in Manhattan. Starting before 7 a.m.,
reporters, programmers and sales representatives reach across one
another for bowls of fruit and cups of coffee at the food nook, the
operation's main intersection.
</P>
<P>
   All around them, Bloomberg's computers are silently compiling
financial data and other information, and spitting them out for
those who need them. Any news headline about an Asian insurrection,
any stock transaction on an obscure Latin American market, any
change in a local water authority's bond price _ information from
800 separate sources _ can be sent through the company's servers at
the rate of 12,000 discreet items of information a second.

 NEW YORK: a second.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bloomberg began building this empire in 1981, after he was
unceremoniously ousted from Salomon Brothers when it merged with
the Phibro Corp. He had been a successful bond trader and head of
equities before becoming the brokerage firm's chief of information
systems. In that capacity, he developed a system for providing
Salomon's traders with data and numerical analysis. Still, his
personality did not meld with those of the other partners.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg used his partnership proceeds from Salomon to began
building his own company, designing a data system for bond traders
with the same needs he once had. No off-the-shelf computer of the
period could accommodate the system's needs, so he built his own
dedicated computer terminals, eventually naming them for himself.
By 1990 he was leasing 10,000 boxes a year for about $1,200 each.
</P>
<P>
   The Bloomberg, as the box is known, provided streams of data in
newly accessible formats, including a reservoir of historical
information that lent depth and perspective to every market
decision. With the push of a button, complex calculations about
prices and trends could be retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let investment professionals focus on their business rather
than the mathematics of it,'' Bloomberg said.
</P>
<P>
   That service was augmented in the early 1990s with a news
service that began by providing financial bulletins and has grown
into a broad-based service with a worldwide staff of 700 reporters
covering financial and political news for Bloomberg customers,
America Online subscribers and others.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the system brought rich rewards to the
company's founder. And Bloomberg, who is worth an estimated $2
billion, came to cut a wide swath in the world of philanthropy. He
joined the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and donated $100
million to Johns Hopkins University, where he is chairman of the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, his profile rose as rumors began circulating that he
might enter politics _ perhaps with a run for mayor of New York. He
neither encourages nor discourages that notion. When the subject
came up in a recent two-hour interview, Bloomberg paused, sweeping
his hands outward, as if to embrace 18 years of accomplishment
certified by the dozens of framed newspaper clippings that cover
his office walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can agree that we've done this successfully,'' he
said. ``No. 1, you don't want to do something for the rest of your
life if you have the option. No. 2, I've always been _ envious
isn't quite the word _ but people who do public service deserve our
admiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg has shared his success with his employees, winning the
loyalty of many. Given the rapid growth of the company, its bonus
system _ based on the number of new customers _ proved lush. For
example, journalists a few years out of school could make $90,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   So when the bonus system was recently revamped, it received
considerable notice internally. The changes reduced the sales base
on which bonuses were calculated and made the bonuses more
sensitive to annual sales fluctuations. Though employees can,
theoretically, receive windfalls as big as ever, some are anxious
about the overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are used to the market appreciating a certain
rate, and they are starting to feel like their wealth has gone
down,'' said one longtime senior employee, speaking on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The company's managers, including Bloomberg, see the change as a
necessary adjustment, one of many reflecting tighter controls as
the company tries to shave costs and rein in what have been rather
loosely run operations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company's investigation of purchasing practices
at its offices in Princeton, N.J., led to Bloomberg's filing a
lawsuit last month against two former employees, accusing them of
embezzling more than $1.5 million. The primary defendant, Joseph T.
Menno, declined to comment when reached by telephone shortly after
the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, journalists' expenses are coming under closer
scrutiny, and Bloomberg employees have been given electronic passes
to monitor their comings and goings.
</P>
<P>
   The new strictures may test morale at a company that thrives on
the intensity of its work ethic. A further test may come from
challenges to a culture that, some employees say, has transported
Wall Street's locker-room language uptown at a time when more women
are willing to challenge such behavior, in court if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   While the atmosphere has improved in recent years, employees
say, the change did not happen fast enough to avert three lawsuits
accusing the company of sexual harassment. All make reference to a
work environment in Bloomberg's sales organization in which
explicit sexual comments were commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   One plaintiff, a former saleswoman named Sekiko Sekai Garrison,
contends in her suit that women in the sales department were
encouraged to wear provocative clothing and were subjected to
vulgar descriptions of their figures. Men, she says, spoke openly
of female colleagues as potential sexual conquests.
</P>
<P>
   According to her suit, which is pending in federal district
court in Manhattan, Bloomberg himself joined in the banter.
``Bloomberg regularly made sexual comments about women to company
employees and clients,'' the suit says. None of the suits, however,
accuse Bloomberg of making sexual overtures toward female
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg does not deny that he occasionally uses bawdy
language, but he says that neither he nor the company misbehaved.
Bloomberg instituted awareness sessions about sexual harassment in
1994, and he noted, a news bureau chief was dismissed after the
company concluded that he had harassed a female colleague
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg is dismissive of the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of their lawyers called up and said, `If you give us
cash, we'll go away,''' he said. ``As far as I am concerned, that
is out-and-out extortion, and I think companies caving in to that
sort of thing are making a terrible mistake. And we will go and
fight all three of these. And I, in my heart of hearts, believe
that we have done nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Shechtman, the lawyer who filed the suit for Ms.
Garrison, said he had had extensive, but ultimately fruitless
settlement talks with the company's lawyer. ``There was a serious
and sustained effort to resolve the case,'' Shechtman said. &QL;

 NEW YORK: Schectman said.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Bloomberg's sales representatives, its journalists built
their organization from scratch, beginning in 1990. Besides having
to win respect for a fledging news operation, they were working for
a management that pushed its vision of journalistic excellence
relentlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Winkler, the former Wall Street Journal reporter who is
editor in chief of Bloomberg News, is credited both inside and
outside the company with establishing a high quality of basic
financial reporting. And these days, Bloomberg is supplementing its
wire service staples with columns and in-depth articles, like an
expose in December about companies' selective disclosure of
information to analysts at high-priced retreats.
</P>
<P>
   (That is a far cry from the early days, when Bloomberg
journalists were being rejected for press credentials that would
enable them to cover federal agencies. Then, Winkler offered
Bloomberg boxes free to newspapers, including The New York Times,
if they would run Bloomberg articles. That arrangement is ending,
though news organizations may be eligible for discounted rates.)
</P>
<P>
   The service, about one-third the size of the news operation at
Reuters, was built on Winkler's rigid rules, presented in a booklet
called ``The Bloomberg Way.'' Among its injunctions are
prohibitions on words like ``flat.'' (``People would never say that
a market's curved or round, so don't write that it's flat.'')
</P>
<P>
   Its clientele's voracious appetite for information leads to a
punishing work schedule, even given the company's high pay scale.
Present and former reporters say 11-hour days are routine.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler, who routinely arrives at work at 6 a.m. and stays until
after 7 p.m., said, ``I &UR;  &LR; would never ask anyone to do what I
haven't done myself or what I'm doing.'' He added, ``You put in the
time that's necessary as the story is unfolding.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, long hours are a staple in many news organizations,
as are arguments among strong-minded journalists. Still, Bloomberg
alumni with experience in other organizations describe a management
culture pockmarked by debilitating confrontations, a workplace in
which stories about personal humiliations have become the stuff of
corporate legend.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1993 incident, Winkler criticized two Washington-based
reporters who, while working 15-hour days, neglected to return a
call from another reporter in Princeton. In his weekly employee
newsletter, Winkler headlined his observations ``Proud to Be
Stupid'' and characterized the behavior as ``shocking'' and ``the
antithesis of what this news organization stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Winkler did not defend his handling of the situation, but asked
that his reviews of reporters' work be assessed as a whole. Indeed,
the tone of his write-ups has become less acerbic, with praise more
forthcoming. ``You get older and wiser,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg is quick to defend Winkler. The editor, he said, ``is
a perfectionist, and I don't see anything wrong with that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Employees who stayed with the company benefited handsomely as it
grew. Figures provided by one investor indicate that Bloomberg,
which does not release financial numbers, made about $270 million
in 1998 on sales of $1.5 billion, giving it a pretax profit margin
of about 18 percent. These people think that Bloomberg had debt of
about $315 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg said the numbers were generally correct.
</P>
<P>
   As a limited partnership, Bloomberg's profits _ and tax bills _
pass to its shareholders, though under the arrangement, equity
owners receive 60 percent of profits, with 40 percent plowed back
into the company.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch owns about 20 percent of Bloomberg. Bloomberg owns
about 72 percent, and six longtime employees have a total of about
8 percent. Their stake, along with Bloomberg's, is in a holding
company called Bloomberg Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Merrill chose to reduce its stake from 30 percent,
the holding company borrowed to pay Merrill $200 million for 10
percent of the operating company, thus valuing all of Bloomberg LP
at $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Merrill deal, Bloomberg also agreed to buy
out two of the eight smaller shareholders to whom he had given
stock in the company's early days, when he was looking for ways to
recruit and retain key employees.
</P>
<P>
   One of those shareholders, a computer programmer named James
Jong who left in 1995, said recently, ``I was bought out for 40
cents on the dollar, and the payment took a year.'' Bloomberg, he
said, told him that he lacked the cash to pay a higher price and
that, in any case, a minority shareholder like Jong would have no
other potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that account, Bloomberg said: ``I would never do
that. And Jong's number's were inaccurate.'' Bloomberg omitted any
mention of Jong from his autobiography, ``Bloomberg by Bloomberg''
(Wiley, 1997), although he cited all the company's other minority
shareholders, including another investor who sold his stake but who
remained with the company.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Bloomberg wants no more shareholders. If
Bloomberg were public, stockholders might raise their eyebrows at
continuing losses in its television operations.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg Television is carried in the mornings over the USA
cable network and local stations like KDFW-TV, Channel 4, the Fox
affiliate in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Bloomberg's TV revenues come from selling ads
during this programming, but sales have yet to come close to
covering expenses, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   With a private company, Bloomberg need not defend his
money-losing investment in what the company calls ``audio-visual''
journalists. In any event, he says that Bloomberg's TV and radio
reports help extend the brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most guys I know who run public companies claim they wish they
were me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg's future rests not on television, however, but on
sales of its data systems. Its growing sales force of 1,000 is the
largest staff in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The product that those representatives are selling is no longer
a stand-alone machine but a system that runs on personal computers.
That change reduces the company's overhead somewhat, since
Bloomberg will no longer have to manufacture or service the
terminals itself. (Existing terminals will be phased out and
replaced by the PC system.)

 NEW YORK: PC system.)  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reuters, the longtime market leader, sends data to 445,000
screens, according to Robert Crooke, a company spokesman. Unlike
Bloomberg, which has been selling a one-size-fits-all product for
an average of $1,200 a month, Reuters offers a range of products
priced from $100 to $1,200. Its high-end Reuters 3000 PC-based
service is designed to challenge the depth and versatility of
Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   Bridge Information Systems is offering Telerate Plus, a bond
analytics product that sells for $825 a month. Bridge bought
Telerate from Dow Jones last year in a fire sale, after Dow Jones
lost more than $1 billion on its investment. Bridge's purchase of
that and another service, ADP, brought its installed base of
terminals to about 300,000, or nearly triple the number of
Bloomberg terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg, Reuters and Bridge operate systems designed in an era
when the Internet was not a factor in the market data universe.
Now, though Bloomberg maintains that his company and Reuters are
actually the world's biggest Internet companies, he is well aware
that there are many advertiser-supported sites _ from Yahoo.com to
CNNfn.com to Marketwatch.com _ that offer basic data on United
States equities. And users get much of the information free.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg, in internal memos, has said he sees a threat from
``small, nimble entrepreneurial companies'' that might cut into his
market.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short run, some analysts say, he needs to challenge
Reuters' domination overseas and in the currency markets generally.
According to one Bloomberg executive, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, Bloomberg now has 800 institutions providing it with
currency data. Reuters has 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg has also introduced a system for completing trades in
certain limited markets, as a competitor to Reuters' Instinet
system. And it has developed a product called Data License, which
provides end-of-the-day data to financial professionals who do not
need minute-by-minute price information.
</P>
<P>
   Yet according to some financial analysts and executives of other
data companies, the biggest threat to companies like Bloomberg is
most likely to come from their own large customers: Banks and
brokerage houses may develop their own internal systems that render
Bloomberg's higher analytic functions superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg is acutely aware that there may be other, younger
Michael Bloombergs out there. But at the moment, his name still has
a magical resonance. Traders check ``the Bloomberg''; some Merrill
Lynch executives, who transmit messages over their machines, use
the verb ``to Bloomberg'' as a synonym for sending e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bloomberg is hyperconscious of the speed at which a
company can spiral into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started Bloomberg in 1981,'' he said. ``I've gone back and
looked at the then-Fortune 500 companies. How many do you think are
still in the Fortune 500?'' His answer: ``One hundred sixty, as of
a few months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few companies that survive through multiple
market cycles and technological evolution,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Will his? ``Well,'' Bloomberg said, ``I can guarantee you that
if we don't keep changing, innovating, giving our customers more
for their money, we will not survive.''

Holland, the founder of Europa International, a dealer of vintage

for their curiosity value. From 1995 to '98, Europa sold a few
dozen lushly-equipped three- and five-door versions (labeled the
G320 for their 3.2-liter six cylinder engines). Now Europa is
importing a yet-swankier version, a model that preserves the
G-Wagen's squarely retro look but uses a new Mercedes engine that

CLINTON SAYS HE IS UNAWARE OF NUCLEAR SPYING DURING HIS PRESIDENCY 

</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Friday that he was unaware
of any espionage cases at the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories
during his time in office and defended his administration's
response to suspicions that China stole U.S. nuclear secrets from
one of the labs in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of my knowledge, no one has said anything to me
about any espionage which occurred by the Chinese against the labs,
during my presidency,'' Clinton said at a White House news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials have determined that China benefited
from leaked information about the design of a nuclear warhead,
known as the W-88, from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials said they first learned of the
apparent theft in 1995, and Clinton said Friday that several
government agencies had acted promptly and responsibly since then
to investigate the matter and strengthen security at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   The president denied allegations by some Republicans that the
administration was slow to respond to the spy case, and that it
deliberately suppressed the information because of the 1996
election and the White House trade policies with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say categorically that it never crossed my mind that I
should not disclose some inquiry being undertaken by the United
States government for reasons of commercial or other gain,''
Clinton said. ``That is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Since detailed disclosures of the suspected theft were reported,
the administration has ordered several reviews. The CIA directed a
retired vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to assess the
damage to national security. On Thursday, Clinton asked an advisory
panel to analyze the security threats at the Energy Department's
nuclear labs.
</P>
<P>
   There are differing accounts of when the president was briefed
on China's nuclear espionage activities. Last year, a special House
committee that found evidence of the nuclear espionage asked the
White House when Clinton had been briefed about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials, the answer given to the committee was
1998. In recent weeks, however, White House aides have told
reporters that the president's national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, briefed the president in July 1997, shortly after Berger
received an extensive briefing on the subject from the Energy
Department.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
that since the completion of the House committee's report, headed
by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., late last year, Berger and other
aides had refreshed their recollections. ``After the Cox Committee
process, we've remembered more,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   A government official who has read the 700-page House report,
which is still highly classified, said the panel found evidence of
other thefts, or suspicious transfers, of sensitive military
technology, dating back two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other thefts that I'm aware of,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official would not say
when the other thefts occurred.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Clinton said he was first notified of
the suspected theft in 1997, and that the CIA, Energy Department
and FBI were investigating. In February 1998, Clinton issued a
presidential directive that ordered security tightened at the
weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   With the Chinese prime minister scheduled to visit Washington
early next month, Clinton also defended the administration's policy
of engaging Beijing on issues from trade to human rights to missile
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to do it is to work with the Chinese where it's
in our interest to do so and to frankly and forthrightly state our
differences where they exist,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't been working with China, China would not have
signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the Chemical Weapons
Convention,'' he continued. ``They would very likely not have
refrained from transferring dangerous technology and weaponry to
countries that we don't believe should get it.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When asked by a reporter from Fox News about whether China stole
information from the labs about a nuclear device called an
electromagnetic pulse warhead, during his tenure, the president
said he knew nothing about that.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Friday night that intelligence reports show that China is satisfied
that it has obtained the technology to develop a so-called
electromagnetic gun. That gun, the official said, shoots an
electromagnetic pulse.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a nuclear weapon, however, and is different from the
electromagnetic pulse warhead in the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

 &HT;    Buckeye's looking for confidence from the line
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Jim O'Brien has tried twice-weekly, 7 a.m.
foul shooting sessions. He's tried sports psychologists. He's tried
pep talks. And still, the Buckeyes foul shooting, well, stinks.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State is shooting just 61 percent from the foul line.
Against Auburn, they shot a dismal 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what it is,'' O'Brien said. ``In practice,
our percentages are really high, which makes me think it's not
mechanical. For the most part, I think it's between the ears.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU center Ken Johnson acknowledges that doubt creeps in when
players step to the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we even need practice,'' he said. ``I think it's
just confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   He chuckled when asked if the school's sports psychologist has
helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can talk to us seven hours per day but if we don't go out
there with confidence, then we won't make our free throws,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scoonie Penn is the only Buckeye starter shooting better than 70
percent from the line (74 percent). Michael Redd is next, having
made 62 percent of his shots. Johnson is the worst free throw
shooter among the starters, with a 48.6 percent success rate from
the line.
</P>
<P>
   OSU guard Brian Brown will see several familiar faces when he
steps on the court against St. John's today. Red Storm reserve
foward Reggie Jessie was a teammate of Brown's at Bishop Loughlin
High School in New York City. Starting forward Ron Artest played at
nearby La Salle Academy and freshman guard Erick cq Barkley played
on the same CYO team as Brown in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said initially he didn't understand why Brown chose to
attend Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when Ohio State was going bad,'' Barkley said,
referring to the Buckeyes' losing records and off-the-court
problems in recent years. And I said, `Why you going there?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Just watch.'''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley will get to do that in person today.
</P>
<P>
   A Columbus native, Redd was asked what it was like to live in
the city during the recent down times of OSU basketball. Redd said
the team was so bad, the locals coined an unflattering nickname for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to be called the 'Suckeyes' all the time instead of
the Buckeyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, sitting a few seats away, shifted uncomfortably in his
seat and blushed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   After his 26-point performance in OSU's victory against Auburn,
Penn was the center of the media's attention Friday. At one point,
a reporter asked four of Penn's teammates who were sitting next him
during an interview session to describe one particular Penn shot or
moment that made them go ``Wow, how did he do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Redd recalled getting a great no-look pass from Penn during a
home win over Iowa. Brown recalled a shot Penn threw up against
Indiana that bounced off the backboard and went in. Jason Singleton
and Johnson said Penn has made so many remarkable plays, they
couldn't highlight just one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's routine for him to make plays like that,'' Redd said.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat embarrassed by the praise, Penn bowed his head, buried
it in his hands and turned a light shade of red. He had nothing to
add to the discussion.

 &HT;    Huskies hyped for game against Iowa
 &HT;    By Bucky Albers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ As if Tamika Williams didn't already have enough
motivation to play well this afternoon when her Connecticut team
faces Iowa State in the NCAA Midwest Regional basketball
tournament, she has gotten some extra incentive.
</P>
<P>
   The former Chaminade-Julienne High School star has been told
that she will be able to spend the night at home in Dayton if the
Huskies (29-4) defeat Iowa State (24-7) in the 12 noon game at the
Shoemaker Center.
</P>
<P>
   That may not sound like much to the average person, but Tamika
hasn't been home since Christmas. She is eager to spend some time
with her parents, George and Jo Williams, and with her 12-year-old
sister, Tiffany, who is already 6-feet tall and a budding
basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   Tamika's older brother, Mike, just became a father, and she
wants to see her new nephew.
</P>
<P>
   When you are playing college basketball, especially for a
high-profile team like Connecticut, there isn't much time for
family in the middle of March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   After watching C-J play in the state tournament at Columbus
Thursday, Tamika's parents drove down to Cincinnati on Friday to
see their daughter after the Huskies practiced. They didn't get
much time with her.
</P>
<P>
   So many reporters wanted to talk to Tamika that UConn officials
took her aside and set up interviews separate from the usual
session with coaches and players. ESPN did a private interview.
Earline Brown, a family friend, and her daughter-in-law, former UD
player Tobette Pleasant Brown, managed to have their picture taken
with the 18-year-old phenom, but there wasn't much time for
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Before they knew it, Tamika was being swept off toward the team
bus without the pound cake that Mrs. Brown had baked for the team.
The cake was hustled to the bus just in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose control,'' Tamika's mother said. ``You have to sit
back and wait. I probably won't get to see her until after the game
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamika didn't forget about the family. Some of her teammates
gave her their complimentary tickets for today's game, so she was
able to round up two dozen for family, relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   When George and Jo drove back to Dayton, they brought with them
Tamika's latest trophy. She was named Freshman of the Year by The
Sporting News .
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the UConn-Iowa State game meets the winner of the
Georgia-Clemson game Monday evening for a ticket to the Final Four
in San Jose, Calif., next weekend.

 &HT;    Duke juggernaut rolls on
 &HT;    By Leo Willingham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Duke moved another step closer to the Final Four
Friday, but it wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils (35-1) advanced to the East Regional final with
a 78-61 victory over Southwest Missouri State, which might have
played its last game under coach Steve Alford. Unlike its two
previous tournament games, top seed Duke found itself in a battle
against the Bears (22-11), the 12th seed, which trailed 39-30 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Duke used a 14-4 run in a four-minute span of the second half to
pull away for its 30th straight victory and a spot in Sunday's
regional final. The Blue Devils failed to reach 80 points for the
just the fourth time this season and the first since Dec. 22, a
71-60 victory over Kentucky at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended the tournament run for Alford, the former Indiana
All-American who is one of eight candidates for the vacant Georgia
job and has been mentioned as a possible successor to Tom Davis at
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   _ Top seed Michigan State (32-4) advanced to the Midwest final
with a 54-46 victory over Oklahoma (22-11). The game was delayed
for 10 minutes in the second half as Oklahoma's Eduardo Najera, the
team's leading scorer and rebounder, lay motionless on the court
after colliding with Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves. Najera
suffered a concussion and a lacerated chin, but returned to the
game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Connecticut (31-2) hopes to secure its first-ever Final Four
berth today when it faces Gonzaga (28-6) in the West final in
Phoenix.

 &HT;    Duke handles SW Missouri, wins 30th in row
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It wasn't devastation, but it was still
domination for No. 1 Duke as the No. 1 Blue Devils got 24 points
from senior guard Trajan Langdon to beat Southwest Missouri State
78-61 in Friday night's NCAA East Regional semifinals at the
Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Duke (35-1) extended its winning streak to 30 games and will
play the winner of Friday's late game between Purdue and Temple on
Sunday for the regional championship and a spot in next week's
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   After Duke won its first two NCAA Tournament games by 41 points
each, the 12th-seeded Bears were expected to offer just token
resistance to the Blue Devils, who appear to be on a collision
course with their third national championship in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But to its credit, Steve Alford's team made Duke work for the
victory. Not until the final 10 minutes were the Blue Devils able
to put away the pesky Bears from the Missouri Valley Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Duke came into Friday night's contest having won its last 11
games by an average of 30.8 points.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri (22-11) reached is first Sweet 16 by
upsetting Wisconsin and Tennessee in last week's first and second
round in Charlotte. In those games, Southwest Missouri held its
opponents to 29 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck against the Blue Devils, who shot 55.6 in first
half and were hot for most of the night from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   If Duke can win Sunday's game, it will advance to the Final Four
from this arena for the fifth time in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Up by nine at halftime (39-30), Duke jumped out to its biggest
lead of the game, 47-34, on a long 3-point shot by William Avery
with 16:48 left. But Southwest Missouri came back with its own
3-pointer by Allen Phillips. The Bears were still in the hunt,
trailing 50-39.
</P>
<P>
   Then Duke got four straight points from Langdon and a 3-pointer
from Nate Games to put the Blue Devils ahead 57-42 with 12:23 left.
Alford called a timeout, feeling the game was about to slip away.
</P>
<P>
   His instincts were right as three minutes later the Duke lead
was 18 and the Bears simply did not have enough energy to make a
final run to get back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   In Duke's two previous tournament games, the Blue Devils led by
39 and 30 at halftime. Against Southwest Missouri State, Duke led
39-30 at the intermission but had to fight for every single point.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils jumped out to a quick 15-6 lead on Avery's
3-point shot at the 13:17 mark and appeared to be headed towards
one of its withering runs. But Southwest Missouri would not succumb
to the pressure and quickly regrouped, getting a pair of 3-pointers
from Phillips and Kevin Ault to move to within three at 15-12.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Duke seemed ready to apply the knockout punch, as it
had done to so many opponents in the first half this season,
Southwest Missouri found a way to score and stay within striking
distance.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears still trailed 23-20 when Duke's Elton Brand scored
inside and Langdon hit a long 3-pointer to put the Blue Devils up
by eight with 5:51 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri would get the deficit back to five, but then
Langdon hit a three with 50.8 seconds left to give Duke its
halftime margin. Langdon scored 10 points in the last 5:51.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Several UCLA football players will have new
positions when spring practice begins April 6, with each change
involving the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have moved 300-pound guard Steve Morgan to defensive
tackle, where he'll join Ken Kocher, Sean Phillips and Anthony
Fletcher to form a young (two redshirt freshmen, two true
sophomores) but massive tackle rotation in the 4-3 alignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morgan's a load and we want guys who will clog it up,'' coach
Bob Toledo said. ``He's hard to move. Guys couldn't block him in
one-on-one drills.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, freshman tight end Saia Makakaufaki (260 pounds)
will play defensive end, defensive tackle Micah Webb will move to
offense when he recovers from knee surgery, and redshirt freshman
and defensive lineman Doug Whiting will miss the 1999 season
because of back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruiting update: The Bruins have received an oral
commitment from Pat Norton, a junior fullback from Newhall Hart
High School. UCLA has two scholarship fullbacks on the roster,
seniors-to-be Durell Price and Mark Verti. Norton's commitment is
not binding until he signs a letter of intent next February. He is
the second junior to commit, behind Vista (Calif.) linebacker Tim
Warfield. UCLA's allotment of approximately 18 scholarships for
next season is going fast.
</P>
<P>
   __ The winners are: Former UCLA offensive lineman Kris Farris
reviewed movies for the Daily News last season. Farris took time
out from preparing for the NFL Draft to proffer his predictions for
Sunday's Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Best actor: Tom Hanks (``Saving Private Ryan'') is an Academy
favorite but won't get his third statue of the '90s. Ian McKellan
(``Gods and Monsters'') and Nick Nolte (``Affliction'') are very
deserving but will cancel each other out.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Edward Norton (``American History X'').
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Roberto Benigni (``Life is Beautiful'').
</P>
<P>
   ++ Best actress: The voters feel Meryl Streep (``One True
Thing'') has already been adequately compensated. Unfortunately for
Fernanda Montenegro (``Central Station'') and Emily Watson
(``Hilary and Jackie``), not enough people have seen their work.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Cate Blanchett (``Elizabeth``).
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Gwyneth Paltrow (``Shakespeare in Love'').
</P>
<P>
   ++ Best supporting actor: This is the most exciting and
talent-filled category. It seems to be a tight race between Billy
Bob Thornton (``A Simple Plan'') and Geoffrey Rush (``Shakespeare
in Love''), the edge going to Thornton for his dim-witted, morally
challenged Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Best supporting actress: Judi Dench (``Shakespeare in Love'')
is the only nominated actress with a pivotal role in a legitimate
Best Picture contender. Kathy Bates' performance was powerful, but
``Primary Colors'' was released more than a year ago, and the
voters can't remember anything before December.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Dench.
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Dench.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Best Picture: For me, there is a clear-cut champ, ``Saving
Private Ryan.'' ``Life is Beautiful'' will win the Best Foreign
Language Oscar, leaving ``Shakespeare in Love'' as the only serious
contender.
</P>
<P>
   What should win: ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   What will win: ``Saving Private Ryan.''

SPARKS' KNUCKLEBALL ON TARGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ Going into Friday's game against the Angels, the
Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa had nine hits this spring _ all for extra
bases (seven homers, two doubles). In his first at-bat Friday, Sosa
got his first single _ a one-hopper off the glove of shortstop Jeff
Huson _ in the Angels' 5-1 victory at HoHoKam Park.
</P>
<P>
   That was the only hit Angels starter Steve Sparks allowed in six
shutout innings of work, the longest outing by an Angels starter
this spring. Sparks, who threw 88 pitches, retired the last 10
batters he faced, struck out five and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Knuckleballers usually have trouble in Arizona because the air
is so light and dry, but Sparks has been successful _ his ERA is
2.12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to grade myself on throwing strikes,'' Sparks said.
``If I throw strikes and take the spin off it, the climate will
take care of everything else. I want to keep it in the area code so
guys will make a pass at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks has known all spring he'll be the No. 4 starter, but he
doesn't want to take anything for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the same situation with the Brewers in '96,'' Sparks
said. ``I went out to get my work in, but I was not getting hitters
out. I'm conscious of not making the same mistake this time. I want
to have some momentum going into the season.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Luke moved: The Angels returned outfielder Matt Luke to
minor-league camp for rehabilitation purposes. Luke suffered a
strained muscle in his back lifting weights in January and has been
limited all spring. He was hitting .333 (3 for 9).
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd been shut down for the last few days and we just have not
been able to give him a chance to see what he can do,'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``Like anybody, at this particular time
in camp you have to be 100 percent and he wasn't going to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   With Luke now out of the picture, one of the final available
spots on the roster will be awarded to either Phil Nevin, Orlando
Palmeiro or Chris Pritchett.
</P>
<P>
   __ Finley update: Pitcher Chuck Finley, who will make his next
start Sunday, will try to get in as much work as possible during
the final two weeks of camp in order to be ready by the start of
the season. But it seems unlikely he will be ready for his
opening-day start.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Finley might remain in Arizona after the rest of
the team breaks camp so that he can get in some extra work at the
minor-league camp in Mesa. If Finley can't go by opening day,
either Tim Belcher or Ken Hill will draw the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Olivares has moved into the lead for the No. 5 spot in the
starting rotation over Jarrod Washburn and Jason Dickson, but the
competition is far from complete. Olivares has to win the job by
pitching well in the final two weeks of camp, even though he had an
impressive 1998, going 9-9 with a 4.03 ERA in 37 games (26 starts).
</P>
<P>
   ``By now, they know what I can do,'' Olivares said. ``It's a
little surprising after the year I had last year that I have to
fight for a job, but if I let it bother me it'll affect my pitching
and it'll be worse. The thing I do about it is I don't think about
it. It's their headache. I just have to get ready to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Also: Third baseman Dave Hollins (tight left hamstring) and
center fielder Jim Edmonds (tight groin) were scratched from
Friday's game. . . . Musician Bruce Hornsby visited with some of
the Angels before the game. Ex-Angel and current television
colorman Rex Hudler said he planned to get together with Hornsby
and Garth Brooks on Friday night. . . . The Angels will make roster
moves after today's games. . . . The Angels play split-squad games
against the San Francisco Giants today. Olivares will face the
Giants' Mark Gardner in Scottsdale; Washburn will face the Giants'
Jason Grilli in Tempe.

   DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS FAIL TO CLOSE ABOVE 10,000
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average made its biggest move yet past
10,000, but fell back once again, unable to make its first close
above that milestone. The Dow made it to 10,085.31 in early
trading, and spent more than half the session trading above five
digits. But the robust opening turned around when IBM and dozens of
smaller technology stocks began to decline. The Dow closed at
9,903.55, down 94.07 points.
</P>
<P>
   Other stock market gauges also ended lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index fell 17.26, or 1.31 percent, to 1,299.29.
And the Nasdaq composite index decreased 41.69, or 1.7 percent, to
2,421.27.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices slumped on speculation that AT&AMP;T would increase
its bond sale from the $6 billion or more already planned. The
yield on the 30-year Treasury rose to 5.55 percent, from 5.48
percent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST UNION PLANS TO CUT 5,850 JOBS
</P>
<P>
   First Union said it would cut 5,850 jobs, or 7 percent of its
work force. The job cuts come in the wake of First Union's $16.1
billion merger with Corestates Financial. The actual cuts were
lower than the 7,150 jobs the banking company said it might make.
</P>
<P>
   LEHMAN EARNINGS INCREASE 13 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers Holdings said first-quarter earnings rose 13
percent, to $211 million, or $1.57 a fully diluted share. Analysts
had expected a profit of $1.45 a share.
</P>
<P>
   HONG KONG ECONOMY SHRINKS 5.7 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   The economy of Hong Kong shrank an estimated 5.7 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1998 and 5.1 percent in all of 1998. It was the
first full-year decline in economic output since Hong Kong began
keeping records in 1961. And, despite a rebound in the stock and
property markets, consumer spending plummeted 9.3 percent in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   GREENSPAN HINTS AT LESS REGULATION
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said the
success of derivatives traded outside of exchanges suggested that
futures markets could operate with less government oversight.
Futures industry leaders praised the speech and said they hoped it
would influence Congress when it begins rewriting futures trading
laws later this year.
</P>
<P>
   PAN-EUROPEAN TV NETWORK PLANNED
</P>
<P>
   Mediaset of Italy and Germany's Kirch Group said they would pool
$1.1 billion in assets to create a pan-European television network.
The two companies already control broadcast outlets in
German-language nations, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN TELECOM DEAL REPORTED NEAR
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and British Telecommunications are close to buying a stake
in Japan Telecom, adding a third partner to their $10 billion
alliance and speeding their entry in the Japanese market, a senior
official at the Japanese company said.
</P>
<P>
   NISSAN-RENAULT DEAL ADVANCES
</P>
<P>
   The board of Nissan Motor expects to meet March 27 to discuss
Renault's bid to buy a 35 percent stake in the company. Nissan has
been seeking a foreign investor to help it return to profitability.
DaimlerChrysler quit talks with Nissan earlier.
</P>
<P>
   SIGNS OF RECOVERY IN BRAZIL
</P>
<P>
   General Motors and Volkswagen plan to increase production in
Brazilian factories, providing signs of life in the country's
struggling auto industry. The moves suggest price-cutting and
government efforts to help sales by suspending some car taxes for
90 days are paying off. Car sales in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest
city, tripled last weekend, according to automakers, as consumers
took advantage of discounts of up to 20 percent.

   Scoodini does it again
</P>
<P>
   By Gary Nuhn
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Daily News
</P>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ He was a breech-birth baby.
</P>
<P>
   Scoonie Penn came into the world with the umbilical cord wrapped
around his neck. According to his mother, Allegra, he didn't take a
breath for four or five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I think Houdini was able to do that; a good match since now, 22
years later, Scoonie is a basketball Houdini.
</P>
<P>
   Scoodini did it again Thursday night while most of Ohio slept.
Ohio State was about to put away the jerseys when Scoonie came back
on the floor against Auburn in the NCAA South Regional semifinals
and took over as if he were Steven Spielberg walking on the set of
a movie.
</P>
<P>
   He made, by conservative count, somewhere between 17 and 47
marvelous plays in the last 10 minutes to resuscitate the Buckeyes,
dismiss Auburn and set up tonight's Regional final match with St.
John's.
</P>
<P>
   He is his mother's child, Scoonie Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Allegra grew up a great athlete in West Chester County, N.Y. It
didn't hurt that she had seven brothers, who, naturally, nicknamed
her ``Legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Legs was taking her first-born son, then known as Oonie, to the
playground by the time he was 3 or 4 to shoot around, and drilled
into his head that he could do anything he wanted if he tried hard
enough. Later, after high school games, Scoonie would come back to
the gym after taking his shower and find his mother on the floor
shooting baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Scoonie grew up fast. Without a father at home, he was the
eldest male and as such took on more responsibility than any
11-12-year-old should have.
</P>
<P>
   Allegra worked on the assembly line at a General Electric
aircraft plant and when there was overtime to be had, she couldn't
turn it down. That left Scoonie in a conflict _ he wanted to spend
all his time playing ball, yet he had a younger brother and sister
to look after.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might have been times I missed some games because of
it,'' he said. ``And I might have been mad at times. But I knew
what was best.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a two-sport star at Salem, Mass., High _ a
tailback/cornerback in football and a 30-point scorer in
basketball. ``I always liked football better,'' he said. ``But
after my sophomore year, I let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose basketball because he didn't have to find a dozen other
kids to play with him.
</P>
<P>
   After two years at Boston College, he followed his coach, Jim
O'Brien, to Ohio State, and now has propelled the Buckeyes back
from basketball's graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise. Last season, as a transfer, Scoonie was allowed to
practice with the team, but not play in games. It was like teasing
a lion by pulling raw meat along outside his cage.
</P>
<P>
   Scoonie's release was playing scrimmages, and no matter how
O'Brien mixed and matched the players, Scoonie's team usually beat
the Buckeye regulars.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his on-court contributions, Scoonie said he'd rather
be remembered in another way. ``Everybody talks about the plays,''
he said, ``but the way these guys respect me as a teammate and as a
friend is more important to me. If they look back and say that that
kid Scoonie was a great kid to play with and a great kid to be
around, that will make me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   I set up a scene for him for tonight: ``Ten seconds to go; St.
John's up by a point; you've got the ball; no timeouts. What
happens next?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shootin' it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what's the play?'' I asked. ``Where will you be?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me and laughed at my naivete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shootin' it,'' he said again.

SHAW SAYS HE'S RIGHT ON SCHEDULE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Jeff Shaw finally pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if Todd Hundley would catch a game and Gary Sheffield would
return to left field, the Dodgers would finally have their full
squad in place for an inning or so of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``More of the parts are getting involved,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, the Dodgers closer who missed most of spring training
while awaiting the birth of his third child, pitched an inning,
threw 28 pitches and gave up a pair of unearned runs Friday against
the New York Mets. Not that anything outside the number of pitches
means much.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan was for Shaw to throw mostly fastballs, but
after a pair of runners reached on errors, he mixed in some
sliders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to say his velocity was as good as it was at the
end as when he started,'' pitching coach Charlie Hough said. ``He
was eight inches higher than he would like to be. He threw probably
10 more pitches than would have been preferred, but he's an awfully
good competitor out there.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Washington Court House, Ohio, for nearly a month of
spring training, Shaw kept in shape by throwing on the side.
Ideally, Shaw said he'll throw every other day in spring training
and work 12 to 15 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at some of the other guys in the league, they've
only got two or three innings, so I'm not that far behind,'' said
Shaw, who had 48 saves with the Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds last
season. ``I feel like I'm ahead, like I'm right where I need to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Spring-training decision delayed: The Dodgers are expected to
delay the announcement of a possible move to Arizona for spring
training. The decision was originally supposed to be made by the
end of March as to whether or not they would leave Dodgertown for a
new facility.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano said it's taking longer
than anticipated for the city of Vero Beach and Indian River County
to gather information into purchasing Dodgertown from the team and
then leasing it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can guarantee it's not going to be made by March 31,''
Graziano said. ``I would say the decision would come in the middle
of April or the end of April.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are examining a move to the Fort McDowell Indian
Reservation northeast of Phoenix, which would end a 51-year
partnership of Vero Beach and the club-owned Dodgertown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can wait a reasonable amount of time,'' Graziano said. ``We
need to keep our finger on the pulse of it. As long as they're
working hard on it, and we think they are, then we'll wait. It
takes time when the state is involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fort McDowell Indian Community said it's willing to build a
$30 million complex for the Dodgers, complete with cloverleaf
practice fields and a 12,500-seat stadium.
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: Utility infielder Juan Castro played
shortstop late in the game, his first appearance since being
sidelined with a thigh strain March 7. . . . Third baseman Adrian
Beltre left the game after the top of the first inning when he felt
a twinge in his left groin while running to second on a double.
``It happened a week ago, but it's nothing serious,'' Beltre said.
He's expected to rest today and return to action Sunday, Johnson
said. . . . Johnson said he didn't expect Sheffield, nursing a sore
right shoulder, to return to action until late next week.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Libya told the United Nations Friday that it
would hand over the two suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing for
trial in the Netherlands by April 6.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time, after years of equivocation, that Libya
had set a definite date for the surrender of the two men suspected
of planning the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing 207 people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in the offer delivered by letter Friday to the
United Nations, Libya appeared to accept all the other conditions
the United States and Britain have said they wanted to see met
before they would consider lifting the economic sanctions that the
Security Council imposed on Libya in 1992 because of its refusal to
surrender the two men.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan move followed months of mediation by South Africa and
Saudi Arabia and a declaration last month by the United States and
Britain that Libya could be subjected to even tougher sanctions if
it did not turn the men over by March 26.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter to the United Nations, Libya's leader, Col.
Moammar Gadhafi, agreed that the suspects would be tried by
Scottish judges sitting in the Netherlands. Any prison sentences
imposed would be served in a Scottish jail under U.N. supervision.
Libya would post a consul to Scotland who would have free access to
the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan offer was first disclosed earlier Friday by President
Nelson Mandela of South Africa, who has acted as a mediator in the
dispute, during a speech in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
</P>
<P>
   It was also conveyed in the letter delivered to the U.N.
secretary-general, Kofi Annan, by Libya's representative, Abuzed
Omar Dorda, who said it contained all the points made by Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Dorda confirmed that the two suspects, Libyan intelligence
agents Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, would
be handed over to the secretary-general or his representative.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British diplomats expressed satisfaction with President
Mandela's account of the Libyan offer but made plain that after so
many years of Libyan evasion, that nothing short of the surrender
of the two men would satisfy them.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration would take a close look at the
letter, a State Department spokesman said, but added that, ``What
we are going to be looking for is the actual turnover of the
suspects.'' Annan welcomed Mandela's announcement in a statement by
his spokesman, saying, ``The secretary-general is greatly
encouraged by this development and the necessary arrangements will
now be initiated by the Secretariat.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan thanked Mandela, as well as Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi
Arabia, who also served as a mediator with Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Mandela, apparently reading from a copy of the letter
to Annan, said on Libyan television that Gadhafi would ``ensure
that the two suspects would be available for the secretary-general
of the United Nations to take custody of them on or before 6 April
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``we are particularly hopeful that these
undertakings will put the secretary-general in a position to
expedite his report to the Security Council to have sanctions
against Libya finally lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter goes on to say that Libya expects economic sanctions
to be suspended as soon as the two suspects reach the Netherlands.
They are to be lifted permanently 90 days later if Annan has
reported to the Security Council that Libya has complied fully with
all demands.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Libya also affirms its opposition to ``all forms
of terrorism'' and pledges ``cooperation with the investigation,
the procedures and trial within the framework of Libyan laws and
legislation.'' And it offers to pay compensation to the victims'
families if the suspects are convicted.
</P>
<P>
   But in return, Libya requested that the Security Council adopt a
resolution making the terms of this agreement binding on all
parties to the dispute _ possibly because it fears that the United
States or Britain, as permanent Security Council members, might
veto the lifting of sanctions after the suspects are surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Friday night whether the Security Council would
go along with this request. But Dorda insisted Friday that this was
not a new Libyan condition for surrendering the suspects, but just
something that it favored.
</P>
<P>
   Libya had long resisted handing over the suspects, insisting
they would not get a fair trial in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Britain and the United States agreed to Libyan
proposals for a trial in a third country. Libya said it would be
willing to turn over the men over for a trial by Scottish judges in
the Netherlands, but then sought assurances that sanctions would
actually be lifted, and that the men, if convicted, would not serve
their prison sentences in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Gadhafi told the Libyan Parliament that Libya had
received ``all the guarantees'' it needed through South Africa and
Saudi Arabia.

DOES JOHNSON HAVE BEST JOB AROUND?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ If power were muscle, Davey Johnson's biceps
would rip apart his Dodgers shirtsleeves.
</P>
<P>
   If power were money, he'd need a blue-and-white money belt for
his walking-around cash.
</P>
<P>
   If power really were the ultimate aphrodisiac, he'd have to
fight 'em off with a Louisville Slugger.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Davey Johnson, beginning his fourth major-league
managing job, might be the most powerful man in a baseball uniform
anywhere this spring.
</P>
<P>
   He has a track record _ managing division champions in six of 10
full seasons _ that commands respect from his bosses, his players
and the press.
</P>
<P>
   He has a ``high-maintenance'' reputation _ the result of
contentious stints with the Mets, Reds and Orioles _ that could
intimidate his employers and staff.
</P>
<P>
   He has the security of a contract that guarantees him $1.5
million for each of three Dodgers seasons. He has the likelihood of
a one-year honeymoon while Dodgers critics focus on big-spending,
bold-talking general manager Kevin Malone.
</P>
<P>
   And he has all that in Los Angeles, where there's a chance to
put the National League's highest-profile franchise in the playoff
win column for the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dodgers' front office, there's a feeling that if the
club's baseball power structure is a pyramid, in any practical
sense it's Johnson who stands at the top. Malone figures it's more
like him and Johnson side by side at the top _ but that sounds like
a concession in itself, seeing that the GM is first among the
baseball men on the Dodgers masthead, while the manager isn't
actually listed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a marriage,'' is how Malone described the
semi-equal partnership. Will it be a happy marriage?
</P>
<P>
   Malone wonders why the question keeps coming up, maintaining
that the men got along fine in the two seasons they both worked for
the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to me to make the final decisions most of the time. I
have to make the decisions because of my position,'' Malone said.
``But I learned a long time ago that I'm only as good as the people
who surround me. I want my people opinionated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the `No Fear' thing that if you don't live on the
edge, you're taking up space. You have to take risks. You have to
take chances. If you surround yourself with people with strong
opinions, you're going to have differences of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have to look at the big picture. I've got one eye on
the present and one eye on the future. He's (the manager) got both
eyes on the present. That's his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both are opinionated, but we'll try to do what it takes to
win. We might have differences of opinion, but we'll figure out the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When their opinions clash, it will be Johnson who gets the first
chance to sway the public. He's the one with the postgame quotes,
the one with the winner's credentials. Malone, less familiar to
most reporters and fans, is still establishing his credibility in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson learned to use the media when he managed the Mets for
seven seasons in New York, where it's use or get used. He seemed to
learn something when he managed the Orioles for three seasons in
the shadow of Washington, D.C., where the White House staff crafts
a Message of the Day.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, however subtly, often delivers a Message of the Day to
the Dodgers beat writers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday in Kissimmee, Fla., the message was that 21-year-old Onan
Masaoka had pitched himself into contention for a left-handed
relief job even though ``the organization wants him to start in
Double-A.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday it was about the value of infielder Jose Vizcaino,
whose future with the team is the subject of front-office
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday it was about the mound ``presence'' of pitcher Ismael
Valdes, whose intangible qualities are frequently questioned and
who is often rumored to be trade bait.
</P>
<P>
   And when Johnson talks baseball, who wouldn't listen? His new
players know he's a 43-home-run second baseman who's been there _
and there and there _ as a manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, they had a ballclub with a lot of talent that
couldn't get to the next level. Boom _ he came in and got them
there (winning the 1986 World Series),'' said Dodgers first baseman
Eric Karros. ``In Cincinnati, they had a good ballclub, a good
bunch of guys, but couldn't get over the hump. He came in and they
won (two division titles). Same in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done it three times in situations very similar to this.''
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson does it again with the Dodgers, who open the season
April 5, of course Malone will deserve half the credit, at least
half. But Malone's huge payroll and only half-joking prediction of
a World Series have made him the target of Dodgers-haters. That
means if the team falls short, the question will be, ``Malone spent
$86 million for !ital!this?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Johnson, either he wins or it's the GM's fault. That's a
nice spot to be in. That's power.

CLINTON SEES SEX SCANDAL AS A FOOTNOTE IN HISTORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to shake any pall left from his impeachment,
President Clinton predicted Friday that lies he told in the
sex-and-perjury scandal would be a minor notation in the box score
of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference dominated by tensions in the Balkans,
Clinton acknowledged ``working hard'' on his marriage, sidestepped
a sexual abuse allegation from 21 years ago and defended his policy
of engagement with China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied looking the other way on allegations that China
stole weapons secrets from the United States or that his
administration was slow to deal with security lapses at the
nation's nuclear laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that we in the White House have done what we
could to be aggressive about this,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   In his first full-scale White House news conference since April
30, Clinton responded to most inquiries from reporters whose
questions for the past year have centered on his affair with Monica
Lewinsky and efforts to conceal it.
</P>
<P>
   The president declined to discuss his personal thoughts about
the bitterly partisan impeachment trial that ended five weeks ago
with his acquittal in the Senate on perjury and obstruction of
justice charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's best for me not to focus on that now,'' says Clinton,
pointing out that he has two years left before his presidency ends.
``Any time I spend worrying about that will detract from by ability
to be an effective president.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what lesson children would learn from his admitted lies
about trysts with the former White House intern, Clinton said the
lesson is that ``even presidents'' have to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he suggested history will judge his
administration kindly despite the affair and his cover-up effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a box score, and there will be that one
negative,'' Clinton said, his voice rising as he gripped the podium
more tightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there will be the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
of times when the record will show that I did not abuse my
authority as president, that I was truthful with the American
people, and scores and scores of allegations were made against me
and widely publicized without any regard to whether they were true
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   In a slap at journalists, Clinton added: ``So I would hope that
there would be a higher regard for truth-telling by all people in
public life, and all those who report on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how his relationship was faring with first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton in the wake of the affair, the president said:
``We're working hard, and we love each other very much. And we're
working at it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton said he has ``no clue'' if his wife will
run for the Senate in 2000, but pointedly added that more than a
year ago she said they should move to New York when his presidency
is over.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined once again to discuss, or even deny,
allegations by a businesswoman that he raped her in 1978 while he
was running for attorney general in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   When Arkansas nursing home operator Juanita Broaddrick first
publicly accused Clinton of sexually assaulting her in a Little
Rock, Ark., motel room, the president referred inquiries to his
attorney, David Kendall, who called the charge ``absolutely
false.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a statement made by my attorney,'' Clinton said
when asked again why he would not at least deny the charge. ``He
speaks for me, and I think he spoke quite clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also dealt with questions about spying at U.S. nuclear
installations, a controversy fueled by the dismissal of a
Chinese-American working at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico. He was fired last week after allegations arose that nuclear
weapons secrets were given to the Chinese military some time in the
mid-1980s. China has denied any spying at the nuclear labs.
</P>
<P>
   The president denied that the administration reacted too slowly,
but at the same time acknowledged that security at the New Mexico
lab and other facilities was too weak for ``years and years and
years.''
</P>
<P>
   He denied that donations to the Democratic National Committee
from Chinese-related sources prompted a delay in investigations.
Asked if information was suppressed for political reasons, he said:
``The ... charge is simply untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress have called for a re-evaluation of U.S.
relations with the Chinese government. Clinton said U.S. ties to
China have brought about some positive developments, such as
Chinese cooperation during the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The president characterized the U.S. relationship with China as
''profoundly important, very large, and inherently frustrating,
because it has many different elements, some of which we like, some
of which we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who next week is to meet with Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, said he hopes an agreement can be reached for the
International Monetary Fund to extend Russia's credit.
</P>
<P>
   The president added that new lending to Russia will achieve its
goal only if laws are changed there to reform financial
institutions and stop money flooding out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF approved a $22.6 billion loan package to Russia in
midsummer but suspended most of the aid after the ruble was
devalued in mid-August, a move that plunged the country into a
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that will permit the IMF
program to go forward, because I think that is important,'' Clinton
said. ``But it will only work if the money does not turn around and
leave the country as soon as it is put in.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he felt betrayed by former aides George
Stephanopoulos and Dick Morris, who recently published books that
included critical accounts of his administration, the president did
not rise to the bait. Clinton said he has read neither book.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding recent ridicule aimed at Vice President Al Gore for
padding his resume with the claim he had fathered the Internet,
Clinton said that the vice president had been ``one of the major
architects for America's progress in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Gore has been ``integral to the good things'' of
the administration, adding that he has been too ``reticent'' to
brag about his accomplishments. ``I'll be happy to toot his horn,''
the president said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton praised Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and
expressed hope that he would remain in the Cabinet, despite rumors
that the former Wall Street investment banker is eager to leave
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has not issued a direct denial when asked about the
rumors.

CLINTON'S CONSOLATION: DONATIONS TO PARTY SURGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - WRITETHRU-NYT  
 (Eds.: Subs grafs 5, 6 and 11 with additional reporting)   
 (ATTN: Colo., N.J., Texas, Ark., Calif., Fla., Ohio, Nev., N.H. )  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's impeachment appears to have a
silver lining, or at least a green one.
</P>
<P>
   Republican efforts to remove the president from office have
prompted a spurt in campaign donations to Democratic coffers, with
much of the giving inspired by the president himself as he
crisscrosses the country, blames Republicans for trying to bring
him down and thanks his supporters for standing by him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was impeached by the House on Dec. 19 by the House
and acquitted by the Senate on Feb. 12, single-handedly has raised
more than $9 million since mid-January. He has attended more
fund-raising events this year (13) than he has held Cabinet
meetings (1) or met with foreign heads of state (7).
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very big draw, probably our biggest ever,'' said Roy
Romer of Colorado, general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. ``When they see him being attacked in a partisan way as
he was all last year, people rise up and say, `I'm coming to the
table with twice what I gave before.' Receipts are double what we
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic fund-raiser agreed. ``The impeachment,'' he said,
``has energized donors.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, aides to Romer said that by this time in 1998, an
election year, the president had raised $4 million for the national
committee alone through his attendance at 11 events, nearly double
the six DNC fund-raisers he has had to attend this year to raise
the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   Romer said that Democrats were in ``Alamo syndrome,'' which he
described as fighting back against attacks on the president. As a
recent direct-mail letter from the committee to prospective donors
put it: ``Now is the time for key Democrats to rally around the
president and our party. Otherwise, nothing stands in the way of
the GOP's slash-and-burn tactics. The last Congress focused almost
entirely on investigating instead of legislating.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight weeks, Clinton has raised money for all three
Democratic campaign committees, those of the national party, the
Senate committee and the House committee. He has helped raise money
for two state parties, in New Hampshire and Arkansas, and for two
members of Congress. In one evening earlier this month he brought
in $2 million for Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey
Democrat, who prominently defended him during the impeachment
process. Torricelli is not up for re-election until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, two Democratic fundraisers said that the president
raised ``very little'' money in the first few months of 1997,
estimating that the first quarter's total was less than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The president's calendar is chock-a-block with more events, and
aides say it will only become more crowded as the 2000 campaign
draws closer. He is scheduled to attend Democratic National
Committee fundraisers next week in Cincinnati, Las Vegas and Los
Angeles. Two weeks later he heads for lunch in Detroit and dinner
in Boston to raise money for a joint committee promoting Senate and
House candidates in 2000. That committee alone is scheduling
Clinton for about eight more events this year, with a goal of his
personally bringing in $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans typically raise more than Democrats, and Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said this
committee alone had raised about the same amount this year as the
president had for all Democratic committees. By other gauges,
though, the president's collection of cash has been extraordinary.
Two Democratic fund-raisers estimated Friday that in the first
quarter of 1997, the last non-election year, Clinton raised less
than $2 million, not even one-fourth of what he has amassed in the
last nine weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Such a frenzy of fundraising is unusual for a lame-duck
president. ``He's out raising money like he's running for another
term,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a public
policy group. ``With all the fundraising the president keeps doing,
it may well be that Clinton's legacy is going to be as the greatest
big-money fundraiser in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton speaks at these events, usually for 10 or 15
minutes after dinner, he frequently strays to topics like his
political survival. At the Torricelli dinner, where singer Gloria
Gaynor entertained the crowd, Clinton joked that he was trying to
decide which of her anthems to take as his theme song: ``I Will
Survive,'' or ``Never Can Say Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   His purpose, aides say, is to thank supporters for sticking by
him, to repay what aides describe as his personal debt to members
of Congress who defended him, and, increasingly, to make a point of
what he perceives as his persecution by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, he pulled in half a million dollars for the
Democratic National Committee at a fundraising dinner in Stuart,
Fla.. After the Drifters sang their paean to loyalty, ``Stand By
Me,'' the president said: ``I thought about how the American people
have stood by me through thick and thin. This country has got to
get over believing that our political life is about beating each
other up and hurting people instead of lifting people up and
bringing them together.''
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke Tuesday in Florida, he took with him two
Democratic congressmen from the area, Reps. Peter Deutsch, who may
run for the Senate seat being vacated by Republican Connie Mack,
and Alcee L. Hastings, a former federal judge who, Clinton pointed
out, had been impeached in 1988 and removed from the bench. Unbowed
by his impeachment, Hastings went on to run for public office and
win a seat in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Gary, a Florida trial lawyer who was the host for the
event, said that the donors, many of them African-American, found
the president an inspiration. ``He has refused to be denied, he has
been down but not out, he has been a fighter, and has had, as we
say in the church, to climb the rough side of the mountain,'' Gary
said. ``When you see all he's been through and that he never
considered throwing the towel in, that's inspiration for a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent the previous weekend in his hometown of Little
Rock, Ark., where he helped raise money at a state party dinner
featuring former Sen. Dale Bumpers, who gave the closing speech
last month in Clinton's impeachment trial. He also visited
Texarkana, Texas, where he raised $500,000 for Rep. Max Sandlin,
who served as a deputy whip during Clinton's impeachment in the
House in December and helped hold the Democrats together.
</P>
<P>
   At these events and others, the word ``impeachment'' did not
pass from the president's lips. Instead, he used the word
``Constitution'' as code to convey his argument that his lying
about his affair with a White House intern did not rise to an
impeachable offense as described in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time in the last year when a lot of people just worried
which way the political winds were blowing,'' Clinton said at the
$1,000-per-person dinner for Sandlin, ``that guy was telling people
to read the Constitution of the United States of America.'' The
audience responded with a big applause.

HOFFA CLEARED TO TAKE HELM OF TEAMSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge cleared the way Friday for James
Hoffa to be sworn in as president of the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters, 32 years after his famous father took the helm of the
powerful truckers' union.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Judge David Edelstein of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan rejected the remaining appeals that had delayed
certification of Hoffa's election in December.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling cleared the way for a federal election monitor,
Michael Cherkasky, to certify the election. On Friday night, just
hours after Edelstein's ruling, Cherkasky telephoned Hoffa's lawyer
with the official certification, clearing the way for Hoffa to take
the union oath of office in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hoffa had won an overwhelming victory on Dec. 7, he was
unable to take the helm of the 1.4 million-member union, delayed by
numerous challenges to the election. For more than a month, several
of Hoffa's top aides have been working to put policies and
procedures in place so that Hoffa can start running the union as
soon as he is sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Edelstein rejected an appeal by Hoffa's main
challenger, Tom Leedham, that the certification of Hoffa's election
be delayed indefinitely while a court-appointed oversight board
weighed charges filed against three of the 19 vice presidential
candidates elected on the Hoffa slate.
</P>
<P>
   One Hoffa vice president was charged with violating campaign
gift rules, another with filing false campaign finance reports and
a third with financial improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   Leedham, who received 39 percent of the vote to Hoffa's 55
percent, also asserted that certification of Hoffa should wait
until the review board issued a report on its investigation of
Hoffa, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing by the board.
</P>
<P>
   With Leedham arguing that the election monitor should screen
Hoffa's character _ and those of his running mates _ before
deciding whether to certify him, Edelstein ruled that Cherkasky
could rule only on election violations.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters are subject to a complex system of federal
oversight as part of a consent decree that the union signed in 1989
to settle a federal civil racketeering case, in which the union was
accused of having a ``devil's pact'' with the mob.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Edelstein upheld a decision ordering a new election
for a Teamsters vice president, J.D. Potter of Texas, whom
Cherkasky had barred from running.

GORDON ON POLE, BUT BENSON OFF HOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Jeff Gordon says he won the pole for the
TranSouth Financial 400 with ``an unbelievable lap'' at 173.167 mph
at Darlington Raceway yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Then what can be said about the lap rung up by Johnny Benson?
</P>
<P>
   Mired in a season kindly described as mediocre, Benson toured
the treacherous 1.366-mile oval at 172.541 mph to claim the outside
starting position in the two-car front row.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more like it,'' said Benson, who came into this event
having qualified 39th, 37th, 26th and 36th in 1999. Those starts
produced finishes of 17th, 16th, 38th and 22nd in the No. 26
Cheerios Ford Taurus owned by Jack Roush.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Benson's job security has become fodder for
the early season NASCAR Winston Cup rumor mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying as hard as we can, and there's no doubt
we've struggled,'' said Benson, who is winless in 98 career Cup
starts. ``We need some good runs. I thought last week we were gonna
qualify good \Rat Atlanta Motor Speedway\S and I went for it and
ended up bad. This week Jack said, `What are you gonna do?' And I
said, `Well, maybe we'll just go for a good, solid run.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of looked at me and I thought, `Well, I might change
my mind on pit road.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Good thinking. Benson ultimately posted his best qualifying
effort since starting second at Rockingham, N.C., in November. His
hot lap also marked the first time he has qualified in the first
round during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good, solid run for us,'' said Benson, who is in his
second season with Roush Racing. ``We needed it, and hopefully, we
can just get it race-ready and race good this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson's run was only the start of the headline news for Team
Roush, as four of its five drivers earned top-10 positions. Mark
Martin qualified third at 171.878 mph in the repainted No. 6 Zerex
Ford; Kevin Lepage (171.764) will start seventh in the No. 16
Primestar Ford; and Jeff Burton (171.638) earned the ninth position
in the No. 99 Exide Batteries Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just super,'' said Roush, who added that Benson and
Lepage needed good runs ``real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, Mark was real steady,'' Roush said of his ace. ``We
thought we had a shot at the pole, but that 24 car \RGordon\S is
just incredible right now. It's awful hard to do anything with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, winner of the Cracker Barrel 500 at AMS on Sunday,
bagged his 25th career pole and second in 13 races at the track
``Too Tough to Tame.'' Gordon, who also won the pole for the
Daytona 500 (and the race), is the first two-time pole winner of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the prettiest lap, but when you're running that fast
you want to be able to keep it on the edge,'' said Gordon, driver
of the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
``These guys \Rat Hendrick Motorsports\S hit the chassis and engine
combination just right, and I hit all my marks on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if a lap can ever be perfect, but the car was
unbelievably good. It did everything I wanted it to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, meanwhile, authored his sixth consecutive top-10
qualifying effort at Darlington, which is NASCAR's oldest
superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   Series points leader Mike Skinner maintained his impressive pace
by qualifying fourth at 171.890 mph in the No. 31 Lowe's Chevy. It
was the fourth consecutive top-10 qualifying effort of 1999 for
Skinner, who leads injured runner-up Bobby Labonte by 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth starting spot was claimed by John Andretti at 171.782
mph in the No. 43 STP Pontiac Grand Prix. It was Andretti's best
effort since he started fourth in the Pepsi Southern 500 here last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The top 25 positions were locked in yesterday, with the
remainder of the 43-car field to be determined today.

JARVIS SURPRISED BY SPEED OF ST. JOHN'S SUCCESS  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Who is this team in the St. John's uniforms
that is on the verge of going to the Final Four, and where has it
hidden the group that stumbled through the end of the regular
season just two weeks ago?
</P>
<P>
   St. John's run to the South Regional final of the NCAA
tournament against Ohio State on Saturday night seemed unlikely
back in October, when the walls in coach Mike Jarvis' office were
still bare. It seemed even more improbable when the Red Storm
limped into Orlando, Fla., last week, reeling from a 21-point
beating by Connecticut in the Big East tournament final.
</P>
<P>
   With just one more victory, St. John's will go to the Final Four
for the first time since 1985, when it was propelled by Chris
Mullin, Walter Berry and Bill Wennington.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jarvis conceded last week that when players asked him on
the first day of practice if he thought they could go all the way,
it was a bit of wishful thinking when he replied that certainly,
yes, they could win it all.
</P>
<P>
   Only a group as confident as this one could have believed that a
team that lost its two leading scorers _ one of whom was a
first-round draft pick in the NBA _ had a freshman point guard, a
new coach and a new offensive system could perform so well that it
would hand Indiana its worst tournament loss and dismantle a
Maryland team that many thought could have received a No. 1
seeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I would have said a minimum of a year away,'' Jarvis
said, ``probably three or four players away providing the majority
of players stayed. I would say it would have taken another year for
them to become more comfortable with what I would like them to do.
For us to be talking here, 40 minutes away. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis was proven wrong because his team raised the quality of
its game several notches during the NCAA tournament. Since that
loss to Connecticut, the Red Storm (28-8) has played intelligent,
cohesive basketball, slowly, methodically squeezing the life out of
its opponents with nearly flawless play. The players have bought
into Jarvis' demand that they be open to adjustments, and their
defense, in all its incarnations, has been superb, limiting three
opponents to 33.9 percent shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The offense has been smooth and efficient, with no one player
dominating, except perhaps Erick Barkley, with his stellar passing
skills and unflappability in the face of pressure. St. John's has
shot 48.7 percent in the tournament and has had 77 assists on 158
field goals.
</P>
<P>
   The victory over Samford, with its Princeton-style offense,
required discipline and patience. The victory over Indiana required
the willingness to believe Jarvis when he said that the unfamiliar,
distasteful zone defense would work. And the victory over Maryland
required the confidence that St. John's had the ball handlers to
neutralize the Terrapins' press and that the same aggressive zone
defense would work again. St. John's won the three games by an
average of 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to change the tenor of this season _ from
multiple near misses against top five teams to the total domination
of Maryland _ the players say is rooted in late-season losses to
Villanova and Connecticut. After those games, Jarvis said, his
players discovered what was needed to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing for 40 minutes instead of 20 minutes here and
there,'' center Tyrone Grant said. ``In the post-season, teams play
for 40 minutes. That taught us a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also taught us that we've got to continue to attack the way
we were early in the season, and it would wear our opponents
down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The last three opponents have been worn down so early in the
games that, in the space of a week, St. John's has gone from shaky
to superlative. Against fourth-seeded Ohio State _ a team that is
using one of the nation's best backcourts to fashion its own
meteoric rise from the basement of the Big Ten _ the Red Storm is
favored.
</P>
<P>
   After winning just one game in the Big Ten last season and
enduring a 17-game losing streak along the way, second-year coach
Jim O'Brien _ who left Boston College two years ago after a
disagreement with the school's admissions officials _ has crafted a
remarkable recovery. Ohio State (26-8) finished second in the Big
Ten to Michigan State largely on the strength of its two
spectacular guards, Scoonie Penn and Michael Redd, who combined for
48 of Ohio State's 72 points in a victory over Auburn on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the perception of the Buckeyes is that while Penn (16.9
points) and Redd (19.6 points) are superb, the rest of the team is
no bigger than St. John's and is not as gifted as the Red Storm,
allowing St. John's to key on the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been concerned about it all year,'' O'Brien said.
``Teams have attempted to take Scoonie and Michael out all year.
We've been fortunate that there hasn't been one guy who has stepped
up to be the third or fourth scorer but several guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I had my druthers, I'd rather have five guys in double
figures than two guys averaging 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Penn and Redd have slight edges at their positions over
Barkley and Bootsy Thornton. But those advantages are not as great
as the ones Lavor Postell should have over Brian Brown, a guard
from Brooklyn who has been in the starting lineup at forward for
the first time all season, and that Ron Artest should have over
Jason Singleton, a 6-foot-6-inch, 190-pound forward.
</P>
<P>
   Even at center, the 6-7, 240-pound Grant has been able to handle
bigger players, like the slight 6-11, 225-pound Ken Johnson, who
averages just 6.3 points per game for Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two teams are much more similar than Maryland was,''
Jarvis said. ``They're both team oriented. They're both undersized,
but don't tell them that. And the kids believe. It's going to be a
matter of will more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   And St. John's has already shown plenty of that in this
tournament. &QL;

TEXAS LAW STUDENT TAKES HER SCHOOL TO COURT 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Wendy Anderson moved from Austin to Houston in 1997 to
enroll at the South Texas College of Law, but she is now getting a
legal education she never bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is representing herself in a lawsuit she recently filed
against the school over its academic policy. She claims the school
deceived her about how much time she would have to bring her grade
point average up to 2.0 if she experienced academic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was temporarily kicked out of the school in June 1997
because she failed to maintain a C average, according to her state
district court suit. Anderson, who could not be reached for
comment, did not flunk any classes, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   School spokeswoman Sheila Hansel said Friday that Anderson has
been readmitted to the school and is currently doing ``very well
academically.'' School officials denied Anderson has been treated
unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson claimed in the lawsuit that one reason she chose South
Texas College of Law, which is affiliated with Texas A&AMP;M
University, was because school literature assured her she would
have at least two semesters to bring her GPA up to 2.0.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks after she enrolled in January 1997, the lawsuit
said, Anderson was told for the first time that the school's policy
was to dismiss students after the first semester for failing to
maintain a 2.0 GPA. She was dismissed before completing two
semesters.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said the one-semester policy had been in effect
beginning October 1996, but the school's admissions bulletin and
policy handbook had failed to disclose the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an older student, it had been some time since I had been in
school,'' Anderson said in court papers. ``I knew that I would
potentially require a couple of semesters to familiarize myself
with analytical thinking and writing.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that if she had been told of the policy she would not
have chosen the South Texas College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson filed suit in January seeking at least $50,000 in
actual damages as well as unspecified exemplary damages. She also
wants a court order ``expunging any evidence of previously
attending law school and their corresponding grades.''
</P>
<P>
   She claims that as a result of being temporarily kicked out of
school, she ``suffered intense feelings of humiliation and
belittlement, an abnormal sense of inferiority and accompanying
panic attacks, and loss of sleep and appetite.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said most U.S. law schools allow students two
semesters to bring their GPAs up to a minimum level.
</P>
<P>
   School spokeswoman Hansel said she did not have information
Friday on what type of school literature prospective students
received at the time Anderson applied.
</P>
<P>
   A letter written to Anderson by the school's general counsel
Jerry Thorn in December 1997 that was included in court records
said Anderson's legal claims were ``not applicable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The College wishes you to understand that it values you as a
student,'' Thorn wrote to Anderson. ``It appreciates the efforts
that you have put forth to this date in getting yourself ready for
law school and then attending and hopes that you continue on this
course.''

UCLA MUST STOP HAMMON TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They sat at a table on an elevated podium inside
the Sports Arena and said all the right things: how they're happy
to be here at the NCAA West Regional, how they respect their
opponent, how it will be a great game.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, the UCLA and Colorado State women's basketball
teams tipped their hands. The teams' focus is clear as they prepare
for tonight's 9:30 p.m. game.
</P>
<P>
   During UCLA's 30 minutes on the dais, nearly all the talk was
about Colorado State All-American point guard Becky Hammon, what
she can do and how to stop her.
</P>
<P>
   When someone finally asked about the rest of the 33-2 Rams, UCLA
coach Kathy Olivier had to think about the question for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope I don't screw up the name,'' she began before mentioning
forward Katie Cronin by last name. ``Cronin, she's very talented.
She can shoot well. You can tell she's the other leader on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State followed the Bruins in the press conference and
the dominant talk was about the Rams' size disadvantage, and how to
stop UCLA's post duo of Maylana Martin and Janae Hubbard, who
helped the Bruins (25-7) win their first Pac-10 title.
</P>
<P>
   When coach Tom Collen was asked how his team will defend, he
said the players prefer to press and create an up-tempo offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be to our advantage to go up-tempo,'' he said. ``It's
not to their disadvantage, but we don't want to play a halfcourt
game with them.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, it appears UCLA has the advantage. Martin, a
6-foot-3, third-team All-American, and the 6-4 Hubbard combine for
31 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State doesn't have anyone taller than 6-3, and Marsha
Tate doesn't even play in every game. Plus, the Western Athletic
Conference team with the best post game, Collen said, is Southern
Methodist _ the same Mustangs who shocked the Rams 65-49 to win the
WAC tournament. Previously, the Rams had won by seven and 17
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're big, but we're small,'' Cronin said of UCLA. ``We can
bring them out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams like to shoot from the outside, led by the 5-6 Hammon,
who averages 23 points and shoots 42 percent (111 of 265) from
3-point range. As a team, Colorado State has attempted 759 treys.
</P>
<P>
   But here again is a UCLA advantage. Point guard Erica Gomez
played with Hammon on the U.S. Jones Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being that size, you have to find some ways to score,'' Gomez
said. ``She played against people who were a lot taller, so she
knows how to get her shot up.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Bruins have a plan to stop her: Continue to rotate
defenders on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best help defense I've seen,'' Gomez said. ``A
couple of teams have good 3-point shooters in our conference.
Washington State puts up an incredible amount. Our team has gotten
better, as far as rotation goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the location of the game: 10 miles from UCLA.
Although the Bruins haven't drawn well in the postseason (the 9
p.m. starts have limited the attendance of UCLA's target group _
pre-teen girls), it's much easier and cheaper to drive to the
Sports Arena than fly from Fort Collins.

SOME OF PILFERED MASSACHUSETTS TREASURY FUNDS MAY BE INSURED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The state treasury, stung by a multimillion-dollar
theft scandal, has caught a break.
</P>
<P>
   If prosecutors can prove former deputy treasurer Robert E. Foley
pilfered $2.4 million from state coffers, not all is lost for the
taxpayers: nearly $1 million can be recovered through insurance
carried by the state on top treasury officials.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, like all state officials who handle large amounts of
cash, are bonded to cover ``dishonesty,'' including theft of the
funds they oversee. In Foley's case, the bond was for $1 million
with a $5,000 a deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to inquiries by the Globe, Treasurer Shannon P.
O'Brien Friday confirmed existence of the bonding policy for the
first time since the scandal broke in February. On Thursday, one of
her top aides informed Hanover Insurance Co., the Worcester firm
that holds the policy, of ``potential'' claims. The aide did not
tell the firm any further details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have notified our insurance company of the potential loss
and have taken the necessary steps to initiate a claim against
these policies pending the outcome of the criminal investigation,''
O'Brien said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Her spokesman, Dwight Robson, said O'Brien knew about the
policies but did not disclose that the state could recoup $1
million because she was focused on the criminal probe and
implementing new controls within the treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the criminal investigation has not been concluded, she
thought the most important step was to protect the other $25
billion under her control,'' Robson said.
</P>
<P>
   The policy covering Foley calls for immediate notification of
any potential ``dishonesty'' by the employee that could result in a
loss. Asked why it took two weeks after Foley's arrest to notify
the insurance carrier, Robson noted the time lapse was only 10
business days.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not respond to calls seeking comment. But Robson
said the Hanover had informed O'Brien's office that it was
satisfied with the timing of the notification.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, state police, working with Attorney General Thomas
F. Reilly in his probe of the treasurer's office, arrested the
39-year-old Foley and charged him with stealing $2.4 million from
the Unpaid Check Fund, an account that holds unclaimed state
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who had been hired by former state treasurer Joseph D.
Malone in 1992, was not kept on by O'Brien. He was in charge of the
cash management division and left his post in Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Malone had been under pressure from his top aides, upset at
Foley's refusal to cooperate with them, to fire him for several
years, but the former treasurer blocked the move.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged in the case is Foley's associate, Thomas Ciliberto
of Woonsocket, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has charged that Foley stole $1.6 million from the fund
in 1993 and 1994. A year later, Reilly asserts, Foley conspired
with Ciliberto to steal another $812,000 and funnel the cash to a
construction company in Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   Foley was the supervisor of John F. Trishitta, who was charged
last month with taking part in the theft of $6.5 million from the
unpaid check fund. That money was returned by his alleged
accomplice, Martin Robbins, when the probe began in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, asserting that he was acting as an ``heir finder'' on
behalf of a corporation that was owed the money, is charged with
giving Trischitta a $50,000 bribe to release the funds to him last
November.

US SPYING THREATENS N-PLANT MONITORING WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The monitoring system being installed worldwide to
ensure that nuclear power plants are not used illicitly to make
nuclear weapons materials was designed with the help of a former US
intelligence officer who allegedly rigged a similar system to spy
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure is raising fears that countries may refuse to
accept the monitoring program for fear the information will be
funneled back to the US government. And it threatens to frustrate
the efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency to broaden
its scrutiny of weapons development projects in North Korea and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The secret involvement of US intelligence agents in the UN
effort to track down hidden Iraqi nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons became a major embarrassment for the United Nations.
Disarmament specialists said the revelations could undermine one of
the pillars of US arms control policy: a decades-long campaign to
persuade countries to open their nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons facilities to international scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major setback,'' said Spurgeon Keeny, a former US
arms control negotiator who has pressed for decades for aggressive
spot checks of the world's deadliest arms stockpiles. ``Nobody who
is really cheating is going to be willing to permit intrusive,
on-site inspections. But this gives them a built-in excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The US official is a career Air Force intelligence specialist
who led a group of Americans that built the UN remote video
surveillance system to monitor Iraqi facilities capable of
developing chemical and biological weapons, according to US and UN
officials. A senior Pentagon official, voicing concern for the
official's safety, requested that his name not be published.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Ekeus, the former chief of the UN Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in Iraq, described the official as a ``creative''
troubleshooter who rigged an effective communications system under
highly difficult and hostile conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But the team, which included two CIA operatives, secretly
installed microwave eavesdropping devices into the system in the
mid-1990s that picked up Iraqi communications between military
bases throughout the country, the Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   The March 2 report was confirmed by a US source familiar with
the operation. A senior Pentagon official declined to confirm or
deny the report.
</P>
<P>
   An UNSCOM official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
described the Air Force officer as ``a loose cannon.'' Particularly
galling, the official said, was the public disclosure on an Air
Force intelligence web site of his role in analyzing raw data from
the UN monitoring system. UNSCOM demanded that the US government
remove the information, and it was taken off the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern was that it looked like this was a US operation,''
said another UNSCOM source.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe has learned that the official has since gone to Vienna
to create a low cost, remote monitoring system for the
International Atomic Energy Agency. There is no evidence that the
new system also would pick up microwave communications between
military bases.
</P>
<P>
   In an telephone interview from his office in Vienna, the
official denied that he had spied in Iraq. He said that he was
always under the scrutiny of his Iraqi handlers. He also said that
he is not spying at his new atomic agency post.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role is clean,'' he said. ``I don't do anything that is not
approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Pellaud, the Swiss deputy director general for safeguards
at the IAEA, said he believes the American.
</P>
<P>
   He said the American communications expert came to work for him
two years ago to help establish a remote monitoring system that
will enable the agency to monitor nuclear power facilities around
the globe from the organization's Vienna headquarters through video
cameras and radio sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Pellaud and other agency officials said they recently became
aware of the report that the official had spied in Iraq. But
Pellaud said the American remains a key member of the team.
</P>
<P>
   With his help, the agency has established remote monitoring
systems at nuclear power stations in Switzerland, South Africa and
Japan. And the agency is negotiating with Iran and North Korea,
both suspected by US intelligence of having sought to develop
nuclear weapons, to install similar monitoring systems in their
nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have intensified our efforts to expand the use of remote
monitoring in nuclear facilities around the world because of the
potential for cost-saving,'' said Pellaud. ``Instead of sending
inspectors, we have the privilege to have cameras permanently
installed so we can draw a picture every hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior US officials expressed concern that charges of American
spying in Iraq may prompt countries to backtrack on their
commitments to grant future access to international inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are longstanding US efforts to halt the spread of
nuclear weapons, freeze the production of scores of chemical and
biological warfare agents from Iraq to India, and eliminate
millions of gallons of dangerous nerve agent stockpiles in the
United States, Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried that some of these allegations will lead to
reluctance on the part of some countries to accept intrusive
inspections,'' a senior US official said. ``I'm worried the
credibility of some organizations will be unfairly damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the executive chairman of UNSCOM, added that the
reports of espionage was likely to heighten suspicions in other
agencies that hunt for hidden weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest nightmare of any treaty partner is that one of its
members will cheat from within,'' Butler said during a recent
speech at the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Their concerns appear to be well founded.
</P>
<P>
   Disarmament specialists and other political analysts now assume
that international inspectors from most countries, whether they are
spies or not, routinely report back to their governments on
confidential information they pick up on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain degree it's taken for granted that countries take
this information back home,'' said Eric Croddy, a chemical weapons
expert from the Monterrey Institute, a think tank specializing in
arms control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether that is a good thing or a bad thing that
our taxpayer dollars go to fund these things,'' he added. ``Many of
our spies are terrible scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador John Ritch, the US representative to the IAEA, said
that he has been ``scrupulous'' in ensuring the atomic agency's
reputation for independence remains ``pristine.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in judging the IAEA, a voluntary arms control
agency, by the standards of the UN inspection operation in Iraq, is
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider what we did in Iraq was arms control,'' he
said. ``I consider it the disarmament of a defeated aggressor.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato Kiniger-Passigli, the Italian spokesman of the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and the
IAEA's Pellaud said that while many of the agencies' inspectors
have been recruited from UNSCOM, they do not use the
confrontational tactics employed by UNSCOM, which included a covert
UN intelligence operation in its inspections.
</P>
<P>
   IAEA and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons are working with countries that are voluntarily granting
access to their nuclear and chemical facilities, the spokesmen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kiniger-Passigli said that while his organization freely accepts
offers of intelligence from its members, his organization has
imposed rigorous guidelines to ensure that inspectors don't report
sensitive information back to their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work for us and only for us,'' he insisted, referring to
the agency's 205 international inspectors.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not meant to be like this. With the single currency
comfortably in place, spring was supposed to bring a general
tidying up in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There would be radical changes to the European Union's farm
policy, a wider reform of its entire budget, and then a final
making ready to receive applicants from the east.
</P>
<P>
   With a new government firmly in place, Germany, as current
president of the EU, would hold a triumphant summit in its
once-and-future capital Berlin, on March 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of its presidency in midsummer, a new chairman of the
EU's executive, the commission, would have been chosen; a new
European Parliament would have been elected; and the way would be
clear to start serious talks to admit new members.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the EU has lost the entire commission and Germany, the
Union's biggest economic power as well as its president, has lost
its finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is, undeniably, awkward, yet good can come of all
this confusion.
</P>
<P>
   It will do so if the chance is taken to rid the EU of some of
its Mediterranean practices, exploiting the Union's more northern
balance and mores; and if Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder,
can make up his mind about what he wants to do with the new power
he holds, and then use it well.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, neither outcome is at all certain. The immediate
task is the appointment of a new commission. The trouble with the
old one was not just that its members, or at least some of them,
were complaisant about fraud, cronyism and mismanagement _ as an
independent committee found this week, making it impossible for
this lot to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   It was also that the commission's president, Jacques Santer, was
too weak to control them. The next president needs to be stronger.
For a period, someone not censured in the report, Sir Leon Brittan
perhaps, might take over. But the sooner a permanent appointment is
made, the better.
</P>
<P>
   The new president needs to be strong enough to keep his troops
in line, to command the ear of heads of government, and to have the
confidence of Euro-MPs. Italy's Romano Prodi, having squeezed Italy
into the euro, might be such a man.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament has, on the whole, come well out of this episode.
Like the Council of Ministers, it has been accruing power at the
commission's expense. Yet it too suffers from weak leadership, and
is hardly a paragon of financial rectitude.
</P>
<P>
   It needs to attend to its own faults if it is to exercise better
control over the executive, bringing to an end, in particular, its
expensive dual life in Brussels and Strasbourg. Best stick to
Brussels, even though this would require a treaty change.
</P>
<P>
   The main business before the EU is expansion. A new
inter-governmental conference will be needed to reform the Union's
institutions to accommodate its new members.
</P>
<P>
   In the light of this week's damning report, it should also
strengthen the provisions for accountability and control.
</P>
<P>
   One improvement would be to allow the president, with the
approval of the parliament, to sack individual commissioners.
Another would be to open up Council of Ministers' meetings to
public scrutiny when the ministers are legislating.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, however, the budget must be settled, and the
responsibility for that rests largely with Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin summit next week will be Schroder's first unambiguous
test. So far, he has been able to blame his government's long list
of failures on others: his Green partners, who have helped to
antagonize so many companies with their anti-nuclear and other
policies; the opposition, which has frustrated Schroder's proposed
rewriting of Germany's citizenship laws; and, most notably, his
turbulent finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, who flounced out on
March 11.
</P>
<P>
   With Lafontaine gone, the tug-of-war at the center of government
should also be gone. The Greens are cowed, at least for the moment.
And Schroder is expected to take over Lafontaine's other job, the
chairmanship of the Social Democratic Party, on April 14, leaving
him free, in theory, to pursue his politics of the ``New Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroder faces two general difficulties, however, and one
particular one.
</P>
<P>
   First, he has to show that he really has some sense of what he
wants to achieve; he has, in other words, to dismiss the impression
that he has no central values and no clear idea of how Germany, or
indeed Europe, should be run.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he has still to reform his party, which has been
subjected to none of the colonic irrigation of that other New
Middler, the British Labour Party.
</P>
<P>
   And then, unrelated to these general concerns, and perhaps even
harder to achieve, he has to cajole the other 14 members of the EU
into accepting a budgetary arrangement that makes it possible for
newcomers to join. The miserable deal reached by the Union's farm
ministers on March 11 is not encouraging.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not meant to be like this. With the single currency
comfortably in place, spring was supposed to bring a general
tidying up in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There would be radical changes to the European Union's farm
policy, a wider reform of its entire budget, and then a final
making ready to receive applicants from the east.
</P>
<P>
   With a new government firmly in place, Germany, as current
president of the EU, would hold a triumphant summit in its
once-and-future capital Berlin, on March 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of its presidency in midsummer, a new chairman of the
EU's executive, the commission, would have been chosen; a new
European Parliament would have been elected; and the way would be
clear to start serious talks to admit new members.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the EU has lost the entire commission and Germany, the
Union's biggest economic power as well as its president, has lost
its finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is, undeniably, awkward, yet good can come of all
this confusion.
</P>
<P>
   It will do so if the chance is taken to rid the EU of some of
its Mediterranean practices, exploiting the Union's more northern
balance and mores; and if Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder,
can make up his mind about what he wants to do with the new power
he holds, and then use it well.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, neither outcome is at all certain. The immediate
task is the appointment of a new commission. The trouble with the
old one was not just that its members, or at least some of them,
were complaisant about fraud, cronyism and mismanagement _ as an
independent committee found this week, making it impossible for
this lot to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   It was also that the commission's president, Jacques Santer, was
too weak to control them. The next president needs to be stronger.
For a period, someone not censured in the report, Sir Leon Brittan
perhaps, might take over. But the sooner a permanent appointment is
made, the better.
</P>
<P>
   The new president needs to be strong enough to keep his troops
in line, to command the ear of heads of government, and to have the
confidence of Euro-MPs. Italy's Romano Prodi, having squeezed Italy
into the euro, might be such a man.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament has, on the whole, come well out of this episode.
Like the Council of Ministers, it has been accruing power at the
commission's expense. Yet it too suffers from weak leadership, and
is hardly a paragon of financial rectitude.
</P>
<P>
   It needs to attend to its own faults if it is to exercise better
control over the executive, bringing to an end, in particular, its
expensive dual life in Brussels and Strasbourg. Best stick to
Brussels, even though this would require a treaty change.
</P>
<P>
   The main business before the EU is expansion. A new
inter-governmental conference will be needed to reform the Union's
institutions to accommodate its new members.
</P>
<P>
   In the light of this week's damning report, it should also
strengthen the provisions for accountability and control.
</P>
<P>
   One improvement would be to allow the president, with the
approval of the parliament, to sack individual commissioners.
Another would be to open up Council of Ministers' meetings to
public scrutiny when the ministers are legislating.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, however, the budget must be settled, and the
responsibility for that rests largely with Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin summit next week will be Schroder's first unambiguous
test. So far, he has been able to blame his government's long list
of failures on others: his Green partners, who have helped to
antagonize so many companies with their anti-nuclear and other
policies; the opposition, which has frustrated Schroder's proposed
rewriting of Germany's citizenship laws; and, most notably, his
turbulent finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, who flounced out on
March 11.
</P>
<P>
   With Lafontaine gone, the tug-of-war at the center of government
should also be gone. The Greens are cowed, at least for the moment.
And Schroder is expected to take over Lafontaine's other job, the
chairmanship of the Social Democratic Party, on April 14, leaving
him free, in theory, to pursue his politics of the ``New Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroder faces two general difficulties, however, and one
particular one.
</P>
<P>
   First, he has to show that he really has some sense of what he
wants to achieve; he has, in other words, to dismiss the impression
that he has no central values and no clear idea of how Germany, or
indeed Europe, should be run.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he has still to reform his party, which has been
subjected to none of the colonic irrigation of that other New
Middler, the British Labour Party.
</P>
<P>
   And then, unrelated to these general concerns, and perhaps even
harder to achieve, he has to cajole the other 14 members of the EU
into accepting a budgetary arrangement that makes it possible for
newcomers to join. The miserable deal reached by the Union's farm
ministers on March 11 is not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   However, the events of the past ten days have at least provided
the possibility of better outcomes. German politics should be less
confused. European politics should be more open and accountable,
less off-putting to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, time is short. If Europe's leaders are serious about
reform and about opening the way for the EU's overdue expansion,
hard decisions must be taken within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   A Berlin summit that produces just fudge and waffle will only
confirm doubters in their belief that the Union is incapable of
putting its house in order, let alone opening its doors to
newcomers. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, conventional wisdom held that Latin America would
easily weather the Asian financial storm. While economies crumbled
on one side of the Pacific, free-market reforms would pay off on
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, although Latin stock markets have recently rallied, the
outlook remains gloomy. Brazil faces its steepest economic decline
since the early 1980s. Ecuador is having its worst financial crisis
for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters expect a fall of 1.5 percent in Latin American GDP
this year; and net inflows of private foreign capital will shrink
from $80 billion in 1998 to around $50 billion. Can anything be
done to make Latin America less vulnerable and less volatile?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes. A first step is simply more of the same. Most
governments have reacted responsibly to the past year's turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   As foreign finance has dried up, governments have tightened
their fiscal belts and raised interest rates. There has been no
giving in to populism or to protectionist pressures. Maintaining
this resolve is a precondition for greater stability.
</P>
<P>
   But the region has not been uniform in its newfound virtue _ and
it is the most prudent that have fared best. Although every Latin
American country has found it more expensive to tap external
capital, those with sound budgets (such as Mexico, Peru and Chile)
have been hit less hard.
</P>
<P>
   While several countries have suffered from financial contagion
or plunging commodity prices, the biggest weaknesses have often
been self-inflicted: in particular, politically difficult fiscal
reforms have been put off for too long.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, notably, fiscal reform must mean more than simply
abiding by the recent IMF agreement. This agreement was a clever
compromise between the economically desirable and the politically
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   But, rather like a crash diet for a compulsive eater, it does
not solve the underlying problem _ and it could have unwelcome side
effects. Distortionary tax increases hurt the private sector; the
root cause of public profligacy, which is excess spending on wages
and pensions, remains untackled.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve stability, Brazil must find a more sensible tax
structure, get better control of fiscally lax state governments and
reform its public pensions.
</P>
<P>
   A second path to virtue is to be found in better risk
management. Even countries with healthy budgets could do more to
insulate themselves from capital-market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Careful debt-management strategies that avoid short-term
borrowing or the bunching of maturities and hedge against
interest-rate or exchange-rate swings should come high on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening the region's commercial banks should be another
priority. A big reason for Ecuador's current mess is its weak
banks. In a region with such a history of volatility, banks also
need quicker access to cash.
</P>
<P>
   High reserve requirements, especially against foreign borrowing,
are one option. Another is to encourage contingent arrangements
with foreign banks that guarantee limited credit lines in advance.
A third is to encourage the internationalization of the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   As Argentina has found in recent years, a bigger role for
foreign banks usually means a safer banking system.
</P>
<P>
   The other, more controversial, matter that needs attention is
exchange-rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   Pegged but adjustable currency regimes such as Brazil's have
been discredited by the recent crisis. So far, the preference has
mostly been for free floating _ witness Mexico, Brazil, even
Ecuador. But the wholly opposite notion of ``dollarization'' is
also gaining support.
</P>
<P>
   Dollarization is, in essence, merely a stronger version of the
currency boards that seem to have protected countries such as
Argentina from financial contagion.
</P>
<P>
   Even places without a currency board are already heavily
dollarized: that is, many people hold their assets in greenbacks
rather than domestic currency.
</P>
<P>
   At the first sign of trouble, investors across Latin America
tend to flee to dollars. So many countries suffer the volatility of
floating currencies without the benefits of flexibility _ for if
they try to cut interest rates or prop up their banks, their
currency tends to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   That gives dollarization its appeal. But it is not a panacea.
Important questions, such as how to create a limited lender of last
resort, need to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, which is toying with dollarization, has thought up
ingenious schemes for using seignorage revenue (returned from
America) as collateral for private credit lines.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, it will be more feasible in small, open
economies than in big, closed ones such as Brazil's, where the
consequent abnegation of monetary policy would be hugely
controversial. But it should be considered as a serious option for
some Latin American countries. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASBURY PARK, N.J. _ When Ed Gubitosa and his wife, Grace,
learned that Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band would be
providing a sneak preview of their first concert tour together in
more than a decade, they dropped everything.
</P>
<P>
   The Gubitosas, who live in Houston, would not be discouraged
simply because the two concerts, which are technically rehearsals
for a world tour, were being staged on less than three days'
notice, more than 1,600 miles away, here in the punch-drunk
seashore city where Springsteen began his career in the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   And they weren't dissuaded when Gubitosa, a 45-year-old airline
executive, called Ticketmaster from Texas and learned that all
3,000 tickets to the performances Thursday night and Friday night
had been sold in little more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   All that mattered to the Gubitosas, both natives of the Jersey
Shore, was that the concerts were a way to turn back the clock and
relive a chapter of ancient history _ theirs, ``Bruce's,'' and
Asbury Park's _ with their children, Andrew, 12, and Gina, 16.
</P>
<P>
   And so, as a freezing wind from the ocean lashed the boardwalk
outside Convention Hall on Thursday night, the family celebrated
spring break by huddling together like Dust Bowl refugees in a line
of perhaps 300 others who were ticket-deprived, hoping a few extra
tickets would be made available at the box office just before show
time, as is often the case at Springsteen concerts.
</P>
<P>
   That the Gubitosas were not among the lucky 53 people shepherded
inside the hall as the concert began did not seem to diminish their
experience. ``I'm having a blast,'' Gubitosa said this afternoon,
as he weighed joining the line again for a second night.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that kind of week in Asbury Park.
</P>
<P>
   For a small resort city that has had very little to smile about
for decades _ its once-thriving colony of 200 hotels has dwindled,
famously, to just one _ the fleeting reappearance of Springsteen
has generated a frenzy reminiscent of the days when Billie Holiday,
the Marx Brothers and Frank Sinatra came here to play, followed
generations later by The Doors, The Who and the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was lightened all the more this week by Springsteen's
decision to donate the proceeds from the two shows, which grossed
about $100,000, to four local charities.
</P>
<P>
   ''When someone like Bruce Springsteen, who has an emotional
attachment here, makes a physical investment, that's powerful,''
said Susan Maynard, the executive director of the West Side
Community Center on Dewitt Avenue, who learned from a radio report
that her social service agency had been selected to get some of the
money. ``It's a sign that good things are coming.''
</P>
<P>
   For Springsteen, who last toured the country three years ago
with a dour, acoustic set that left many fans wondering if he had
lost the desire to play rock-and-roll, the performances here
suggested that he, too, seemed eager to go back in time.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching Thursday's night show to 2 hours and 35 minutes with
no intermission, Springsteen, seemed as gleeful as a child who had
rediscovered a long-lost toy, stomping across the stage with his
guitar hoisted over his shoulder and smiling giddily at his eight
bandmates as they tuned up for an international tour that begins
next month in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   With saxophonist Clarence `Big Man' Clemons to his right and
guitarist Little Steven Van Zandt to his left, Springsteen ignored
most of the material he had recorded after 1984, the year the album
``Born in the U.S.A.'' made him a pop icon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he played chestnuts that were once known only within
the clubs of New Jersey, rockers like ``Spirit in the Night. ''
Rounding out a week in which he was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll
Hall of Fame, he also unveiled a new song, ``Land of Hope and
Dreams,'' which fuses gospel and rock to a piano line simulating
the roll of a train.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special night for us,'' he told those standing in
the audience, many of them waving cellular phones with open lines
to friends, who, like them, probably had slimmer stomachs and
fuller hairlines when they first discovered Springsteen as a
scraggly teen-ager from nearby Freehold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a rededication of our band.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what to say,'' he added, ``except that I'm real
happy.''
</P>

<P>
   Standing within arm's reach of the stage, in a venue no bigger
than a high school gym, Jeff Gimbal, 47, turned to his brother,
Jim, 42, and shouted ``He's not the only one!''
</P>
<P>
   The Gimbals, who own an educational recording company in Ocean
Township, cheered even louder when Springsteen pointed near them
and recalled where he stood as a fan when an unknown Pete Townshend
came to Convention Hall and smashed his guitars in the late 1960s;
the brothers had been there that night, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wore me out,'' Jeff Gimbal said to his brother . ``My legs
are shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it will take a lot more than a Bruce Springsteen
concert to solve Asbury Park's problems. But officials in this city
of one square mile, which owns the 69-year-old red-brick hall where
Springsteen performed, hope that the enthusiasm he generated this
week is contagious.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when he should be thinking about little other than how
to jump-start a long-stalled $800 million plan to rebuild the
shuttered waterfront, the city manager, Wilbert Russell, confessed
that he had been reduced this week to the role of a full-time
ticket broker.
</P>
<P>
   Allotted only enough tickets to sprinkle among a handful of
elected city officials, Russell said that he had turned down offers
of upward of $1,000 per ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city has been beaten down,'' Russell said. ``Asbury really
has a tainted name, with people saying `Asbury isn't what it used
to be.' I think Bruce is giving hope that a change is coming about
in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sign that Springsteen may well have begun to prime the
pump, however slowly, Chico Rouse, the general manager of the
Convention Hall and adjoining Paramount Theater, said that within
hours of Springsteen's announcement of his shows, the city had
received serious inquiries from two ``significant'' rock and pop
acts about playing Asbury Park. Rouse, whose father, Charlie,
played saxophone with Thelonious Monk, said it was too early to
name them.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that they would be a departure from some recent
billings at the hall. One was billed as March Metal Meltdown, an
extravaganza that blends professional wrestling and heavy metal
music. Another was an evening with the man who was the subject of
Robert Redford's movie ``The Horse Whisperer,'' who filled the hall
with clay six-feet deep and who demonstrated his gift by talking to
several local mounts.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd spilled out of the hall Thursday night and onto the
splintered boardwalk, the happiest man may have been George Panas.
</P>
<P>
   Panas, an immigrant from Greece, bought the circular Howard
Johnson's on the boardwalk in 1961, at a time when the line spilled
out the door all day, every day, during the summer. Now, Panas only
opens his restaurant when there is an event at the hall, but even
then, he, his wife and their daughter don't see the crowd that they
saw last night: nearly 1,000 people passed through their doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, this will again be one of the great towns,''
Panas, 67, said from behind the bustling counter. ``Like
Disneyland.''

 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, conventional wisdom held that Latin America would
easily weather the Asian financial storm. While economies crumbled
on one side of the Pacific, free-market reforms would pay off on
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, although Latin stock markets have recently rallied, the
outlook remains gloomy. Brazil faces its steepest economic decline
since the early 1980s. Ecuador is having its worst financial crisis
for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters expect a fall of 1.5 percent in Latin American GDP
this year; and net inflows of private foreign capital will shrink
from $80 billion in 1998 to around $50 billion. Can anything be
done to make Latin America less vulnerable and less volatile?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes. A first step is simply more of the same. Most
governments have reacted responsibly to the past year's turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   As foreign finance has dried up, governments have tightened
their fiscal belts and raised interest rates. There has been no
giving in to populism or to protectionist pressures. Maintaining
this resolve is a precondition for greater stability.
</P>
<P>
   But the region has not been uniform in its newfound virtue _ and
it is the most prudent that have fared best. Although every Latin
American country has found it more expensive to tap external
capital, those with sound budgets (such as Mexico, Peru and Chile)
have been hit less hard.
</P>
<P>
   While several countries have suffered from financial contagion
or plunging commodity prices, the biggest weaknesses have often
been self-inflicted: in particular, politically difficult fiscal
reforms have been put off for too long.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, notably, fiscal reform must mean more than simply
abiding by the recent IMF agreement. This agreement was a clever
compromise between the economically desirable and the politically
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   But, rather like a crash diet for a compulsive eater, it does
not solve the underlying problem _ and it could have unwelcome side
effects. Distortionary tax increases hurt the private sector; the
root cause of public profligacy, which is excess spending on wages
and pensions, remains untackled.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve stability, Brazil must find a more sensible tax
structure, get better control of fiscally lax state governments and
reform its public pensions.
</P>
<P>
   A second path to virtue is to be found in better risk
management. Even countries with healthy budgets could do more to
insulate themselves from capital-market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Careful debt-management strategies that avoid short-term
borrowing or the bunching of maturities and hedge against
interest-rate or exchange-rate swings should come high on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening the region's commercial banks should be another
priority. A big reason for Ecuador's current mess is its weak
banks. In a region with such a history of volatility, banks also
need quicker access to cash.
</P>
<P>
   High reserve requirements, especially against foreign borrowing,
are one option. Another is to encourage contingent arrangements
with foreign banks that guarantee limited credit lines in advance.
A third is to encourage the internationalization of the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   As Argentina has found in recent years, a bigger role for
foreign banks usually means a safer banking system.
</P>
<P>
   The other, more controversial, matter that needs attention is
exchange-rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   Pegged but adjustable currency regimes such as Brazil's have
been discredited by the recent crisis. So far, the preference has
mostly been for free floating _ witness Mexico, Brazil, even
Ecuador. But the wholly opposite notion of ``dollarization'' is
also gaining support.
</P>
<P>
   Dollarization is, in essence, merely a stronger version of the
currency boards that seem to have protected countries such as
Argentina from financial contagion.
</P>
<P>
   Even places without a currency board are already heavily
dollarized: that is, many people hold their assets in greenbacks
rather than domestic currency.
</P>
<P>
   At the first sign of trouble, investors across Latin America
tend to flee to dollars. So many countries suffer the volatility of
floating currencies without the benefits of flexibility _ for if
they try to cut interest rates or prop up their banks, their
currency tends to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   That gives dollarization its appeal. But it is not a panacea.
Important questions, such as how to create a limited lender of last
resort, need to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, which is toying with dollarization, has thought up
ingenious schemes for using seignorage revenue (returned from
America) as collateral for private credit lines.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, it will be more feasible in small, open
economies than in big, closed ones such as Brazil's, where the
consequent abnegation of monetary policy would be hugely
controversial. But it should be considered as a serious option for
some Latin American countries. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A PRESIDENT RE-EMERGES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 20:
</P>
<P>
   At his first full-dress news conference in 11 turbulent months,
President Clinton showed Friday what normalcy could be like. It was
not especially newsworthy, which may have been a White House
objective.
</P>
<P>
   Extremely cautious when discussing China and animated in
outlining his economic program, the president referred many times
to his 22 months left in office. But he also hinted that he had
begun thinking about the more distant future, which could include
living in New York. There was almost no talk of confrontation with
the Republicans and no real moral or intellectual engagement with
the conduct that brought about his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   All told, from Clinton's point of view things went smoothly,
leaving no reason for him not to return to a normal schedule of
press conferences in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the session was dominated by news from overseas, the
arena in which a president in his last two years of office can
often make the most difference. Even at his most combative, in
warning the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, of NATO military
action in Kosovo, Clinton sounded logical and convincing but not
especially bellicose.
</P>
<P>
   His comments were limited and self-protective in denying that
the administration had been slow to recognize possible Chinese
espionage. For obvious reasons, he emphasized that such activity
had been going on for ``years and years and years'' _ that is,
before he took office. He defended continuing engagement with both
China and Russia, but in a manner more businesslike than
passionate.
</P>
<P>
   A lot more passion came into play when Clinton sounded
determined to leave as his legacy the shoring up of Social Security
and Medicare, as well as the national savings rate. But there was
also a wistful valedictory tone that The Times' John Broder has
observed in many of Clinton's recent public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke of the loyalty of ``the overwhelming
majority'' of his staff, an obvious slap at memoirists like George
Stephanopoulos. He spoke of a final ``box score'' that would make
his lying look like a more proportional part of his record. And he
seemed enthusiastic about the possibility of his wife, Hillary,
serving in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   By passing up most but not all opportunities to address the
scandals of the last year, Clinton was understandably trying to
turn the page. In defending his foreign and domestic policies, he
seemed to go out of his way not to challenge his Republican
critics, particularly those who worry about intervention in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cogent performance, making it clear that Clinton needs
to resume a regular conversation with the nation, and that he
probably can. &QL;

   IRVINE _ There is nothing quite like the peace dividend for
creating civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that the citizens of Orange County, Calif.,
would relish the chance of getting their hands on 4,700 acres of
prime property, particularly when a single acre in the area can
fetch as much as $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the decommissioning of the El Toro Marine Corps Air
Station has created the biggest row in the county for decades. It
has set neighbors against neighbors, Republicans against
Republicans, the filthy rich against the disgustingly affluent.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the citizens of Newport Beach have been irritated by
the growing number of aircraft using John Wayne Airport. (It is
regarded as a local tragedy that the city's most popular former
resident has given his name to its least popular institution.)
</P>
<P>
   They have also been worried that air traffic will grow hugely
with federal deregulation in 2005. After news came through in 1993
that the local Marine base was being decommissioned, George
Argyros, a leading citizen of Newport Beach, spent about $1 million
promoting a ballot measure to turn the base into a commercial
airport.
</P>
<P>
   El Toro may be only seven miles away from John Wayne Airport,
but Argyros correctly sensed that seven miles could as well be 170.
Moving the airport even such a short distance diverts the flight
path from Newport Beach to Irvine and seven other cities farther
south.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was carried by a tiny majority, 51 percent, and
ever since then the citizens of Irvine have been stretching
ingenuity to reverse the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Most arguments in the area are discreetly solved by the Irvine
Company, which owns more than a fifth of the county. But this time
the company is keeping studiously silent, probably because it owns
land on both sides of the noise divide. This means that the
citizens have the unfamiliar task of sorting things out for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They are making heavy weather of it. The County Board of
Supervisors, which is split three-to-two in favor of the new
airport, is frequently paralyzed by airport-related bickering.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican political machine is divided down the middle on
the issue; in particular the Lincoln Club, one of the biggest
collections of Republican moneybags in Southern California, is
losing key members because of its support for the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings in Irvine are running so high that ways are being
explored of ending the subsidies it pays to the fire departments of
cities that support the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is so explosive that all the local papers have
assigned at least one full-time reporter to cover it.
</P>
<P>
   The Irvine town council has set up no fewer than five committees
to fight the airport. Christina Shea, Irvine's glamorously blonde
mayor, admits to devoting half her time to fighting the airport _
and thinks it could get to be more than half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to the death,'' she argues. ``It's our Gettysburg.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvine and its allies have no shortage of arguments against the
airport. The ballot violated the proper procedures for
decommissioning bases.
</P>
<P>
   The hills behind the base are so high that they pose a safety
hazard. The planned doubling of the size of Los Angeles
International Airport (LAX) means there will be no need for yet
another international airport in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the real reason why Irvine's citizens hate the airport is
that it will threaten their (somewhat peculiar) quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine is a planned community where you cannot change the color
of your door without getting permission. But the new airport may
introduce all sorts of unplanned things from junk-food joints to
(if LAX is anything to go by) strip clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Laguna Woods is the only city in the United States
that consists almost entirely of people aged 55 and over: the
airport will send air traffic directly over its plush golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Newport Beach crowd have outmaneuvered their
opponents at every point. They have managed to persuade the north
of the county (which contains 70 percent of the population) that
the new airport will be good for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   So the airport's opponents are trying two loosely related
tactics: putting a measure on the ballot to require a two-thirds
vote before public money can be used to support ``noxious'' land
uses; and a grand ``millennium plan'' which involves buying the air
base and turning it into an ``urban village,'' complete with
houses, offices, a sports complex and parkland.
</P>
<P>
   For all their political naivete, however, the airport's
opponents have two important things on their side: the glacial pace
of the American legal system and an iron determination to prevent
the ``incursion of the airport into our quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   They are willing to spend whatever it takes to delay the
proposed airport for years, perhaps decades, to come.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving such a valuable piece of land empty for the foreseeable
future might seem folly. But the strength of the passions involved
may mean that there is no other choice: unless, that is, both sides
decide to give the land back to the Marines. &QL;

<P>
   The Republican political machine is divided down the middle on
the issue; in particular the Lincoln Club, one of the biggest
collections of Republican moneybags in Southern California, is
losing key members because of its support for the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings in Irvine are running so high that ways are being
explored of ending the subsidies it pays to the fire departments of
cities that support the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is so explosive that all the local papers have
assigned at least one full-time reporter to cover it.
</P>
<P>
   The Irvine town council has set up no fewer than five committees
to fight the airport. Christina Shea, Irvine's glamorously blonde
mayor, admits to devoting half her time to fighting the airport _
and thinks it could get to be more than half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to the death,'' she argues. ``It's our Gettysburg.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvine and its allies have no shortage of arguments against the
airport. The ballot violated the proper procedures for
decommissioning bases.
</P>
<P>
   The hills behind the base are so high that they pose a safety
hazard. The planned doubling of the size of Los Angeles
International Airport (LAX) means there will be no need for yet
another international airport in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the real reason why Irvine's citizens hate the airport is
that it will threaten their (somewhat peculiar) quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine is a planned community where you cannot change the color
of your door without getting permission. But the new airport may
introduce all sorts of unplanned things from junk-food joints to
(if LAX is anything to go by) strip clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Laguna Woods is the only city in the United States
that consists almost entirely of people aged 55 and over: the
airport will send air traffic directly over its plush golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Newport Beach crowd have outmaneuvered their
opponents at every point. They have managed to persuade the north
of the county (which contains 70 percent of the population) that
the new airport will be good for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   So the airport's opponents are trying two loosely related
tactics: putting a measure on the ballot to require a two-thirds
vote before public money can be used to support ``noxious'' land
uses; and a grand ``millennium plan'' which involves buying the air
base and turning it into an ``urban village,'' complete with
houses, offices, a sports complex and parkland.
</P>
<P>
   For all their political naivete, however, the airport's
opponents have two important things on their side: the glacial pace
of the American legal system and an iron determination to prevent
the ``incursion of the airport into our quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   They are willing to spend whatever it takes to delay the
proposed airport for years, perhaps decades, to come.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving such a valuable piece of land empty for the foreseeable
future might seem folly. But the strength of the passions involved
may mean that there is no other choice: unless, that is, both sides
decide to give the land back to the Marines. &QL;

KNEE INJURY MAY KNOCK BONILLA OUT OF OPENER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ A magnetic resonance imaging test of
Bobby Bonilla's right knee Friday revealed that his posterior
cruciate ligament has a 15 percent tear, an injury that will keep
the Mets' starting right fielder out of the lineup for the next 10
days to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Mets' final exhibition game this spring is
two weeks from Saturday, the chances are good that Mets manager
Bobby Valentine will have had just one opportunity all spring to
see his projected starting lineup on the field together. And that
came on Thursday night, when Bonilla reinjured his knee.
</P>
<P>
   And what are the chances that the 36-year-old Bonilla will
actually be ready for opening day, on April 5 in Miami?
</P>
<P>
   ``Questionable, right now,'' General Manager Steve Phillips
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla missed opening day last season, when he was a member of
the Florida Marlins, after undergoing off-season surgery on both
his left shoulder and his left Achilles' tendon. By the time the
season was through, Bonilla had not only been traded to Los
Angeles, but had also gone through three stays on the disabled
list, not to mention in-season surgery to have a noncancerous
growth removed near his colon and an episode of tendinitis that
caused him to miss the last six games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So even though Bonilla _ who hit .249 last season with just 11
homers and 45 runs batted in _ seemed dejected by Friday's news, he
realized it could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to have to have surgery, which meant
here we go again,'' said Bonilla, who was fitted with a brace
instead. ``That's why I was really nervous going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla first injured his knee in a collision with the Expos
pitcher Dustin Hermanson on March 8. Fred Hina, the Mets' trainer,
said Friday that Bonilla's knee had been gradually improving until
the first inning Thursday night, when he banged it while bending
down to field a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla remained in the game and belted his first homer of the
spring (even though the ball appeared to be well foul of the
left-field pole). But as a precaution, the Mets' team physician,
Dr. David Altchek, recommended that Bonilla undergo an MRI this
morning, and that is when the tear was found.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets traded Mel Rojas for Bonilla on Nov. 11, they were
just going for a little stability in their outfield. Aside from
center fielder Brian McRae, the Mets' rotating set of outfielders
proved particularly unproductive last season. By acquiring Bonilla
and signing Rickey Henderson, Phillips was making an effort to
improve the situation _ offensively, if not defensively.
</P>
<P>
   But considering that Bonilla is 36, and carries a lot of weight
on his frame, and Henderson is 40, Phillips' solution also posed
some risk. And not just health-wise. Although Henderson's left knee
has been sore, it has not kept him from playing. But after going 0
for 3 Friday, Henderson is 0 for his last 24 since opening the
spring with a single and is hitting his age (.040).
</P>
<P>
   At least Henderson _ who never cared much for spring training _
has been able to get some at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   As Bonilla lamented Friday, ``I needed to get at-bats this
spring, because I didn't want what happened to me last year happen
again.''

   PRISTINA _ ``What are we without you, our holy ground? I'm not
giving up what's mine to anybody, even if I perish with it. Even if
the skies open, and even if judgment day comes, we will stay here
where our roots are.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the chilling new jingle broadcast by Serbia's state-run
television with the main evening news, even as NATO has been
revving up its own war machine in an increasingly desperate effort
to impose a peace on the battered Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Serbia's delegation to the second round of peace talks in
Paris this week makes an 11th-hour about-face, negotiations with
the Contact Group _ America, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and
Russia _ over a peace deal look set to end abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs still reject the deal that would give broad autonomy
to the Kosovars, with some 28,000 NATO-led peacekeepers
guaranteeing peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a climb-down by Slobodan Milosevic, technically the
president of Yugoslavia but still in effect the boss of Serbia, its
main part, diplomacy now seems exhausted _ though the talks' two
co-sponsors, Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and his
French counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, were expected to make a
last-minute appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Western embassies in Belgrade have again been preparing to
evacuate their staff in preparation for oft-threatened NATO air
strikes against military targets in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, say members of his much-reshuffled inner circle, is
still keeping his options open. But they are narrowing fast.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of talks in France last month went his way. To
the annoyance of Madeleine Albright, America's secretary of state,
the divided delegation representing Kosovo's Albanian majority
refused to accept the deal. That weakened NATO's ability to squeeze
the even more recalcitrant Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, however, the leaders of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) agreed to the deal. Milosevic's team in Paris
have been trying in vain to reopen it. But, if anything, Serb
intransigence seems to have united the sometimes fractious Contact
Group in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's strong-arm tactics on the ground have also
backfired. Since the earlier talks fizzled out on Feb. 23, Kosovo
has seen some of the worst fighting since last October, when, under
NATO pressure, Milosevic agreed to halt his offensive, reduce his
forces and cooperate with unarmed ``verifiers'' from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
   That agreement is now in tatters. More than 80,000 ethnic
Albanians have fled their homes over the past three weeks, as more
Serb troops have been moved in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But if Milosevic was trying to provoke the KLA into abandoning
the deal, he miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   His next gamble is probably that NATO's missile threats will
prove hollow. Since they were first made last year, western
embassies have twice evacuated staff, while the threats have yet to
be made good.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has probably lost count of the number of western and
Russian emissaries to his palace in Belgrade. But a western
mediator in Paris has warned the Serbs that air strikes would come
in days, rather than weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently unperturbed, Milosevic seems to be digging his heels
in more deeply. He sacked the generals who advised him six months
ago to make concessions to NATO and accept a cease-fire, and
replaced them with loyal hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   They have told their commander-in-chief that to allow NATO
troops into Kosovo without a fight might be a final humiliating
blow to his regime. Many Serbs already blame Milosevic for losing
former Serb lands in Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is closer to home, its ancient Orthodox monasteries a
symbol, if rarely visited, of Serbia's birthright.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, increasingly fed up with Milosevic and the burden
of sustaining his bankrupt economy with cheap gas, publicly oppose
NATO air strikes but have refused to break a U.N. arms embargo
against Yugoslavia or give it sophisticated air-defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav armed forces are in no position to resist NATO,
which is why they are being dispersed around Serbia for protection.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic may be hoping that NATO will settle for hitting a few
remote installations, causing little real damage to his army. That
would allow him to channel popular anger towards the United States,
and away from himself, while he capitulated on Kosovo to save the
Serb nation from further harm.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a risky gamble. And NATO has its own credibility
to think of. It is due to celebrate its 50th anniversary next
month. Milosevic will not be allowed to spoil the party. &QL;

EDITORIAL: REALISTIC SCHOOL STANDARDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, March 20:
</P>
<P>
   The school standards movement is being undermined by a failure
of political will. In state after state, politicians pander to the
public with tough new standards and tests _ while failing to
provide qualified teachers or the rudimentary labs necessary to
prepare students adequately. When students fail the new tests,
parents explode in outrage and the standards are eased, feeding the
impression that public schooling is worthless and that some
children can never learn.
</P>
<P>
   New York state has embarked on a similar course. Anyone who
doubts this should look at the 27 percent failure rate on a new
English test prescribed by the state Board of Regents, one of five
such Regents tests that students will eventually have to pass to
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, the state must take an active role in helping
high school students who face a test for which their districts have
failed to prepare them. In the long term, the state will need to
embrace the broad preparation plan that the State Board of Regents
recommended when it created the new standards. To do any less is
courting civic disaster.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its history, New York had a two-tiered testing
system that led to two classes of diplomas. About 38 percent of
high school students took the more challenging courses that led to
the Regents High School Examinations, and for those who passed, the
Regents diploma. But most students took less demanding courses and
the Regents Competency Tests, leading to a local diploma.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents has scrapped the less challenging courses
and tests and now wants virtually every student to take the math,
science and English courses that lead to the Regents examination.
The exam initially will have two passing grades, one for the
Regents diploma and a lower one for the local diploma _ which will
soon be phased out, making everyone reach for the Regents' mark.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards do not kick in until next year. But a dry run
in an English exam among current high school seniors whose results
were released this week found that 27 percent across the state and
37 percent in New York City failed to achieve even the lower grade
required for a local diploma. By contrast, under the old system,
virtually everyone who took the weaker competency test got a local
diploma. Given that next year's English test is longer and more
difficult and that science and other subjects will be tested in
subsequent years, the failure rates could soar much higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents hoped to avoid high failure rates by
spending almost $900 million to bring all students up to speed
while concentrating the bulk of that money on poor districts that
have the least-qualified teachers and the worst facilities. But
after welcoming the new standards and pledging to support them,
Gov. George Pataki submitted a budget proposing only about $270
million and redirected much of the money toward affluent districts.
</P>
<P>
   Students who do not get better preparation will fail the new
tests in ever greater numbers. Those who repeat the 12th grade will
make the current overcrowding problems worse. As more students drop
out and fail to get jobs, they will deaden an economy that already
lags behind the nation's.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the state should commit to furnishing all of
its students with the instruction and tools they need to succeed.
But doing that will require money, planning and vigorous leadership
from the governor and the Legislature.

UCONN'S CALHOUN DEALS WITH PRESSURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pressure is not two free throws with the game on the line or a
3-point shot at the buzzer. Pressure is the weight of a state,
especially when the state is Connecticut and the coach is Jim
Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have averaged 25.4 wins per season in the '90s. They
have won 30 games four times. They have won the Big East
regular-season title six times. They have won the Big East
tournament four times. They've made the Sweet 16 seven times and
the Elite Eight four times.
</P>
<P>
   But they've never reached the Final Four, and for that reason
Calhoun is under hydraulic pressure to defeat Gonzaga today and win
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has made so much of us getting to the Final Four,''
Calhoun said. ``But I know I'm not going to change. If we win
(today), I'm not going to be a better coach. If we lose, I'm not
going to be a worse coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nutmeg State might disagree, since his success and its
self-respect are forever intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   UConn basketball is unique. What other elite program has a
history that begins in 1986? That's when Calhoun arrived from
Northeastern, where he coached the late Reggie Lewis. Until then,
the Huskies had won a total of four NCAA Tournament games, and none
since 1976. The All-American section in Connecticut's media guide
shows three players; all are Calhoun's.
</P>
<P>
   The school is located in Storrs, a small town 20 miles east of
Hartford. It has no movie theater and no McDonald's but a
passionate alumni following. (Approximately 90,000 reside
in-state.) The football team is Division I-AA and the Hartford
Whalers bolted for North Carolina two years ago, leaving
Connecticut without pro sports. Boston teams are popular in the
north and New York teams in the south, but the Huskies are all that
binds the state. Fourteen newspapers cover UConn regularly,
compared to the six that follow UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't North Carolina or Kansas or Kentucky. There is no
athletic history and not much reason to spend four years in Storrs,
except someone forgot to tell the UConn faithful. Each time he
misses the Final Four, Calhoun is swallowed by the expectations he
alone created.
</P>
<P>
   ``If over the next 10 years we average 26 wins and not make the
Final Four, I'll be a very happy coach,'' he said, appearing
genuine. Later, this: ``We haven't been to the Final Four and I
guess that's how you judge (coaches). I've accepted that.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun's critics either miss the point or ignore the facts. For
all its regular-season wins and Big East titles, Connecticut has
produced little NBA talent. Of the nine players drafted during the
Calhoun era, only two (Cliff Robinson and Ray Allen) are impact
players. Scott Burrell, Tate George, Travis Knight, Donny Marshall,
Donyell Marshall and Chris Smith are role players or castoffs.
UConn's talent hasn't been commensurate with its success. Calhoun
must be doing something right.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have three Elite Eight losses under Calhoun, all to
better teams: Duke in 1990, when Christian Laettner hit a jumper at
the buzzer; UCLA in 1995, and North Carolina last year, in
Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   The '94 Huskies lost to Florida in the Sweet 16 when Donyell
Marshall missed the game-winning free throws with three seconds
left. They lost to eventual-champ Duke in 1991 and to No. 1 seed
Ohio State in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Really, the only bad loss _ the only loss you can pin on Calhoun
_ came in 1996, when the No. 1 Huskies crumbled in the Sweet 16
against No. 5 Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how to avoid another piercing defeat, Calhoun cracked:
``One, make sure Christian Laettner isn't in the game. Two, make
your foul shots at the end. Three, don't get into overtime. Four,
don't get into a shootout with UCLA. And don't go to Greensboro, if
you have the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Calhoun has avoided it all _ the higher seeds and
home-court advantages, the late-game fades and last-second shots.
He's one No. 10 seed away from pacifying a state and corralling his
White Whale.
</P>
<P>
   If not now, when?
</P>
<P>
   __ Ready and relaxed: Gonzaga showed no signs of nerves at its
press conference Friday afternoon, less than 24 hours before the
most important sporting event in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Quentin Hall, a Bahamas native, on the adjustment to
living in eastern Washington: ``I had to buy more clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Casey Calvary, on whether the Bulldogs have adopted
coach Dan Monson's personality: ``Our coach does a lot better with
the women than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Monson, who is engaged: ``Casey's suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, on guard Richie Frahm kissing Calvary after his
game-winning shot against Florida: ``I would have hugged him. I
wouldn't kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Maryland lost in the Sweet 16 with its most
talented roster in the post-Len Bias era. Wouldn't want to be coach
Gary Williams' dog.
</P>
<P>
   The Pac-10: Conference of (NIT) Champions?
</P>
<P>
   Duke was favored by 27 points over Southwest Missouri _ an
astonishing spread for the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   Think Temple's nonconference schedule prepared it for the
tournament? The Owls played Mississippi, Michigan State,
Pennsylvania, Indiana, Wisconsin, Stann State, Florida State,
Fresno State and Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' dream Final Four: Connecticut, St. John's, Duke and
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' nightmare Final Four: Oklahoma, Ohio State, Gonzaga and
Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: On Selection Sunday, Gonzaga was 5,000-to-1 to win
the NCAA title.

   PRISTINA _ ``What are we without you, our holy ground? I'm not
giving up what's mine to anybody, even if I perish with it. Even if
the skies open, and even if judgment day comes, we will stay here
where our roots are.'
</P>
<P>
   This is the chilling new jingle broadcast by Serbia's state-run
television with the main evening news, even as NATO has been
revving up its own war machine in an increasingly desperate effort
to impose a peace on the battered Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Serbia's delegation to the second round of peace talks in
Paris this week makes an 11th-hour about-face, negotiations with
the Contact Group _ America, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and
Russia _ over a peace deal look set to end abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs still reject the deal that would give broad autonomy
to the Kosovars, with some 28,000 NATO-led peacekeepers
guaranteeing peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a climb-down by Slobodan Milosevic, technically the
president of Yugoslavia but still in effect the boss of Serbia, its
main part, diplomacy now seems exhausted _ though the talks' two
co-sponsors, Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and his
French counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, were expected to make a
last-minute appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Western embassies in Belgrade have again been preparing to
evacuate their staff in preparation for oft-threatened NATO air
strikes against military targets in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, say members of his much-reshuffled inner circle, is
still keeping his options open. But they are narrowing fast.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of talks in France last month went his way. To
the annoyance of Madeleine Albright, America's secretary of state,
the divided delegation representing Kosovo's Albanian majority
refused to accept the deal. That weakened NATO's ability to squeeze
the even more recalcitrant Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, however, the leaders of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) agreed to the deal. Milosevic's team in Paris
have been trying in vain to reopen it. But, if anything, Serb
intransigence seems to have united the sometimes fractious Contact
Group in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's strong-arm tactics on the ground have also
backfired. Since the earlier talks fizzled out on Feb. 23, Kosovo
has seen some of the worst fighting since last October, when, under
NATO pressure, Milosevic agreed to halt his offensive, reduce his
forces and cooperate with unarmed ``verifiers'' from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
   That agreement is now in tatters. More than 80,000 ethnic
Albanians have fled their homes over the past three weeks, as more
Serb troops have been moved in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But if Milosevic was trying to provoke the KLA into abandoning
the deal, he miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   His next gamble is probably that NATO's missile threats will
prove hollow. Since they were first made last year, western
embassies have twice evacuated staff, while the threats have yet to
be made good.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has probably lost count of the number of western and
Russian emissaries to his palace in Belgrade. But a western
mediator in Paris has warned the Serbs that air strikes would come
in days, rather than weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently unperturbed, Milosevic seems to be digging his heels
in more deeply. He sacked the generals who advised him six months
ago to make concessions to NATO and accept a cease-fire, and
replaced them with loyal hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   They have told their commander-in-chief that to allow NATO
troops into Kosovo without a fight might be a final humiliating
blow to his regime. Many Serbs already blame Milosevic for losing
former Serb lands in Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is closer to home, its ancient Orthodox monasteries a
symbol, if rarely visited, of Serbia's birthright.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, increasingly fed up with Milosevic and the burden
of sustaining his bankrupt economy with cheap gas, publicly oppose
NATO air strikes but have refused to break a U.N. arms embargo
against Yugoslavia or give it sophisticated air-defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav armed forces are in no position to resist NATO,
which is why they are being dispersed around Serbia for protection.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic may be hoping that NATO will settle for hitting a few
remote installations, causing little real damage to his army. That
would allow him to channel popular anger towards the United States,
and away from himself, while he capitulated on Kosovo to save the
Serb nation from further harm.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a risky gamble. And NATO has its own credibility
to think of. It is due to celebrate its 50th anniversary next
month. Milosevic will not be allowed to spoil the party. &QL;

CONNECTICUT COACH ONLY CARES ABOUT WIN THAT WILL PUT HIM IN FINAL
FOUR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Geno Auriemma has had a lot of success during his
14 years as the women's basketball coach at Connecticut. He has a
.793 winning percentage and a 6-0 record in the round of 16. His
1995 national championship team finished at 35-0.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, his team has a chance to make it six straight seasons
with at least 30 victories when the top-seeded Huskies play
fourth-seeded Iowa State at noon in the NCAA Mideast Regional
semifinals at the Shoemaker Center.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference Friday, Auriemma scoffed at the mention
of the possibility of another 30-victory season. ``We've won 30
games five years in a row, but we've been to two Final Fours,''
Auriemma said. ``And I think if you asked me if I would trade in a
couple of 30-win seasons for a couple of Final Fours, I'd say yeah.
If we win and don't win Monday, I'm not going to be a happy man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies (29-4) have lost in the regional championship three
times in the last five years _ in 1994, 1997 and 1998. Last season,
they were beaten by a surprising North Carolina State team. But the
Huskies are favored to stop that trend this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I love,'' Auriemma said, balking at the notion
that Iowa State has an advantage as an underdog. ``I love when
teams come in and say, `We have nothing to lose.' I love when teams
say that; you're not going to play as hard as we are. We've got a
national championship to lose. That's what we're playing for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second game here Saturday, second-seeded Clemson (26-5)
plays third-seeded Georgia (25-6).
</P>
<P>
   In the East Region, top-seeded Tennessee, vying to become the
first women's team to win four consecutive national titles, faces
fourth-seeded Virginia Tech this afternoon in Greensboro, N.C. That
game follows the contest which pits third-seeded Duke against
second-seeded Old Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue, seeded No. 1 in the Midwest Region and ranked No. 1 in
the nation, plays fourth-seeded North Carolina Saturday night in
Normal, Ill., followed by third-seeded Rutgers against
second-seeded Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Regional in Los Angeles, top-seeded Louisiana Tech
meets fourth-seeded Louisiana State Saturday night, followed by the
game between third-seeded UCLA and second-seeded Colorado State.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Iowa State (24-7), ranked No. 19 in The Associated Press poll,
is relishing the opportunity presented by its first round of 16
game. Watching UConn barely defeat Xavier by 86-84 in the second
round has the Cyclones believing they can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of all the No. 1 seeds, they were the team we thought we
could play with,'' said Iowa State guard Megan Taylor, who averages
15.7 points.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State's style is similar to Xavier's. The Cyclones have a
deft touch from the perimeter, shooting 39 percent from 3-point
range. Xavier was the only team in the nation that shot better from
long range.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State has a star point guard to deal with the Huskies' full
court pressure. Stacey Frese, a junior, averages 17.3 points and
led the nation in 3-point field goal percentage, hitting 48.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a scrawny little thing that people don't think much
about when they first look at her,'' Iowa State coach Bill Fennelly
said. ``But she's a great player, a real leader on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn players say they are more focused this week and are intent
on getting back to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past two years were disappointing,'' said Amy Duran, the
Huskies' captain. ``You look back, and those were games we could
have and should have won. Maybe we were a little too worried about
losing. I don't know. I don't think we're going to make that
mistake again.'' &QL;

AFTER ATTACKING A SPRINKLER, LOVE TIES FOR LEAD AT BAY HILL
INVITATIONAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ It was a successful day for Davis Love III, but
an embarrassing one as well.
</P>
<P>
   Angry about seeing his ball buried in a bunker on the 17th hole,
Love banged a sprinkler head with his club. The sprinkler head
broke, releasing a steady stream of water that poured into the
bunker, making a large portion of it unplayable.
</P>
<P>
   Love said he expected to be fined by the PGA Tour. But after
this weekend, he may have a $450,000 winner's check that will
easily cover his debt.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a six-under-par 66 and putting himself in position to
win a tournament that has eluded him in the past, Love was tied
with Tim Herron at 135, nine-under-par Friday after the second
round of the Bay Hill Invitational. Andrew Magee was one stroke
back in third place, while Tom Lehman was alone in fourth place at
137, two shots behind and well within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   While Love was happy with his position, he was troubled by his
outburst, particularly because he has great respect for Arnold
Palmer, the tournament's host. It was too late for Love to mend
what he had done. But he did apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure those maintenance guys aren't real happy with me,''
said Love, whose round included five birdies, an eagle and only one
bogey. ``Hopefully, Arnold will send me a bill for it when he gets
it at the end of the month. I have done a lot of things that I'm
not proud of: kicked water coolers and hurt your foot, bashed your
toe with your club. Suffice to say, I am embarrassed. But it's good
for you to get embarrassed every once in a while. Takes you down a
notch.''
</P>
<P>
   While Love's composure left something to be desired, his play
was superb as he used his power and steady putting to tie Herron,
the first-round leader who shot a 69 Friday after an opening-round
66.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights of Love's round included an eagle at the par-5,
530-yard fourth hole, when Love reached the green in two shots, a
drive followed by a mammoth 3-wood shot that landed just four feet
from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sprinkler head incident did not break Love's
concentration. After hitting his buried bunker shot onto the green,
Love made a 45-foot putt to save par, then ended his day with a
12-foot putt for birdie at No. 18.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Love finished second at Bay Hill in 1989 and 1993, and last year
he was tied for first place after two rounds only to finish 75-76,
which dropped him into a tie for 17th place. This year, Love hopes
for a happier ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to win this tournament, just because it's Arnold's
tournament,'' said Love, who has 13 victories on tour, including
the 1997 PGA Championship. ``It's a good golf course and a good
field. I have been very close here a couple of times and I'm off to
a good start again. If this weather continues, scores are going to
be pretty good. You have to try to keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tiger Woods barely made the cut of two over par as
one of the top 70 professionals. Woods was actually tied for 71st
place, but Matt Kuchar, an amateur who finished at two under par
(142), did not count against the cut.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's even-par 72, Woods silently cleaned out his
locker at Bay Hill Club &AMP; Lodge, figuring he was off for the
weekend. But a few moments later, Woods was informed that he had
made the cut. Now, if he could only fix his swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To shoot 72 was kind of a mini-miracle, because I hit it so
bad,'' said Woods, who has missed only one cut during his career,
at the 1997 Bell Canadian Open. ``I wish I could see a pattern. The
only pattern I could see was that I was consistently
inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Love already has four top 10 finishes this year, but
no victories. He hoped to change that this weekend. And he would
also try to hold his temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hit a lot of sprinkler heads and nobody sees it,'' Love
said. ``I have a feeling that somebody saw that one.'' &QL;

SOUTHWEST MISSOURI STATE PUTS UP A FIGHT, BUT DUKE PREVAILS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ No. 1-ranked Duke came into the East
Regional like a bullet train in a stagecoach race, beating its last
11 opponents by an average of 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   Big-name opponents, like North Carolina and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   But little-known Southwest Missouri State proved Friday night
that the Blue Devil Express could be slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Overmatched, but never outhustled, the No. 12-seeded Bears went
floor burn for floor burn, 3-pointer for 3-pointer, with the
tournament heavyweight for nearly 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Southwest Missouri State ran out of horsepower in the second
half and lost, 78-61, in a scrappy performance that gave the mighty
Blue Devils their first test in the tournament that they are
expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Southwest Missouri State coach Steve Alford
finally removed his starters with 59.5 seconds left and down by 20
points, the crowd at the Continental Arena _ Duke fans included _
gave them a standing ovation. It was only the fourth time this
season that the Blue Devils were held to 80 points or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Blue Devils' house. They are 14-1 in regional
semifinal games at the Meadowlands. Four times they left as East
Regional champions with a ticket punched to the Final Four _ in
1986, 1988, 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   This was Duke's 16th round-of-16 appearance and was Southwest
Missouri State's first. Alford's post-season record consisted of a
Division III title game loss while coaching tiny Manchester
College.
</P>
<P>
   Alford, an all-American at Indiana as a player, and his Bears
ignored the Blue Devils' daunting record. Southwest Missouri State
came out to play as if it were just another Missouri Valley
Conference game.
</P>
<P>
   It began as if it were taking on Drake, not Duke. The Bears ran
with the more athletic Blue Devils, and they banged inside with
Duke's nine high school all-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hard, poised and unafraid display led by Keven Ault,
one of four Hoosiers in Southwest Missouri's starting lineup. He
opened the game by going right at, and over, Elton Brand. The
6-foot-3-inch junior guard showed why he was named Indiana's Mr.
Basketball in 1996 in a fearless first half when he lifted his
teammates every time the Blue Devils threatened to make it a
blowout.
</P>
<P>
   When Duke charged to 15-4 lead, Ault stripped William Avery and
got the ball to Allen Phillips for a 3-pointer. Then he nailed one
himself. Another Ault steal _ one of his three in the first half _
and the Bears were back to within three. Another Indiana product,
6-11 Danny Moore, never backed down from Brand, a consensus
all-American. Moore had six first-half points, including a dazzling
reverse layup around his higher-profile opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Moore even slapped Brand's point-blank dunk attempt, holding him
to nine first-half points. The Bears seemed to have an answer for
everybody, except for Trajan Langdon. The Blue Devils' fifth-year
senior is still nursing a sprained fifth metatarsal in his left
foot, but he uncorked 15 first-half points, mostly from way out as
he was 3 of 4 from behind the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Duke shot 55 percent in the first half while the
Bears made only 40 percent, Southwest Missouri State managed to go
into halftime down by only 39-30. The Bears' stingy first-half
defense forced seven Duke turnovers for eight fast-break points. &QL;

BRUTALLY, SPARTANS SLOG PAST OKLAHOMA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Michigan State survived Friday night, barely and
brutally.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans slogged past Oklahoma, 54-46, in a game that
featured rugged defense and less offense than an elementary school
clash. Two players wound up dazed and on the floor after a nasty
collision, and every other player looked weary and bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   Do not search for the videotape of this contest in the NCAA film
archives. Not unless you love watching teams struggle to get open
shots, struggle even when they got the shots and simply struggle
all night. Sure, the defense was feisty, but pick a player on
either team and he probably had a subpar performance on what was
the biggest evening of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the obvious difference for the top-seeded Spartans is
that they survived in the semifinals of the Midwest Regional at the
Trans World Dome to scamper into the round of eight, where they
will play Kentucky or Miami. Meanwhile, the Sooners, who were
trying to become the first 13th-seeded squad to be among the final
eight teams left in the tournament, stumbled mightily.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State (32-4) walked to a 36-29 lead with 10 minutes
left in the second half by allowing Oklahoma (22-11) just four
points for 10 minutes. Or did the Sooners stop themselves? In one
five-possession spurt, the Sooners, who were 17 of 51 (33 percent)
from the field, hit the rim once. Even though Mateen Cleaves,
Michigan State's star, was only 3 for 14 shooting and had nine
points, the Spartans received 12 from Andre Hutson and 11 from
Morris Peterson to survive.
</P>
<P>
   With 9 minutes 34 seconds left in the second half, there was a
frightening collision after Oklahoma inbounded the ball. As Cleaves
pursued a dribbling Michael Johnson, he ran into Eduardo Najera,
who was setting a pick. Cleaves' head banged into Najera's chin and
both players collapsed on the hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   There was silence throughout the dome when neither player
budged. Cleaves finally moved and was helped to his feet after
being on the floor for almost five minutes. It took Najera a lot
longer. There was blood on the floor near Najera and he needed
medical attention on his chin. He rose 11 minutes after the
collision, with a bandage on his chin, his face pale, and he needed
to be helped to the sidelines. Both players returned later, but
Najera, whose nine points were well below his 15.7 average, was
wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma managed to stifle Cleaves early. He was restless and
frustrated when the first half was almost over and he had not
scored. So when he took possession of the ball with less than 10
seconds remaining in the half, he dribbled ahead like a sprinter,
glided around the Sooners, slid inside and made a nifty left-handed
layup with one second remaining. It gave Michigan State a
precarious 26-25 lead, and it gave Cleaves a little relief.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson, who guided the Spartans to the national
championship as a player in 1979, was perched behind their bench
and broke into a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   The way to possibly throttle Michigan State is to negate
Cleaves. The muscular point guard loves to push the ball up the
court, loves to explode to the hoop, loves to toss up jumpers and
loves to play defense. If Cleaves is unable to do those things, the
Spartans become an ordinary team.
</P>
<P>
   So coach Kelvin Sampson of Oklahoma tried to confuse Cleaves by
using different defenses throughout the half, and the strategy
worked. The Sooners trudged to a 23-19 lead, the largest of the
half, and Cleaves, unnerved and uncomfortable, missed all eight of
his shots from the field before the coast-to-coast layup.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners used a 2-3 zone and dared Michigan State to shoot
from the outside. They used a 2-1-2 zone and packed it in tight
around the basket. Most unusual of all, the Sooners used a matchup
zone with the 6-foot-8-inch Najera hounding Cleaves, who is 6-2,
above the free-throw line.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexis De Tocqueville originally traveled to the United States
in 1831 to study not the country's political institutions but its
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   These were an object of great curiosity in Europe because the
United States had embarked on a bold experiment: to rehabilitate
criminals through a strict regime of solitary confinement, silence
and hard work in a newly created institution, the ``penitentiary.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocqueville was not impressed by what he found. America's social
reformers, he said, were in the grip of a ``monomania'' and seemed
to believe that prisons were a ``remedy for all the evils of
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades that monomania has again gripped
America, and it shows few signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   This week the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that the
nation's prison and jail population has increased yet again, by 4.4
percent to 1.8 million in the year to June 1998. This represents
slower growth than the annual average of 6.2 percent since 1990, or
the 5.9 percent growth in 1997. But it is not much of a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   More remarkable is the fact that America's prison population
continues to grow at such a steady pace in the teeth of two other
facts: rates of reported crime have fallen for each of the past six
years, and America has already locked up more people than any
country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of imprisonment in America is now unmatched in any
democracy, and is greater than even most totalitarian governments
have ever attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Last year one in every 150 American residents (children
included) was behind bars. The rate of incarceration, at 668
inmates per 100,000 residents, is five to ten times the rates of
countries in Western Europe, six times the rate in Canada and
nearly 20 times that in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans in prison has nearly quadrupled since
1980 and more than doubled since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Only Russia imprisons a larger proportion of its people but, at
the current rate of increase, America should win the top spot in a
year or two. Because of its larger population, America already has
more people behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Is this extraordinary experiment in mass imprisonment working?
It seems to beggar belief that the fall in crime in recent years
does not have something to do with the increase in imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   But so many factors influence the level of crime _ demographic,
economic and cultural _ that it is difficult to establish a link
between any single policy and the overall crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, there are reasons to doubt that mass imprisonment
can take the lion's share of the credit. In some places where crime
has dropped most, such as New York, the incarceration rate is not
as high and has not risen as fast as the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Although crime has decreased nationally since 1991, that drop
came after a seven-year rise in crime even though the prison
population expanded by 77 percent during the same period, points
out Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie Mellon University.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the effect of increased imprisonment could have been
delayed, producing a lower crime rate in subsequent years. But even
today the level of violent crime in America is still about the same
as in the mid-1980s, when 1 million fewer people were in prison or
jail.
</P>
<P>
   According to a government report published in January, arrests
for murder, rape and robbery declined sharply between 1990 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The prison and jail populations have soared not because the
police are catching more violent criminals, but because sentences
have been lengthened and probation severely curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is one type of crime where mass imprisonment
seems to have failed abysmally _ illegal drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Since America panicked over the crack epidemic ten years ago,
toughening drug laws at both the federal and state level, the
number of people imprisoned for illegal drug use or trafficking has
quadrupled, nearly twice the growth rate for violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400,000 people are now imprisoned for drug offenses, a
larger number than those in prison for all crimes in England,
France, Germany and Japan combined.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such large-scale imprisonment, the number of people
abusing drugs has not changed since 1988, according to the National
Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1997, the most recent available.
</P>
<P>
   The survey estimated that about 14 million people had used
illegal drugs, and 600,000 had smoked crack cocaine, in the month
before the survey, the same figures found by the survey a decade
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The costs, both financial and social, of mass imprisonment have
been high. Ballooning prison budgets have squeezed out spending on
education and other social programs in states throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The toll on the black community has been especially heavy.
Blacks comprise 12 percent of the American population, but
represent nearly half of those in prison or jail.
</P>
<P>
   The incarceration rate for black men, according to figures
published last year, is eight times that for white men. About one
in every 12 black men aged between 25 and 29 is currently behind
bars, ten times the rate among whites.
</P>
<P>
   Many are there not for violent offenses, but for breaking the
drug laws, which seem aimed directly at blacks.
</P>
<P>
   For example the penalty for possessing five grams of crack
cocaine, the form most widely used in black districts, is the same
as the penalty for possessing 100 times as much of the powdered
variety, which whites prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not prison works as a crime-fighting tool, how much
further down the road of ever more frequent imprisonment can
America go? &QL;

 (ATTN: Ind., Mo.)  (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The coach's son discovered at a tender
age that the country was a vast playground of wondrous talent
beyond the scope of even an Indiana boy who could really play. In
New Castle, Ind., Brandon Miller had learned from his father that
basketball was like religion, something in the blood. But from his
boyhood idol came the message that fame and fortune are not
necessarily part of the same basketball equation.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Alford had filled what supposedly is the largest high
school arena in the country, seating 9,300, in a place so
basketball crazed that they built the State Basketball Hall of Fame
right next door. Alford eventually left New Castle's Chrysler High
for Indiana University, where he became a central character in a
best-selling book about a volatile coach. Alford also won the 1987
national championship, Indiana defeating Syracuse as 7-year-old
Brandon Miller watched with his father, Roger, at his grandparents'
home, on a Monday night he will never forget.
</P>
<P>
   The hometown hero was drafted by the Indiana Pacers but he never
did become a big-time money player. Like his father, Sam, and Roger
Miller, too, Steve Alford became a coach, which meant there was one
player he never had to recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I committed to Southwest Missouri my sophomore year of high
school,'' Brandon Miller said Friday night before Southwest
Missouri State was a stubborn sacrifice, losing its East Regional
game, 78-61.
</P>
<P>
   The Alfords and the Millers found out what it was once like to
be a mosquito trying to knock off New Castle in the Indiana state
sectional. Sam Alford, who coached his son in high school, was in
the assistant's seat next to Steve, now the head coach, on the
Southwest Missouri bench. Roger Miller, the assistant to Sam for
the one season he coached Brandon at New Castle, was in the stands,
waiting for his son to jump off the bench and man the point.
</P>
<P>
   This photo opportunity of a lifetime came late in the first
half, the Bears still not quite pitch-forked by the Blue Devils.
Miller threw away an entry pass but baited William Avery into a
charge. Then he was matched against an all-American, Trajan
Langdon, and didn't hustle back fast enough from a double team.
Langdon nailed a 3-pointer. Miller came out a game that would be
with him forever, like Indiana-Syracuse in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, there would be additions to the Miller family
album. When Roger played high school ball in Vincennes, Ind, he
made the state Final Four. ``He's got me there,'' said Brandon
Miller, a 6-foot freshman with short, cropped hair and a boxer's
flattened nose.
</P>
<P>
   The farthest he went at Chrysler was the final eight, his
freshman year, which was Sam Alford's 20th, and last. In Indiana,
these tournaments advancements are badges of honor, a lifetime
defined by one shot, one night, one game when a town from nowhere
is suddenly a star on the state basketball map.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year we went to the Final Four with Steve, we had 26 buses
from New Castle following ours into Indianapolis,'' Sam Alford
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was always a level to climb, an opponent to behold. That
was the beauty of the Indiana tournament until some bureaucrats got
together and changed the one-classification format against the
lifers' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   New Castle Chrysler was never the biggest school, with 800 or so
students, but it had tradition and commitment. It had Sam Alford.
``I tell the coaches in Missouri, `Our coaches and players are no
better than yours,''' he said. ``But Indiana basketball is just
something you have to witness.''
</P>
<P>
   A coach there starts low, aims high. Sam Alford's first job was
at Monroe City, a 100-student school with seven senior boys. From
there it was on to South Knox and Martinsville, and then it was
time to put down roots, make his stand. His last victory in New
Castle was his 300th, but there were also 188 defeats, one of them
in the tournament to little Knightstown. He didn't campaign to have
the system junked.

   ``Oh, no ... no,'' he said. ``The coaches didn't want that
system changed. All of us had been at the lower end.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach who wins with the little guys invariably moves up. In
big-time college basketball, these associations often end clumsily.
Steve Alford is already on the short list at Iowa, meaning the
Bears may not get out of the first round again. Miller won't be
going with Alford, but he at least got this far, all the way from
New Castle, to the Round of 16, against the best team of all.
</P>
<P>
   It was all an Indiana kid could want, the opportunity to dream,
which money can't buy.

   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Last week Lou Carnesecca, Brian Mahoney and
Ron Rutledge sat together in Orlando, Fla., and watched St. John's
whip Samford and tear apart Indiana. On Thursday, they watched St.
John's play a near-perfect first half on the way to a romp over
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   As the clock wound down, with St. John's one victory away from
the Final Four, the three stood, applauded and shook hands. Connie
Jarvis, the wife of the St. John's coach, Mike Jarvis, the players
and parents hugged and celebrated one more unlikely step in an
unlikely season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every coach's dream to have a team play that way,''
Carnesecca said in his raspy voice. ``To play with great
discipline, great passing and great intelligence. They remind me of
the 1964 UCLA team. They play that way, with great passing. They
perform surgery on you and you don't even know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the three held a significance you might miss if
you didn't know the history.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years ago, in March 1985, Carnesecca, Rutledge and
Mahoney were on the bench coaching together in Denver as St. John's
reached the Final Four with victories over Kentucky and North
Carolina State. St. John's, with Chris Mullin, Bill Wennington,
Mark Jackson and Walter Berry, met Big East rival Georgetown in one
national semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little different, we were supposed to go,''
Carnesecca said. Mahoney added: ``That's what makes this so
special. There were no expectations for this group. Now you look at
the way they're coming together, the way they are playing together,
everything is really coming together nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Carnesecca, Mahoney and Rutledge indicates a
more subtle adhesion: the coming back together of a program, a
self-styled mom-and-pop operation that had, by its standards, been
stood on its ear.
</P>
<P>
   After Carnesecca's retirement in 1993, Mahoney, who had served
as his assistant for nearly 20 years, was given the job out of
loyalty and a desire for continuity. Four seasons later, Mahoney
was dismissed by Ed Manetta, who had replaced Jack Kaiser, the
longtime athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   After a clumsy search process, the university hired its third
choice, Fran Fraschilla from Manhattan. That selection set in
motion two seasons of turmoil, but it also produced two marvelous
players: Ron Artest, the sophomore forward, and Erick Barkley, this
season's outstanding freshman point guard.
</P>
<P>
   After a well-documented feud that centered around personal
conduct and Fraschilla's interest in another job, Fraschilla was
fired. Jarvis was hired from George Washington, and the program has
regained its balance. The presence of Carnesecca, Mahoney and
Rutledge underlines how steady the ship is.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney, who was wounded by his dismissal nearly five years ago,
returned to St. John's last fall to work in the university's
development office with Carnesecca and Rutledge. ``We wanted to
show our support,'' Mahoney said. ``We thought it was a nice
gesture. I think Mike appreciates it. I think the kids notice it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they do. On Friday, Tyrone Grant, the senior center who
was recruited by Mahoney and played one season for him, two for
Fraschilla and one for Jarvis, said it was nice to see a bond
forming.
</P>
<P>
   ``When coach Jarvis came it brought that togetherness back to
the program,'' he said. ``I haven't seen all my coaches together at
a game in a long time. Since the first game, they have been there,
they have supported us. Those are coaches who recruited me. So, I'm
just happy that we're together and we're a big family again,
because for two years we weren't really a family. Everybody was
spread apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminders of that 1985 St. John's glory year abound: Mullin and
Jackson are teammates on the Indiana Pacers; Berry has enjoyed a
long, profitable career in Greece. The former coach and his two
assistants are a bridge from St. John's past to a promising future.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Carnesecca, Mahoney and Rutledge will take their
assigned seats near the St. John's bench and watch the Red Storm
battle Ohio State for the right to go to the Final Four. Mahoney
said that he was happy to be back in the fold. It's almost as if he
never left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put a lot of years in the school,'' Mahoney said. ``I
spoke to Father Harrington'' _ Donald J. Harrington, the university
president _ ``and one of the things he said was: `You don't realize
it, but people still have strong feelings about you. You don't know
how many people still admire you.' He told me, `Remember you're
part of this.' That made me feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Red Storm needs Saturday night is a victory for a happy
ending.

<P>
   Oracle's boss, Larry Ellison, likes to describe competing with
Microsoft in apocalyptic terms: ``It's Microsoft against mankind,
and mankind isn't winning.''
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks that Bill Gates's firm should be broken up for
repeated antitrust violations. For its part, Microsoft sneers at
the bombastic Ellison as a failed visionary whose attempts to
supplant the PC with a low-cost browser-based ``network computer''
went nowhere with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the funny thing is that, until now, neither firm has really
competed head-on against the other, even in databases.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's database, SQL Server 6.5, was a lightweight compared
with Oracle's, suitable only for departmental use and smaller
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Oracle benefited from the success of Microsoft's
Windows NT operating system for business users, selling many more
databases than it would have had it been confined to the
slower-growing Unix system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, nearly 30 percent of Oracle's database sales came from
its share of the NT market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Microsoft has long been eyeing the $9.5 billion-a-year
relational database market. In January it pounced, with SQL Server
7.
</P>
<P>
   According to Doug Leland, the Microsoft manager responsible for
marketing the new database, SQL 7 ``is a stake in the ground that
puts us squarely into the enterprise class.'' He adds ominously:
``Our friends in Redwood Shores (where Oracle is based) are going
to feel the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why the database market has begun to matter to
Microsoft. Databases are the all-important platform for
``enterprise resource planning'' (ERP) applications, pioneered by
Germany's SAP, which have revolutionized the business processes of
large companies over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new emphasis on mining data to get a detailed
understanding of what is really going on inside a firm.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft needs SQL 7 to help spearhead its next release of NT,
christened Windows 2000, which it claims will be able to run even
the most powerful server computers that currently rely on different
types of Unix.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has worked closely with consulting firms and big ERP
suppliers, such as SAP and PeopleSoft (though not, oddly enough,
with Oracle), to create a platform that they can recommend even to
their biggest clients.
</P>
<P>
   SQL 7 is indeed a ``good enough'' database, according to Betsy
Burton, a consultant at Gartmore. It will support
online-transaction processing by about 500 concurrent users.
</P>
<P>
   That number will grow when Windows 2000 is launched towards the
end of this year and Intel's powerful new Xeon processors also
become available.
</P>
<P>
   But, as always with Microsoft, the database's success will
depend less on its own qualities than on the company's sheer market
power.
</P>
<P>
   SQL 7 will be bundled with other Microsoft products, such as
BackOffice, attracting price-conscious companies. A further $600
million has been earmarked to sweeten contracts with inducements.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has nearly $20 billion in cash, waiting to be siphoned
into grabbing extra market share when needed. It will also use the
clout it gets from the NT operating system to win the backing of
hardware firms.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most crucially, Microsoft will have strong support from
the dominant ERP supplier, SAP, because of the German firm's own
rivalry with Oracle in the business-applications market.
</P>
<P>
   Against such an onslaught, many firms would panic. And for
Sybase and Informix, relative minnows of the database industry, the
prospects indeed look cloudy. But Oracle is not without advantages
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   SQL 7 has fewer features than Oracle 8, the latest release of
Oracle's database, and it cannot match its performance. In
particular, Oracle 8 will support a couple of thousand, as opposed
to a few hundred, concurrent users.
</P>
<P>
   With Unix now the preferred platform for ``mission critical''
applications, SQL 7's restriction to running only on NT guarantees
Oracle a lock on the high end of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle also has a large installed base. It dominates the Unix
market and provides over 40 percent of the databases that run on
NT. Oracle also claims that 87 percent of Fortune 500 companies
have an Oracle database; and that today a majority of ERP
applications run on Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Because database customers do not like to chop and change, it is
almost inconceivable that Oracle users will suddenly switch to SQL
7, however tempting the price.
</P>
<P>
   But what gives Oracle most confidence is the conviction that
computing is moving its way. Although Ellison was wrong about the
network computer, he is probably right to say that ``the Internet
changes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracle is betting on a type of Internet computing in which
applications are centrally managed, backed up and administered.
Users will gain access to information and applications using a
browser that can run on a personal computer or an even simpler
device.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle may charge more than Microsoft, but it says that the
extra costs of running SQL 7 on NT more than offset any saving. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To ram home the message, Oracle has this month released Oracle
8i, which is designed to be not just a database, but a complete
platform for Internet computing.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle believes that the rigors of doing business on the
Internet are creating a demand for ever more sophisticated database
technology, and that 8i will be a natural choice for electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Firms now need not only to give their employees access to a
database, but also to extend parts of their database to customers
through corporate ``extranets'' or the public Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With customers doing their own ordering and billing through the
Internet, databases must be able to handle vast numbers of
concurrent users and provide information fast.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle claims that the ten most-visited consumer websites,
including Yahoo! and America Online, are powered by its databases,
as are the ten biggest business websites (with one exception:
www.ibm.com). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oracle 8i should tighten the company's grip on the exploding
e-commerce database market, where IBM is its main competitor. But
it has another purpose too.
</P>
<P>
   By incorporating software that allows traditional files to be
stored and managed by the database, Oracle 8i also removes the need
for a big, all-purpose operating system, such as Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize this, Oracle has joined Sun Microsystems to create
an Intel-based server, called the ``Oracle 8i appliance,'' with an
Oracle database and its own simple operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to use out of the box, this, Oracle says, is a cheaper and
less complex alternative to a database that runs on NT, because it
minimizes the cost and complication of the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Several large computer makers, including Compaq, Hewlett-Packard
and Dell, have already said they will sell their own versions of
the appliance.
</P>
<P>
   With much of their distribution aimed at small and medium-sized
firms, the machine will take the fight to Microsoft. As Merv
Adrian, an analyst with Giga Information Group, puts it,
``Microsoft is playing the commodity card, but Oracle has gone one
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Who _ apart from customers _ will win this database war? The
answer depends to some extent on Windows 2000. Until it is
established, SQL 7 will be a capable, cheap database in search of
an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   More decisive, however, will be the speed with which the
Internet approach to computing that Oracle preaches takes off.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Oracle not only remains in pole position, but has the
more compelling vision. That said, few firms can play catch-up to
more devastating effect than Microsoft. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Oracle's boss, Larry Ellison, likes to describe competing with
Microsoft in apocalyptic terms: ``It's Microsoft against mankind,
and mankind isn't winning.''
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks that Bill Gates's firm should be broken up for
repeated antitrust violations. For its part, Microsoft sneers at
the bombastic Ellison as a failed visionary whose attempts to
supplant the PC with a low-cost browser-based ``network computer''
went nowhere with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the funny thing is that, until now, neither firm has really
competed head-on against the other, even in databases.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's database, SQL Server 6.5, was a lightweight compared
with Oracle's, suitable only for departmental use and smaller
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Oracle benefited from the success of Microsoft's
Windows NT operating system for business users, selling many more
databases than it would have had it been confined to the
slower-growing Unix system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, nearly 30 percent of Oracle's database sales came from
its share of the NT market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Microsoft has long been eyeing the $9.5 billion-a-year
relational database market. In January it pounced, with SQL Server
7.
</P>
<P>
   According to Doug Leland, the Microsoft manager responsible for
marketing the new database, SQL 7 ``is a stake in the ground that
puts us squarely into the enterprise class.'' He adds ominously:
``Our friends in Redwood Shores (where Oracle is based) are going
to feel the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why the database market has begun to matter to
Microsoft. Databases are the all-important platform for
``enterprise resource planning'' (ERP) applications, pioneered by
Germany's SAP, which have revolutionized the business processes of
large companies over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new emphasis on mining data to get a detailed
understanding of what is really going on inside a firm.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft needs SQL 7 to help spearhead its next release of NT,
christened Windows 2000, which it claims will be able to run even
the most powerful server computers that currently rely on different
types of Unix.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has worked closely with consulting firms and big ERP
suppliers, such as SAP and PeopleSoft (though not, oddly enough,
with Oracle), to create a platform that they can recommend even to
their biggest clients.
</P>
<P>
   SQL 7 is indeed a ``good enough'' database, according to Betsy
Burton, a consultant at Gartmore. It will support
online-transaction processing by about 500 concurrent users.
</P>
<P>
   That number will grow when Windows 2000 is launched towards the
end of this year and Intel's powerful new Xeon processors also
become available.
</P>
<P>
   But, as always with Microsoft, the database's success will
depend less on its own qualities than on the company's sheer market
power.
</P>
<P>
   SQL 7 will be bundled with other Microsoft products, such as
BackOffice, attracting price-conscious companies. A further $600
million has been earmarked to sweeten contracts with inducements.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has nearly $20 billion in cash, waiting to be siphoned
into grabbing extra market share when needed. It will also use the
clout it gets from the NT operating system to win the backing of
hardware firms.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most crucially, Microsoft will have strong support from
the dominant ERP supplier, SAP, because of the German firm's own
rivalry with Oracle in the business-applications market.
</P>
<P>
   Against such an onslaught, many firms would panic. And for
Sybase and Informix, relative minnows of the database industry, the
prospects indeed look cloudy. But Oracle is not without advantages
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   SQL 7 has fewer features than Oracle 8, the latest release of
Oracle's database, and it cannot match its performance. In
particular, Oracle 8 will support a couple of thousand, as opposed
to a few hundred, concurrent users.
</P>
<P>
   With Unix now the preferred platform for ``mission critical''
applications, SQL 7's restriction to running only on NT guarantees
Oracle a lock on the high end of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle also has a large installed base. It dominates the Unix
market and provides over 40 percent of the databases that run on
NT. Oracle also claims that 87 percent of Fortune 500 companies
have an Oracle database; and that today a majority of ERP
applications run on Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Because database customers do not like to chop and change, it is
almost inconceivable that Oracle users will suddenly switch to SQL
7, however tempting the price.
</P>
<P>
   But what gives Oracle most confidence is the conviction that
computing is moving its way. Although Ellison was wrong about the
network computer, he is probably right to say that ``the Internet
changes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracle is betting on a type of Internet computing in which
applications are centrally managed, backed up and administered.
Users will gain access to information and applications using a
browser that can run on a personal computer or an even simpler
device.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle may charge more than Microsoft, but it says that the
extra costs of running SQL 7 on NT more than offset any saving. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To ram home the message, Oracle has this month released Oracle
8i, which is designed to be not just a database, but a complete
platform for Internet computing.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle believes that the rigors of doing business on the
Internet are creating a demand for ever more sophisticated database
technology, and that 8i will be a natural choice for electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Firms now need not only to give their employees access to a
database, but also to extend parts of their database to customers
through corporate ``extranets'' or the public Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With customers doing their own ordering and billing through the
Internet, databases must be able to handle vast numbers of
concurrent users and provide information fast.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle claims that the ten most-visited consumer websites,
including Yahoo! and America Online, are powered by its databases,
as are the ten biggest business websites (with one exception:
www.ibm.com). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oracle 8i should tighten the company's grip on the exploding
e-commerce database market, where IBM is its main competitor. But
it has another purpose too.
</P>
<P>
   By incorporating software that allows traditional files to be
stored and managed by the database, Oracle 8i also removes the need
for a big, all-purpose operating system, such as Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize this, Oracle has joined Sun Microsystems to create
an Intel-based server, called the ``Oracle 8i appliance,'' with an
Oracle database and its own simple operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to use out of the box, this, Oracle says, is a cheaper and
less complex alternative to a database that runs on NT, because it
minimizes the cost and complication of the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Several large computer makers, including Compaq, Hewlett-Packard
and Dell, have already said they will sell their own versions of
the appliance.
</P>
<P>
   With much of their distribution aimed at small and medium-sized
firms, the machine will take the fight to Microsoft. As Merv
Adrian, an analyst with Giga Information Group, puts it,
``Microsoft is playing the commodity card, but Oracle has gone one
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Who _ apart from customers _ will win this database war? The
answer depends to some extent on Windows 2000. Until it is
established, SQL 7 will be a capable, cheap database in search of
an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   More decisive, however, will be the speed with which the
Internet approach to computing that Oracle preaches takes off.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Oracle not only remains in pole position, but has the
more compelling vision. That said, few firms can play catch-up to
more devastating effect than Microsoft. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a devastating act of violence in the volatile North
Caucasus region, a powerful bomb ripped through the center of a
market in Vladikavkaz on Friday, killing 62 people and wounding
100.
</P>
<P>
   Top law-enforcement officials, who left Moscow to go to the
scene, said the explosion was ``unequivocally a terrorist act.'' A
grim President Boris Yeltsin, offering condolences to the victims'
families in a special television message, vowed to wage a merciless
campaign against those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing, coming on the heels of yet another brazen
kidnapping in nearby Chechnya and other violent episodes in the
region, was a reminder of how little control Moscow has over its
southern borderlands, which have been exhausted and impoverished by
wars and lawlessness since the breakup of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing was in the capital of northern Ossetia, which was
the scene of ethnic clashes between Ossetians and the Ingush in the
early 1990s that culminated in mass evacuations of Ingush and
lingering bitterness, with the situation exacerbated by criminal
gangs and an easy access to weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no indication Friday who was responsible for the
explosion, and no group claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes from the market shown on Russian television Friday
night looked like a massacre, with dismembered bodies strewn across
bloodied rubble. According to reports, 15 people were killed
instantly when the bomb went off at 11:40 a.m., near a stall where
two long lines of shoppers had formed to buy potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just come out of the cellar when a powerful explosion
went off,'' said one resident, interviewed Friday night on
television. ``I sat down, and when I got up again, I saw such a
horrible picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Vladikavkaz put out an urgent appeal for blood
donations, as the city's hospitals struggled to cope with the
steady flow of victims brought in from the market, most with
shrapnel wounds. Two of the wounded were children, television news
reported Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The timing and location of the bomb suggested that it had been
deliberately set to cause maximum damage and death. It was meant to
be ``intimidating and was aimed at destabilization,'' said
Alexander Zdanovich, spokesman for the Federal Security Services.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported seeing two young men running out of the
central market shortly before the bomb went off. Both Sergei
Stepashin, Russia's interior minister, and Federal Security
Services chief Vladimir Putin arrived at the scene Friday afternoon
to start the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Vladikavkaz is near Russia's border with Georgia, and about 30
miles from Chechnya, the breakaway region that has been engulfed by
banditry and kidnappings since its 1996 victory in a war with the
Russian army. The violence in Chechnya has caused international
concern, particularly after kidnappers cut off the heads of four
employees of a British telecommunications firm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aslan Maskhadov, president of Chechnya, issued a statement
expressing condolences for those killed in Vladikavkaz, and
offering to assist in the search for the criminals. Maskhadov and
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov had been scheduled to meet
soon to discuss cooperation in the region, particularly regarding
kidnapping and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Gennady Spigun, the representative of the Russian
interior ministry in Chechnya, was recently seized by gunmen who
took him off a plane on the runway at Grozny, the Chechen capital,
an act that worsened Moscow's relations in the region. In response
to the kidnapping, Stepashin, the Russian interior minister,
threatened to punish Chechnya's rebel warlords, and to impose
economic sanctions against the region if Spigun was not released.
Two weeks later, the general is still being held, reportedly for a
huge ransom, but Moscow has not followed up on its threats.
</P>
<P>
   Regional leaders have sought increasingly to take power in their
own hands, in some places organizing vigilante groups, in others
sidestepping federal laws. Chechnya itself, which has declared its
independence from Russia, has adopted the Islamic legal system, or
Sharia, and recently staged a public execution, even though Russia
has formally dropped the death penalty to comply with European
human rights standards.
</P>
<P>
   Regional leaders have implored Moscow to come up with a coherent
policy for the region, and to carry it through. ``Does Russia have
any policy in the Caucasus?'' Maskhadov, the Chechen president,
asked in a recent interview in the Moscow newspaper Komsomolskaya
Pravda. ``I have always wanted to find this out from Russian
leaders and never got any coherent answers.''

 &HT;    Temple rolls to date with Devils
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In what has been an unconventional
career, Temple coach John Chaney invoked some unconventional wisdom
after Friday night's NCAA East Regional semifinals. For his Owls,
Chaney hopes the fourth time is the charm.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney's sixth-seeded team from Philadelphia used relentless
defense and timely technical fouls by Purdue to turn what was
supposed to a tough game into a laugher, routing the Boilermakers
77-55 at the Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Temple (24-10), in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1993,
advances to Sunday's championship game to play No. 1 Duke where a
win would put Chaney into his first Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of beating Duke are very much against Temple, but
history says the Owls are due to win a regional championship. In
1988 they reached the East championship game and lost to No. 2
Duke. In 1991 they lost in the East finals to North Carolina. In
1993 they fell in the West championship game to Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Now all the Owls have to do is beat a 35-1 team on a 30-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   As the final minutes wound down, the Temple fans began yelling:
``We want Duke! We want Duke!''
</P>
<P>
   Temple will get Duke on Sunday at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most points Temple had scored since an 85-78 win over
St. Joseph's on Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue (21-13), the No. 10 seed in this regional, didn't have to
look far to find where it let the game slip away.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers were up 11-7 at the 14-minute mark of the first
half when they were hit with two technical fouls in the span of 19
seconds. The first came against Jaraan Cornell, who was nailed
after throwing an elbow. Then coach Gene Keady was given a
technical by official John Clougherty for protesting a little too
strongly.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the smoke had cleared, Temple had made five of six
free throws and had put together a 13-0 run to lead 20-11.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive three-pointers by Mark Karcher gave the Owls a 30-18
lead with 8:18 left in the first half. The Temple lead would grow
to as many as 19 before the Owls settled for a 47-32 advantage at
the intermission.
</P>
<P>
   It was Temple's highest point total at halftime all season. The
Owls are averaging only 66.4 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue never made even a token gesture of getting back in the
game in the second half as Temple opened the period with a 14-4 run
that expanded the lead to 25, 61-36, at the 13:24 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Then it simply became a matter of how bad the beating would be.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue had lost five of its six games coming into the NCAA
Tournament, but upset seventh-seeded Texas and second-seeded Miami
to reach the round of 16 for the fourth time this decade.
