<HEADLINE> Encouragement on Workers' Consumption Cooperatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to improve and
increase workers' consumption cooperatives which provide relief to
the lives of impoverished workers, vice premiers Zou Jiahua and Li
Lanqing said today.
</P>
<P>
They made the remarks to representatives at a symposium of the
All-China Workers' Consumption Cooperatives, which opened today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Workers' consumption cooperatives were established by workers
themselves to bring them economic benefits by cutting down the
number of links in the retail chain. There are more than 6,000
such cooperatives across China, with more than five million member
workers.
</P>
<P>
"Close attention should be paid to solving living problems of
impoverished workers, which is pivotal to maintaining the
stability of work forces and society," Zou Jiahua said at the
working meeting.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing said that the cooperatives can offer wide-range
services and have a great potential for development. They should
adhere to the principle of low profits, providing service, and
bringing people convenience and relief.
</P>
<P>
"They should be combined with a modern business form of chain
stores to push them to a higher level," he emphasized.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank
(ADB) said it is ready to contribute to the funding
of power generation and distribution projects contained in
Egypt's fourth five-year plan, starting next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Energy Maher Abaza said
today the Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire)-based bank is also prepared to
finance the electrical grid linkup projects between the Arab
Maghreb countries.
</P>
<P>
The bank has extended loans totaling 600 million U.S. dollars
to the energy sector over the past few years, he added after his
meeting with visiting ADB Board Chairman Omar Kabash and his
accompanying delegation.
</P>
<P>
The bank will fund projects in west of Cairo, Arish in northern
Sinai, Damietta in northern Nile Delta along with the national
plan for rural electrification and studies to use solar energy at
a large scale, he added.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the timetable and executive programs of these
projects during the meeting, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
An ADB representative will be present in the meetings of the
electricity ministers from the Arab Maghreb countries, namely
Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, except Mauritania,
Abaza said.
</P>
<P>
Spain and Italy, whose power grids will be connected to the
Arab Maghreb network, will also attend the meetings to be held in
Tunisia in March, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank also approved a grant to fund the studies of economic
feasibility for electricity connection between Egypt and Zaire as
part of the joint African grid projects, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The 76-member bank, created at the Conference of Ministers of
African Countries in Khartoum, Sudan, in 1963, provides finance
for agricultural, transport and public facilities projects
submitted by African governments.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Keep Nuclear Potential, Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Rodionov said here today that Russia has to maintain its strategic
nuclear potential as a deterrent against aggressive designs on
Russia and other former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an international conference on strategic
partnership and military-political integration among member states
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Rodionov stressed
that there are sources of military threat to the 12 CIS countries,
all of which are former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister mentioned the U.S. efforts to maintain its
world leadership with the assistance of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) as one of the sources of potential danger to
CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
"NATO, which has taken the strategic decision to expand
eastwards, is a source of military danger which can evolve into a
direct military threat," Rodionov pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The cold war is officially over but its geopolitical
goals and the hidden mechanism continue influencing relations
between countries."
</P>
<P>
"The disintegration of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact,
the reduction of the economic and military-political potential of
CIS member states made it possible for the United States and its
allies to expand their spheres of enfluence and fill the vacuum in
the markets where Russian goods used to prevail," Rodionov said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Russia and other CIS countries have also been
threatened from the south. "Individual Asian countries, as well as
permanently increasing amounts of offensive weapons stockpiled in
this region are also a source of military threat," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and Japan are
enlarging their spheres of influence and trying to play down the
role of CIS countries in tackling key regional problems.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that numerous countries "such as Turkey, Pakistan
and Japan" are trying to take advantage of the new situation
around former Soviet republics.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Offers to Pay Wage Arrears to Servicemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that he was determined to find a solution to the
problems of delayed pensions, wages, benefits and salaries to
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
In his first national radio address since returning to the
Kremlin, he said the measures taken by the government up to now
have failed to solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the state debt is still great and the living
standards (of the servicemen) unacceptably low."
</P>
<P>
He said he will use all his power to seek a quick solution,
adding that a full and timely collection of taxes is of vital
importance to correcting arrears of wages and pensions.
</P>
<P>
Promising to restore order on the market of alcoholic drinks,
he said, "those selling alcoholic drinks have built up an enormous
capital, but do not pay taxes."
</P>
<P>
An end must be put to the squandering of the state treasury, he
noted, and "time has come to deal rigorously with those who live
at state expense, to be more exact, at the expense of ordinary
citizens."
</P>
<P>
He also charged the Prosecutor-General's Office and the Control
Department to give him a detailed report on the exposed instances
of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
"The procedure is simple and strict: those officials who
misappropriate state money will be sent to prison and those who
cannot work efficiently will be dismissed."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Yeltsin returned to the Kremlin and resumed his work
after a rehabilitation period following a heart by-pass surgery
last month.

<HEADLINE> New Method of Sending Scholars Abroad Proved Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese education
official said today in Beijing that the country's new method of
sending scholars abroad has proved to be effective.
</P>
<P>
"It is a key step in reforming the way of sending people abroad
for further studies and training, and has resulted in positive
effects at home and abroad, winning favorable comments from all
sides," Wei Yu, vice minister of the State Education Commission
(SEC) told a national conference that opened today.
</P>
<P>
Wei is also the director of the China Scholarship Council
(CSC), a non-profit institution established in June, 1996 to take
over the SEC's tasks of handling affairs related to international
studies.
</P>
<P>
According to the new method, introduced in April, any Chinese
person who wants to get state financial support to study abroad
can submit a personal application and go through a selection
procedure by a panel of relevant experts.
</P>
<P>
If selected, they must sign an agreement with the state to
pledge to return home after completing their overseas studies.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the CSC announced its plan to select and send 1,500
people throughout the country to study abroad at state expense
next year.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with the past, the number of candidates is on the
rise, and the treatment for scholars studying abroad will be
improved," Wei claimed.
</P>
<P>
Regarding science and technology as a vital factor in economic
development, China used to prefer to send people abroad for
engineering or technical studies.
</P>
<P>
"Under the current situation, however, China has a more urgent
need for masters of economics and international law," Wei noted,
adding that it is also necessary for the country to learn about
cultural and social progress in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
She also revealed that next year the CSC will ensure a number
of scholars from areas inhabited by ethnic minorities are selected
and sent abroad. Preferential treatment will also be given to some
key research units and outstanding talents.
</P>
<P>
The CSC, which will start to accept applications next April, is
expected to complete the selection and announce the list of chosen
candidates in late August.
</P>
<P>
Education officials from 43 central departments, all provinces,
autonomous regions, and municipalities, and a number of Beijing
colleges and universities, attended today's conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Jia Qinglin, acting Mayor of
Beijing, China's capital, announced today that the city is to
launch a drive to become the "information capital" of China.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that developing an information industry is a global
trend. As the capital of China, Beijing has many advantages in
transmitting and exchanging information and should become the
country's leading information center.
</P>
<P>
Over recent years, the information industry has employed 44
percent of the labor force in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The information transmission network has developed rapidly,
with the number of telephone switchboards in the city providing up
to 3.8 million lines. The telephone penetration rate has reached
28 percent, while the urban figure amounts to 35.5 percent. The
number of mobile subscribers has risen to 160,000.
</P>
<P>
To carry out the project, Jia stressed that the leadership
should be strengthened, short and long term plans made, and the
construction of information infrastructure facilities speeded
up.

<HEADLINE> Song Jian on Closing Small Polluting Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Song Jian
today called for effective measures to speed up the closing of 15
kinds of small enterprises that have caused serious pollution to
the environment.
</P>
<P>
"This is a key to reaching our country's goal for environmental
protection in the next century," Song, who is also the director of
the Environmental Protection Commission under the State Council,
China's cabinet, told a session of the commission in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the joint efforts of the government and the
people, pollution control on the Huai River, a major river in east
China severely polluted by small enterprises along its banks, has
achieved satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
"To make the river clean and potable again, however, still
needs more time and more efforts," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental protection is an arduous and complicated cause,
and we have just declared an all-round war against pollution."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the State Council has made a very correct and
timely decision to have all small polluting enterprises across the
country closed within a limited period of time.
</P>
<P>
"Experience tells us that the 15 kinds of small enterprises
ordered to be closed have made small contributions to local
economic growth, but brought about devastating results on the
environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The work of closing small polluting enterprises might harm
some short-term interests, and be met with interference or
hindrance," he conceded, "But we must be far-sighted, and
implement the State Council decision resolutely."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that next year all enterprises in the flow area of
the Huai River must meet state standards for waste discharge, and
called on scientists and technicians to help township industries
in restructuring, and achieving a shift in the mode of economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
China has now closed 80.5 percent of the 15 kinds of small
enterprises blamed for seriously polluting the environment.

<HEADLINE> Equal Rights for Married Couples Urged in  Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Women
Lawyers Association today called for raising marriage age limit
for females to 18 from 15 and equal rights for married couples in
managing common property.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the association said the
above stated demands are among proposals it has submitted to the
Ethiopian parliament and regional councils for the improvement of
some articles in the civil code and international human rights
law.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, the other proposals include: the
registration of married couples must be an obligation, and the
disputes of married couples must be tried at regular courts.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent study carried out in some areas of
Ethiopia, early marriage of women is universal.
</P>
<P>
The study indicated that 13 percent of women marry before they
are 15 years old and 39 percent of women marry at the age of
between 15 and 17. This showed that more than 50 percent of the
women marry before they are 18 years old.

TOKYO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government today
has worked out a four-year program on administrative reform in a
bid to improve its operation in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The 1997-2000 reform program, which is designed to guide Japan
into the 21st century, focuses on streamlining and adjusting
ministries of the central government.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the Japanese government will submit bills on
the reform to the yearly session of the new Diet slotted to open
early next year.
</P>
<P>
Also under the program, the government will have to call for
publication of financial statements of the publicly-funded
corporations, a move long expected by the public.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government will merge the Japanese Research
Institute for Asian Economy and the Japan External Trade
Organization into one before July 1, 1998, and allow the Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation to enter the
international telecome market.
</P>
<P>
An investigation committee will be set up to carry out dramatic
changes in the system of national public service personnel.

<HEADLINE> British Side Urged Not to Make Trouble (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article says it is well-known that the establishment of the
Provisional Legislative Council is a result of the British side
running counter to stipulations in the Sino-British Joint
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
A "through-train" arrangement would have been achieved, if the
British side had fulfilled its commitment, and abided by the Joint
Declaration and the principles in line with the Basic Law, as well
as the agreements and understanding reached between the two sides
through diplomatic channels, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
However, some people including Governor Chris Patten insisted
on the "constitutional package", which led to the sabotage of the
"through-train" arrangement, it says.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that during 17 rounds of talks, the British
side clung obstinately to its position, bringing an end to the
talks despite the Chinese side's patience.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances it was impossible to realize the
"through-train" arrangement, the article says, adding that the
Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the
Hong Kong SAR suggested the establishment of the Provisional
Legislative Council according to the Basic Law and the decisions
adopted at the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee endorsed the suggestion and decided
to establish the Provisional Legislative Council, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The decision is entirely fair, reasonable and legitimate, as it
aimed at maintaining the Joint Declaration, ensuring the smooth
transition, and avoiding a legal vacuum, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It is a real regret that the British side still clings to its
wrong stance, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The British side also put forward the opinion that the Chinese
side should make it clear that the Provisional Legislative Council
does not function before July 1, 1997, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Chinese side has repeatedly pledged that the
Provisional Legislative Council will formulate some laws
absolutely necessary for the Hong Kong SAR after 1997, so as not
to hold up the effective operation of the SAR because of the legal
vacuum. The laws to be formulated by the Provisional Legislative
Council will not go into effect before July 1, 1997, and it will
not infringe upon the legislative authority of the Legislative
Council of the British Hong Kong government, the article stresses.
</P>
<P>
In raising such questions, the British side attempts to provoke
new disputes and mislead the world opinion, the article points
out.

<HEADLINE> British Side Urged not to Make Trouble (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article says that it is really ridiculous that the British
side is attempting to play an international card, and even asserts
that it will unite some countries to exert pressure on the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
How arrogant Britain was when it forcefully occupied Kowloon in
Hong Kong with armed forces more than a century ago. However, the
time when colonialists practised hegemonism has gone forever, the
article says.
</P>
<P>
Even until now, the British side still can not be free from
colonialist feelings.
</P>
<P>
Those with little general knowledge are aware that the question
of Hong Kong is a matter between the two governments of China and
Britain before it returns to the motherland. And Hong Kong will be
an internal affair of China after its return, and no foreign
government will have the right to interfere in China's affairs,
the article stresses.
</P>
<P>
The article says that the British Foreign Office's statement
prior to the establishment of the Provisional Legislative council
was meaningless.
</P>
<P>
As to Chris Patten's attack on the election of the Provisional
Legislative Council as a "farce", the article cites the fact that
33 members of the present Hong Kong Legislative Council have been
elected as members of the Provisional legislative Council of the
Hong Kong SAR as having given him "a good answer."
</P>
<P>
The article advises the British side to see the reality and do
something beneficial to Hong Kong's smooth transition. Such action
will be wise and in accord with Britains' long-term interests, the
article concludes.

<HEADLINE> Iran To Impose AIDS Test on Foregin Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian health authorities
decided to impose AIDS test on foreign travelers to defuse the
danger of spread of the disease, an official report said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Health Minister Mohammad Esma'eel Akbari said the tests
will be done at clinical centers at the ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
"Specific information about the place where they would reside
is registered and if need be they would be contracted later,"
the Iranian official was quoted by the Persian-English weekly
Kayhan Havai.
</P>
<P>
Akbari said that Iranians who stay out of the country for
three months would be also requested for the AIDS test when they
return home.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the AIDS test for foreign travelers reflects
the growing worry by the Iranian government for the AIDS problem
in the country since 122 Iranians had died of the disease in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The health authorities said that some 260 AIDS patients were
living in Iran. Of them 233 were men and 27 were women, but no
word on the nationalities of the patients was reported.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Ali Reza Marandi has been under fire by the
press for not instituting a system whereby people with AIDS could
be checked upon their arrival in the country.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for Aid to Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has produced
an appeal for 92 million U.S. dollars to aid emergency and
recovery activities in war-torn Liberia, a Nigerian newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Of the money, about 31 million dollars will be used to continue
the relief activities for civilians and to meet the basic needs of
ex-combatants, the paper said, quoting UN Department of
Humanitarian Affairs (DHA). And the remaining part will be
invested to boost community reintergration and peace-building.
</P>
<P>
"While fighting continues in many areas, the prospects for
peace have been reinvigorated with the signing of the latest Abuja
agreement on August 17, and the beginning of the demobilization
process on November 22," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Since war broke out in Liberia in 1989, an estimated 150,000
people have been killed, and more than two-thirds of its pre-war
population of about 2.3 million forced to flee their homes, either
displaced within the country or escaping to neighboring countries
as refugees.

<HEADLINE> Attention Urged to Placement of Retired Military Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today
called on Chinese authorities to ensure that retired military
officers are well looked after in their old age.
</P>
<P>
He urged governments in localities to pay closer attention to
accommodation placements for retired officers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told a meeting, called to cite advanced workers and units
of placement of retired officers nationwide, that the suitable
placement of retired military officers is a long-term important
political task for both military and governments in localities.
</P>
<P>
Retired officers have made great contributions to the founding
of New China, to the adding of strength to its national defense
and military construction, and to its social and economic
development, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
The president called on local governments at all levels and on
military units to redouble their efforts to deal with various
issues related to retired officers.
</P>
<P>
"Those who are involved in the work should always show great
concern for the political and daily lives of retired officers, and
let them lead a happy life in their remaining years," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
A recent report shows that governments in localities have
placed more than 70,000 retired officers since 1981. Over 1,400
special living compounds for retired military officers have been
built nationwide, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting in Beijing, some 600 outstanding retired
military officers and placement workers, and 87 outstanding
organizations for the placement of retired officers, were
cited.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain has been urged not to
make trouble, but to act in a beneficial way for the smooth
transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Only by doing so will it be sensible for the long-term
interests of Britain, says a Xinhua commentator's article issued
today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The article describes the election of the Provisional
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) as new progress in the preparation for the establishment of
the Hong Kong SAR, following the selection of the first Chief
Executive.
</P>
<P>
Most of the media as well as people from various circles of
Hong Kong held that the Provisional Legislative Council is broadly
representative, and is certain to play an important role in
ensuring the normal operation of the SAR government, the article
says.
</P>
<P>
But just before the election of the Provisional Legislative
Council, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind once again
voiced opposition to the establishment of the Provisional
Legislative Council in a statement, it says.
</P>
<P>
He denounced the Chinese side, claiming China had violated the
Sino-British Joint Declaration, asserting that the International
Court may be asked to judge whether the Provisional Legislative
Council is legal or not, adds today's article.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the London-based "Financial Times",
Rifkind also attacked the election of the Provisional Legislative
Council as a "foolish step", the article says.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind also asserted in his statement that Britain's policy
toward Hong Kong is backed by the Sino-British Joint Declaration,
and the Provisional Legislative Council does not conform to the
stipulations in the Joint Declaration, the article notes.

BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Zhu
Rongji has urged the building of an effective modern supervision
system to oversee state property.
</P>
<P>
Zhu sent a letter to an on-going national working conference on
administration of the state property, calling for redoubled
efforts to enhance the control and supervision over state property.
</P>
<P>
Great achievements have been made in controlling and overseeing
state property in the past few years, Zhu said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
"The administration of state property is a glorious and hard
task," he said, expressing his hope that officials concerned will
work hard in an earnest and down-to-earth style in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Youcai, director of the State Administration of State
Property, spoke at the meeting, stressing the importance of
building such a supervision system.
</P>
<P>
Supervision of state property should be done in accordance with
the law, while there is also a need to build up a body of
talented, honest supervision personnel, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Computers and advanced equipment should be introduced into the
supervision system to enhance the dynamic control and analysis of
property maintenance as well as changes, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Golan Heights Indispensable for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said today that the Golan Heights is essential
to Israel, not only for security value, but for its water
resources, according to a report of the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the statement when he was addressing a Knesset
(parliament) conference marking 30 years of Jewish settlement in
the Golan Heights since Israel snatched the territory from Syria
during the 1967 Middle East War. He said that in recent weeks,
tension on the Syrian border has eased.
</P>
<P>
The rightwing premier said while peace with Syria will be a
major step toward ending its conflicts with Arab neighbors, it
must not seek peace at any price.
</P>
<P>
The Golan Heights was formally annexed by Israel in 1981 when
the Knesset passed a ruling extending the Israeli laws to the
1,200-square-kilometer Syrian plateau. In order to establish
facts on the ground, Israel has encouraged Jews to settle in the
Golan. Now there are about 13,000 settlers there altogether.
</P>
<P>
The late Labor prime minister Yitzhak Rabin informally
suggested that in a package of the final peace arrangements,
Israel would return the Golan Heights of strategic importance to
Damascus. But the Likud-led government has repeatedly declared
"no way" since it came to power in June.

Bathhouses, canteens and apartment buildings for single workers
provide better services, taking care of their daily lives, and
leaving them free of worries at work.

"What the mine has done for us allows us to worry less at
work," Duan said.
</P>
<P>
The coal mine placed importance on giving employees equal
rights to participate in the management of the whole enterprise.
</P>
<P>
"We have to think about whether our employees' rights are
protected and whether they are satisfied before we make any
decision," said Hu Qingyong, secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party committee at the coal mine.
</P>
<P>
The congress of workers' representatives has been playing a
leading role in deciding the things that are related to the
interests of workers. These include appraising the work of leaders
and promoting ordinary workers to leading positions.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 items of advice for improving working methods and
facilities have been submitted to the mine's heads through the
congress in the past three years, with 95 percent adopted.

ADDIS ABABA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Women
Lawyers Association today called for raising marriage age limit
for females to 18 from 15 and equal rights for married couples in
managing common property.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the association said the

"Next year will also see the Chinese Communist Party hold its
15th national congress, which will push the great cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics to the new century

"Under the special situation of the coming new year, the
departments of united front will face a very tough job," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Summons U.S. Ambassador over Bomb Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Foreign Affairs
Ministry today summoned the U.S. Ambassador Walter Carrington in
its capital Abuja over the recent U.S. State Department statement
warning of more bombings in Nigeria in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Tom Ikimi told the media
afterwards that Nigeria wishes to share any information the
U.S. might have on the prospects of more bombings in the country.
</P>
<P>
Following two bomb explosions in Lagos last week, the
U.S. State Department issued a statement saying that there would
be more bombings between late this month and mid-January next year
and warned its citizens in Nigeria to be careful.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the U.S. statement gave the impression
that it possesses information which it should share with Nigeria
for their mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for me to know so that we could have this
information, so that we could take action," Ikimi said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. statement has "created hysteria among
the citizenry and discouraged our traditional friends who normally
visit Nigeria to spend their holidays at this time of the year."
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the concern of the Nigerian government on
the activities of Ambassador Carrington, particularly his
preference for dealing with the anti-government groups, adding
that Nigeria expects that he would engage in activities that
would promote healthier relations between the two countries.

<P>
HEFEI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- An old coal miner, Duan
Changqiu, at Liuqiao Colliery in east China's Anhui Province, has
experienced many changes in his daily work and life in the past
several years.
</P>
<P>
He has witnessed the coal mine stepping out of the shadow of a
decade of losing money, and becoming a leading profit maker in
Huaibei City.
</P>
<P>
He has seen the enthusiasm of his fellow workers greatly
aroused after strict management rules were adopted and poor
working and living conditions improved.
</P>
<P>
In newly-built residential areas, dusty roads became cleaner
and greenery replaced trash piles. More young workers preferred
spending their spare time attending training courses, in stead of
idling or fighting in the street.
</P>
<P>
"All these changes are a result of our efforts to promote
ethical and cultural progress," Duan said.
</P>
<P>
The coal mine has become famous in China because of its
achievements in accelerating economic growth together with
cultural progress, in line with the nationwide drive initiated by
the central government to spur economic growth and social progress.

<P>
Established in 1981, the 6,000-staff mine never earned profits
until in 1993. Then heads of the enterprise reformed internal
management systems to encourage miners to work harder and more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
The mine produced 1.5 million tons of coal, earning more than
100 million yuan (12 million US dollars) this year, compared with
1.4 million tons and some 70 million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The mine has been chosen as a national model enterprise for the
best management in coal production and outstanding ideological
work among workers.
</P>
<P>
"What makes us successful is we consider things from the points
of view of every employee," said Jia Chuanhai, who was appointed
head of the mine in 1991.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Industry Recovers from Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China's textile industry is
hailing a dawn of recovery from a year-long depression, though it
is still running in red for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Wu Wenying, president of the China National Textile Council
(CNTC), told a national work conference today that this year, the
difficulties suffered by the industry had not only roused the
attention of central committee of the Communist Party of China,
State Council and local governments at all levels, but also become
a focus for society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
A package of emergency measures were launched by central and
local governments to help rescue the industry from the
depression. Included were a special loan of seven billion yuan
issued by the central government for cotton purchasing, and the
reform of an inter-provincial cotton supply system. The local
governments also launched a number of preferential policies
guaranteeing a smooth structure readjustment in the industry.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by CNTC, economic loss margins
have been largely narrowing since the spring of this year. Losses
of the second quarter were 14 per cent less than the first three
months, and the third quarter registered another decrease of 16
per cent. By last October, textile enterprises in 38 large and
medium-sized cities even began to make profits.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that accompanying the revival, the reform of the
industrial structure also took a leap from the beginning this
year.
</P>
<P>
A "go west" program to move textile manufacturing from east
China to west and central regions is now in full swing. A project
for the transfer of 230,000 weaving spindles from Shanghai,
Shandong and Guangdong to landlocked Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region passed final appraisal from bankers. Moreover, Beijing has
signed a cooperation agreement with Central China's Henan Province
to transfer textile manufacturing equipment.
</P>
<P>
In the mean time, debt-ridden state-owned enterprises are
experiencing extensive reform in both production and management
styles this year.
</P>
<P>
A provisional survey in 58 cities shows that by the end of this
year 280 textile enterprises have been merged, and more than 100
conglomerates have been launched, with state-owned capital of 39
billion yuan re-organized, and more than two million workers
shifted to other industries.
</P>
<P>
So far, the stock of more than 40 Chinese textile companies
has gone public on stock markets, accounting for nine per
cent of country's listed companies.
</P>
<P>
However, the whole industry is still far from being profitable,
though it has almost drawn the continuous decline to an end,
according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Vowing to make "concrete progress" in profit turnover, Wu said
that the readjustment of the industrial structure will be further
expanded next year, and the development of new products and
markets will be continued.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Massive Technological Innovation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China is undertaking a
200-billion-yuan massive technological innovation program in an
effort to create a group of internationally competitive large
businesses by the end of this century, a government official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"We will implement 500 major technological innovation projects
and strive to develop 5,000 important new products during the
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000)," Jiang Lu'an, director of
the Department of Technology and Equipment of the State Economic
and Trade Commission, said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that the commission is currently doing feasibility
studies and making selections, adding that the program will first
be implemented on a trial basis in two cities and 20 competitive
businesses that are in line with China's industrial policies.
</P>
<P>
"The program is aimed at improving the ability of China's large
and medium-sized enterprises in developing and applying major
technology as well as in digesting imported technology," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
This, in turn, will promote the restructuring of the product
mix and the industrial structure, he added.
</P>
<P>
He explained that a planned economy over the past decades has
made most Chinese enterprises lack incentives and a proper
mechanism to initiate strategic technological development on their
own.
</P>
<P>
"This sort of situation cannot meet the new need to establish a
market economic system and has harmed the growth of enterprises,"
Jiang warned.
</P>
<P>
He said that the centerpiece of the program is to sharpen the
competitive edge of Chinese enterprises by making them the subject
to make strategic policies, develop technology, make investments,
bear risks and distribute interests.
</P>
<P>
The key projects under the program will cover such sectors as
energy, machinery, electronics, transportation,
telecommunications, biological engineering and new industries with
policy support and able to cut energy consumption to the greatest
extent, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that investment in technological innovations during the
1996-2000 period will total 200 billion yuan (about 24 billion US
dollars), much more than during the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth implementation of the program, the
commission has formulated a guideline for national technological
innovations during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, according to
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Besides limited direct financial input, the central government
will support and encourage technological innovations mainly in the
form of preferential policy treatment, such tax breaks and
exemptions, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Products Quality Control Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China is to tighten quality
control over products across the country in 1997 to raise the
efficiency of enterprises, a senior government official said in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Li Chuanqing, director of the State Bureau of Technical
Supervision, told a national conference on technical supervision,
which started today, that the quality of Chinese products has been
greatly improved after years of efforts.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the general situation for quality control is
still not optimistic, and there remains a number of problems in
the quality of products, engineering projects, and services.
</P>
<P>
"There are still many complaints from consumers on product
quality, while fake and shoddy commodities can not be wiped out
from the market, despite continuous efforts," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said technical supervision work in 1997 should focus on
helping enterprises to adopt a scientific and advanced quality
control system.
</P>
<P>
"Technical supervision should also be expanded to the quality
of engineering projects and social services," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged technical supervision departments at all levels to
strengthen management, and toughen law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
"Emphasis should be laid on the supervision of key industrial
products, agricultural productive materials, and consumer goods
that are directly linked with public health and safety," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for enterprises whose products pass state quality
examination twice in a row to be publicly honored, while managers
of state enterprises that fail twice in the quality check should
be dismissed.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President to Leave Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said today he will be discharged from hospital Thursday,
three days after undergoing an operation on his neck to clear a
carotid block.
</P>
<P>
"I will be out (of the hospital) tomorrow, 8 a.m. after the
blood chemistry test," Ramos told reporters at the Makati Medical
Center here.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said doctors asked him and his wife to stay one more
night in the medical center to do a complete blood chemistry test
to check the level of his cholesterol, sugar and other components
in the blood.
</P>
<P>
The blood sample will be taken early Thursday after 12 hours of
fasting, the president said, adding that a blood chemistry taken
Tuesday indicated nothing wrong with his blood.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be in the office at 12 tomorrow very quietly," Ramos
said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' doctors said earlier significant cholesterol deposits
resulted in the blockage in Ramos' carotid artery.
</P>
<P>
The country's stock market tumbled Monday over the surprising
news of Ramos' operation performed that morning and rumors that
Ramos may need a heart surgery. But the market rebounded
considerably Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Stunned by the news, both businessmen and congressmen demanded
strongly that they should be informed of the state of the
president's health.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' hospitalization this week, the second in 10 days, has
raised concern about the state of his health among the country's
political and business communities. Doubts have arisen about
whether Ramos, 68, can serve out the rest of his six-year term,
due to end in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has been hospitalized from December 12 to 14 for what his
doctors said "a systemic viral infection."
</P>
<P>
Ramos' supporters intensified their campaign this month to
amend the country's Constitution to enable him to serve beyond
1998. But Ramos has said repeatedly that he will step down in
1998.

The central government plans to build irrigation, transport
projects and infrastructure facilities to tap natural resources in
poverty-stricken areas. Preferential policies on taxes and
exemptions will be granted in the areas to encourage
economically-developed areas and enterprises to cooperate with
their less developed counterparts. International cooperation to
help boost the economies of the poor areas will be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting Guangxi, Xie Fei found that Guangxi abounds in
natural resources, the people are diligent, and officials in high

</P>
<P>
"Both Guangdong and Guangxi have a common task of helping the
poor to climb out of poverty, and we shall make the success so long
as we learn from each other's strong points," Xie Fei said.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Guangdong will aid Guangxi's poor

<HEADLINE> Legislators Propose Reform to Administrative Supervision (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators today
proposed the reform of a self-check system within government
bodies to ensure decrees from the top are faithfully implemented.
</P>
<P>
The reform is also aimed at improving governmental efficiency
and weeding out corruption.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) raised the suggestions during the examination of a
draft law on administrative supervision. Their deliberations took
place in panel discussions at the ongoing NPC Standing Committee
session in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Currently, supervision bureaus are responsible for checking
government bodies of the same level, and even checking on the
officials they are responsible for supervising.
</P>
<P>
"It's something like a surgeon operating on himself, it's too
difficult," said Yang Jike, a member of the Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Yang and many other committee members said that the Ministry of
Supervision and supervision bureaus should have much more control
over the agencies under them than local governments have; and
local governments and their officials should therefore come under
supervision from supervising agencies above them.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing's most notorious corruption case, involving former
vice-mayor Wang Baosen, can best explain my point," Yang added.
Wang had abused financial matters for several years before the
exposure of his crime and his eventual suicide, without being
reported by the Beijing Municipal Supervision Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Xia Jiajun, lawmaker and professor from the China University of
Political Sciences and Law, said the Ministry of Supervision
should be empowered with more authoritative leadership.
</P>
<P>
Xia suggested that the ministry should be given the right to
hand out punishments. This would be in addition to the right to
trial, investigations, decision making, suggestions, and final
judgement concerning cases handled by agencies at the next level,
as decided by the current law draft.
</P>
<P>
An addition should also be made to spell out legal consequences
of taking reprisals against supervisory personnel, Xia added.

<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Better-off areas in east China
are helping their less developed counterparts in the west to join
them on the road to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide drive to shake off poverty as quickly as
possible, a whole range of unique relations has been formed.
</P>
<P>
It has seen wealthy provinces sharing their good fortune with
less developed areas, which has demonstrated that the two-way
collaboration is much more than charity - but a partnership in
progress.
</P>
<P>
Engineers, experts and technicians, as well as machinery and
equipment from coastal economically-developed areas are now found
in economically less developed areas, such as Yunnan, Guizhou,
Sichuan, Shaanxi, Qinghai provinces and Guangxi Zhuang, Ningxia
Hui, Xinjiang Uygur and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from economically developed provinces and cities in the
east have been heading west, and concluding a package of
aid-the-poor projects.
</P>
<P>
Xie Fei, leader of Guangdong Province, headed a recent
delegation to neighboring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to
discuss how to help the poor region to boost its economy.
</P>
<P>
Chen Huanyou and Zheng Silin, both leaders of Jiangsu
Province, visited poor areas in Shaanxi Province, while Zhao
Zhihao, head of Shandong Province, headed to Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region to talk about increasing economic
cooperation between the two areas.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Tianjin City and Gansu Province have settled 118
cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
"To encourage the east to help the west is another strategic
aid-the-poor policy of the central government, and the practice of
Deng Xiaoping's theory of 'encouraging a number of people and
areas to become well-off first, and then help those who are still
on the way to becoming well-off, to achieve a common prosperity in
the end," Qu Tianjun, said an official of the State Council,
China's highest governing body, who is in charge of poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Through years of efforts, the number of poor people with an
annual income under 530 yuan per capita has dropped to the present
65 million from 80 million in 1992. These people live mainly in
karst, arid, highland and desert areas, with adverse natural
conditions and poor transport access.
</P>
<P>
To help eradicate poverty and enable the poor to have adequate
food and clothing, the central government is to increase aid for
the poor from 10.8 billion yuan this year to 15.3 billion yuan a
year until 2000.

KUALA LUMPUR, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian police detained
16 men who tried to intrude into the embassies of France, Holland
and Sweden and the British High Commission here today.
</P>
<P>
The detained men, who were believed to be illegal immigrants
from Indonesia with no valid travel documents, were detained for
investigation, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the men began gathering outside the foreign
missions from about 9.30 a.m., reportedly to seek political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
A commotion broke out when they refused to obey police orders
to disperse.
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman said action might be taken against the men
under the Penal Code or under the Immigration Act.
</P>
<P>
They would be handed over to the immigration authorities to be
deported to Indonesia, he added.
</P>
<P>
The men also held a demonstration to protest against actions
taken to deport Indonesian illegal immigrants detained at the
Langkap temporary detention camp in Perak State, Northern
Malaysia.

Hu Min, another lawmaker, said a supervision agency should be

According to lawmaker Sun Tingfang, governmental supervision
work should come under supervision by the public, and supervision

"Such moves will serve as educational programs for the public

Government agencies are due to offer help to supervisory
bureaus, since most of the current problems in the public eye

Public security, auditing, taxation, as well as customs and

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Teachers Warn of New Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Academic Staff of Nigeria
Universities (ASNU) has warned of another strike if teachers
sacked after a six-month strike are not reinstated.
</P>
<P>
In a recent statement, the ASNU asked the public to hold
"university administrators responsible for whatever actions
academics may take to seek redress for the unjust treatment of our
colleagues."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian university teachers went on strike on May 9, demanding
higher salary and better funding of universities. The strike
paralyzed the country's higher education system and was called off
on October 25 by the union mainly to halt the exodus of students.
</P>
<P>
The statement listed "the spate of illegal and punitive
actions" against ASNU members, including the prevention of 50
academic staff of the Federal University of Technology in Owerri
from returning to their posts, the sacking of 162 teachers at the
Ogun University and the termination of appointment of union
officials.
</P>
<P>
It blamed university authorities for failing to understand the
circumstances that led to the suspension of the strike and
unwilling to build upon the fragile peace now exists in the
universities.
</P>
<P>
It warned that the academic staff would not stand-by and watch
their colleagues "being victimized for their patriotic role in the
principled struggle to make the university system a better one."

<HEADLINE> 1996 Overseas Investment in China To Reach 40 Billion Dollars (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Overseas investment in
China this year is expected to reach a record total of 40 billion
US dollars, despite a drop in the number of the approved
overseas-funded projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
This represents a 16 percent rise over 1995 though the number
of the approved projects is 20 percent smaller, official sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The major factor behind the growing investment is that many
overseas transnational firms have come to make investment in
China, according to an official in charge of overseas investment
in China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 400 transnational firms have entered the
Chinese market from 1992 up to now, and by the end of last year,
only some 200 more had invested in the country.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the transnational firms are from the US,
Japan and EU member countries, and over 200 of the
top 500 listed in the US Fortune magazine have helped fund
projects in China.
</P>
<P>
These transnational firms have been attracted by China's social
stability, strong momentum in economic growth, solid industrial
foundation and enormous market potentiality, as well as favorable
terms granted by the Chinese government, economists and trade
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The ideal environment for their investment also includes a
strict and daily complete legal system, complete and improved
service regulations, a government free from corruption and a
working process and style with transparency and high efficiency,
they added.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that in the first 11 months this year,
over 22,000 overseas-funded businesses were approved with a total
contractual investment of 66.5 billion US dollars, and 36.9
billion US dollars of the total investment have arrived and were
used.

</P>
<P>
During the same period, tens of thousands of deaf children have
learned to speak, and hundreds of thousands of children suffering
from polio have received treatment, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks at a recent ceremony to mark the opening
of a large Belgium-sponsored rehabilitation center for handicapped
children in Shenyang City of northeastern Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
Being the biggest developing country, China has some 60 million
handicapped people, who have been under the good care of the
government, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The federation and its local branches have acted as linkage
between the government and the masses of the handicapped people.
In the past eight years, China has mapped out a number of outlined
programs or plans to help the handicapped, providing them with
opportunities for rehabilitation, education and employment.
</P>
<P>
The federation, which has joined some major international
organizations for the handicapped, has forged ties with more than
100 welfare organizations in some 50 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Wang also expressed gratitude for the organizations of the
United Nations and charity institutions around the world for their
aid and assistance, which has enabled his federation to score
noticeable progress.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Tries to Ease Tension Between Government, Maronite Church (I) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
today made an effort to try to ease tension between the government
and Maronite church by attending a Christmas Day mass headed by
Patriarch Butros Sfeir, the spiritual leader of Lebanon's
Maronite Catholic community, in Bkirki, the site of the Maronite
church.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi, a Maronite, carried out his annual customary visit to
Bkirki half way up a seaside hill overlooking the
Christian-populated city of Jounieh, situated 20 kilometer north
of Beirut, amid mounting tension between the church and the
Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Conducting the Christmas sermon, Sfeir, who usually has the
final say in the country's affairs pertaining to interests of his
powerful community, urged the government "to protect the
citizens from a fear that they are living in a corrupt state."
</P>
<P>
"It is a right of the Christians to celebrate in an
atmosphere far away from worry and it is their right to have
their sentiments and their houses respected by the authorities,"
the Maronite patriarch told the president and an audience of
over 1,000 people this morning.
</P>
<P>
The tension between the church and the government, which was
sparked by a security crackdown following a wave of terror
attacks, was the leading story of the Beirut media this morning.
</P>
<P>
The security operation has been under attack by right-wing
politicians who complained that the bulk of those detained were
members of Christian opposition groups or known sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Sfeir's decision to abstain from Christmas
reception, the largest-circulated An-Nahar daily said in the
front-page banner headline: "Bkirki closed its doors in the
Christmas in protest against the prosecutions and days of
terror."
</P>
<P>
The Christian-owned Nida Al-Watan daily's banner headline
quoted Sfeir as asking: "What the state officials congratulate
me when my sons are in prison?"

<P>
"The season is meant to be one of joy and happiness, but in
reality it is one of fear and terror," Sfeir said in his
Christmas message issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the patriarch's dismay that prompted Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri to visit Bkirki Tuesday night in an effort to
placate Sfeir, Beirut's Daily Star newspaper reported in today's
issue.
</P>
<P>
Hariri told the patriarch that the recent security campaign
was forced by serious acts and evidence of a dangerous plot,
sources close to the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Sfeir answered that he supported the enforcement of law and
order, but some innocent people who had been detained by the
police should be freed to mark Christmas with their families.
</P>
<P>
Adnan Addoum, the state prosecutor, announced that most of
the detainees had been set free before the Christmas eve and
that only 11 people rounded up last week were still kept in
custody for further questioning.
</P>
<P>
Addoum earlier said that recent incidents "pointed to a plot
to undermine national security."
</P>
<P>
He said acts that had alarmed authorities included an attack
on a mini-bus transporting Syrian workers last week.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen sprayed the vehicle with machinegun fire as it drove
through Tabarja, 25 kilometers north of Beirut, and then fled the
scene. The driver was killed and a passenger was wounded.
</P>
<P>
Other incidents, Addoum said, included the detonation of
grenades to create panic among the people and distribution of
leaflets "which slandered senior government officials and
encouraged sectarian conflict."
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with an Arab press delegation Monday, President
Hrawi accused Israel of instigating the spate of terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
"A small group of Lebanese people are manipulated by Israel,
and Israel is trying to undermine (Lebanon's) internal peace,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
"But the Lebanese people in general are committed to
stability of their country and this small group will not be able
to destablize the nation as its plots will be confronted and
thwarted," Hrawi underlined.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, especially the south part of the country, is the last
active battle ground in the Arab-Israeli conflict.

<HEADLINE> PTA Travellers' Cheques To Be Phased out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Travellers' cheques issued by
the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) for East and Southern Africa
are set to be scrapped due to a decline in their value.
</P>
<P>
A statement released recently by R. Marambii, Chief Banking
Manager of the Central Bank of Kenya, said that sales of the
cheques will cease on December 31, 1996 in all member countries
of the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Travellers who bought the cheques before December 31, can
still encash them in 1997, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to phase out the cheques was made by a committee
of COMESA Central Bank Governors at an annual meeting held in
Maputo last month.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the usefulness of the cheques has
continued to decline as a result of the liberalization process
now taking place in all the COMESA member countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the PTA travellers' cheques had been of great benefit
in promoting travel and trade in the COMESA region during the
pre-liberalization time.
</P>
<P>
At the COMESA Central Bank Goveners' meeting, the governors
directed the PTA Bank to examine the possibility of transforming
the travellers' cheques instrument into regional credit card
which would be more effective.

<HEADLINE> China's Machinery Industry Braves ahead amid Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China's machinery industry is
expected to turnover a gross output value of 450 billion yuan this
year, an increase of 10 percent over 1995. The success comes
despite nearly half of the enterprises being loss-makers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Machine-building Industry (MMI),
production has been growing steadily, with the production and
marketing ratio picking up with each passing month.
</P>
<P>
The production and marketing ratio of machinery products stood
as high as 96 percent in the January-November period.
</P>
<P>
A MMI spokeswoman described the export of machinery and
electrical products as satisfactory this year, in spite of fierce
competition on the international market.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months, China exported 38 billion US
dollars-worth of machinery and electrical products, up 11 percent
from the previous year, accounting for one third of the country's
total export value, she said.
</P>
<P>
However, problems such as the large number of loss-making and
cash-strapped enterprises, and heavy debts among various
businesses, still remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, 46 percent of the machinery enterprises
were running in the red, with total losses jumping to 8.34 billion
yuan, soaring 48.5 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Four out of the nine major sectors; machine tools, heavy-duty
mining machinery, engineering machinery and basic components, all
showed an all-round loss.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the prospects in 1997, Bao Xuding, Minister of
Machine-building Industry said that the industry will "grow
steadily" next year, and is expected to reap a 10 percent increase
of output value from this year.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive and robust bounce-back is unlikely to be
possible, although the general situation looks good, he added.

BONN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- "Silent Night" in Frankfurt
turned out to be a nightmare as a bomb blasted a crowded local
church in Frankfurt at Christmas Eve, claiming three lives.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt police suspected that one of the dead was a suicide
bomber, who brought two grenades with her into the church and
detonated them shortly before midnight.
</P>
<P>
The suspected bomber were blown to pieces while two women
sitting next to her were also killed. Among the approximately 70
church-goers, some 10 people were injured, including a 12-year-old
girl who is still in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Local residents found the attack awful and could hardly believe
that such a thing was done on a day like this.
</P>
<P>
So far, police was still unable to identify the woman, who was
considered the prime suspect. And her motive is still unknown to
the living world.

PARIS, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Nearly 200,000 people once again demonstrated on Tuesday in
Belgrade at the call of the Serbian opposition, while President
Slobodan Milosevic organized about 100,000 people in a
counter-demonstration. Fifteen people were wounded, including one
wounded by gun bullets, in a dozen clashes which took place during
the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
-- In a letter addressed to French President Jacques Chirac,
the Algerian militant movement Armed Islamic Group said that it is
ready to "destroy" France and poses its conditions, which include
release of one of its leaders jailed in prison in Algeria and the
stop of cooperation between Paris and Algiers.
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday failed to reach an agreement on the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank town of
Hebron. Both sides are waiting for an intervention by the United
States to get out of the impasse.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Twenty-one days after the bombing of the RER Paris
underground train at Port Royal in central Paris, Algeria's
Islamic extremist group, Armed Islamic Group, made once again a
threat to France by asking President Jacques Chirac to intervene
with the Algerian government for the release of one of their
"emirs".
</P>
<P>
Saying that it would "destroy your country at all costs," the
GIA made the threat on the second anniversary of the hijacking of
an Air France Airbus passenger plane by a GIA commando in
Marseille.
</P>
<P>
-- Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic Tuesday organized a
counter-demonstration against the opposition in Belgrade by
bringing 100,000 supporters from around the country on passenger
coaches. Milosevic accused some foreign forces hostile to Serbia
of trying to destabilize the country, and described the opposition
as "the fifth column".

<HEADLINE> 1996 Overseas Investment in China To Reach 40 Billion Dollars (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment in China
this year is expected to reach a record total of 40 billion US
dollars, despite a drop in the number of the approved
overseas-funded projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
This represents a 16 percent rise over 1995 though the number
of the approved projects is 20 percent smaller, official sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The major factor behind the growing investment is that many
overseas transnational firms have come to make investment in
China, according to an official in charge of overseas investment
in China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 400 transnational firms have entered the
Chinese market from 1992 up to now, and by the end of last year,
only some 200 more had invested in the country.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the transnational firms are from the US,
Japan and EU member countries, and over 200 of the
top 500 listed in the US Fortune magazine have helped fund
projects in China.
</P>
<P>
These transnational firms have been attracted by China's social
stability, strong momentum in economic growth, solid industrial
foundation and enormous market potentiality, as well as favorable
terms granted by the Chinese government, economists and trade
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The ideal environment for their investment also includes a
strict and daily complete legal system, complete and improved
service regulations, a government free from corruption and a
working process and style with transparency and high efficiency,
they added.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that in the first 11 months this year,
over 22,000 overseas-funded businesses were approved with a total
contractual investment of 66.5 billion US dollars, and 36.9
billion US dollars of the total investment have arrived and were
used.

<HEADLINE> 1996 Overseas Investment in China to Reach 40 Billion Dollars (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since China started the reforms and opening-up policy in 1979,
the Chinese government has approved a total of 281,300
overseas-funded projects and over 172 billion US dollars have been
actually used.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the average investment in the newly
approved overseas-funded projects in the first ten months of this
year rose to 3.03 million US dollars each from 2.47 million US
dollars each in the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The transnational firms-invested projects cover mainly
infrastructure facilities and sectors producing machines,
chemicals and raw materials. They are playing a major role in
readjusting and improving China's industrial structure and
product mix.
</P>
<P>
More solely overseas-funded businesses have been set up in
China this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months of 1996, an average of 25 such
businesses were approved each day, with both the number and the
contractual investment increasing four percent over the same 1995
period.
</P>
<P>
The transnational firms-funded projects usually employ high
technology, advanced management and have a long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, investment and trade experts believe that more
transnational firms come to China as investors will help China
with its socialist market economy and with its effort to improve
the country's enterprise system and build a modern enterprise
system.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1996:  A Hard Year of Transition for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Yegang, Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1996, the
third year since the abolition of Apartheid in South Africa, has
witnessed sustained efforts by the South African people to
promote the social and democratic process and stimulate economic
recovery despite some domestic troubles.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, South Africa has made encouraging achievements
toward democracy and national reconciliation, among which the
accomplishment of the national constitution is apparently the most
remarkable success for the government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the final constitution legalizes the
racial equality, democracy and national reconciliation, which has
become a milestone in South Africa's history.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress (ANC), headed by
President Nelson Mandela since April 1994, has been playing a
leading role on the way to national democracy.
</P>
<P>
New acts of labor and education as well as a series of laws
and regulations concerning equality among the Whites and Blacks
have been adopted at parliament on basis of wide-ranging debates
and consultation.
</P>
<P>
In addition to promulgation of the decrees, provincial
democratic elections were held throughout the country, by which
the regional democratic systems have been consolidated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a special
court authorized by the government, has fairly judged several
influential cases, thus diverting possible racial turmoils.
</P>
<P>
In the field of social welfare and services, the government
spared no efforts in implementing the "Reconstruction and
Development Program", which is aimed at offering Blacks farm
land, clean water, low-price houses and electricity, better
education and medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
More and more black people have begun doing farm work on their
own land. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2000
water projects for the black communities have been erected while
a large number of poor children supported by government subsidies
have got access to schooling.
</P>
<P>
Due to a personnel system reform, an increasing number of
educated Blacks who had never dreamed of having a good job in
government departments before, have got an opportunity to become
civil servants in various government institutions.
</P>
<P>
While South Africa is gearing up on its way to democracy and
development, it is also trying to play an active part in
political and economic affairs in Africa.
</P>
<P>
A sequence of international visits made by President Mandela
and other top government officials this year have remarkably
improved ties between South Africa and countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
Being a regional power, South Africa has been trying on the
one hand to attract as much as possible foreign investments, and
on the other hand it has been also striving to invest heavily in
other African countries. (more )

<HEADLINE> 1996 Overseas Investment in China To Reach 40 Billion Dollars (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Overseas investment in
China this year is expected to reach a record total of 40 billion
US dollars, despite a drop in the number of the approved
overseas-funded projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
This represents a 16 percent rise over 1995 though the number
of the approved projects is 20 percent smaller, official sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The major factor behind the growing investment is that many
overseas transnational firms have come to make investment in
China, according to an official in charge of overseas investment
in China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 400 transnational firms have entered the
Chinese market from 1992 up to now, and by the end of last year,
only some 200 more had invested in the country.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the transnational firms are from the US,
Japan and EU member countries, and over 200 of the
top 500 listed in the US Fortune magazine have helped fund
projects in China.
</P>
<P>
These transnational firms have been attracted by China's social
stability, strong momentum in economic growth, solid industrial
foundation and enormous market potentiality, as well as favorable
terms granted by the Chinese government, economists and trade
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The ideal environment for their investment also includes a
strict and daily complete legal system, complete and improved
service regulations, a government free from corruption and a
working process and style with transparency and high efficiency,
they added.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that in the first 11 months this year,
over 22,000 overseas-funded businesses were approved with a total
contractual investment of 66.5 billion US dollars, and 36.9
billion US dollars of the total investment have arrived and were
used.

<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Yegang and Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- In general, South Africa
has indeed made headway both at home and abroad this year, but at
the same time it met with some troubles at home.
</P>
<P>
The contradictions between the ANC and the National Party, the
representative of Whites, have been so serious that the latter
withdrew from the coalition government this May and became an
opposition party.
</P>
<P>
The National Party's withdrawal actually marks the
disintegration of the political cooperation between parties of
the White and the Black.
</P>
<P>
However, the beginning of a single rule by the Black does not
mean at all that the government crisis is over.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that different views over the autonomy of
Zulu tribe between the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party, a black
party representing eight million Zulu people, will sooner or
later cause the two parties to separate.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that the opposition National Party has
revised its principles and advocated the white and black people
to be united and make preparations for general elections in 1999.
</P>
<P>
These are thorny problems facing the government leaders to
deal with in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
Besides the government crisis, poverty, high unemployment
rate, investment shortage and security problems also challenge
the South African government.
</P>
<P>
Local economists predicted that Gross Domestic Product
(GDP)this year will increase by three percent, but this figure is
below that of last year and the scheduled target.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the expected low increase of GDP mainly
resulted from disputes between laborers and employers,
devaluation of South African currency Rand against the U.S.
Dollar, inappropriate foreign exchange control and high tax rate.
</P>
<P>
Facing these problems, the government recently issued the
macro-economic Strategy, which calls for promoting privatization
and investment, shrinking government deficit, restraining
inflation, and lifting foreign exchange control.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, South Africa is trying to create 400,000
jobs and to raise its economic growth rate at six percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela said recently that to completly wipe out
colonialism and Apartheid is by no means an easy job, "but no
matter how difficult and complicated the problems are, the South
African government and its people will definitely have them
overcomed ".

<HEADLINE> Ten Sites to Host 2002 World Cup in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- As the soccer World Cup comes to
Asia for the first time, four cities and six prefectures in Japan
will play the hosts to the 2002 sports gala, the Japan Football
Association said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The venues chosen are the cities of Sapporo, Yokohama, Osaka
and Kobe and the prefectures of Miyagi, Ibaraki, Saitama, Niigata,
Shizuoka and Oita, said Keita Yamashita, spokesman of the
Association.
</P>
<P>
The 2002 World Cup was awarded to Japan and South Korea by the
sport's world governing body of FIFA, the first time that two
countries to co-host the event.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said each is to have 32 of the final round games in at
least six stadiums and at most 10, and each stadium must
accommodate more than 40,000 spectators. The semifinals and finals
will be held at a stadium that can hold more than 60,000.
</P>
<P>
The 2002 World Cup opening ceremony is to be staged in South
Korea with the final and closing ceremony in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Kobe suffered an earthquake in January 1995 that killed more
than 6,000 people and Sapporo played the host to the 1972 Winter
Olympics
</P>
<P>
The port city of Yokohama, 29 kilometers south of Tokyo, is
constructing the largest stadium among the ten, with a capacity of
70,000, and Saitama prefecture is planning the second largest
stadium with a capacity of 63,000, Yamashita said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Since China started the
reforms and opening-up policy in 1979, the Chinese government has
approved a total of 281,300 overseas-funded projects and over 172
billion US dollars have been actually used.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the average investment in the newly
approved overseas-funded projects in the first ten months of this
year rose to 3.03 million US dollars each from 2.47 million US
dollars each in the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The transnational firms-invested projects cover mainly
infrastructure facilities and sectors producing machines,
chemicals and raw materials. They are playing a major role in
readjusting and improving China's industrial structure and
product mix.
</P>
<P>
More solely overseas-funded businesses have been set up in
China this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months of 1996, an average of 25 such
businesses were approved each day, with both the number and the
contractual investment increasing four percent over the same 1995
period.
</P>
<P>
The transnational firms-funded projects usually employ high
technology, advanced management and have a long-term strategy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, investment and trade experts believe that more
transnational firms come to China as investors will help China
with its socialist market economy and with its effort to improve
the country's enterprise system and build a modern enterprise
system.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's would-be College
graduates are beginning seeking jobs from now on, a Beijing
education official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The heated job seeking efforts are against the backdrop of
record high 59,000 graduates in 1997, 4,000 more than that of last

Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission arranged a gathering to invite student applicants

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Two Elections Usher in New Stage in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- With the year 1997 just
round the corner, two historical elections held this month ushered
in a new stage in Hong Kong's transition.
</P>
<P>
With broad support from Hong Kong people and in an
unprecedented democratic way, 59-year-old Tung Chee-hwa was
elected first Chief Executive on December 11 by the 400-member
Selection Committee for the First Government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Eleven days later, 60 people who are widely representative in
HK were similarly elected to the HKSAR's Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
The two historic elections, conducted in a just, fair and open
manner, marked a milestone in the preparations for the
establishment of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Most local citizens are satisfied with the outcome of the
elections and they are confident that Hong Kong's smooth
transition is ensured in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
In January when the Preparatory Committee (PC) for the HKSAR
under China's National People's Congress (NPC) was formed, it
adopted the principles of "taking ourselves as the mainstay" and
"catering to Hong Kong people and relying on them".
</P>
<P>
The PC has abided by these principles in its work in forming
the Selection Committee and the election of the first Chief
Executive and of the PLC.
</P>
<P>
It held 16 meetings in Hong Kong in April to listen to the
views and opinions voiced by some 1,500 people representing more
than 300 local associations on the methods for the formation of
the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
In its sixth plenary session held in Beijing on November 2, the
PC elected 400 members for the Selection Committee from among
5,791 applicants who handed in their application forms to the
Hong Kong Office of the Secretariat of the PC from August 15 to
September 14.
</P>
<P>
The 400-member Selection Committee which is made up entirely by
Hong Kong residents marks the first instance in which Hong Kong
people exercise their democratic rights to implement the principle
of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PC chairman and vice-chairmen meeting at the
session confirmed eight qualified nominees from 31 applicants to
run for HKSAR's first Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
From November 15 to December 11, the Selection Committee met
in Hong Kong for three plenary sessions to perform their first
task of electing HKSAR's first Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
All the three sessions, including the three-day inquiry
meetings for the three final candidates to make present their
policy platforms and answer questions raised by the Selection
Committee members, were broadcast live on the local radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee held its fourth plenary session in
Shenzhen on December 21 and elected 60 members from among the 130
candidates to form the Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The election process proceeded with the presence of several
hundred Chinese, Hong Kong and foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
The entire process of both elections demonstrated the sincerity
and determination of the Chinese government to implement the
principle of "One country, Two systems" as well as the efforts of
the Chinese side to maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The local media echoed with the comment made by Chinese Vice
Premier Qian Qichen: the election process marked the beginning of
genuine democracy in Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 40 major trading
companies and manufacturers engaged in electronic publications
have issued a joint letter of appeal, calling for tightening the
crackdown on copyright piracy.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the electronic publication industry is
developing rapidly is China, however, piracy is still rampant in
some regions.
</P>
<P>
The letter suggested that the Press and Publications
Administration and local authorities strengthen law enforcement,
and handle the cases in a serious manner.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested that a market supervision power be authorized
to trade associations which can help the government regulate the
market.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, the industry as a whole should work
together to investigate and report any piracy case, with the help
of local governments and police.
</P>
<P>
Electronic publication is a fledgling industry in China, and it
generates great profits each year and is becoming one of the most
dynamic spheres in the publication sector.
</P>
<P>
Many of the unauthorized products, including CDs and LDs, were
overseas products that were shipped in China via illegal channels,
according to official sources.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Turkey Strengthens Ties with Moslem Countries in 1996 (I) (By Zheng Jinfa) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has been rapidly
developing its ties with Moslem countries with the aim of playing
an important role in the Islamic world since the formation of the
coalition government led by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan in
July.
</P>
<P>
But, the prime minister's all-out diplomatic drive to bolster
ties with Moslem neighbors provoked differences at home. Within
the coalition, Erbakan's junior partner Tansu Ciller, deputy prime
minister and chairwoman of the True Path Party (DYP), insists on
keeping Turkey's close links with the West.
</P>
<P>
On August 10, the pro-Islamic Turkish prime minister who also
serves as Islamist Welfare Party (RP) chief, embarked upon his
first foreign visit to neighboring Iran despite opposition from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The visit was envisioned as a bid to assure the Iranians that
Turks are their friends and that as a neighbor, Turkey would
remain so irrespective of external pressures.
</P>
<P>
This move also indicated a determination of Erbakan's
government to strengthen the relations with the Moslem countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the d'Amato-Kennedy law on
August 5 to reinforce embargo against Iran and Libya to keep
foreign companies and individuals from investing heavily in
the oil industries of the two countries. The U.S. policy, however,
was widely criticized as a tool of the superpower hegemony over
smaller countries.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. sanctions, Turkish State Minister
Abdullah Gul, a major aide to Erbakan, said that Turkey is "not in
a position to ask the U.S.." "Turkey is "not a state of the U.S.,
Turkey has its own interests," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan's foreign trip also took him to Pakistan, Singapore,
Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Iran's press highlighted Erbakan's visit to Iran as an
important political and economic victory following Tehran's
efforts to thwart the political isolation and economic sanctions
by the U.S. against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Through his trip to Tehran, Erbakan stepped up cooperation with
the Iranian government in many areas, including oil, gas and
aviation.
</P>
<P>
Defying the U.S. opposition, Turkey and Iran signed a gas
agreement worth 20 billion U.S. dollars, and a 23-year accord
involving the sale of 4 billion cubic meters of gas annually,
which will be increased gradually to 10 billion cubic meters by
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati once said that "we
are looking forward to seeing more friendly ties between Iran and
Turkey in future." He described the Erbakan government as having
always adopted a friendly stance toward Iran, since he is in favor
of forging cordial ties with the Islamic states.

<HEADLINE> North China Exploring Wind Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region in north China will use more Domestic loans and foreign
governmental mixed loans, as well as more foreign funds to convert
its rich wind energy into electricity in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region aims to install more wind converters and
to make its total generating capacity reach 200,000 kw by the turn
of this century.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia has 310 million kw of wind energy reserves,
accounting for 20 percent of the country's total, and is a major
area for wind energy exploitations.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary estimate, wind energy in Inner
Mongolia can provide the autonomous region with electricity
equivalent to that produced by burning 332 million tons of
standard coal.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 125,000 sets of small-capacity wind converters have
been installed across this autonomous region where animal
husbandry remains as a major means of production, offering 500,000
residents with electricity for their household use.
</P>
<P>
Following the construction of four major wind energy
development centers where large-capacity wind converters are
installed, the autonomous region has now an aggregate converting
capacity of 15,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Inner Mongolia converted wind energy to generate 55
million kw/hour of electricity, accounting for three per thousand
of the autonomous region's total volume of power production for
the year.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Tongmuo, a senior engineer with the Inner
Mongolia Wind Power Corporation, the autonomous region hopes to
generate 1.5 percent of the autonomous region's annual total power
output by converting its wind energy at the turn of this century
and will strive to have a wind power generating capacity of 1.2
million kw in the end.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region has so far used governmental loans from
Germany and Denmark, as well as 64 million yuan (one U.S. dollar
equals to 8.3 Chinese yuan) of domestic funds for wind energy
exploitation. Governmental loans from the United State and the
Netherlands are also reported to be presented over soon for the
development in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Turkey Strengthens Ties with Moslem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To further enhance the ties between Iran and Turkey, Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani paid a four-day state visit
to Ankara starting from December 19.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after his first tour abroad, Erbakan dispatched
Justice Minister Sevket Kazan and Education Minister Mehmet
Saglam to visit Baghdad to boost bilateral trade, economic and
political relations after Iraq signed an oil-for-food deal with
the United Nations in May.
</P>
<P>
Following the U.S. air strikes against southern Iraq in
September, Erbakan reportedly held a secret meeting with senior
diplomats of the Iraqi embassy to Ankara to discuss the
developments of the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan once condemned as "a Zionist war" the 1991 Gulf War
staged by the U.S.-led coalition forces to drive Iraqi troops out
of Kuwait following its 1990 invasion.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his Asian tour, the Turkish prime minister
started his second foreign trip to Africa, which took him to
Egypt, Libya and Nigeria from the beginning of October. With the
visit, he hoped to consolidate the strong position of Turkey in
the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan's visit to Libya, however, greatly annoyed the U.S. and
other Western countries, some of which have imposed economic
sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
At the Conference on Cooperation and Development held in the
Turkish largest city of Istanbul in October, Erbakan proposed
creation of an eight-nation Moslem bloc, which was officially
formed in November.
</P>
<P>
The Moslem bloc, which he saw as a way to balance the influence
of the G-7 formed by highly-developed industrial countries, groups
Turkey, Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Egypt
and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation among countries in the process of development is
very important in order to become stronger partners of the
developed countries," Erbakan said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the establishment of the "Moslem-8" group would
serve as the foundation of a just world order.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is expected to host the first "Moslem-8" summit in
Istanbul, next February or March, and foreign ministers of the
eight countries will gather in the city on January 4 for
preparation of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The Moslem-8 group will be based in Istanbul, with a
secretariat handling its daily work, according to State Minister
Abdullah Gul.
</P>
<P>
The West is very cautious about the foreign policy of the
Erbakan-led coalition government.
</P>
<P>
During the election campaign last December, Erbakan spoke of
his plans to set up "an Islamic United Nations, an Islamic NATO
and an Islamic version of the EU (European Union)." We will create
an Islamic currency," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister has softened his attitude towards
the West and said that the new coalition government between the
RP and DYP would maintain close links with the western countries
while further strengthening its relations with the Islamic
states.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here maintain that the Erbakan government will
endeavor to promote its ties with Moslem states in the political,
military, trade and economic fields as long as he is in power.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Goods Market Continues to Thrive in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Though the hazard of dwindling
resident consumption still lingering, retail sales of consumer
goods are expected to grow by some 11 percent when adjusted for
inflation to reach 2,450 billion yuan (295.1 billion US dollars)
in China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Internal Trade, sales of foodstuff
will rise by 14 percent and account for about 52 percent of the
total consumer goods sales.
</P>
<P>
Total supply of sugar is estimated to exceed the 7.5 million
ton mark, including expected new output of 6.6 million tons,
imports and existing stocks.
</P>
<P>
The supply of pork, which is the most preferable meat of the
Chinese, will remain stable, since efforts have been taken to
ensure sufficient fodder supply for pig-breeding areas.
</P>
<P>
It is anticipated that the supply of edible oil will be
adequate next year.
</P>
<P>
While market competition for household appliances is expected
to be more acute, the sale volumes of China-made products will
rise, and more people will make purchases to replace the old ones.
</P>
<P>
Garment markets both in urban and rural areas will continue to
retain the momentum, and demands on brandname products,
high-quality garments, and casual wears will be strong in urban
areas, and sales of read-made clothes in rural regions will keep
growing.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the expenditure of urban residents on housing,
education, transportation and telecommunications will continue to
surge.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iraq to Hold Joint Economic Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- After a five-year suspension,
a meeting of the Turkish-Iraqi Joint Economic Commission is to
resume here today to normalize economic and trade relations
between the two neighbor countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, respectively headed by Turkish State Minister
Ahmet Cemil Tunc and Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid, are
expected to sign a cooperation protocol at the end of the
four-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Turkey wants to supply Iraq with food and medicine, which are
badly needed in the U.N. sanction-hit country, in exchange for
Iraq's crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss concrete measures to boost the
seriously shrinking bilateral trade, which has dropped to 200
million U.S. dollars annually from the previous billions of
dollars years ago.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the officials will touch on the issue of opening
a new border gate between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly asked the U.N. Security Council to
allow it to sell food and medicine to Iraq, listed on top of the
oil-for-food deal, in return for importing Iraq's crude oil, but
the request was turned down by the world body, which asked
Turkey to wait for the results of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been complaining that the U.N. sanctions on
Baghdad following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 have made it
suffer a total loss of 30 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian economy in 1996 as
a whole is going out of crisis and starting a recovery, a
high-ranking government official said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Interfax news agency, Valery
Litvitzky, chief assistant to President Leonid Kuchma, called this
year's economy with an inflation rate almost dropping to 40
percent "a prelude to economic growth."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Ukrainian policy of stabilizing finance this year
is of vital significance to the monetary reforms implemented in
September. Though unable to secure stabilizing loans for a new
currency from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Ukraine's
central bank managed to maintain its monetary reserves during the
process of reforms, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal stabilization policy has helped keep the production
decline in 1996 to its minimum level, and momentums of economic
growing have already appeared in industries, such as metallurgy
and chemicals, Litvitzky said.
</P>
<P>
By furthering the fiscal stabilization and taxation reforms, he
predicted, Ukrainian economic recovery would subsequently be
accelerated.

DHAKA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Activists of the opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) clashed with police here
Tuesday evening in what they called a "peaceful" procession
against the filing of a "false" case against BNP chief Khaleda
Zia.
</P>
<P>
The clash broke out at about 17:15 when the slogan-chanting BNP
procession was crossing the Topkhana road in the city, witnesses
said, adding that police tried to disperse the agitated BNP
activists by charging batons and lobbing tear-gas shells as they
damaged several vehicles on the streets.
</P>
<P>
Chase and counter-chase between police and BNP activists
continued for about one hour and pedestrians ran helter-skelter in
panic as angry BNP activists pelted stones at the police.
</P>
<P>
But BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan strongly
condemned the police for attacking the "peaceful party procession
in the city without any provocation".
</P>
<P>
"This cowardly attack reflected the autocratic and fascist
character of the present government," he said in a statement,
warning that his party would give a befitting reply if any such
attack is made in future.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Anti-corruption filed a case with police last
Saturday accusing BNP chairperson and ex-prime minister Khaleda
Zia and former home minister Abdul Matin Chowdhury of appointing
police officials by misusing powers, canceling a list of selected
candidates, during BNP rule till march 1996.

BANGKOK, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand might continue to
seek a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling on its shrimp dispute
with the United States, although the U.S. has lifted its ban on
imports of Thai shrimp, a local daily said today.

<P>
Krirk-krai Jirapaet, Thai ambassador to the WTO, would seek a
mandate from Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan who is in charge
of the country's economic affairs, on the matter, The Nation said.
</P>
<P>
The move will be sought as the United States failed to clarify
the reasons behind the ban it imposed earlier this year on imports
of sea-caught Thai shrimps by December 8 as required by Thailand,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Indicating that the U.S. ban violated the principle of free
trade, Thailand will continue to join other countries in urging
the WTO to set up a panel to rule on the case, it added.

<HEADLINE> 600 Natural Disasters Kill 11,000 People Worldwide in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1996 has seen 600
major natural disasters killing more than 11,000 people worldwide,
said a report released today by the world's biggest reinsurer.
</P>
<P>
The disasters in 1996 were 30 cases more than the previous year
and resulted in a total of about 60 billion U.S. dollars in
property damage, according to statistics from Munich Re.
</P>
<P>
They included 200 storms, 170 floods, 50 earthquakes, 30
volcanic eruptions, 150 forest fires, droughts and landslides.
</P>
<P>
The worst disaster this year was the flooding along the Yangzte
River in southern China, which killed about 2,700 people and
caused some 20 billion dollars in damage.
</P>
<P>
The flooding, the biggest in 150 years, affected the daily
lives of 20 million people in the region.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hurricane Fran in northeastern United States was
the most powerful tropical storm of the year and the grassland
fire in Mongolia was unprecedented in history.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the 1960s, said Munich Re, the number of natural
disasters in 1996 represented a 400 percent rise and the resulting
property damage a 700 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Behind the more disasters and heavier losses were global
environmental and climatic changes in addition to the higher
density of population and property, the reinsurance company said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Launches Electricity-saving Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is launching a high-efficiency motor
program to help manufacturers nationwide to save 6 billion baht
(240 million U.S. dollars) in production costs.
</P>
<P>
The program is part of the EGAT plan to reduce energy
consumption by 3.4 billion kilowatt-hours by the year 1998.
</P>
<P>
The state-run enterprise hopes the program will help save 550
megawatts of power generating capacity and 3,400 kilowatt-hours of
electricity consumption, or 6 billion baht in value per year in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that the campaign, if successful, would
help the EGAT to cut 20 billion baht (800 million dollars) for
building new power plants, 2.4 billion baht (96 million dollars)
for fuel costs, and the discharge of 2.5 million tons of
green-house gas in the country.
</P>
<P>
The EGAT is introducing incentives to encourage local
manufacturers, which consume about 50 percent of the country's
electricity, to install high-efficiency motors to reduce their
consumption of electricity.

<HEADLINE> Capitalization in Dhaka Stock Exchange Comes Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Market capitalization of the
Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) for the first time contracted to only
about 3.90 billion U.S. dollars Tuesday from an all-time high of
5.98 billion dollars in November.
</P>
<P>
In late September, the market capitalization was only around 2
billion dollars. Afterwards it was on rising track and reached the
peak of 5.98 billion dollars on November 4.
</P>
<P>
But the down trend started more than a month ago when the
government took measures to correct the previously overheated
stock prices, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, trading on the DSE floor drastically
declined Tuesday. Its benchmark price index further lost 55.73
points to 2319.64 on the day from Monday's 2375.37 while
transaction in term of volume went down by 58 percent and in value
fell by 48 percent compared with the previous day's closing
records.
</P>
<P>
Only 43,692 shares and debentures valued at TK 18.9 million
(about 440,000 U.S. dollars) changed hands Tuesday against 102,807
securities worth TK 35.7 million (over 800,000 dollars) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decline has sent a panic wave among small investors.
Angered by the sharp fall in stock prices for the sixth
consecutive days Tuesday, the kerb market traders under the banner
of the Bangladesh Small Investors Federation held a rally in front
of the DSE building.
</P>
<P>
Speakers reiterated their demand for punishing the corrupt
members and urged the government to take immediate effective steps
to salvage the bruised capital market.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 25 (Xinhua) -- India has projected an
economic growth rate of seven percent per annum during the period
covered by the Ninth Five Year Plan (1997-2002), the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the ninth plan draft approach paper approved by

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Nepali Govt Faces Uncertainty After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's three-party
coalition government faces a uncertain future after it narrowly
survived a no-trust vote Tuesday evening at a special session of
the lower house.
</P>
<P>
With the withdrawal of one faction of a crucial ruling partner
from the coalition, the government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba of
the Nepali Congress (NC) party has been reduced with only minority
support in the House of Representatives, political analysts here
said.
</P>
<P>
The 205-seat lower house Tuesday rejected a no-confidence
motion, tabled by main opposition the Communist Party of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist), in a voting held in the house when 101
MPs voted for and 84 MPs against it.
</P>
<P>
Under Nepal's Constitution, a no-confidence motion requires a
majority of 103 votes in the lower house to pass.
</P>
<P>
It was the second no-trust motion survived by the Deuba
government in nine months.
</P>
<P>
Nine MPs of second ruling partner the National Democratic Party
(RPP), including its parliamentary leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand,
were among those who voted in favor of the no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
However, three of RPP's 19 MPs in the house voted against the
motion while the remaining seven were absent from the special
house session, summoned by King Birendra for discussing the
no-confidence motion, in order to keep a neutral stance.
</P>
<P>
The RPP party seems to have been split into two factions led by
party president Surya Bahadur Thapa and senior leader Chand
respectively after disputes arose between them over the censure
motion.
</P>
<P>
While Chand earlier announced to withdraw support to the
government and issued a whip ordering RPP MPs to vote for the
no-confidence motion, Thapa and his supporters in the party
decided to continue their support for the government.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers during the special house session had
protested the ruling side for alleged abduction of seven MPs of
the RPP and other small parties to prevent them from voting in
favor of the motion.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deuba denied such allegations but sources here
said on condition of anonymity that some of the MPs were sent to
foreign countries willingly to hide from the house session after
getting huge financial benefits from the government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in March this year, the government survived a similar
no-trust motion filed by the communist opposition, which expected
the RPP's withdrawal from the government, as the RPP chose to
remain in the coalition at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
After the defeat of the no-confidence motion Tuesday, Deuba
ruled out the possibility of his resignation despite his
government having only minority support in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would not consider to recommend a mid-term
election in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motion seemed to be a no-loser's game when
opposition CPN-UML MPs cheered up at the result of the voting on
the motion held in the lower house late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML will soon decide whether or not to call for the
prime minister's resignation now that the government has been
reduced into a minority status, according to CPN-UML president Man
Mohan Adhikari.
</P>
<P>
With nearly half of the MPs in the lower house voting in favor
of the opposition-tabled censure motion, the stability of the
coalition government, which came to power in September 1995
through a censure motion against the minority communist
government, would be a question in the foreseeable future,
analysts said.

<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- One of Duan Shulin's recent
habits is to watch "Morning Beijing", a popular program with a
comprehensive coverage shown by the Beijing Television Station, at
seven o'clock every morning.
</P>
<P>
And she has long developed a habit: turning on the TV
immediately after getting home, and doing her household chores
amid music strains.
</P>
<P>
Duan, 45, said: "I am really obsessed with television. I would
feel very uneasy if something is wrong with the TV antenna. If my
TV set, washing machine and refrigerator defunction at the same
time and a new ones need to be added, I would certainly buy the TV
set first."
</P>
<P>
"My life is largely connected with TV," the woman maintained.
</P>
<P>
Duan is a fee collector of a real estate company in
Beijing. Her husband is a worker of a coal company and her
daughter is a high school student.
</P>
<P>
"My family members are all TV fans. We often argue over what
channel should be chosen," she said.
</P>
<P>
Duan's attitude towards TV is shared by many other Chinese
residents, especially urban residents. Statistics show that in big
cities like Beijing and Shanghai, more than 85 percent of the
population watch TV everyday. In smaller cities, even 90 percent
of the citizens are regular TV viewers

Liang Hongying, with a master degree in literature and working
for a government department, and his wife, who is studying for a
Ph.D, show another example of TV obsession.
</P>
<P>
The couple are book fans as well, with more than 2,000 books
piled on their home shelves. However, they have their fixed TV
channels.
</P>
<P>
Liang said that book and TV can not be replaced by each other
in many aspects. "Written materials can not create the special
screen effect which is the product of artistic and technological
means," Liang explained.
</P>
<P>
China began to air its first TV program on May 1, 1958. On
October 1, 1973, the black-white program was replaced by colored
programs.
</P>
<P>
The last decade has witnessed TV sets pouring into people's
homes in very big numbers.
</P>
<P>
Duan bought her first TV set, a 12-inch black-white one, in
1982, when TV set was a sort of luxury commodity. The government
issued certain tickets for urban citizens to buy TV sets, as there
was a shortage of supply.
</P>
<P>
Duan bought her color TV set of a bigger size in 1990, when
there was an abundant supply of electrical appliances and people
had more money in their pockets, thanks to the reform and opening
process.

Even in some remote and economically-backwarded regions, the
rural areas in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region for example,
there were 86.6 TV sets for every 100 households.
</P>

China now has 980 conventional TV stations and 1,200 cable TV
stations. The China Central Television has eight channels, beaming

In Beijing, viewers can choose between 26 channels, from
comprehensive news channels to special channels devoted to sports,
education and music. Some programs have been designed for the

BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has
launched a massive campaign to clean its 6,000-plus lanes, over
100 residential areas and 4,000 construction sites.
</P>
<P>
The week-long move, which was sponsored by the Municipal
Construction commission and started Monday, is designed to greet
the forthcoming new year with a new and clean image of the city.
</P>
<P>
The campaign includes cleaning the garbage scattered in lanes,
residential areas and construction site. Residents and units are
being encouraged to dismantle buildings and stalls constructed
against regulations.
</P>
<P>
The campaign requires the removal of all garbage in a timely
way.
</P>
<P>
After this, another large-scale cleaning campaign will be
launched in mid-January 1997 in the wake of the traditional
Chinese Lunar Year - the Spring Festival which will fall on
February 7, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the latter half of this year, the city has organized a
series of cleaning campaigns and hundreds of thousands volunteers
to help improve its image as an international metropolis.

Liu Jianguo, a newspaper editor, watches TV for two hours every
day. He said that everyone of his five-member family can find his
or her favorite programs on the screen.
</P>
<P>
However, the family's common interest is in a program called
"Life Space", produced by the CCTV with a theme of "letting
ordinary people tell the stories of their own".
</P>
<P>
Duan's family enjoy the program as well. She said that among
all the programs, she likes those programs having a close
connection with people's daily life. She even hopes one day she
can tell her true stories in the "Life Space".
</P>
<P>
Because most viewers like the programs having close connections
with the people, as well as with life and reality, more and more
TV stations have produced programs with human touches.
</P>
<P>
Duan noted that TV stations have added color to her
life. "Besides telling me major domestic and international news,
TV stations also provide me with the knowledge of how to be an
honest person and how to teach my child," she said.
</P>
<P>
Like Duan, many Chinese viewers never eye TV as a mere means of
entertainment. They regard it as a way to deepen their insight,
obtain information, acquire education, and receive service. By
making use of TV, many people have found their mates, new jobs and
business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
However, some people have the strong idea that watching TV has
occupied a lot of time, and will cause negative effects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, more than 90 percent of the Chinese
population will have access to TV networks.

SHENZHEN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, a special economic
zone in South China's Guangdong Province, has promulgated strict
regulations on controlling automobile tail gas.
</P>
<P>
The 34-article regulations ban the driving of motor vehicles
that discharge tail gas in excess of government-set standards. All
such vehicles must have purification devices installed.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, which borders on Hong Kong, is pursuing flexible
policies to encourage investors from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The past few years have seen a steady increase in the number of
motor vehicles in the prosperous city. Shenzhen currently has
230,000 registered motor vehicles, more than double the figure for
1991, according to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
A recent government survey shows that the tail gas of motor
vehicles has become a principal source of air pollution in the
city, and that the situation is deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The density of nitrogen oxide, a chemical harmful to human
health, doubled in 1995, compared with that in 1991, according to

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Makes Remarkable Progress in Fighting Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 3.7 million
impoverished people in southwest China's Guizhou Province have
been lifted out of poverty thanks to a help-the-poor drive.
</P>
<P>
Due to deep-rooted geographical and social-economic factors, 15
million people in Guizhou used to live under the poverty line with
no more than 500 yuan for each farmer annually, before 1986.
</P>
<P>
The number of poverty-stricken people was cut to 10 million by
1993, and has now dropped to the present 6.29 million owing to
measures taken by governments at all levels.
</P>
<P>
With economic assistance from the central government and other
parts of the country, the province has built and renovated
highways totalling 10,000 kilometers, and 35 hydro-electric power
stations in poor areas. Over two million people have been given
access to clean water by launching irrigation projects in the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
The drive has lowered the ratio of poverty-hit people in the
Guizhou's total rural population from 57.5 percent in 1993 to this
year's 21.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The per capita net income of farmers in 48 poor counties has
risen to 700 yuan this year, doubling the 1993 figure.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou's drive was part of national efforts, launched in 1994,
to eliminate poverty within seven years.
</P>
<P>
China has succeeded in lifting 15 million among its total poor
population of 80 million out of poverty, a remarable achievement
when the global impoverished population continues to grow.

<HEADLINE> Nagano Embarrassed by Lack of Interest in Pre-Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The 1988 Winter Olympics host
city of Nagano will face potential problems just about a year
before the Games are to open.
</P>
<P>
The invitational five-nation Nagano Cup ice hockey tournament
last week saw the 10,000-capacity Olympic ice hockey arena near
empty. The average attendance was 1,826 including 700 invited
guests and journalists.
</P>
<P>
An acute shortage of hotels also came to the fore as the
International Ice Hockey Federation executive board demanded more
rooms within the city -- not in surrounding areas as far away as
100 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Railway and resort magnate Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who owns the
Nagano ski resorts, revealed he had at one point thought of moving
ice hockey to Tokyo to solve problems of organisation and
accomodation.
</P>
<P>
Over three months, Nagano is to host a dozen World Cup events
and world championships on ice and snow -- events which may bare
more problems such as a short downhill course and ski jumps on a
windy hill.
</P>
<P>
The Nagano Olympics Organising Committee (NAOC) had initially
promised to build a 12,000-seat stadium but scaled it down to an
arena with 5,000 fixed seats to suit its future use in the city
of 350,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The International Skating Union (ISU) has demanded world-class
hotel rooms for some 100 officials who have been booked at
so-called "business hotels" which feature no-frills rooms, not
much bigger than prison cells.
</P>
<P>
Takashi Yamada, the NAOC director of accomodation and
transportation, said the organisers would take requests for
changes in accomodation until the end of January.
</P>
<P>
"But, since the absolute capacity is short, we cannot shuffle
much," he said. "We are angry at the suggestion that the venue be
moved to Tokyo. It is a childish threat."

<HEADLINE> Boarding Schools Established For Minority Ethnic Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A group of boarding schools
have been constructed in central China's Hubei province to help in
the education of local ethnic students.
</P>
<P>
Liang Erping, a five-grade primary school girl now has no need
to trek five kilometers to her classroom every day. Instead she
now can live in a newly established school hostel.
</P>
<P>
"Dormitories in my school are even better than my home," said
the girl, who is just one of those benefiting from the new
boarding schools.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has spent a total of 165 million yuan
in the construction of 609 boarding schools in regions where
minority ethnic groups live in compact communities.
</P>
<P>
Minority ethnic groups in the province mostly inhabit
mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation. Students and
pupils were forced to make long journeys to their schools.
</P>
<P>
In some villages, students used to study in dark classrooms
with broken desks and chairs.
</P>
<P>
Those days have gone, and today new rooms equipped with
televisions and tape recorders have been built. It will greatly
benefit the study of minority ethnic students in poverty-stricken
areas.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Economy To Suffer From AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of adults in Zambia
affected with AIDS is expected to increase from about 10,000 in
1990 to over 75,000 by the year 2000, which will cause the
country's GDP to fall between five to nine percent below what it
would have been in this period.
</P>
<P>
The prediction is made at a booklet dubbed ''HIV/AIDS in
Zambia: a policy maker's perspective'' that was launched by the
Ministry of Health on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The document of the Health Ministry attributes the slackening
of economic growth to the effects of HIV/AIDS on productivity,
primarily through the loss of skilled workers and costs of
illness and death.
</P>
<P>
Among the effects of the disease are the increasing cost of
medical care for employees affected with AIDS, the cost of
recruiting and continually training of workers to replace their
departing colleague.
</P>
<P>
''Considerable judgement is involved in estimating the profits
or investments that may be lost through replacement cost, delays
and the ultimate combined impact on a business,'' the booklet
says.
</P>
<P>
While launching the policy document on Tuesday, Minister of
Health Katele Kalumba called for redoubling investment in the
fight of AIDS, saying that it should not be left to his ministry
alone to do the job.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries like Zambia are strongly committed to the
fight against AIDS but they lack the financial and material
support required for an effective fight.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Armymen Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli armymen,
including an officer, were killed and two others seriously
wounded Tuesday in a Hezbollah (Party of God) roadside bombing
attack in south Lebanon, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The attack followed an earlier, abortive roadside bombing by
the Islamic organization, Hezbollah, and occurred in Markabeh
village, in the eastern sector of the Israeli self-declared
"security zone" in south Lebanon, some three kilometers from the
border.
</P>
<P>
A squad of soldiers were returning on foot from operational
duties when an explosive device was detonated alongside them,
killing the commander of the force at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Three members of the squad were seriously wounded, and were
evacuated by helicopter directly to the Rambam Hospital in
Haifa, northwest Israel, and one of them was rushed immediately
to the operating table, where he died of his wounds.
</P>
<P>
The two men's deaths Tuesday brought to 27 the number of
Israeli armymen killed in fighting in south Lebanon this year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army Northern Command head Amiram Levine blamed Syria
for the recent escalation in fighting in south Lebanon, saying
Tuesday's attack came after ten "stormy days" in the area.
</P>
<P>
"There has been an escalation since the U.S. elections,"
Levine said. "There is cooperation with the Syrians."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, chief of the general staff of
the Israeli army, also said that "the Syrians are heating up the
situation."
</P>
<P>
Shahak added that the Syrians have the ability to heat up or
calm the situation, but it "would be wrong to draw conclusions
now."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Lebanon said Israeli army and its allied South
Lebanese Army (SLA) gunners shelled suspected Hezbollah targets
north of the "security zone," and Israeli helicopter gunships
strafed infiltration trails in response to the roadside bombing
attacks.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident Tuesday, Hezbollah gunmen fired mortars
at an SLA post in the Jezzine enclave north of the "security
zone," without causing any injuries and damage. SLA gunners
returned fire.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in south Lebanon in 1985 as a buffer against cross-border
guerrilla attacks on its northern Jewish settlements.

BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A 1,289-year-old stone
sculpture bearing inscriptions has been found in Ruicheng City in

base, in which there is a sitting Buddha with other two Buddhas
standing on each side.

Experts said that though the heads of the three figures in the
shrine are missing, the clear-cut design of clothes suggests that
the whole sculpture was finely made.

Inscriptions of some 100 characters can be found at the back of
the sculpture.

assistance program in this remote and underdeveloped region, and
gave up their vacations for work.
</P>
<P>
"This is the fifth Christmas I celebrated in this plateau city,
and I have become quite used to it," said Francoise Mathieu, a
female surgeon from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say, celebrations and festivities here are no
match to those in Europe," she noted. "But we are happy all the
same, especially after receiving cheese sent by our families."
</P>
<P>
While becoming increasingly popular among urban youth in other
parts of China, Christmas has never been celebrated in Tibet,
whose residents are almost unexceptionally pious Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
However, the Lhasa City Bureau of Public Health did not forget
to prepare Christmas presents for the doctors, a delicate tapestry
embroidered with the pattern of yaks -- the region's special
animal.
</P>
<P>
The director of the bureau, a Tibetan woman, expressed her
thanks to the European doctors for their contributions to the
improvement of local public health conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely wish you a merry Christmas and every success in
the new year," she said.
</P>
<P>
During the past six years, foreign volunteers have cooperated
with local medical workers to cure 6,000 patients of the
Kaschin-Beck disease, and helped train 600 village doctors for the
suburban counties of Lhasa.

<HEADLINE> Nunnery Identified as Site of Legendary Japanese Ancestor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO (Zhejiang Province), December 25 (Xinhua) -- A nunnery
in east China's Zhejiang Province has been identified as the place
where a legendary Japanese ancestor left China to settle in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Luo Qixiang, a famous Chinese geologist, says that the nunnery
is the only reliable site in China that was related to the
navigation of Xu Fu, an alchemist dispatched by the emperor of the
Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC) to find an elixir of life.
</P>
<P>
Failing to find in East China Sea the legendary Penglai Island
where immortals were said to be living, Xu, with 500 girls and 500
boys, sailed to Japan and never returned.
</P>
<P>
Xu arrived at Saga in Japan and later moved to an area near
Mount Fuji, where there is still a China village.
</P>
<P>
Xu brought to Japan advanced culture and technologies and was
thus called an "Ancestor of Japan". Today more than 20 monuments
related to Xu can be found in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chinese historical documents recorded Xu's mission, but left
the starting place of the navigation a debating topic among
historians.
</P>
<P>
Having studied three possible places, Luo, also an expert on
the study of Xu Fu, found a nunnery and other relics in Cixi City
in east China's Zhejiang Province that related to Xu's navigation.
</P>
<P>
The nunnery was named Qindu, which in Chinese means a ferry
crossing in the Qin Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Luo points out that Xu's fleet started from Cixi and could be
brought to Saga by ocean current, just as Monk Jianzhen of the
Tang Dynasty (618-907) did.
</P>
<P>
Historical records have shown that Jianzhen failed many times
in trying to sail to Japan from other places until he later set
out from Cixi.

SHENZHEN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build a
gold-silver statue of Sanskrit, the Goddess of Mercy in Buddhism,
to bless Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5-meter-high eight-arm statue will be built with 100
kilograms of gold and silver, and inlaid with diamonds shipped in

Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The statue will be exhibited in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, when
China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over the territory,
the producers said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Buy More Canadian Securities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors bought 4.38
billion U.S. dollars worth of Canadian bonds, money market paper
and stocks in October, their biggest investment in a year and a
half.
</P>
<P>
"Canada was the flavor of the month," a Canadian economist was
quoted as saying by media reports today.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners bought 2.3 billion dollars in Canadian bonds, 1.5
billion in money market paper such as federal government bonds and
treasury bills, and 500 million in stocks.
</P>
<P>
The purchases brought total foreign investment in Canadian
securities to 10.8 billion in the first 10 months of this year,
Statistics Canada figures show.
</P>
<P>
The October buying followed four months of mostly selling which
totaled 2.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But that enthusiasm will be seen to have evaporated and even
reversed when the November and December statistics come in,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
In October, foreign money flowed into Canada despite a rise in
the Canadian dollar, which made Canadian investments more costly
for foreign buyers. The Canadian dollar gained 1.25 U.S. cents to
74.72 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign investors were very bullish on the longer term
prospects for the Canadian dollar in the month, and bought bonds
and T-bills hoping to boost returns with a currency play.
</P>
<P>
That buying resulting from their "excessive bullishness" drove
the Canadian dollar up, but as reality set in and the buying spree
ran out of steam, and the (Canadian) dollar fell back, the
economist said.
</P>
<P>
The figures for the last two months of the year will move the
opposite direction from October's, the economist predicted.
</P>
<P>
In October, Canadians also invested heavily in foreign stocks,
purchasing 1.2 billion dollars. More than half of the purchases
were U.S. issues.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Workers Receive Retraining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The general qualities of
Chinese posts and telecommunications workers will be raised
through extensive training, today's China Daily quoted Wu Jichuan,
Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The educational level of ministry personnel must be raised in
order to modernize the ministry's operations, the minister
explained.
</P>
<P>
The educational level of the posts and telecommunications
workers remains low: 43 percent of the 1.2 million such employees
have only had primary or junior middle school education.
</P>
<P>
Under a new training program of the ministry, each year since
now, 400,000 workers should receive on-the-job training across the
country, and by the year 2000, 70 percent of all workers should
have completed senior middle school or college education.
</P>
<P>
Posts and telecommunications is technology-intensive and with
the spectacular expansion of China's national and local telephone
systems, more new high-tech products have been introduced from
overseas to upgrade telecommunications networks in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese graduates of postal and telecommunications colleges
have become sought-after candidates in the current job
market. Many are employed by foreign telecom companies and joint
ventures.

<HEADLINE> Fuzhou Devotes Efforts Towards Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Fuzhou, capital city of east
China's Fujian Province, has been carrying out four big projects
to control pollution since early this year, according to today's
"China Daily".
</P>
<P>
An official with the city's Environmental Protection Bureau
said that the four projects included a major one to control
benzene poisoning in shoe-making over the coming two years.
</P>
<P>
The other three projects are centered on cleaning up the Min
River, which flows across Fuzhou, and on controlling dust
pollution of ceramic plants.
</P>
<P>
The city claims some 257 production lines, which use glue
containing poisonous materials like benzene, to make shoes.
</P>
<P>
The shoe-making enterprises have been ordered to use
benzene-free glue and to adopt cleaner production techniques with
some subsidies from the local government, according to Yan
Zhangjin, an official with the Fuzhou City Environmental
Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
If these factories do not tackle their pollution problems
within certain time limits, they will be fined up to 100,000 yuan
each, ordered to close down or even brought to court, Yan said.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, has ordered
all the industrial-pollution sources across the country to meet
State standards in pollutant discharges by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou is planning to fulfill the order in the shoe-making
industry two years before the deadline, according to the City
Environmental Protection Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Resettlement Wins National Support (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Resettlement operations for
the construction of the Three Gorges Project, the world-largest
water-control scheme, has won full support from many parts of
China, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Various areas of the country have poured more than 1.6 billion
yuan (about 193 million US dollars) into the Three Gorges
reservoir area over the past four years to support completion of
the project, said Qi Lin, director of the Resettlement Bureau of
the Three Gorges Project Construction Commission.
</P>
<P>
When the reservoir is filled with water, 632 square kilometers
of land will be submerged and 21 counties and cities in Sichuan
and Hubei provinces will be affected by the year 2009.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth progress of the project, the State
Council, China's highest governing body, has called on various
areas to support the resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
Qi said 20 provinces and cities nationwide have provided
support with funding, technology and materials to the reservoir
area, and helped the area launch more than 800 projects.
</P>
<P>
Governments of various districts have encouraged major
companies to develop name-brand products in areas near the
reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Wahaha Group, a well-known confectionery firm, has merged three
enterprises in Fuling, Sichuan Province. After technological
upgrading of the enterprises, the group has not only relocated
more than 1,200 employees of the enterprises, but also recruited
1,500 migrant workers from rural areas close to the
reservoir.

<P>
The official also said that a number of scientific research
institutes across the country have provided technology to promote
agricultural development in areas surrounding the reservoir, free
of charge.
</P>
<P>
Aided by technicians from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jilin and
Guangdong provinces, farmers in the reservoir area have become
better off by applying fine methods of planting American Ginseng,
melons, and raising soft-shelled turtles and deer.
</P>
<P>
Poor education and overpopulation on scarce land resources have
conspired to curb the economic development of the reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
In recent years other parts of China have trained more than
4,000 personnel for the reservoir area. Guangdong Province plans
to invest in the rebuilding of 165 secondary and primary schools
in the area.
</P>
<P>
Ministries or companies under the State Council have also lent
support to the resettlement. The State Commission of Science and
Technology has introduced new techniques in the planting of rice,
vegetables and oranges.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture has invested more than 25 million
yuan in the reservoir area, establishing a score of research
centers.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the support from across the country, the resettlement
is making smooth progress. So far, more than 20,000 people have
been resettled, 75,000 square meters of housing have been rebuilt,
and over 60 new factories have gone into operation. In addition,
2,500 factories are being built, Qi said.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Industry Revives After Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- China's textile industry has
revived this year after a seven-year slump, with losses decreasing
and exports climbing, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The total profits of textile enterprises in major cities
exceeded losses in October this year for the first time for seven
years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the third quarter, the textile industry in Inner
Mongolia, Shanghai, Fujian, Henan and Hainan had turned to making
a profit.
</P>
<P>
The whole industry was losing money in the first quarter of
1996 and only Inner Mongolia reported profits in the second
quarter, the China National Textile Council said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 17 provinces and cities reported lower losses in the
third quarter, while net losses of all enterprises under the
jurisdiction of the council dropped 16 percent to 2.16 billion
yuan from 2.571 billion yuan at the end of the second quarter, and
3.005 billion yuan at the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Exports of textiles and garments reached 29.2 billion by the
end of October. Though this was still 5.7 percent less than the
same period of last year, the total volume rose 3.8 percentage
points from the end of September, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Exports in the three months ending October exceeded those in
the same period of 1995, with exports in October up nearly 30
percent from the same month in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The achievement of the industry is significant, as it
encountered the most difficult situation in eight years at the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
In more than 3,000 enterprises monitored by the council, net
losses rose 40 percent in the first quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics from 56 areas suggest that 131 textile
enterprises have gone bankrupt since the asset
redistribution. Another 280 have been annexed, while 105
enterprise groups have been established, with redistributed assets
totalling 38.7 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Rebels Free Another Hostage, With 105 in Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian rebels set free another
hostage this evening from the Japanese embassy residence in Lima
which they have been occupying since last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The released hostage was identified as Uruguayan ambassador
Tabare Bocalandro Yapeyu by chief negotiator of the International
Red Cross Michel Minnig.
</P>
<P>
He said that 105 hostages still remained inside the residence.
</P>
<P>
Peru had been seeking the extradition of two members of the
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), both Peruvians, but a
Uruguayan court earlier Tuesday reportedly denied the extradition
request and ordered their release, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Before the release, Red Cross said there were 106 hostages
being held by the guerrillas inside the residence instead of the
140 previously announced.
</P>
<P>
"There was a little confusion at first about how many hostages
there were with the release (on Sunday night) of 225 persons," Red
Cross official Jean-Pierre Sharer told reporters outside the
residence.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began last Tuesday night when MRTA guerrillas
stormed the ambassador's house and took more than 400 people
hostage at a diplomatic reception to honor Japanese emperor's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels released all women and many of the young and elderly
on the first night of the siege. They released 38 men Friday
night and 225 more as a "Christmas gesture" Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas said that they would release the remaining
captives only if the government freed some 400 of their imprisoned
comrades.
</P>
<P>
Peruvians President Alberto Fujimori has rejected their demands
but promised not to storm the building if the guerrillas put down
their arms and freed all their hostages.
</P>
<P>
The remaining hostages include Peru's foreign and agricultural
ministers, congressmen, other senior officials, Japanese
businessmen and diplomats from other countries.

<P>
KIEV, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
talked with his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin over the phone
today and congratulated the latter's return to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed that both countries should resume
normal state-to-state relations despite the rows between the two
parliaments, Ukraine's Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian and Russian parliaments fought a battle of words
over the status of Sevastopol, the home base of the Black Sea
Fleet claimed by both countries.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the fleet and the status of Sevastopol, a
Ukrainian port city, has dampened the relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma and Yeltsin reportedly decided in the telephone
conversation to keep frequent personal contacts to lay grounds for
the development of good-neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin returned to his Kremlin office on Monday after recovery
from a major heart surgery on November 5.

SHENYANG, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province will build in five years a mineral water production
center with an annual capacity of 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The center is located in Kangping County, which abounds in
resources of quality mineral water.
</P>
<P>
The county has two mineral water belts. The larger one is 30 km
long and 50 meters wide.
</P>
<P>
A recent prospecting shows that 22 water wells can be drilled
on the two belts. An expected 100 tons of water will be pumped out
a day.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the center will be completed at a total cost of
200 million yuan, which will be used to build a mineral water
plant, a brewery and distillery.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the mineral water in Kangping falls into the
category of complex structure. Each liter of mineral water
contains 3.2 mm of strontium and high content of silicic acid.

<HEADLINE> Cuba's GDP Expected to Grow 7.8 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's gross domestic product
(GDP) is expected to grow by 7.8 percent in 1996, up from an
earlier projection of five percent, Minister of Economy and
Planning Jose Luis Rodriguez announced today.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who is also vice president of the Council of
Ministers, presented his economic report to this year's regular
sessions of the National Assembly of the People's Power, which
opened today.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 budget deficit was 2.4 percent of the GDP, less than
the projected figure, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez described the positive economic results as a "real
miracle and a colossal achievement" due to the fact that they were
made under the adverse conditions brought about by the
Helms-Burton Act of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Act, named after its sponsors at U.S. Congress
and signed into law by U.S. President Clinton last march, seeks to
prevent all non-U.S. investment in Cuba and therefore arouses
strong opposition from European nations.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez also noted that this year Cuba struggled with higher
oil prices and a devastating hurricane, while world prices for
sugar and nickel -- Cuba's main exports -- dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's annual law-making sessions, usually held in July and
December, was delayed by Hurricane Lily in October.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly today begins both sessions to approve an
antidote bill against the Helms-Burton Act and draw up economic
guidelines for 1997, such as budget bill and economic and social
program.
</P>
<P>
The deputies will also set targets for sugar and food
production, approve an assembly regulation bill to substitute the
current one which has been in effect for the past 14 years, and
ratify the decrees issued by the Council of State in 1996.

<HEADLINE> 110 Rural Laborers Commended in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 110 young people
from China's countryside, including 10 of the most outstanding,
have been commended in Beijing for making contributions to urban
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The people, all 35 years old or below, came from rural areas
and found jobs in cities, according to the China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Some of them worked in cities but returned to their home towns,
set up their own businesses and eventually became successful.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in the cities, they learned many skills,
including management expertise.
</P>
<P>
The selection of 110 outstanding rural youths was jointly
organized by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth
League, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of
Construction and the Central Social Comprehensive Management
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The commendation is an effort to acknowledge the role of rural
laborers in urban economic construction.
</P>
<P>
The 110 people came from 28 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities. They worked or once worked in construction,
textiles, security, sanitation, coal-mining, service and other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Sources claim that China now has 460 million rural laborers.
Some 100 million work in township enterprises, while 250 million
work in the farming industry.
</P>
<P>
And another 80 million flock to cities to find jobs and 80
percent of them are 35 years of age or younger. The remaining 30
million remain jobless and may seek their fortunes in larger
cities.

<HEADLINE> China Eyes More Than Title Sweep (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 25 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Chinese paddlers have
swept all major titles for the year of 1996, but the nation's
table tennis authorities say it isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
With a four-title haul from the Olympic Games, a sweep of all
four trophies in the Pro-Tour Finals, the men's and women's World
Cup going to Liu Guoliang and Deng Yaping respectively, China
concludes that she is still far from her target -- beat the rest
of the world, convincingly.
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky in the Olympic Games as most of top
Europeans were upset by non-Chinese players," said Li Furong,
vice-president of the Chinese Table Tennis Association.
</P>
<P>
After Canadian Johnny Huang beat reigning Olympic champion
Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden and Czech Petr Koppel downed former
world No.1 Jean-Michael Saive of Belgium, Liu Guoliang took a rare
chance to win China's first Olympic men's singles title.
</P>
<P>
Liu then won the World Cup in Nimes, France, in a way that
didn't impress Li Furong, who said the 21-year-old Chinese was
lucky in the World Cup as well as in the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fast attacker faced six consecutive match points in
the opening tie of the World Cup before turning the table to win
19-21, 22-20, 21-12 against Croatia's Zoran Primorac.
</P>
<P>
Penholder Liu, the world championships singles runner-up to
Chinese Kong Linghui, trailed Primorac by a game and 14-20 and
looked jaded against an inspired opponent.
</P>
<P>
Riding on luck, pulling off a desperately aggressive game, Liu
got eight points in a row to level one-all and finally beat a
disappointed Primorac, World Cup winner three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We can hardly say that Chinese men now have an edge over the
rest of the world," said Li Furong.
</P>
<P>
"Veteran European players like Waldner, Primorac and
(Jean-Philippe) Gatien have been on the decline, but in a very
slow pace, while more young players from the continent are mature
enough to challenge the Chinese," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, the only player in the world to have won a Grand Slam
of the Olympic, world championships and World Cup titles, clinched
two singles titles in the 10-leg ITTF professional tour, while
fellow Swede Jorgen Persson won the last leg in the Swedish Open
early December.
</P>
<P>
Li was amazed by the sporting longevity of European players.
</P>
<P>
"Poland's Andrzej Grubba won the Malaysian Open at the age of
38, it's unbelievable," Li said. "Chinese should learn from
Europeans on how to extend their careers."
</P>
<P>
Vladmir Samsonov of Belarus, winner of the European Master
Championship this year, is expected to succeed Waldner as the best
European player.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Samsonov, a semi-finalist in the Olympics
Games, had beaten almost all of top Europeans in the year.
</P>
<P>
"Technically, Samsonov is nearly perfect. What he needs is
experience," commented former Chinese head coach Xu Shaofa after
Samsonov lost to Kong Linghui in the final of the Pro-Tour Finals
in northern Chinese city Tianjin in December.
</P>
<P>
"He is the man to watch in 1997," Xu added.

<P>
Besides elite Europeans, the other man who has given China a
trouble is South Korean Kim Taek Soo, undisputedly the world best
top spin penholder.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Kim, who upset world No. 1 Kong Linghui in the
Olympic Games, nipped the 21-year-old Chinese again early December
while handing a straight-set defeat to newly-crowned Olympic
champion Liu Guoliang.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese players are no longer as dominant as in early 1980s,"
said Xu Yinsheng, president of the International Table Tennis
Federation and head of the Chinese Table Tennis Association.
</P>
<P>
China had taken all of the seven titles in the 1981 world
championships in Yugoslavia and repeated the feat in the 1995
Tianjin Worlds, the latter China attributed to the home-court
advantage and out-of-form by European top players.
</P>
<P>
In the women's table tennis, Deng Yaping stands alone in glory.
</P>
<P>
National champion at 13, Asian champion at 15, world champion
at 16, doubles Olympic champion at 19, the 23-year-old Deng
repeated an Olympic double and lifted the inaugural women's World
Cup in the year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who has bagged 14 world titles and four Olympic gold
medals in her career, says she won't rest on the laurels and vows
to fight on, brushing off suggestion from friends that she should
withdraw at the apex of career to avoid possible humiliation.
</P>
<P>
"My personal fame or shame doesn't matter," she told
Xinhua. "If my country needs me, I won't call it quits."
</P>
<P>
Certainly China needs players like Deng. Nerves steady, style
aggressive and ranked world No. 1 for sport's record of six years,
Deng is hardly replaceable.
</P>
<P>
"A few Chinese youngsters may be technically better than Deng.
But in terms of mentality and experience, there is no match," said
Zhang Xielin, Deng's coach for eight years.
</P>
<P>
China is never short of young and good women players. Yang
Ying, Li Ju, Wang Chen and Wang Nan are among the top eight in the
latest world rankings, but they will have to toughen their nerves
before they take international responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Former Chinese now playing for their adopted countries and
regions remain the top threat to the Chinese dominance of the
women's table tennis.
</P>
<P>
World No. 3 Chen Jing of Chinese Taipei, No. 9 Chai Po Wa of
Hong Kong and No. 12 Chire Koyama of Japan, who had played for
either the Chinese national team or provincial squad, have given a
headache to their birth country.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jing downed world No. 2 Qiao Hong in the Olympic Games and
then stretched Deng Yaping to five sets before losing the final.
</P>
<P>
Koyama, who beat Deng in the 1994 Asian Games and caused an
outcry in China for checking top players moving overseas, is still
strong at age of 32. She overcame Wang Chen to win the Asian
championship early December.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese women's closest rivals are those Chinese who have
switched their allegiance to represent other countries and
regions," said Zhang Xielin.

<HEADLINE> National Key Projects Help Former Nomadic Region (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A number of key national
projects have changed the economy of north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, and its fashionable cashmere industry of this
sparsely populated region is now known nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure construction has been a major part of China's
long-range objectives for the 1990s, and six key state-run energy
and power projects have been built in the region in 1996.
</P>
<P>
These include the Yimin coal mining project on the Hulun Buir
grassland, the Jungar coal mining project on the Ordos grassland,
the Sheng-Shenfu Coal Mine, and the Dalad Power Station.
</P>
<P>
Heavy industry is not the only stress of the national
construction program in the region, however, according to one
official. Near the key projects, new businesses like construction
engineering, building materials, and services, including food and
retail sales, have grown, creating new jobs and providing local
people with more consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
The ancient Ordos wasteland in the western part of the region
is now dotted with a handful of key projects. Coal mining,
building materials, chemicals, and animal husbandry, which are
called the four local economic pillars, have provided a number of
name-brands, including Ordos cashmere garments.
</P>
<P>
A new industrial zone, with the Ordos highland at the center,
now leads the region in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Revenues in Ordos have grown at an annual rate of 23 percent in
the past four years, and key projects have helped the region,
which was formerly beset with poverty, develop economically.

The economic activity is breathing new life into Ulanqab League
and some areas of Hohhot, which have one-third of the region's
total population living under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
A power plant in Dalad Banner is providing half the revenue
for nearby Fengzhen County, while farmers in Fengzhen have taken
advantage of the catering, transportation, and other businesses
around the power plant.
</P>
<P>
Qingshuihe county is another example of going from poverty to
promise, by providing building materials for the construction of
Wanjiazhai reservoir, part of the Jungar coal mining project.
</P>
<P>
Qingshuihe has an annual output of 500,000 tons of cement and
500,000 square meters of glazed tiles and has become an important
industrial base in the region.
</P>
<P>
Nearby Lamawan township is keeping up with its neighbor
transporting building materials and coal, and the townships of
Fengzhen, Lamawan, Dalad, Xuejiawan and Yiminhe add new promise to
the local economy.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to benefit more from China's westward
economic development strategy. In implementing this strategy,
Inner Mongolia is enhancing economic cooperation with internal and
overseas businesses. It has become part of the regional economic
co-operative zones in north China and northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and provinces like Hebei and Shandong are developing
long-term cooperation links with the region, whose cooperation
with coastal cities like Shanghai, and the provinces of Jiangsu
and Zhejiang is also thriving.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors from more than 30 countries and regions are
competing in the promising region, producing over 800 kinds of
commodities for the international market.

<P>
CHENGDU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A white jade sculpture of the
late Chinese top marshal Zhu De has been erected in Yilong county, Zhu's
hometown in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
This sculpture is erected to commemorate the 110th anniversary
of the birth of this late Chinese Communist Party and state leader
who had been a huge star in the history of Chinese revolution in
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Zhu died in 1976, the year when two other top Chinese leaders,
Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, also passed away.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held in Yilong Sunday, when a memorial park in
honor of Zhu De opened to the public, with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin writing the park's name.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people, including Zhu's relatives, local Party
and government officials, were present on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
A book, titled "My Father Zhu De" by Zhu's daughter Zhu Ming,
made its debut at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Ming donated 10,000 yuan (about 1,200 US dollars) and some
books to the "Project Hope" schools, and offered a blanket, which
was once used by Zhu De, to the Memorial Hall of Zhu De in the
county.

few days:
</P>
<P>
LIMA -- Peru's net international reserves reached 8.96 billion
U.S. dollars on December 18, an increase of 539 million dollars
over the previous month, which the Central Reserve Bank (BCR)
attributed to the growing deposits from the public sector and the
Banco de la Nacion.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Due to price drops at international markets,

this year, 12 percent less than 1995 against a two percent
increase of the export volume, the Brazilian Steel Institute said.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- The production of cereals in Argentina exceeded
48 million metric tons this year, 14 percent above that of 1995,
according to the Rural Society's annual balance sheet.

recently-privatized ports of Balboa and Cristobal, Barleta said.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- The Costa Rican government announced its 1997

<HEADLINE> South China Relying On Technology To Tap Marine Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, which has abundant marine resources, has become
increasingly dependent on technology to develop its marine
industry.
</P>
<P>
One official says that the province's seven cities, which are
focusing on improving fishing facilities and breeding techniques,
are the major beneficiaries of this practice.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, marine fisheries in the seven cities,
which are in the eastern and western parts of the province, netted
in 1.52 million tons in 1995, 77 percent of the province's total
of marine products.
</P>
<P>
Zhanjiang city, which has seen a boom in deep-sea fishing in
recent years, has 141 oceangoing freighters, a dramatic increase
from the two freighters it had in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the deep-sea fish yield now accounts
for 20 percent of the city's total output of marine products, and
that advanced processing skills are beginning to take the place of
older more traditional methods, and newer industries, like a
marine health food industry, are beginning to take shape.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Reports High Increase in Grain Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai
provinces and Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions in
northwest China all have reaped good grain harvests this year and
produced some six million tons more grain than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounts for half the country's increased grain
output this year.
</P>
<P>
Increased grain sown acreage, conscientious implementation of
government policies by these provinces or autonomous regions, more
input for grain production, application of agrotechniques on an
extensive scale, farmland improvement projects, and good weather
conditions are cited as the main reasons for this year bumper
grain harvest in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to increased grain output, local farmers' income rose
remarkably. Statistics show that per-capita income for farmers
of northwest China will exceed 1,000 yuan (120 U.S. dollars) for
the first time this year. Increased grain output alone drives up
farmers' income by 100 yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, China is expecting to harvest 480
million tons of grain, an increase of 13.5 million tons of grain
over last year's standard.

<HEADLINE> Italian High Court to Decide on Case of Ex-Nazi Captain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Briefs on former German Nazi, SS
Captain Erich Priebke, were sent today to the high Court of
Cassation, which will decide whether a civilian or a military
court should try the man accused of participation in the country's
worst World War Two atrocity.
</P>
<P>
The dispute occurred when a panel of military judges ruled they
could not handle the case and civilian judge Italo Ormanni who
took over the case early this month said he had no jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Ormanni asked Rome preliminary investigating judge Ciro
Monsurro to rule on the matter, who then submitted the case to the
Cassation Court, Italy's highest court.
</P>
<P>
Priebke, 83, was charged with complicity in multiple homicide
for his participation in the Ardeatine Caves massacre south of
Rome in March 1944. A total of 335 men and boys were shot in
reprisal for a bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
Priebke was extradited to Italy from Argentina in November 1995
and faced a military court earlier this year. The trial, later
overturned, ended on August 1 in uproar when the military tribunal
found him guilty of mass murder but ruled he was no longer liable
for punishment.
</P>
<P>
The highest court is also to decide on the case of former SS
major Karl Hass, 84, who was originally brought to Rome to testify
as a witness at Priebke's trial. On November 21, a military
investigating magistrate said Hass should be tried by a civilian
court because he was not charged with a war crime.
</P>
<P>
Both Priebke and Hass argue they were under orders to take part
in the massacre and would have been killed had they refused. But
Ormanni hinted the prospect of trying both for multiple murder if
their cases stayed with the civilian court.
</P>
<P>
It was also learned that Ormanni had requested new detention
warrants for Priebke and Hass to replace the warrants set to
expire in about 20 days.

<HEADLINE> 100 Alleged Terrorists Killed in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Defense
Force in an offensive has killed and wounded over 100 alleged
terrorists who tried to cross into Ethiopia in an attempt to
attack the town of Dollo again.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted a statement issued by the
Defense Ministry as saying today that 19 members of the
multinational Islamic extremist group killed during the recent
offensive were Arab nationals from different Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"The terrorists were crushed last August by the Ethiopian
Defense Force while bracing to destabilize the sub-region and
impose Islam fundamentalism by force with the help of some
neighboring countries," the statement recalled.
</P>
<P>
It added that the remnants were forced to flee to far off
areas deep into Somalia in a futile attempt to reorganize
themselves.
</P>
<P>
However, Somalia accused Ethiopian troops of crossing into
Somalia 20 kilometers and taking the Somali town of Dolow,
killing 47 militiamen of an Islamic group.
</P>
<P>
Yet the Ethiopian statement said the multinational terrorist
group has been bent on preparing itself for the past five months
with the assistance it received from certain neighboring
countries and crossed the Ethiopian border recently in an attempt
to attack the border town of dollo.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Defense Force "has gallantly fought and
destroyed the terrorists", the statement said, adding that
following the offensive, the remnants of the group were forced to
retreat in disarray back into Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the Ethiopian people to "remain
vigilant, against activities of the terrorist group" and stressed
the readiness of the defense force to ward off any attempt of
aggression.
</P>
<P>
''the attempt by the fundamentalist group to attack Ethiopia
after recuperating for some time is a proof that it is determined
to destabilize the sub-region and spread its extremist ideology
by force,'' the statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia will not tolerate the futile attempt by the group to
impose its belief on neighboring countries and reiterated its
determination to deal a crushing blow at such an attempt, the
statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the Ethiopian Defense Force killed 232 alleged
terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Says Nobody Can Destabilize, Divide Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic said this evening at a big rally in central Belgrade
that nobody could destablize or divide Serbia because it always
becomes firmer and stronger when faced with foreign pressures and
threats.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody will divide Serbia, nor will Serbia accept to be
anyone's servant," Milosevic said while addressing the people who
came to Belgrade earlier today from other parts of Serbia to show
their support to the Serbian government and Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
This was Milosevic's first public statement since the
anti-government rallies were held 35 days ago. The official Tanjug
news agency said more than half a million people from all over
Serbia had attended the rally organized by the government to
counter the anti-government demonstrations that had been going on
since November 19.
</P>
<P>
Hours before the pro-government rally started in the afternoon,
clashes had erupted between Milosevic's supporters and the
opposition coalition. Tanjug said a total of 15 people have been
injured, two of them seriously. Riot police had to intervene to
separate the political opponents to avoid further clashes.
</P>
<P>
At the rally, Milosevic recalled the situation in the past. "It
was only a year ago that the most difficult period in our more
recent history ended. Our country has withstood enormous trials,
in the face of which much bigger and far more developed countries
would have yielded," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we have had changes in the system, the
disintegration of the country (former Yugoslav federation), a war
in the neighborhood, sanctions, and a million refugees. Each of
these big trials, each of these heavy blows individually would
have destabilized any other country, but we are not destabilized
and are overcoming the difficulties standing upright," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that though there were anti-government protests in
Serbia, a strong Serbia is not to the liking of many power-brokers
outside the country. "This is why they, in collaboration with the
fifth column they have been creating here, have tried to
destabilize and weaken our country."
</P>
<P>
He said the goals of the demonstrations "are, firstly, to slow
down our economic development and, secondly, to make us weak so
that the integrity of the present-day Yugoslavia and present-day
Serbia will be jeopardized."
</P>
<P>
"All of them together, both from without and from within, have
wanted to weaken us, but I tell you that we shall come out
stronger and not weaker," Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall come out stronger and not weaker because Serbia
always unites more firmly and strongly in the face of threats and
pressures," the Serbian president said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic said
there were extremely rightist parties which expressed their
dissatisfaction with election results by causing disturbances in
the streets of Belgrade and some other towns in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
They were doing so by "calling for political terrorism,
threatening the authorities as well as passers-by, manipulating
children and young people, calling for help from foreign states,
spreading lies on their own country, etc.," Marjanovic told a
parliament session in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Through such behavior, those parties not only spread unrest
and destabilize the society which needs a peaceful and stable
atmosphere in order to recover from the recent traumas, they also
intentionally cause harm to the country's reputation in the world
and are attempting to obtain support from the enemies of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for all forms of pressure on it,
Marjanovic said.
</P>
<P>
"A great battle is underway against Yugoslavia and especially
Serbia. The battle is being fought by the coalition Zajedno and
Yugoslavia's enemies abroad, and is supported by Albanian
separatists in Kosovo and other parties, groups and individuals
known for their anti-Serbian and anti-Yugoslav activities," the
prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Imperial Porcelain Kiln of Southern Song Dynasty Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The site of an imperial
porcelain kiln of the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1270) has been
found in this capital of east China's Zhejiang Province. Products
from the kiln are among the most expensive in recent auctions
sales.
</P>
<P>
The find was made by two amateur archeologists from the
Provincial Collector's Association who have spent ten years
searching for the site around the city. They are Chen Fangxiao,
vice-president of the association, and Hua Yunong, deputy
secretary-general of the association.
</P>
<P>
While they were searching near Mount Phoenix earlier this year,
they found among weeds many porcelain fragments and porcelain-
making tools.
</P>
<P>
The fragments show a great variety of colors, such as moon white,
sky blue, millet-colored, darker bluish grey, and colors from
furnace transmutation.
</P>
<P>
Most of the glaze has broken-ice cracks, fishroe marks, or
crab-claw marks.
</P>
<P>
More attractive to the finders might be those with light glazed
mouth rims, and foot rims of purple or iron color, which are
typical products of Southern Song Imperial Kiln.
</P>
<P>
Two pieces of porcelain bearing inscriptions of "imperial kiln"
and other words suggesting its users have also been found.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the provincial museum say that the site, 500 meters
from the ruins of imperial palaces of the Southern Song Dynasty,
can be recognized as an imperial kiln site of the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Historical documents have shown that there were five of the most
famous porcelain kilns in the Southern Song Dynasty. All the sites
of have been found previously, except for the Imperial kiln.

<HEADLINE> New Federation Chairman Vows to Unite Literature, Art Circles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Weizhi, newly elected
chairman of the China Federation of Literature and Art Circle
(CFLAC), said he will turn CFLAC into a bridge between the Party
and the country's artists.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, 80 years old, is the federation's fourth chairman after
Guo Moruo, Zhou Yang and Cao Yu. He is a famous composer and came
to fame in early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the processing of the conference, the Sixth
National Congress of CFLAC was a meeting with an atmosphere of
unity, Zhou said. He added that it showed that the broad masses of
writers and artists are in support of the literary and art
policies of the Party, and have reached a consensus on the theme
of the conference.
</P>
<P>
"CFLAC is home of the literary workers nationwide," he said,
"It should carry out the guidelines of the Party, invigorate
cultural undertakings, and serve as a bridge between the Party and
the artists, by making as many friends as possible and provide as
much service as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Personally speaking," he said, "I admire the work style of
late Premier Zhou Enlai."
</P>
<P>
Zhou is noted for treating artists on an equal standing, and
being a friend to them.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Weizhi first became engaged in the leftist artist movement
and progressive publications in Shanghai in 1935, and was once
acting Minister of Culture.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he has headed the publication of a collection
of books about the leadership of the Communist Party of China in
the literary and art circles. He is also head of the leading group
of the National Artistic Science Program, and advisor to the China
Association of Musicians.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestine to Continue Hebron Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) are due to continue the negotiations
Wednesday on Israeli army's redeployment in the West Bank of
Hebron, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today after a three-and-half-hour summit
meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and
PNA President Yasser Arafat at the Erez checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Special Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross made the
announcement, adding that the two leaders are also agreed to
meet again "soon" to conclude the Hebron redeployment agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ross described today's summit meeting as "good," saying the
meeting had made real progress in the direction of solving the
differences between the two sides over various issues.
</P>
<P>
Before the start of the meeting at noon, Ross said he also
downplayed the expectation for the outcome of the meeting,
saying a Hebron agreement could be solved through one meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was due to start at 1100 a.m. (09:00 GMT) at
the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip, had been
postponed for almost an hour to start with a one-to-one meeting
between Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that Ross's remarks indicated that
Netanyahu and Arafat may hold follow-up meetings, before they
could finally close the accord on the redeployment of Hebron, the
last West Bank city still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, senior officials from the both sides said that
the leaders have to iron out some last minute's details before
signing the accord.
</P>
<P>
The latest dramatic breakthrough in the talks between the
Israelis and the Palestinians on Hebron came Monday afternoon,
when Netanyahu joined the negotiations held at the King David
Hotel in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Ross, who arrived here earlier this week to push
forward the Hebron talks, took an active role in the night-long
intensive negotiations, held at Arafat's Gaza Office. Ross
admitted that difference remained between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In light of the new development, Ross will not return to
Washington for Christmas as previously expected, and is
reportedly to be staying in the region for the time being.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today
urged the Chinese navy to improve in an all-round way its combat
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also chairman of the Central Military Commission and
general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC), told participants at a congress of the CPC
organizations in the Navy that the Chinese navy must resolutely
carry out Deng Xiaoping's thought on army building and the
principles of military strategy in the new period, and enhance the
navy's over-all combat capability.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the achievements the Chinese Navy has made in the past
47 years since its founding, Jiang said, naval officers and
soldiers have contributed greatly to safeguarding the country's
coastal areas and territorial seas, and to maintaining the
country's maritime rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The President expressed his hope that the naval officers and
men will study conscientiously the special features and laws of
army-building, under the new situation of reform and opening up,
carry on the fine work style of the Chinese armed forces, and
build a good image as the people's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks this evening when he met with the
deputies to the eighth Communist Party Congress of the Chinese
Navy, which opened on December 21 in Beijing.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand Cuts Import Tariffs on Petrochemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet today
approved a finance ministry plan to cut import tariffs on
petrochemical products by 10 percent in a bid to enhance
competitiveness of Thai exports.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from the government house, the 10
percent tariff reduction will take effect on January 1 next year
and last six months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the tariff cut, which was agreed upon
by economic ministers on Monday, is lower than the 20 percent
reduction margin proposed by the previous government led by
Banharn Silpa-Archa.
</P>
<P>
However, the tariff cut does not include five petrochemical
products
-- polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchoride and
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. The five products will be subject
to tariff cut in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that the government will examine the
effect of the tariff cut within six months and then it might
decide whether to raise the tariff cut to 20 percent as proposed
by the Banharn government.
</P>
<P>
Thai deputy prime minister Amnuay Virawan, who is in charge of
the country's economic affairs, Monday said that the worldwide
surplus of petrochemical and plastic products might last three to
six months and then it will ease.

biggest cities in Serbia in the second round of local elections
held on November 17.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Belgian PM Calls for EU Summit on Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting the Netherlands on
Monday, Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene declared that in
order to serve any purpose, a summit on drugs between the three
Benelux countries, France and Germany, would require a joint
efforts towards progress.
</P>
<P>
Mr Dehaene was quoted by today's European Report, a
twice-weekly news publication, as saying that he regretted the
adjournment early this year of the summit scheduled in The Hague
in March, claiming that measures prepared for this gathering would
have moved the debate from the squabbling.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Belgian Prime Minister told the
Dutch radio nonetheless that he understood his Dutch counterpart
Wim Kok's decision to adjourn the summit in the absence of the
"necessary conditions for its success".
</P>
<P>
As to whether these questions now exist, Mr Dehaene suggested
the Dublin Summit on December 13 and 14, was "a step in the right
direction", stressing that it was prepared in such a way as to
enable Member States to adopt reasonable measures on drugs policy
while averting a "sterile debate" between Paris and The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Mr Dehaene called for "joint action" to harmonize Member
States' legislation and approach to combating drug addiction and
trafficking, a principle adopted by the European Council.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian Prime Minister added that an bust-up in Dublin
between France and the Netherlands would have cast a shadow over
the Dutch Presidency of the EU which begins on January 1.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands has been criticized by other Member States,
especially France and Ireland, for its permissive attitudes to
soft drugs.
</P>
<P>
Open sale and use of the soft drugs, like cannabis and ecstasy
are now tolerated in Dutch cafe society.

<P>
NEW YORK, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of retailers of
the United States going on-line has more than tripled in the past
year, although on-line shopping makes up less than 2 percent of
retail sales, according to a report of the USA Today on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Entering the Christmas shopping season, shopping is hot
suddenly on Internet, the paper said. Now 14 percent of retailers
are on line -- up from 4 percent a year ago, it quoted a survey
results as saying.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 10,000 on-line shopping sites which
expected to hit 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in sales this year.
That's more than double the amount last year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
While shoppers have been reluctant in the past to make computer
transactions with unknown businesses, a new generation of
well-established retailers is luring customers.
</P>
<P>
"With some big name retailers coming on line, it's making
people more comfortable to shop over their computers," says
analyst Nicole Vanderbilt of Jupiter Communications, a Texas-based
research firm that estimates on-line sales will reach 7 billion
U.S. dollars by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Items sold on line vary to a great extent, ranging from cars,
steel products to books and pizza pies. Book stores found their
customers on line are among the most enthusiastic on-line buyers.
</P>
<P>
As protective software has become a standard of Internet
browsers, concerns about credit card security have declined,
retailers say.

throughout South Africa have been mobilized to curb any possible
crimes committed during the Festival Season beginning from December 3
to next mid-January.
</P>
<P>
Police in Kwazulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Northern Province
were placed on alert on Tuesday against possible violence, Acting
National Police Commissioner Zoli Lavisa said in a statement on
Christmas eve. Christmas is a traditional and grand festival for South

policemen and security personnel in Gauteng and Western Cape are
also being ordered to standby to deal with any emergent criminal
cases in the Christmas period.

as "crime-ridden area" and "a hotbed of crime and violence",
where rates of murder, robbery and rape are extremely high as
compared with other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Of all criminanl cases, women and children usually suffer the
most. An investigation report issued recently by the police said, in
the period between January and August this year, 31,085 cases of rape
or attempted rape had been reported, an increase of 19 percent from
the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
From January to November 1996, the police also attended 12,510
cases of child rape and 3901 cases of indecent assault, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
As part of precautions, policemen and plainclothesmen have for
days been patrolling in pulbic places including shopping centers,
scenic spots and bathing beaches, police authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said on Monday that
police authorities were busy training police officers to deal
sensitively with all criminal cases. He stressed that the security
departments in the country would be on 24-hour standby in the festival
season. enditem

passed in the 205-seat lower house with at least a majority of 103
votes for it.
</P>
<P>
The special house session was summoned by King Birendra as
requested by 102 MPs to discuss the no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
The 102 MPs, including those from the main opposition and some
from two partners of the present three-party ruling coalition,
have claimed that they have lost their confidence in the
government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress (NC)
party.
</P>
<P>
Eleven MPs of the second ruling party -- the National
Democratic Party (RPP) led by its parliamentary leader Lokendra
Bahadur Chand -- and two of the third ruling partner -- the Nepal
Goodwill Party (NSP) -- earlier announced the withdrawal of their
support for the government under Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali
Congress (NC).
</P>
<P>
However, only 101 lawmakers voted in favor of the no-confidence
motion today when it was put to the vote in the house.
</P>
<P>
Opposition MPs claimed that the government has abducted seven
MPs, who were supposed to vote for the motion, to foreign
countries in order to prevent the passage of the motion. But Prime
Minister Deuba denied any "abduction" of MPs by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Deuba government was formed in September last year when a
minority CPN-UML government was overthrown through a no-confidence
motion in the house jointly by the NC, the RPP and the Nepal
Goodwill Party (NSP).
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that the NC-led coalition government
defeated an opposition-sponsored censure motion in the last nine
months.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in March, the three-party coalition government survived
a similar no-confidence motion tabled by the Communist Party as
the second ruling party -- the RPP -- chose to support the
government at the last minute.

<HEADLINE> EU Launches New Strategy for Study of Earthquakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC)
has adopted recently a strategy to improve research and
international cooperation on earthquakes and applied civil
protection measures, it was reported by today's European Report, a
twice-weekly news publication.
</P>
<P>
This new strategy, which will not require additional funding,
will give new impetus to research conducted by the EU since 1986
via 47 projects on seismic risks, with funding in the amount of
ECU 25.6 million(some 33 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the new decision reoriented current
research towards international cooperation, particularly with
Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Measures in the following areas will be stepped up: civil
protection, damage limitation and emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
The EC says that the new strategy will provide for collection
of uniform data on earthquakes, which will require integrated
information systems.
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the world's population live in areas at risk
from earthquakes, and according to the EC, the risks "are rapidly
increasing due to rising population densities and the appearance
of high-risk objects like dams, pipelines, nuclear power plants,
etc."
</P>
<P>
If an earthquake occurred in a European city today, the
consequences would be "catastrophic", the Commission says.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,738 Europeans have been killed by earthquakes over
the past 15 years, including 4,580 in Italy, and the resulting
damage has cost an estimated ECU 430 million(some 559 million
US dollars), according to the Commission.

Workers in the retail, services and tourism industries will

"Manufacturing lines will continue to run because it is too

can only be done when plant is not working," he said.

Main high street banks also plan to dispense with the

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says Hebron Deal to Breathe Life to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that a signing of the Hebron deal will give much-needed
confidence to the frustrated Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It will give confidence to the peace process, and it is the
main issue concerning cooperation in the region," Mubarak told
reporters at a joint press conference following talks with Israeli
Minister of Defense Yitzhak Modechai at the Egyptian Red Sea
resort of Hurghada.
</P>
<P>
During the three-hour meeting, they reviewed the lastest
developments of the peace process in the Middle East and discussed
the Israeli redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, Israeli army was originally
supposed to have completed its redeployment in the Hebron area by
March 28, a pull-back from approximately 80 percent of the town.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment stalled over Israeli insistence on better
security for some 450 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron among 200,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to wrap up the Hebron deal, Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met today
at Erez checkpoint between Israel and Gaza strip.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross said negotiators from both
sides would meet Wednesday morning to continue the work, and
Arafat and Netanyahu would "try to get together again soon."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the summit, Mubarak said: "Maybe it will take some
more time today, but I hope they do not leave until they reach a
solution to all the pending issues." Peace after all, deserves all
sacrifices, he added.
</P>
<P>
When these agreements are carried out, he said, the climate will
greatly improve and people will feel the touch of peace.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli-Palestinian deal also "will bring a good atmosphere
so that negotiations with Syria can start, because Syria has some
demands," he said, adding that Israel's failure to conclude the
Hebron pact had created tensions.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Modechai, the first Israeli defense minister
to visit here in seven years, said he affirmed to Mubarak Israel's
commitment to living in peace and security with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"We are not thinking war, we are thinking how to encourage
peace in the area," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He urged Syria to reopen talks with Israel. "We are trying to
find a way of negotiating with Syria and realize progress in the
peace march," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks on the Israeli-Syrian track was shelved in February
after a series of suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli hardline government led by Netanyahu has rejected
returning the Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel have been accusing each other of preparing for
war and threatening retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Modechai said he expected the Palestinians and the Jewish
settlers would "coexist and respect each other."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has warned that Arab-Israeli normalization would not be
realized unless there is comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister said he hoped that Mubarak will
continue his strong and influential efforts to strengthen
relations between Egypt and Israel because "this is in the
interest of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with the Jewish
state, has been a pillar in the Mideast peace process.

<P>
Speaking after receiving a 10-man committee report on maritime
safety here today, the Minister For Communication and Transport,
William Kusila said the government will work on the recommendations of

</P>
<P>
"Your proposals will help in strengthening maritime safety in
Tanzania and avoid a recurrence of the MV Bukoba disaster," the
minister told the task force.
</P>
<P>
He said maritime safety was a crucial issue which the government
was committed to safeguarding, especially after the MV Bukoba disaster
in which over 500 people died after the vessel capsized in Lake
Victoria last May.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Briefing the minister on the proposals of the committee,
Chairam Costa Mahalu said his committee has suggested short and
long term solutions on maritime safety in the country.
</P>
<P>

inspecion of all marine vessels by maritime experts within a
three-month period, beginning on January 1 to March 31, next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the committee chairman, further short term
suggestions floated by the committee include a call to form a national
maritime safety authority whose role would be to govern marine
operations.
</P>
<P>
The long term proposals put forward by the committee comprise the
need for the government to formulate a comprehensive policy on marine
requirements and uses.
</P>
<P>
The committee wants the policy to encompass marine transport,
fisheries, marine mining, port state control, maritime safety, marine
environmental degradation and a national rescue program.
</P>
<P>
The 10-man committee, which has members from the Tanzania Mainland and
Zanzibar, was formed on November 5, this year.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ethiopia Strives to Double Income in 15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has recently set
a target to double its per-capita income in 15 years which
envisages an average annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) at seven percent.
</P>
<P>
This expresses the government's commitment to alleviate
poverty and backwardness and bring about a sustained economic
development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, as the third most populous country in Africa after
Nigeria and Egypt, is one of the 33 least developed
countries in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's poverty and the associated legacy of a long and
devastating war have made the country one of the most
economically backward nation in the world, with per head GDP
being about 100 U. S. Dollars a year in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ethiopian government has emphasized that "the
overriding objective should be the replacement of the command
economy by an economic stem driven by market forces" since it
came to power in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable progress has been made in economic development
after the government adopted the new economic policy.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement made by the Ethiopian government,
during the reform program for the period 1992-95 under the new
government, the average of annual real GDP rate of growth was 7.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Ethiopia's economy rebounded to grow by 10.4
percent in 1995-96, the highest record during the recent years
and above the average growth rate of African countries.
</P>
<P>
It should be mentioned that the agricultural sector accounts
for about 50 percent of GDP of the country. Ethiopia has achieved
a good harvest for the second consecutive year in 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
In 1995/96, the agricultural sector registered a 14 percent
growth rate as peasants, encouraged by the favorable climate
conditions, peace and stability, and market based economic
development policies, increased their acreage of cultivated land
as well as productivity through a relatively increased use
of modern agro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
The nation has attained for the first time in history almost
self-sufficiency in grain in 1996.
</P>
<P>
To concentrate its effort to alleviate poverty and improve the
living standard of the people, the Ethiopian government has set
the target to double per capita income in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the declared aim of the government, it has planned
that the GDP of the nation to grow at an annual rate of 7-8
percent and the population growth reduced from the current three
percent to two percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has adopted its second reform
program for the period 1996-99. The new medium-term
program is aimed to reduce poverty through a broad based economic
growth in a stable macro-economic environment.
</P>
<P>
Major elements of the program for the three year period
consist of acceleration of privatization, further liberalization
of exchange regime, civil service reform, rehabilitating the
environment and building of physical infrastructure,
strengthening of human resources based of the economy, promoting
family planning, extending fully budgeted social safety net
measures to mitigate social cost of adjustment.
</P>
<P>
During the three years, the program envisages an average
annual growth rate of real GDP of at least seven percent, which
would require public and private investment equivalent of over 21
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Annual average rate of inflation would remain around two
percent, and external current account deficit at about nine
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
To support Ethiopia's effort to alleviate poverty and
sustainedly develop its economy, the donor community who attended
the recent third consultative meeting here for Ethiopia has
pledged 2.5 billion U. S. Dollars over the next three year
period.
</P>
<P>
The pledged assistance will mainly support Ethiopia's
strategies on improving food security, education and health.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's challenge is formidable but its future is bright.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank representative said at the consultative meeting
that "Ethiopia's economy has the potential to grow at a sustained
rate of 7-8 percent over 15 years, particularly in the light of
recent performance and given how far it is from the world's
technological frontier. but this will require intensified,
sustained reform efforts."

targeting an Israeli patrol comprising 15 Israeli soldiers in
the central sector of the bordering buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
It said that the attack on the road between Markaba and
Adaisa in Marjayoun led to the killing of one Israeli soldier
and the wounding of two others.
</P>
<P>
The casualties were confirmed by sources in the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia, which patrols the
1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" established by Israel in
1985 to protect the Jewish settlement in northern Israel from
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic resistance also announced that its fighters
launched a second attack at 3:30 p.m. (13:30 GMT) on the Israeli
position of Tomat Niha overlooking the Western Beqaa.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, the Shiite Moslem guerrilla
group said that the fighters showered the Israeli position with
mortar artilleries and heavy machineguns, but gave no words on
casualties.
</P>
<P>
In a retaliation for the attacks, Israel's artillery
bombarded this afternoon the heights of Ein Al-Tineh and the
vicinities of Ein Al-Amin village.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces shelled the circums of Qabrikha, Wadi
Al-Hajir, Majdal Selm and Al-Jmijmeh this morning.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes hovered over the Syrian-controlled
Western Beqaa in southeast Lebanon and Iglim Al-Toffah, a south
Lebanon mountain area often used by Hezbollah guerrillas as a
springboard to launch attacks at the Israeli occupation forces
and the Israeli-backed SLA militia.
</P>
<P>
Today's casualties added to 26 the Israeli soldiers killed by
Hezbollah guerrillas on the last active battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict since this year, including 19 killed after
a 17-day Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in April.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Lebanese Army Commander Major
General Emile Lahoud inspected this morning the army troops in
positions opposite the Israeli-occupied border strip, on the eve
of Christmas and New Year.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanese National News Agency reported that the
army commander inspected the positions in Iglim Al-Toffah and an
area to the east of the south Lebanese port city of Saida.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the soldiers, the commander clarified that "the
missions of the army in south Lebanon and Western Beqaa stem
from the legitimate and natural right of resisting the (Israeli)
occupation."
</P>
<P>
Praising the soldiers' spirit of persistence and sacrifice,
Lahoud underlined that the security in south Lebanon and in
other parts of the country should be regarded as a "whole" and
could not be disintegrated.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reaction in Israel to Netanyahu-Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The latest development
between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority (PA)
has aroused different reactions among the Likud-led coalition,
reported Israel Radio tonight.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and PA President
Yasser Arafat met for three and half hours at Erez on the
Israeli-Gaza border today, which ended with a progress on partial
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
This development has emerged primarily as a result of the
intensive mediation of the U.S. Middle East peace coordinator,
Dennis Ross, who has shuttled between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Third Way in a statement today urged Netanyahu and Arafat
to sign the agreement on the troop withdrawal soon. It said every
additional delay can cast a question mark over the entire peace
process.
</P>
<P>
But cabinet ministers from the National Religious Party (NRP)
said they will oppose the emerging agreement when it is presented
to the cabinet. Transport Minister Yitzhak Levy said that he does
not think the would-be agreement will ensure the security of the
450 Jews living in the heart of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
At an NRP Knesset (parliament) caucus meeting before meeting
with Netanyahu this evening, the party leaders said they will try
to build up a solid wall of opposition to the approaching
agreement within the government.
</P>
<P>
NRP Chairman Zevulun Hammer is scheduled to meet the Tsomet
party leader, Rafael Eitan, Wednesday to coordinate their
positions.
</P>
<P>
The Likud hawkish ministers have expressed opposition to or
reservation with the forthcoming agreement. Minister of Science
Ze'ev Binyamin Begin said that Arafat is still the enemy of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Infrastructure Ariel Sharon visited Hebron today
saying that the problems posed by redeployment are more grave
than he has thought.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader and Labor Party chairman, Shimon Peres,
welcomed the latest development, saying that the approaching
agreement is roughly the same as that signed by the
Labor-led government.
</P>
<P>
Peres said he hopes to see similar changes in Likud position
with regard to the issue of the Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ethiopia Strives to Double Income in 15  Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has recently set
a target to double its per-capita income in 15 years which
envisages an average annual growth rate of real Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) at seven percent.
</P>
<P>
This expresses the government's commitment to alleviate
poverty and backwardness and bring about a sustained economic
development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, as the third most populous country in Africa after
Nigeria and Egypt, is one of the 33 least developed
countries in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's poverty and the associated legacy of a long and
devastating war have made the country one of the most
economically backward nation in the world, with per head GDP
being about 100 U. S. Dollars a year in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ethiopian government has emphasized that "the
overriding objective should be the replacement of the command
economy by an economic stem driven by market forces" since it
came to power in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Remarkable progress has been made in economic development
after the government adopted the new economic policy.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement made by the Ethiopian government,
during the reform program for the period 1992-95 under the new
government, the average of annual real GDP rate of growth was 7.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Ethiopia's economy rebounded to grow by 10.4
percent in 1995-96, the highest record during the recent years
and above the average growth rate of African countries.
</P>
<P>
It should be mentioned that the agricultural sector accounts
for about 50 percent of GDP of the country. Ethiopia has achieved
a good harvest for the second consecutive year in 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
In 1995/96, the agricultural sector registered a 14 percent
growth rate as peasants, encouraged by the favorable climate
conditions, peace and stability, and market based economic
development policies, increased their acreage of cultivated land
as well as productivity through a relatively increased use
of modern agro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
The nation has attained for the first time in history almost
self-sufficiency in grain in 1996.
</P>
<P>
To concentrate its effort to alleviate poverty and improve the
living standard of the people, the Ethiopian government has set
the target to double per capita income in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the declared aim of the government, it has planned
that the GDP of the nation to grow at an annual rate of 7-8
percent and the population growth reduced from the current three
percent to two percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has adopted its second reform
program for the period 1996-99. The new medium-term
program is aimed to reduce poverty through a broad based economic
growth in a stable macro-economic environment.
</P>
<P>
Major elements of the program for the three year period
consist of acceleration of privatization, further liberalization
of exchange regime, civil service reform, rehabilitating the
environment and building of physical infrastructure,
strengthening of human resources based of the economy, promoting
family planning, extending fully budgeted social safety net
measures to mitigate social cost of adjustment.
</P>
<P>
During the three years, the program envisages an average
annual growth rate of real GDP of at least seven percent, which
would require public and private investment equivalent of over 21
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Annual average rate of inflation would remain around two
percent, and external current account deficit at about nine
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
To support Ethiopia's effort to alleviate poverty and
sustainedly develop its economy, the donor community who attended
the recent third consultative meeting here for Ethiopia has
pledged 2.5 billion U. S. Dollars over the next three year
period.
</P>
<P>
The pledged assistance will mainly support Ethiopia's
strategies on improving food security, education and health.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's challenge is formidable but its future is bright.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank representative said at the consultative meeting
that "Ethiopia's economy has the potential to grow at a sustained
rate of 7-8 percent over 15 years, particularly in the light of
recent performance and given how far it is from the world's
technological frontier. but this will require intensified,
sustained reform efforts."

<HEADLINE> 100 Alleged Terrorists Killed in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Defense
Force in an offensive has killed and wounded over 100 alleged
terrorists who tried to cross into Ethiopia in an attempt to
attack the town of Dollo again.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted a statement issued by the
Defense Ministry as saying today that 19 members of the
multinational Islamic extremist group killed during the recent
offensive were Arab nationals from different Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"The terrorists were crushed last August by the Ethiopian
Defense Force while bracing to destabilize the sub-region and
impose Islam fundamentalism by force with the help of some
neighboring countries," the statement recalled.
</P>
<P>
It added that the remnants were forced to flee to far off
areas deep into Somalia in a futile attempt to reorganize
themselves.
</P>
<P>
However, Somalia accused Ethiopian troops of crossing into
Somalia 20 kilometers and taking the Somali town of Dolow,
killing 47 militiamen of an Islamic group.
</P>
<P>
Yet the Ethiopian statement said the multinational terrorist
group has been bent on preparing itself for the past five months
with the assistance it received from certain neighboring
countries and crossed the Ethiopian border recently in an attempt
to attack the border town of dollo.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Defense Force "has gallantly fought and
destroyed the terrorists", the statement said, adding that
following the offensive, the remnants of the group were forced to
retreat in disarray back into Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the Ethiopian people to "remain
vigilant, against activities of the terrorist group" and stressed
the readiness of the defense force to ward off any attempt of
aggression.
</P>
<P>
''the attempt by the fundamentalist group to attack Ethiopia
after recuperating for some time is a proof that it is determined
to destabilize the sub-region and spread its extremist ideology
by force,'' the statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia will not tolerate the futile attempt by the group to
impose its belief on neighboring countries and reiterated its
determination to deal a crushing blow at such an attempt, the
statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the Ethiopian Defense Force killed 232 alleged
terrorists.
