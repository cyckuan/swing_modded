 &HT;    In 2000, tickets won't be so scarce
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTS to ``Atlanta'' Braves in lede.)
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Atlanta Braves officially presented themselves as
host of the 2000 All-Star Game in a Tuesday morning breakfast. What
became clear is that Major League Baseball is looking forward to
having a site where tickets might actually be available.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the All-Star Game has been held in Colorado and
Cleveland, where season-ticket bases are over 40,000, and then
Fenway Park, so small (33,871) that tickets were never put up for
public sale. After granting first priority to Braves season-ticket
holders (26,000) and 10,000-plus going to Major League Baseball's
disposal, 50,062-seat Turner Field offers a larger share of tickets
to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think with that ticket base, you'd have some kind of
public availability,'' said MLB public relations manager Pat
Courtney.
</P>
<P>
   The experience won't come cheaply. Tickets at Fenway this week
went for $150 for box seats, $100 for reserves and $75 for the
grandstand. Those prices are expected to hold for 2000. Braves
season-ticket holders will receive All-Star ticket information with
next year's order forms, with public sale expected in April.

Shootout has
border town on edge 
Pat Flannery 
The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN LUIS RIO COLORADO, Sonora _ A furious weekend shootout
between Mexican police and a gang of suspected drug traffickers put
this normally placid border town on edge, prompting its mayor to
seek the help of federal troops if violence erupts again.
</P>
<P>
   Three smuggling suspects died, and four other people, three of
them city police officers, were wounded during a fusillade in a
vacant lot only blocks from the Arizona border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inevitably, there's a sense of worry,'' Mayor Florencio Diaz
Armenta said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our citizens don't understand who is responsible for what.
There are tensions because there are people dead, and state
authorities are looking for suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   During the roughly 10 minutes that bullets were flying, one of
the bandits tossed a fragmentation grenade into the melee, but it
failed to explode, Assistant Police Chief Santiago Huizar Rubio
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old boy, who was not identified, was passing by the
area when the violence started. Huizar Rubio said he was wounded
along with the three officers. All are expected to live.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law enforcement officials, who are used to battling the
steady flow of drugs and associated crime along the border, say the
extremity of Sunday's violence was surprising. Roughly two dozen
men armed with AK-47s opened fire on police. There were reports
that the fragmentation device was fired from a grenade launcher.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agents on both sides of the border were still
scrambling Tuesday to make sense of the outburst and to learn more
about an alleged drug kingpin whom Mexican authorities identified
as Gil Amarillas.
</P>
<P>
   Huizar Rubio said Amarillas was identified as the boss of a drug
smuggling operation by some of those involved in Sunday's shootout.
He said the organization is thought to be based in San Luis,
because most of those killed or arrested were native to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police in southern Yuma County were alerted to watch
for suspects from the shootout trying to cross into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal agencies in Arizona also put two of the three
wounded Mexican officers under protection in Arizona hospitals and
whisked the officers' immediate families to hideouts north of the
border after threats were made on their lives, said Ernesto Lugo, a
police officer in San Luis, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of drug activity, yes,'' Lugo said. ``But for
it to get this violent, especially against police, is very
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Lugo, the department's liaison with Mexican law enforcement,
said authorities know little about Gil Amarillas and his gang.
</P>
<P>
   As Mexican federal police, or Federales, took over the
investigation, police fanned out through the city Monday and
Tuesday seeking suspects and drugs. Huizar Rubio said officers
raided 15 homes, arresting 10 suspects. He declined to release
their names.
</P>
<P>
   Huizar Rubio also declined to name those killed. ''El
Independiente,'' a newspaper published in Hermosillo, on Tuesday
listed the dead as Alberto Velazco Ojeda and Jesus Armando
Alcantar, both of San Luis, and Hector Madrid Amarillas, from
Mexicali in Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   The injured officers were identified as Ramon Ramos, who was
hospitalized in Mexico with a bullet wound to the stomach;
Guillermo Arreola, hospitalized in Arizona with leg and foot
wounds; and Israel Avendano Parra, hospitalized in Arizona with a
head wound and symptoms of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   According to municipal police, Sunday's deadly fray started with
the arrest of a man in his early 20s for speeding through town.
</P>
<P>
   The speeder was jailed but paid a fine and was released
Saturday. Early Sunday, the suspect and his friends, armed with
assault rifles, found the arresting officer and confronted him. The
police officer was roughed up and threatened, but he escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Thugs next went to the home of the officer's parents and
threatened his family.
</P>
<P>
   Huizar Rubio said a 36-man security force was being assembled
when police learned about armed men in a vacant lot just east of
the city's heart. As patrol units arrived, they were met with
gunfire. Huizar Rubio said it was an ambush, and the cross-fire
continued as reinforcements were called in.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, a bullet-riddled wall was the only remaining
evidence. Cars cruised by with occupants gawking at the damage.
Across the street, at the Motel Continental, it was business as
usual.
</P>
<P>
   One of those stopping to take in the sight was Jose Lopez
Beltran, a San Luis native who was angry at police for engaging the
gang in a gunfight with so many innocent people nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really shouldn't put people in danger,'' Lopez Beltran
said, adding that he'd never seen that kind of violence in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Other bystanders and workers in nearby businesses were reluctant
to discuss the shootings, fearful of reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   But Augustin Diaz, a San Luis cabdriver who frequently cruises
through the neighborhood, said people are scared. ``People are
afraid to talk about it. They don't know what will happen. It could
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's hail of bullets was not the city's first. In 1997,
Benjamin Flores, editor of the local newspaper, ``La Prensa,'' was
gunned down for his journalistic crusade against drug trafficking
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Several other less-publicized killings took place in the city
during that period, as Mexico's powerful drug cartels battled for
control of smuggling turf. However, city officials maintain that
San Luis, a bustling commercial center in an agricultural region,
has been safe ever since.

KANSAS SET TO FIGHT U.S. OVER TRIBAL CASINO PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Plans for a tribal casino in Miami County,
Kan., have advanced to final review stage before the U.S.
Department of the Interior _ setting up a potentially bitter battle
with indignant Kansas authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time ever in this country that the federal
government has cast aside a state's legitimate role in matters such
as this, and we will not simply sit idly by and take it,'' said
Mike Matson, a spokesman for Kansas Gov. Bill Graves.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department's action takes place under rules it
unilaterally imposed on the states earlier this year. Those rules
are being challenged in court by Florida and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Left unchallenged, the rules empower Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt to license tribal casinos and allow them to be regulated by
another federal agency with virtually no input or oversight from
state or local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Graves was notified Monday of the Interior Department's decision
regarding the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma's casino plans for a site
near La Cygne Lake about 20 miles south of the Johnson County line.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Graves, Bureau of Indian Affairs gaming
management director George T. Skibine advised the governor that the
state had 60 days to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 60 days you can expect something from the state,''
Matson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Matson indicated that response most likely would be a
lawsuit seeking to block any further action by the Interior
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Florida sued earlier this year when the Interior Department
granted similar casino clearance to that state's Seminole Tribe.
Alabama later joined in that action, which is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Skibine said Tuesday that the governor of Nebraska also had been
advised in recent days that a casino proposal by the Santee Sioux
Tribe in that state also had advanced to final review.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can work with the states,'' said Nedra Darling, a
spokeswoman for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. ``These rules have
good intentions to work together. We're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department has heard complaints like Kansas' since
the rules were first proposed early in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respectfully disagree with the arguments raised by the
states,'' Babbitt's office said this spring in a written statement
explaining how the rules work.
</P>
<P>
   After years of litigation against Kansas and others, the Miami
Tribe last year won various court and federal agency rulings
declaring its historic tribal lands in Kansas eligible for casino
gambling under the 1988 federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
</P>
<P>
   However, those approvals came in the midst of a fight between
Babbitt and Congress over the agency's rule-making authority under
the gaming act.
</P>
<P>
   The rules empower the secretary, as a last resort, to approve
and license casinos when tribes and their state governments are
unable to negotiate mutually acceptable tribal gambling agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Under Interior's new rules, states are invited to participate in
the review process and propose alternatives regarding the type of
gambling allowed and other details.
</P>
<P>
   But the final decisions rest with the interior secretary, who
``will take those (state) views into account in his decision-making
process,'' the agency said in its explanatory statement.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1997 blocked Babbitt from implementing the rules,
but that moratorium expired March 31. The rules went into effect
May 12.
</P>
<P>
   On May 25, the Miami Tribe submitted its casino plans to the
department, which advised Graves on Monday that the tribe's plan
met federal eligibility requirements and that the final review
process had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the states' rights issue, Matson said Kansas was
fighting the Miami proposal because it would compete with four
other tribal casinos in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fundamental fairness issue as it relates to the four
indigenous (Kansas) tribes who have been in the state since the
1800s and who have played by the rules,'' Matson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor doesn't believe it is fair to them to allow an
out-of-state group to play on the same field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami casino would be built and managed by Olathe-based
Butler National Corp.

<P>
   BOSTON -- They formed a scrum around Ted Williams at the center
of the Fenway Park diamond last night, the greatest collection of
baseball stars _ past, present, and future _ ever assembled in a
single setting. Feller to Mays to Garciaparra, a century's timeline
arcing into a single circle.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Famers in suits, which included Hammerin' Hank, the
Say Hey Kid, and Yaz, and the All-Stars in full uniform blended
into an emotional tableau of applause, hugs, and tears around the
golf cart transporting Williams, the 80-year-old Red Sox icon who
before our eyes is being transformed from Teddy Ballgame into
Father Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to imagine, in the wake of such a dramatic
prelude, that anyone playing in the 70th All-Star Game could make
this stage his own. But as one fan in the sellout crowd of 34,187
in Fenway Park shouted from the grandstand, ``This is your house,
Pedro,'' Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez once again staked his claim on
Yawkey Way's most precious property.
</P>
<P>
   In a pitching performance that rivaled one of the All-Star
Game's most legendary moments _ Carl Hubbell of the Giants striking
out Hall of Famers Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons,
and Joe Cronin in succession 65 years ago _ Martinez struck out the
side in the first inning, then struck out two more batters in the
second inning, setting the tone in the American League's 4-1
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's victims were Barry Larkin, Larry Walker, and Sammy
Sosa in the first inning, Mark McGwire and Jeff Bagwell in the
second. Sosa is the biggest star in Martinez's native Dominican
Republic, and a close second here to McGwire, whose Home Run Derby
performance Monday night will remain a part of Fenway lore.
</P>
<P>
   But the bats of the game's biggest sluggers were turned to
sawdust by Martinez, who allowed one base-runner to reach, Matt
Williams, who got on board on Robbie Alomar's error, and was erased
when Bagwell whiffed, ending Martinez's stint.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez became the first pitcher in All-Star history to strike
out the game's first three batters, and tied an American League
All-Star record, shared by the Monster, Dick Radatz, and Billy
Pierce of the White Sox, for most strikeouts in a game, five.
</P>
<P>
   As Dorchester's Donna Summer was finishing her elegant rendition
of the national anthem, four F-14s thundered past, seemingly
skimming across the tops of the Fenway light stanchions.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, a clear, 67-degree midsummer's delight, the
complaints about the noise would be few, although surely there was
some minor grumbling that Martinez only worked the first two
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The National League broke through in the third against
Martinez's replacement, David Cone of the Yankees, but not before
Cone struck out the first batter he faced, Mets catcher Mike
Piazza, the sixth NL strikeout victim of the night.
</P>
<P>
   First-time All-Star Jeromy Burnitz, the Milwaukee Brewers'
slugger, lined a double to right, and after Jay Bell looked at a
third strike for the second out, the Reds' Larkin grounded a single
up the middle, Burnitz scoring to make it 2-1. Walker was retired
on a comebacker to the mound, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   American League manager Joe Torre had said before the game that
he was thinking of sending Garciaparra onto the field for the start
of the third inning, then sending Derek Jeter of the Yankees out to
replace the Red Sox shortstop before play resumed.
</P>
<P>
   That way, Torre said, Garciaparra would receive a final sendoff
from the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I do that,'' Torre said, ``my own guy (Jeter) won't get
booed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Torre put off doing so, allowing Garciaparra to lead off the
bottom of the third against the Big Unit, Randy Johnson, the
majors' strikeout leader with 200.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who lined to right against National League starter
Curt Schilling in the first, swung at Johnson's first pitch and
lifted a high fly to shallow center, where the Cubs' Sosa gathered
it in.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on cue, Jeter emerged from the American League dugout and
met Garciaparra just in front of second base. The two shook hands
in front of second base, then embraced, and then with his usual
stiff-legged gait, Garciaparra trotted off the field to sustained
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez received a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the first, as
three of the four Indians in the starting lineup, plus Iron Cal
Ripken, combined to start the AL team.
</P>
<P>
   Leadoff man Kenny Lofton, taking advantage of Schilling's tardy
arrival at first base, beat out an infield hit to McGwire at first
base. Two outs later, Lofton stole second and Manny Ramirez of the
Indians drew a full-count walk. Jim Thome, the Indians' first
baseman, lined a 1-and-0 single to center, scoring Lofton with the
game's first run, and Ripken hit Schilling's next pitch to right
field, scoring Ramirez to make it 2-0.

NATIONAL MANHUNT UNDER WAY FOR SUSPECT IN 1985 MURDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fourteen years after Los Angeles County sheriff's
Sgt. George Arthur was shot to death, police said that they have
solved the crime: DNA matches prove a fellow deputy was the killer.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide manhunt was under way for Ted Eugene Kirby, a
deputy who retired to Spokane, Wash., and disappeared after the DNA
test.
</P>
<P>
   Police said he was in the van with Arthur when the June 1, 1985,
slaying occurred. Kirby was employed as a deputy at the same jail
at the time of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur was leaving the jail and getting on the freeway when he
was shot, causing the van to crash. Witnesses at the time said they
saw a man crawl from the wreckage and flee, but the investigation
was plagued by missteps, according to the first detectives on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Los Angeles police and sheriff's deputies reopened the
case, reinterviewed witnesses and took DNA samples from several
people including the 54-year-old Kirby, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNA sample obtained from Ted Kirby was found to match the
DNA sample left near the crime scene by the murderer,'' Los Angeles
police Capt. Jim Tatreau said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, Los Angeles police detectives went to Kirby's home in
Spokane, where he had moved in 1996, but his wife said he left on
foot June 30 without explanation and hadn't returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kirby was described as being depressed, emotional and possibly
armed with a handgun,'' Tatreau said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police declined to provide details about the
investigation until a news conference scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
   Unanswered questions include:
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Why Kirby would shoot his co-worker in a moving vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Kirby was a suspect at the time of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   And why police obtained his DNA sample.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur, 37, had been with the department for 14 years and
received its highest award for bravery in 1977. On June 1, 1985, he
left his job at the Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles and
was driving his Chevrolet van to his home in Rancho Cucamonga.
</P>
<P>
   Tatreau said they believe Kirby was inside the victim's van when
he left the jail at 9:50 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Arthur was shot in the head several times before
the van hit a concrete divider on the Mission Road on-ramp to the
eastbound San Bernardino Freeway in Boyle Heights. He was
pronounced dead later at Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Officers initially thought Arthur had died from injuries in the
traffic crash, but 27 hours later, the Coroner's Office found
Arthur had been fatally shot.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems with the case, according to detectives who first
investigated it 14 years ago, occurred because Arthur was shot in
the van, but officers at the scene _ unaware that a shooting took
place _ allowed the vehicle to be towed away and cleaned out.
</P>
<P>
   Also witnesses told police they saw a man limp away from the
crashed van after being thrown through the windshield. But a search
was not done for at least a day, when detectives determined the
death was the result of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives recovered a ``variety of evidence, including
biological evidence left by the murderer, from which DNA results
were ultimately obtained,'' Tatreau said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after hundreds of interviews, the murder appeared to be
unsolvable until new technology allowed the use of DNA in crime
investigations, Tatreau said.
</P>
<P>
   At the LAPD's request, Spokane County sheriff's investigators
and the city's police contacted Kirby at his home near 16th Avenue
and Carnahan Road the last week of June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continued the inquiry locally to recover additional
evidence,'' Deputy David Reagan, a spokesman for the Spokane County
Sheriff's Office, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This led police to issue an arrest warrant for Kirby on Monday.
He was charged with capital murder, with no bail, Reagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby is described as white, 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighing
220 pounds, with gray hair and hazel eyes. Police said he is
considered armed and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities asked that anyone with information on Kirby's
whereabouts contact the LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division at (213)
485-2129, or Detective Headquarters' after-hours number, (213)
485-2504.

EDITORIAL: FATEFUL MOMENT IN IRAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 14:
</P>
<P>
   The stifling Islamic dictatorship in Iran has never been a
comfortable fit for a complex, youthful nation of nearly 70 million
people. Now, thousands of students and other protesters in Tehran
and other cities have taken to the streets to challenge the power
of the fundamentalist ayatollahs. They have been greeted by violent
repression. The clerics who control the security forces are in
danger of misreading their nation as badly as the shah did two
decades ago if they think they can prevent change with tear gas,
bullets and vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   The student protesters are invoking the more democratic and
liberal values espoused by President Mohammad Khatami and backed by
a substantial majority of Iranians, particularly young people and
women. In the long run, these more humane values are likely to
prevail. Nearly two-thirds of Iranians are now under the age of 25.
But the immediate course of events will depend on whether the
clerical authorities led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei understand that
they must relax their stranglehold on Iranian society.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, a moderate cleric, was elected president two years ago.
Promising a more tolerant and pluralistic but still Islamic
society, he won 69 percent of the vote against a candidate favored
by the clerical establishment. Millions of devout Muslims support
Khatami's program. But under Iran's constitution, the president
exercises only limited power. Fundamentalist mullahs have tried to
thwart Khatami's reform policies. Outspoken liberals have been
attacked and killed. Khatami allies have been prosecuted and
jailed, and pro-reform newspapers silenced.
</P>
<P>
   It was the closure of one such newspaper, Salam, that set off
the university protests. The crisis intensified after security
forces and chain-wielding Islamic vigilantes raided Tehran
University, causing at least two student deaths. The unrest has now
spread beyond Tehran and represents the most serious threat to
clerical control since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Although the attack on Tehran University was carried out under
Ayatollah Khamenei's authority, he has publicly condemned the
incident. Yet his statement, which absurdly blamed America for the
university raid, failed to appease angry students.
</P>
<P>
   The students are right to protest the harsh repression of the
clerics and to demonstrate their impatience with the slow progress
in carrying out Khatami's reform agenda. But they should avoid
violent street demonstrations. These discredit their cause and
force Khatami to align himself with clerical conservatives, as he
did on Tuesday. Khatami, for his part, must make clear distinctions
between the violence of some protesters and the justice of what
they are demanding. He needs to remain credible as a voice for
change.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei, meanwhile, needs to restrain his fundamentalist
supporters and let more power flow to the elected government. By
continuing to maneuver against Khatami, Khamenei risks plunging
Iran into violent turmoil.

RESIDENTS FIGHT TO SAVE TREES ON THEIR BLOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WINSTON ROSS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ On one of the hottest days of the year, the
sun beats down, broiling the landscape. Relief, at least outdoors,
is hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   But along a few blocks in one Kansas City neighborhood, John
Gartin has found a hiding place.
</P>
<P>
   There are giants on his block, the 400 of West 62nd Street _
giants named hackberry, elm and sweet gum, with big leafy branches
for arms and tremendous brown trunks for torsos. They form a canopy
that blocks most of the harsh sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   But Gartin and his neighborhood may soon lose their giants.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the older trees on the west end of his block are
on what his neighbors call a city ``hit list.'' City officials say
they are worried that when construction begins for new curbs and
sidewalks, the roots of some of these trees will be cut, causing
them to die and fall onto people's houses and cars.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't just in Gartin's neighborhood. Ralph Davis,
the city's manager of street design services, said curb and
sidewalk projects in the 4th District have skyrocketed in recent
years as the city has shifted more money to basic services.
</P>
<P>
   When Davis started working three years ago, fewer than a
half-dozen projects were in the works, he said. Now there are 44.
Only 19 have been surveyed, said Kevin Lapointe, a forester with
the city, but in those, 84 trees will need to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Some blocks may see their trees spared; others could lose as
many as 10. There are 101 curb and sidewalk projects pending
citywide; officials could not give an estimate of how many trees
might be endangered by the work.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Neighborhood fight  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gartin doesn't look much like a fighter, but when it comes to
defending the trees in his neighborhood of 15 years, he'll strap on
the gloves quicker than a chain saw can cut through a sapling.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors will, too.
</P>
<P>
   Twin sisters Connie and Cecilia White voted in favor of the curb
and sidewalk project on their block, the 600 of West 62nd Street.
Now, five years after the vote, city forester Charles Knight has
released a list of 20 trees that must come down within a
three-block radius, where four curb and sidewalk projects are
planned.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, the trees are doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said these trees, like many in the city, have grown out
of the space originally set aside for them. Their roots are
buckling sidewalks, turning a neighborhood stroll into an obstacle
course.
</P>
<P>
   Residents point to other projects in nearby neighborhoods that
have found ways to preserve their older, larger trees. In some
cases, the sidewalks are built higher to leave room for roots; in
others, the walks are routed around trees. These residents said
they don't understand why the city can't be as innovative in their
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Whites circulated a petition to halt the cutting down of
their trees. Gartin, the vice president of the Greenway Fields
Neighborhood Association, helped organize a neighborhood meeting
with city officials. Residents were able to persuade officials to
re-examine the issue. Knight said he would go back to the
neighborhood, to see whether anything can be done to save the
trees.
</P>
<P>
   But he makes no promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trees are wonderful,'' he said. ``But you can have the most
beautiful tree there, and once you cut all the roots, it becomes a
major liability problem. As soon as it kills someone, nobody's
going to worry about how beautiful the tree is.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-three damage claims were filed against the city involving
trees from May 1998 through April 1999, said assistant city
attorney George Sharp. The city paid damages on eight of those
claims. The total bill: $3,900.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 83 claims were a result of storm damage, Sharp said,
for which the city is not liable. The city is liable only if it
knew about a problem and failed to effectively prevent it.
Sidewalks or trees?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The clash between tree lovers and sidewalk proponents is bound
to grow with the increase in these projects, Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   After Knight revisits the issue, residents again will vote on
whether they want the curbs and sidewalks, Davis said. Neighbors
are torn between the need for new sidewalks and the desire for
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The Whites' neighbor, Florence Casey, comes down on the side of
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived for 26 years in this house,'' she said. ``I've been
trying to get new curbs and sidewalks since I moved in.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey believes some neighbors are balking at the cost of paying
for the new installments. Under the 4th District's policy,
residents pay 80 percent of the property owners' cost of
installation; the city, 20 percent. For homeowners on this block,
that can range from $2,000 to more than $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish people would be more truthful about the real reason
they don't want curbs and sidewalks,'' Casey said, ``Or go live in
Johnson County, pay their taxes, and the city will do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey and a few other neighbors want curbs and sidewalks now,
regardless of what happens to the 20 trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many times I've tripped over them in the
dark,'' she said. ``There are kids riding bikes, roller skating.
It's dangerous.''

INSURANCE AGENT SENTENCED TO PRISON, ORDERED TO REPAY INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An Independence, Mo., insurance agent who
bilked 66 investors out of $4.8 million in an investment scheme was
sentenced Tuesday to three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Fernando J. Gaitan Jr. also ordered Jerald
F. Albin, 55, to repay his investors, many of whom were his close
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, however, cautioned more than 40 of Albin's victims
who attended his sentencing hearing not to expect full restitution.
</P>
<P>
   From 1988 to 1998, federal prosecutors said, Albin used
investment programs to operate what is commonly known as a Ponzi
scheme, promising high rates of return through short-term financing
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Albin used about $4.3 million for his own
benefit, to operate his companies and to pay some investors. For
example, he paid himself at least $190,000 for such items as a new
BMW automobile and Lake of the Ozarks property. About $235,000 was
used for legitimate stock investments.
</P>
<P>
   Six of Albin's victims testified Tuesday, asking for a variety
of punishments. Some wanted Albin to go to prison for a long time;
others asked that he receive a light sentence so he could return to
work and start making restitution.
</P>
<P>
   One man asked that Albin be required to carry a large life
insurance policy that, at his death, would pay off his investors in
full.
</P>
<P>
   Most, however, focused on the personal hardship and suffering
that Albin had brought to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Jerry was an honest man and a friend,'' said Ruth
McGrath. ``He took our dreams away from us. I hope you lay awake at
night, thinking about the lives you have ruined. You even took our
11-year-old grandson's college fund and spent it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before hearing his sentence, Albin promised the judge he would
work to repay his victims. He also apologized to them for violating
their trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be more sorry for...my clients and the destruction
and devastation in their lives,'' Albin said. ``The loss of faith
is devastating to them and to myself as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Albin could have been sentenced from 33 months to 41 months in
prison. Saying that Albin's crime was a ``terrible injustice,''
Gaitan said the sentence also should serve as an example to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sentence of substance is important here for others who may
be thinking about this kind of thing,'' Gaitan said. ``There is a
price to be paid for this conduct.''

MISSOURI ACTIVISTS PETITION FOR REFERENDUM ON DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Opponents of capital punishment are
circulating petitions in Missouri to force the nation's first
referendum on abolishing the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Missourians Working for Life must collect at least 80,000
signatures by May 7, 2000. Volunteers started their efforts in
Kansas City this week at housing projects, City Hall and the City
Market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the public will take a look and see that executing
people isn't being tough on crime,'' said Larry Rice, a campaign
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   If the petition drive is successful, the referendum would take
place in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot language, approved by the secretary of state's office
this month, calls for Missouri to replace the death penalty with
life imprisonment. Those sentenced to life in prison would not be
eligible for probation, parole or release except by act of the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri has executed eight men this year, a record since the
state resumed executions in 1989. Rice said the public thinks the
state has gone overboard with its use of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Holste, a spokesman for the attorney general's office,
said many juries already forgo capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, there are those crimes where the death penalty should
be an option for Missouri juries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri capital punishment opponents hope to benefit from Pope
John Paul II's visit to St. Louis in January, during which the pope
persuaded Gov. Mel Carnahan to commute the death sentence of
Darrell Mease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope's visit was, for some people, very significant,''
said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty
Information Center, a Washington-based nonprofit group critical of
capital punishment. ``These things do have a snowball effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon activists are pushing for a similar referendum next year.
Organizers, led by former Sen. Mark Hatfield, plan to submit their
application to state officials on July 22.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion in Missouri and nationwide remains solidly behind
the death penalty. Opponents hope their cause will benefit from
lower crime rates and recent reports of wrongly convicted death-row
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 petition drive to abolish the death penalty fizzled when
backers failed to secure enough signatures.

hedFrozen embryos spur ethical debate 
By Kerry Fehr-Snyder 
and Graciela Sevilla 
The Arizona Republic 
Technology: 1; ethics: 0.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly two decades after doctors perfected the art of freezing
human embryos, the dilemma of what to do with leftover fertilized
eggs is growing.
</P>
<P>
   `'The philosophical question is `What are those embryos to begin
with?' '' said Dr. Michael Grodin, director of medical ethics at
Boston University's School of Medicine and Public Health. ``You
shouldn't be making them (embryos) without having a plan of how to
handle them.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happened at Arizona Reproductive Medicine and
Gynecology, which is getting out of the in vitro fertilization
business on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix clinic plans to let its unclaimed frozen embryos and
sperm thaw and be disposed of as biomedical waste.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the clinic ran a classified ad to locate 50
embryo donors and as many as 70 sperm donors that it cannot find.
About 28 embryo and 15 sperm donors had responded as of Tuesday,
the clinic's patient coordinator Kathy Fink said.
</P>
<P>
   Some couples chose to transfer their embryos to another clinic
at an average monthly cost of $60 for storage. The clinic says it
has no choice but to dispose of the fertil ized eggs belonging to
donors who do not come forward.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of unused embryos is becoming thornier as medical
science outpaces law and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's going to be a lot more need to deal with
embryos that are abandoned or no longer needed,'' said Jeffrey
Kahn, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of spare embryos was unimaginable a generation ago, be
fore fertilization technology and the ability to preserve
fertilized eggs was developed in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the debate centers on whether embryos should be viewed as
viable human beings or a cluster of cells smaller than the naked
eye can see.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen embryos are created by mating a woman's harvested egg
with a male sperm in a petri dish. After a few days, when the cells
have divided several times, the embryo is frozen in liquid nitrogen
tanks to be preserved for later implantation.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, donors need to preserve more eggs than they use,
creating a surplus. In many cases, they never consider what to do
with the spare embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1988, who would have believed they (donors) wouldn't come
back for their embryos?'' Fink said.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, the clinic has lost track of some of its early
donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the reason is that we have been doing this for so
long,'' Fink said. ``These were created before the paper trail and
documen tation was put into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two days, Fink said she has been fielding calls
from people arguing that the clinic should donate the embryos to
infertile couples instead of destroying them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't ethically do that,'' she said. ``They're not ours to
give away.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of the Right to Life movement and some religious
lead ers see it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a situation where (embryos) are abandoned, why
don't they just pass them on to another sperm bank and let couples
who want children adopt them? Then life can go on,'' argued John
Jakubczyk, a Phoenix attorney and president of Arizona Right to
Life.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma also disturbs local leaders of the Catholic Church,
which opposes conception outside marriage and questions in vitro
fertilization on ethical and moral grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Msgr. Edward Ryle said of the embryos,
``Obviously, you're dealing with human life there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if God had not gotten around to giving us the Old and New
testaments . . . destroying hu man life would still be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the nation's 300 fertility clinics have
instituted ``in formed consent'' practices that spell out what
happens to embryos left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Fink emphasized that the vast majority of clients with surplus
embryos don't want to donate them to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over spare embryos is likely to grow as bioethicists
debate the federal research ban on ``stem cells,'' the seed cells
of life.
</P>
<P>
   At the president's National Bioethics Advisory Commission, which
is meeting this week in Cambridge, Mass., some scientists are
lobbying for the use of excess embryos for stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say using embryos this way could further research for
cures for everything from spinal cord injuries to Alzheimer's, valu
able alternatives to destroying them.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, 3,000 fertil ized eggs are abandoned in this
country. American Society for Re productive Medicine guidelines
state that embryos may be discarded if their donors have been out
of contact for more than five years with the clinic and cannot be
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is the first generation of assisted
reproductive technology providers retiring,'' said Debra Crawford,
a spokeswoman for the society. ``It's increasingly an issue as the
field of reproductive technology ages.'' &QL;

MARTINEZ LEADS AMERICAN LEAGUE TO 4-1 ALL-STAR GAME WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pedro Martinez, still miffed because he didn't start
last year's All-Star game, dazzled the vaunted National League
hitters Tuesday night and made All-Star history in doing it. The
talented Boston Red Sox pitcher became the first pitcher to strike
out the first three batters in this game, then ran his successive
strikeout streak to four and wound up striking out five of the six
batters he faced in the American League's 4-1 victory. Martinez was
named the game's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the string of strikeouts were Sammy Sosa and Mark
McGwire, batting in the same lineup for the first time since they
electrified America last season with their scintillating race to
the home run record. Sosa struck out for the third out in the first
inning, and McGwire struck out for the first out in the second
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was putting everyone away with fastballs,'' said Larry
Walker, one of Martinez's victims, ``but he probably could have
told you what was coming and still got you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the American League's third straight victory, and its
ninth in the last 12 All-Star games.
</P>
<P>
   For the fans at Fenway Park, their hero's performance was
nothing new. He leads the league in strikeouts with 184 (84 more
than the next pitcher, David Wells, has), in victories with 15 and
in earned run average with 2.10. If he were to maintain his lead in
all three, Martinez would win the pitching version of the Triple
Crown. He is also threatening to reach 30-victories, a rare feat
last accomplished by Detroit's Denny McLain in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The fans got an additional treat when the Hall of Famer and Red
Sox great Ted Williams, 80, was brought onto the field in a golf
cart before the game and then threw out the ceremonial first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The performance Martinez staged recalled the record strikeout
string Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants reeled off in 1934 in
the second All-Star game. Hubbell, the first pitcher to start an
All-Star game in his home park, the Polo Grounds, allowed the first
two American League batters to reach base, then struck out Babe
Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx. In the second inning, Hubbell
kept the streak going by striking out Al Simmons and Joe Cronin.
Bill Dickey ended it with a single to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, the latest pitcher to start in his home park, Fenway,
and the first since 1982, struck out Barry Larkin of Cincinnati,
Walker of Colorado and Sosa of Chicago in the first inning. Larkin
went down on a feeble swing, Walker took a third strike and Sosa
swung mightily and missed for his third strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw Sammy a couple of breaking balls,'' Martinez said. ``I
saw his reaction. He didn't react well to the breaking ball. I
threw one, then a second one.'' But he struck him out with a
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   As the pitcher went to the dugout, the highly partisan crowd of
34,187 chanted, ``Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   When the National League team went to bat in the second inning,
nothing much changed. McGwire, who 24 hours earlier had crushed 13
home runs in 23 swings in the first round of the home run contest,
led off and struck out swinging. Matt Williams of Arizona then
spoiled the string, hitting a grounder to second that Roberto
Alomar bobbled for an error. The NL had its first base runner.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez reverted to form, striking out Jeff Bagwell of
Houston, the designated hitter, as Williams tried unsuccessfully to
steal second base. Ivan Rodriguez of Texas threw him out for an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy and excited to be the first to strike out the
first four to start the game,'' Martinez said. ``And I hope that
this is just one of many.''
</P>
<P>
   The American League hitters, meanwhile, supported Martinez with
an early burst, scoring two runs against Curt Schilling of
Philadelphia in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Lofton, one of four Cleveland players in the starting
lineup, began the inning by hitting a grounder wide of first to
McGwire and beating Schilling to the base for a hit. Schilling
retired Nomar Garciaparra of Boston on a fly to deep right field
and Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle on a called third strike, but Lofton
stole second and Manny Ramirez of Cleveland, the major leagues'
leader in runs batted in with 96, walked.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome of Cleveland then lined a single to center, driving in
Lofton, and Cal Ripken of Baltimore, an All-Star for the 17th time,
singled to right, sending Ramirez home.
</P>
<P>
   Finally safe from Martinez, the NL scored a run against David
Cone of the Yankees in the third inning. Cone struck out two of the
first three batters, but the one in between, Jeromy Burnitz of
Milwaukee, rapped a double along the right-field line. The batter
after the second strikeout, Larkin, singled him home.
</P>
<P>
   The NL loaded the bases against Cone in the fourth on a walk to
McGwire and two-out singles by Bagwell and Mike Piazza of the Mets,
but Cone induced Burnitz to ground to first for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   The AL increased its lead to 4-1 with two runs in its half of
the fourth against Kent Bottenfield, the St. Louis Cardinals'
surprising 14-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield walked Thome and hit Ripken with a pitch, putting
himself in instant trouble. Rafael Palmeiro of Texas singled Thome
across and, after Rodriguez struck out, Alomar rapped a grounder
that Williams couldn't handle at third base and Ripken scored.
</P>
<P>
   With Mike Mussina of Baltimore pitching, the NL threatened again
in the fifth but again fell short. A leadoff walk to Jay Bell of
Arizona and a one-out double by Luis Gonzalez, his teammate, put
runners at second and third with Sosa and McGwire the next two
batters. But Mussina fired a third strike past Sosa, and McGwire
also struck out for the second time.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Martinez, baseball's best pitcher this season, was a true
superstar in a game that featured many first-time All-Stars, while
many of the familiar big names were missing. They included Greg
Maddux and his Atlanta teammates, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz.
Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds, Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez, Kevin
Brown and Wade Boggs weren't here for Tuesday night's game, either.
</P>
<P>
   With 24 of this year's 60 players on All-Star rosters for the
first time, including 17 of the National League's 30, Fenway Park
was filled with players who have not been considered stars. Instead
of Maddux, Glavine, Smoltz and Brown, the NL pitching staff had
Bottenfield, Paul Byrd, Kevin Millwood and Jose Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Biggio at second base or even on the bench as the
backup, the NL team had Jay Bell in the starting lineup and Jeff
Kent in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big difference here not seeing Glavine and Maddux,''
Lima, Houston's 13-game winner, said. ``Even Craig Biggio. Not just
because he's my teammate, but he deserves to be here. Look at the
numbers he's accomplished. The way he plays, I don't think nobody
plays harder than that man. I'm disappointed he's not here. He
deserves to be here because he's one of the greatest second basemen
in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bell ended Biggio's four-year run as the NL's starting
second baseman, edging him in the fan balloting by 32,000 votes.
``I was shocked probably more than anything else,'' said Bell, one
of two Arizona players in the starting lineup. ``Certainly Bidge
has been the main focus, the fair-haired second baseman over the
last six or seven years. He's deserved that honor.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ The distinction for the Comets is one of pride, having
the Big Three of the WNBA's only champions voted by the fans to the
Western Conference first team for the inaugural All-Star Game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson are discussed
by opposing coaches and players in almost reverential terms.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes led the All-Star voting, a testament to her rise in
popularity. Cooper twice has been recognized as the Most Valuable
Player for the regular season and championship round.
</P>
<P>
   But often lost are the deeds of Thompson, the 6-2 forward who
was the first college player drafted in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the major things you tend to forget about Tina
Thompson,'' Comets coach Van Chancellor said Tuesday. ``You don't
know how young she is, just two years removed out of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an all-around player she's become. What I think about her
is she's become tremendous night after night after night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect her to be our leading rebounder; we expect her to
guard Yolanda Griffith, Natalie Williams, Jennifer Gillom, Lisa
Leslie, the top centers in the league. And not only that, she's
supposed to score. So it's amazing how far she has come.''
</P>
<P>
   The talents of Thompson and the rest of the WNBA All-Stars will
be on display at 6:30 p.m. CDT today at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper and Swoopes will be there, showcasing their skills.
Sacramento point guard Ticha Penicheiro, the league's assists
leader, is sure to dazzle. Leslie (Los Angeles Sparks), Griffith
(Sacramento Monarchs), Williams (Utah Starzz) and East center Kym
Hampton (New York Liberty) will gain a fair share of attention. New
York point guard Teresa Weatherspoon will show why she was the
league's Defensive Player of the Year each of the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But look beyond Thompson's statistics to appreciate what she
brings to the game, said Monarchs guard Ruthie Bolton-Holifield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tina has always been, to me, a real nice player,''
Bolton-Holifield said. ``But she's real versatile for a big player.
She shoots extremely well, like a guard, (is) strong inside. She's
proven that she is an All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's proven that she can play with the big people. When I
played with her in the World Championships, she was a great person,
friendly, very versatile and just loved the game. I see a lot of
improvement in her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know sometimes she gets open because of Sheryl and Cooper.
But she definitely is a player that (deserves) a lot more
recognition because she's doing an excellent job for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how long Thompson is on the court, try to get a
grasp of some of the skills she has mastered, said East coach Linda
Hill-MacDonald. The coach of the Cleveland Rockers, the defending
Eastern Conference champions, got her latest look at Compaq Center
on July 1, when the Rockers lost 76-64. She was reminded of how far
Thompson has progressed since coming out of Southern Cal in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what I saw when we went to Houston that I hadn't
seen in her game when she first started as a rookie, and that's her
developing an inside game, being an inside threat,'' Hill-MacDonald
said. ``Now, she's always had the ability to step out on the
perimeter, hit the 3-point shot, to rebound. But I'm telling you
what, she can post up with the best of them and just killed us
inside when we went to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think she's matured as a player. She's playing with a
whole lot more confidence and self-assuredness. That's elevated her
play as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 24, was a finalist for the Naismith Player of the Year
award as a USC senior and was voted to the Associated Press
All-America second team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never too far away from a basketball,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Thompson was a member of the USA women's national
team that went 4-1 on a European tour. She was named to the 1998
WNBA touring team that was 3-1 against some of the best pro teams
in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   This season, she is averaging 13.9 points (15th in the league)
and 6.6 rebounds (12th) for the Comets (13-2).
</P>
<P>
   The only flaw in Thompson's game might be her moodiness.
Cooperative and cheerful one day, she can be full of gloom and doom
the next. There have been times when she has openly and harshly
debated with Chancellor when he wants her to take a breather.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor said this downside to Thompson's personality comes
from her nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tina Thompson has one of the most competitive attitudes of any
player I've ever been around,'' he said. ``She wants to win; she
wants to play. And like all other players, the longer she plays,
the more she wants the basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. You've got
players who think they can score, who think they want the
basketball. That's just part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson might play second fiddle to Swoopes and Cooper, but
that doesn't seem to matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tina has done a wonderful job of knowing what her role is and
handling every situation,'' Swoopes said. ``When people mention the
Big Three, usually they think of Sheryl, Tina and Cynthia. But it's
usually more Sheryl and Cynthia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely know that without Tina on this team, there's no
way we would have won two championships. And I think she's come in
this year and picked up her game offensively, defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tina has a lot to offer this team. It's unfortunate she
doesn't get the recognition I think she deserves, because of all
the attention being focused on myself and Cynthia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Tina's a great player, a great person. And she always puts
the team before any individual goals and honors she wants to
achieve. It's because of that reason that we have been
successful.''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Even assuming T.J. Brown is far better than
the average 5-year-old basketball player, his father, Larry Brown,
the 76ers coach now coaching the U.S. entry in the pre-Olympic
qualifying tournament, should have little difficulty one-on-one.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is telling, then, that when the senior Brown considered his
team's chances of winning the tournament, even while trying to
defend the chances of the nine opponents hoping to upset the USA
Basketball Men's Senior National Team, he thought of competing with
a 5-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``In basketball, you can lose to anybody,'' said Brown, who
moved into the top job when Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich had to
skip the tournament for health reasons. ``I have a 5-year-old son,
and he beats me. So who knows? But we didn't come here to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The chances of that seem too remote to consider. The U.S.
players would not waste their time on that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not happening, so it's not even something to think
about,'' Hawks guard Steve Smith said. ``We're going to go out
there and play and have a lot of fun and represent our country
well. Losing is not in our head.''
</P>
<P>
   So unlikely are the chances of an upset that tournament
organizers seemed thrilled when NBA Hall of Famer and former Dream
Team member Larry Bird, representing one of the tournament's
sponsors, said: ``I wish Puerto Rico luck in the tournament. I hope
they come in second.''
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Rican team is considered the next-strongest in the
field. But hearing Bird's wish, Salvador Vilella, the tournament
organizing committee president, said: ``It would be great to come
in second. We'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tuesday's practice ended with Smith using a stutter step to
get free and nail a running 15-footer over the Suns' Tom Gugliotta,
Blue beat White 27-25 and the tournament likely had its last close
game that included anyone in a USA Basketball shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The team must play for the gold medal July 24 to earn a place in
the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament begins today, but the U.S. team does not play
until Thursday night against Uruguay. And every U.S. game will
bring comparisons to past American teams.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Dream Team will be judged on everything from its
efficiency to comportment. It will compete as much with the legacy
of its predecessors as with the tournament field. Its finest
performances will be viewed as a minimum standard. As they left the
court at Roberto Clemente Coliseum on Tuesday, the players seemed
to relish that mandate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it more fun,'' Suns guard Jason Kidd said. ``People
will say, `They only shot 45 percent. They only won by 30.' That
first Dream Team _ they raised the bar. They showed a higher level.
We have to do what they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has opinions. Some people go to a movie and think
it's a great movie. You might go and not like it. Opinions are
everywhere. We have to play at a high level. We can't come down and
turn the ball over. We have to have a good shot every time. We have
to be inside, outside, show the versatility of each guy. Hopefully,
we do all that and this show we brought to Puerto Rico will get a
thumbs up.''
</P>
<P>
   But that might not be enough. Every U.S. international team with
NBA players is compared to the first, the 1992 Olympic team, the
only other U.S. team that had to play in a qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But when a reporter said the current team might be more athletic
than the original Dream Team, Bird said: ``Your eyesight is not as
good as it used to be. The United States can always put together a
quality team. They do have a lot of talent here. But in 1992, we
had a lot of talent, too. Who out there is more athletic than
Michael Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about the team we had in 1992, we had a lot of
players who had been in the league a long time. A lot of guys on
that team had won a championship. We had everything _ shooters,
rebounders, passers, scorers _ and all of us were together. It was
a great team, one that wanted to be together.''
</P>
<P>
   That team, led by Jordan, Bird, Magic Johnson, Karl Malone,
Patrick Ewing and David Robinson, had players in their prime or
even past it; the current team is likely to be led by players just
approaching their best, including Tim Duncan of the Spurs, Kevin
Garnett of the Timberwolves and Allan Houston of the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dream Team, the first one, was unbelievable,'' Smith said.
``It was made up of Hall of Famers. We have young guys. Me and Tim
(Hardaway) are getting kind of old. But the rest of the guys the
way they're starting their careers, Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, Gary
Payton, Jason Kidd, those guys definitely will be in the Hall of
Fame, too. We have a lot of great players.''
</P>
<P>
   If measuring up to that legacy is not enough, the team might
also be expected to inspire a style of play, emphasizing passing
and movement, rather than the isolation the NBA has hoped to
minimize through rule changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to come from the stars,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions, they are here. There are three players from
last month's draft _ Elton Brand, Wally Szczerbiak and Richard
Hamilton _ who could be replaced on next year's Olympic team by the
likes of Shaquille O'Neal or Grant Hill. But there is enough talent
to make such matters as Olympic qualifying or winning fait
accompli. How it's done has become the tougher charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to come out and dominate and demonstrate the right
way of playing basketball and winning games,'' Kidd said. ``Since
'92, the NBA has shown the world the way to play basketball. We've
shown dominance out on the court. That's our job to continue that,
to show off our sport.''

OFFICIALS BRINGING BACK FOULS

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the laboratory frontier of the Summer Pro League,
NBA-sanctioned whistles that usually are set on ``stun'' have been
operating on full power.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the crosshairs are shocked defenders, unsuspecting
rogues who are conditioned to use their hands and forearms to
discourage or alter the progress of a ballhandler. In recent NBA
seasons, this tactic has made perimeter defense look something like
a sumo summit between divorce lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a new sheriff in town. Actually, there are a few of
the same older sheriffs veteran NBA officials, such as Hue Hollins
seated in the Pyramid's vulture-vantage seats, monitoring the
wannabe refs who are enforcing the league's new mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Maestro, a little mandate music, please. Thank you.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that mandate is ... thou shalt not touch.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely, there will be no touching on the perimeter. Touching
even the slightest brush with a trusty forearm is a SPL foul,
mister.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's strategy is to make it easier for dribblers get to the
hoop, score points and make the whiny,
we-need-to-be-more-offensive-minded critics happy.
</P>
<P>
   Five days into SPL's run, the frequent whistleblowers haven't
made the Christmas-card lists of coaches and players. The precious
flow of many SPL games has been on a detour march to the free-throw
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make it almost impossible to defend anybody on
the perimeter,'' said one NBA head coach whose desired anonymity
was granted by the prospect of future technical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   But Clippers point guard Troy Hudson offers a perspective that
should be considered by everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it really tough to keep in front of your man,''
Hudson said, ``but if they call it both ways, it shouldn't be a
problem. We just have to get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The SPL's history has been abetted by timely, on-court visits
from NBA stars, but several paragraphs of its mission statement if
it had one would include the goal of identifying players others may
have missed.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Creger, the SPL's talent coordinator and a basketball nut
who's has been involved with the league since its inception, is the
custodian of these success stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is Robert Pack,'' Creger said of the ex-USC point guard,
who was not chosen in the 1991 NBA Draft. ``He asked me if you had
to be on an NBA team to play in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, not quite.
</P>
<P>
   So Pack played, the Portland Trailblazers liked what they saw,
signed him, and he's been in the league (and frequently on the
injured list) since.
</P>
<P>
   OK, not a compelling story, right?
</P>
<P>
   Let's try Marc Iavaroni, who made his SPL debut in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Creger just happened to place Iavaroni who had played in an
Italian pro league after finishing a solid career at the University
of Virginia on the same team with Philadelphia 76er prospects Mark
McNamara and Franklin Edwards. Matt Guokas, a 76er assistant coach,
came to Loyola Marymount (the SPL's home that year) to watch
McNamara and Edwards, and didn't leave until head coach Billy
Cunningham and owner Harold Katz came west to see Iavaroni.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iavaroni was smart,'' Creger said. ``He didn't agree to come
to their camp until he had a guaranteed contract. He didn't want to
go there and get cut, because it would have been too late to get a
good contract back in Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 76ers came through with the guaranteed scoots, and
Iavaroni rewarded their faith by becoming the 76ers' starting power
forward later that season, one that ended with a sweep of the
Lakers in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   This year's story?
</P>
<P>
   An early contender is Kebu Stewart, a 6-foot-8 power forward who
had 34 points and 15 rebounds for the Clippers in Sunday's loss to
Golden State. Stewart's performance included 20 made free throws in
28 attempts, numbers that owe more to his bullish style than to any
hair-trigger referees.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was a second-round pick of the Sixers in 1997, played in
only 15 games as a rookie, then split the past season between
Europe and Sioux Falls of the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES
</P>
<P>
   Those who wonder why the Seattle SuperSonics mailed Corey
Maggette, their first-round pick (13th overall) to Orlando should
come out and watch 6-10 small forward Rashard Lewis, their
19-year-old, second-round pick from 1998. ... The SummerSonic roll
call includes point guard Randy Livingston, who generally was
considered the nation's top high school player at that position in
1993. The scars on his right knee define a college career at LSU
that was limited to just 29 games over two seasons. He averaged 14
points and nine assists in 16 games as freshman. Livingston was
chosen by the Houston Rockets in the second round of the 1996 NBA
Draft, but ended up in the CBA (Sioux Falls) last year. He was
picked up by the Phoenix Suns as the season drew to a close, and
did a solid job backing up Jason Kidd. ... It's difficult to decide
who attacks a game more - second year Lakers forward Ruben
Patterson, or new Lakers assistant coach Jim Cleamons, who prowls
the sideline like someone looking for a few good men. ... Forward
Antawn Jamison, Golden State's top rookie after the celebrated swap
with Toronto (Vince Carter) on draft night in 1998, has had his
summer plans altered. The Warriors viewed this SPL gig as an
opportunity for him to sharpen his perimeter skills, but Jamison
rolled his ankle in last Saturday's Golden State opener. ...
Running the point for the SPL edition of the Portland Trailblazers
is C.J. Bruton, the former Indian Hills Junior College star who
signed with Iowa State, failed to qualify, entered the 1998 NBA
Draft, but wasn't selected. Bruton's father, Cal, played at Wichita
State then became a huge star in Australia's top pro league. ...
Former Inglewood High and Kansas star Paul Pierce was the NBA's
second most-productive rookie in 1999, but that's not stopping him
from playing for the SPL's version of the Boston Celtics.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 14:
</P>
<P>
   It's not a vendetta. That is what Gov. George Pataki's people
say about Pataki's refusal to anoint Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as the
strongest Republican candidate in New York for the Senate next
year. This silence from Pataki, they insist, has nothing to do with
the fact that the mayor endorsed Mario Cuomo for governor five
years ago. Who remembers such trifles? The governor's neutrality is
a way to foster the democratic process, his office proclaims. An
open nominating process allows a free exchange of Republican ideas
and promotes good government.
</P>
<P>
   The political-science platitudes are nice, but with an election
approaching and the Democrats rallying around the prospective
candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton, many in the Republican Party
are urging Pataki to take a more practical approach. National
Republican leaders want Pataki to shed his grudge and look at
political realities. In any year, contested party nominations and
primaries tend to divide parties and voters, and they soften up the
eventual nominee for his or her general-election opponents. In
2000, it looks as if New York's fractious Democrats may be united
and energized behind Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For our part, we favor freely contested primaries and would be
happy to see Reps. Rick Lazio or Peter King face Giuliani in a GOP
primary. But we do find the personal and tactical situation to be
fascinating. Does Pataki really think Lazio or King would be a
stronger opponent for Mrs. Clinton? Or would he and his waspish
communications director, Zenia Mucha, prefer losing to the
Democrats to seeing their intramural rival land in Washington?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mucha says there is no rush to narrow the field and that it
is good for the party to have candidates ``out there testing the
waters.'' But some waters apparently need more testing than others
for the governor. Pataki was part of the rush to endorse Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas for president even though the Republican
presidential primaries are not until next year. So just maybe there
is an Albany corollary to Tip O'Neill's famous maxim that all
politics is local. In the New York GOP, perhaps all politics is
personal.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, July 14:
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
which endured a period of organizational turmoil several years ago,
seems ready again to address issues of concern not only to
minorities but Americans in general. This week Kweisi Mfume,
president of the NAACP, announced two important initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a class-action lawsuit against the gun industry, to
be filed later this week in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.
Rather than seek monetary damages, the organization will ask for an
injunction against the gun industry's distribution and marketing
practices that allow guns to wind up in the wrong hands. Mfume
argues that illegal trafficking in guns, made possible by a failure
to control distribution, disproportionately affects minority
communities. National statistics show that African-American males
between the ages of 15 and 24 are more than three times as likely
to be killed by gunfire than white males of similar ages, and that
guns are a leading cause of death for young black males.
</P>
<P>
   Gun deaths, of course, are not limited to minority communities.
But any headway the NAACP achieves in forcing the gun industry to
reform its practices will help curb gun violence everywhere. There
are more than 31,000 gun-related deaths in the nation annually.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP also announced that it would begin monitoring
diversity in the television and film industries _ an effort, Mfume
warned, that could lead to a boycott of certain shows and of the
sponsors who underwrite them. Of 26 new prime-time shows on the
major broadcast networks this fall, not one will have a minority
character in a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks or other ethnic minority characters are featured in a
number of returning shows, and cable television also provides a
measure of diversity. But the absence of minority principals in the
new shows on the ``big four'' networks is still troubling. The
broadcast networks have an important responsibility to serve the
needs and interests of a general public that includes significant
minority communities. The NAACP raises an important civic issue
that needs attention.

COLLEGE JOCKS' ONLY MISTAKE GETTING CAUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Anyone familiar with big-time college sports is rarely
surprised when one of its student-athletes is busted for a
``mistake,'' as it often referred to euphemistically in
jock-department hallways.
</P>
<P>
   What defines a mistake is subject to interpretation. In first
grade, I was told that getting seven by adding four and two was a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In college life now, a mistake might include clobbering a woman,
trashing a frat house, burglary, turning in bogus term papers or
fraudulently obtaining disabled parking permits _ to name a few
sports headlines from the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, however, it will a ``mistake'' only when caught.
And even when busted, the athletic department will find ways around
it, so that it won't even show up as a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   That became apparent in news reports over the weekend out of
Minneapolis, where the investigation of the University of
Minnesota's outlaw men's basketball program took another nasty
turn.
</P>
<P>
   School investigators, led by a local attorney, turned up a
welter of shenanigans by athletic officials to protect miscreant
jocks from criminal punishments, including a case in which a female
student was talked out of pressing charges against a football
player by an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the kicker: It was the fifth charge of assault or sexual
misconduct involving the guy in nine months, and the coaches may
have been aware he was accused of sexual assault when he was
recruited.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the other findings:
</P>
<P>
   -- In at least five cases, university officials openly
discredited a victim's account of the offending conduct, sometimes
in the presence of the victim or her parents.
</P>
<P>
   -- Athletic officials in several instances showed bias in favor
of the accused athlete in ways that, in the eyes of the victim and
others within the university, were inappropriate and compromised
the integrity of the university's investigation. In one instance,
an official sat in on the police interrogation and argued with the
detective.
</P>
<P>
   -- Other actions by the athletic department frustrated
investigations of misconduct, including the withholding of
important information by basketball coaches.
</P>
<P>
   -- Five ``side deals,'' arranged by the athletic department
between accused athletes and their victims, ended the
investigations and avoided prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation exposed a systematic, successful attempt by
the UM athletic department to hide the thuggery of its athletes,
even if it meant trampling the rights of victims.
</P>
<P>
   The university president, Mark Yudof, offered up the predictable
outrage, calling the disclosures ``deeply troubling,'' and
installing some band-aid reforms in university procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Yudof already forced the resignation of basketball coach Clem
Haskins, who brought his team to Seattle in March for the first
round of the NCAA basketball tournament when the story broke back
home about hundreds of phony academic papers written for players
for years by a former academic counselor.
</P>
<P>
   But Yudof, as with nearly all his contemporaries in charge of
NCAA Division I jock factories, is mostly helpless to make
meaningful change. Winning is too important to the athletic
department and the university to consider a standard that might
interfere with appearances in bowls and tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful any school president has the guts to be the first
to alter a system prevalent almost forever. Athletic departments
for years have been handling everything from parking tickets to
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say that every athlete or school is as reckless as
Minnesota, but the potential for abuse everywhere is strong because
there is nothing in the NCAA system or any university that offers a
sufficiently serious impediment to thuggery by ``students'' who
help make lots of money for everyone _ except themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if a booster buys a hungry jock a hamburger, look out.
Plenty of rules and punishments for that.
</P>
<P>
   While every athletic department will defend itself with not-us
rationalizations, this spring's frequent episodes of criminality
locally and nationally make a far more compelling case than the
denials.
</P>
<P>
   How about those 14 UCLA football players busted for using
illegally obtained disabled parking permits? What a splendid
statement about citizenship. Give these guys some rope, and every
widow in town will be tied to railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Seattle, three Husky football players are escaping
felony prosecution for their parts in the May trashing of a frat
house that included assaults. Even though their identities are
known to the cops, the victims and the athletic department, there's
allegedly enough ambiguity about exactly who did what so that the
King County prosecutor's office is backing off.
</P>
<P>
   Would anyone be surprised to learn that witnesses either had
been intimidated or bought off?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the depth and breadth of the Minnesota scandal will
provoke the kind of contempt about criminal behavior that occurred
a decade ago about NCAA rules at Southern Methodist and the rest of
the late Southwest Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it. These recent episodes are, after all, just
mistakes. Aren't we all entitled to a few?

BUSH AND HIS FUND-RAISING MACHINE STOP IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Gov. George W. Bush brought his high-rolling
presidential campaign to New Jersey for the first time Tuesday
evening, telling a roomful of Republican campaign contributors that
his brand of ``compassionate conservatism'' is the best hope for
continuing the nation's prosperity while strengthening its moral
character.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raising dinner held at the Sheraton hotel next to
Newark International Airport, Bush delivered his standard campaign
speech about tax cuts and the importance of personal
responsibility, making scant reference to New Jersey or issues
affecting urban areas like Newark. He spoke briefly with reporters
and declined to say whether his campaign, which had raised a record
$36.3 million by July 1, will refuse federal matching funds. Such a
move would give Bush more flexibility in his campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   Although some supporters conceded that Bush's message was short
on specifics, many said they were optimistic that his charm,
conviction and ideals would play well with New Jersey's moderate
Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked about his ideas,'' said Irene Almeida, chairman of
the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners, who attended a private
roundtable discussion between Bush and an assortment of Republican
officials before the dinner. ``He didn't go into details, but those
will come later. The good thing is to see how he talks to people,
his warmth. And that he really seems to believe deeply in what he's
saying. You can just see it in the way he talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who flew in from Austin, Texas, also had reason to feel
upbeat. Clifford Sobel, the finance chairman of the New Jersey
Republican Party, announced that the event raised $1 million,
meaning that Bush has now raised more money in the state than any
other candidate _ including Bill Bradley, the Democratic
presidential hopeful and former U.S. senator from New Jersey who
lives in the state. About 500 people paid at least $1,000 each to
attend the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first presidential primaries are still half a year
away, Bush has become a daunting front-runner for the Republican
nomination and the list of his supporters at the event Tuesday
included most of the prominent New Jersey Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The co-chairmen of the event were Donald DiFrancesco, speaker of
the state senate, and Jack Collins, speaker of the Assembly. Gov.
Christie Whitman, a Republican who has said she will not endorse a
presidential candidate until after this November's elections, met
privately with Bush before he made his speech, and many of her
Cabinet members and campaign officials attended the event.
</P>
<P>
   During his half-hour address, Bush spoke about his desire to
spread the nation's prosperity and reach out to the poor. He also
vowed to make public education a priority, and pointed to his
success in improving the test scores of Texas students during his
five years as governor.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest applause came when Bush made a reference to
President Clinton's impeachment and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put my hand on the Bible, I'll swear to uphold the
dignity of the office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hotel, Bush was greeted by a small group of
demonstrators from the gun control group Ceasefire New Jersey, who
protested his opposition to several proposals to limit the sale of
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned by reporters, Bush defended his record of
supporting gun owners' rights and said he did not think it would
hurt his prospects in states like New Jersey, where public opinion
polls show that a majority of voters embrace gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what elections are for,'' he said. ``But I'm proud of
my record.''

GOBRECHT QUITS HYDRO ASSOCIATION POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Yet another shake-up atop the Unlimited Hydroplane
Racing Association has left drivers and teams pondering the sport's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gobrecht surprised the UHRA Board of Directors last
Wednesday when he resigned as president and chief executive
officer, less than 10 months after assuming the hydros' top post.
It is the circuit's fourth significant change of command in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ken Muscatel of Seattle, the hydros' acting commissioner,
will take on Gobrecht's administrative duties in the interim.
Muscatel also owns and drives a hydroplane in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sport is in much better shape than it was last fall and
it's in very capable hands with Dr. Muscatel,'' said Gobrecht, 48,
a former Seafair race director.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Gobrecht working full time as a series executive, now
the hydros will be a client of his California-based sports
marketing business. That change in roles, he said, was at the heart
of his decision to step down. He said the day-to-day business of
running the series didn't afford him time to make good use of his
expertise in marketing, specifically to secure a major sponsor for
the series. Now he can concentrate on the sponsor search.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, I think I needed to come in full time because
we had a real crisis on our hands then,'' said Gobrecht. ``The
series was in disarray. Now the fires are out. I wanted to go in a
different direction and this seemed like the time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gobrecht's announcement _ on the eve of the sport's
prestigious Gold Cup event on the Detroit River _ caught most off
guard. There are seven races remaining on the 12-race schedule,
including the Aug. 6-8 Seafair Texaco Cup on Lake Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is inconvenient because of the timing, but at the same
time Bob got us through the tough parts,'' said Muscatel. ``His
vision is still in place and I'm trying to take that vision and
move forward. I'll just have to use more people within the hydro
commission to fulfill it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hydro series participants were optimistic about Gobrecht's
hiring last September. His marketing experience, they hoped, would
help turn around a struggling series competing against NASCAR, the
NHRA and two open-wheel series for a share of the motor sports pie.
</P>
<P>
   Gobrecht is credited with adding races in Lake Havasu, Ariz.,
and Barrie, Ontario, to the 1999 hydro schedule. He also helped
ensure the status of the two Indiana races, whose financial woes
put their existence in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very sorry Bob decided to resign,'' said Bernie
Little, owner of 15-time series champion Miss Budweiser. ``He was
just getting a good start at what he was doing. Maybe everyone was
expecting too much out of him too fast, but he'll be missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had seen him in Detroit, I would have tried to talk him
out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gobrecht's departure follows the resignation of commissioner
Bill Doner last summer. Ned Allen and Muscatel each ran the
organization briefly prior to Gobrecht's eagerly anticipated
hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Now some people, including Seattle driver Chip Hanauer, worry
what the high turnover rate signals about the stability of a sport
trying to stay afloat. Hanauer said the integrity Gobrecht brought
to the hydros was a factor in his decision to come out of
retirement this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as a threat to the sport immediately, but
what Ken and Bob were doing was keeping their fingers in the dike
and keeping this from going under,'' said Hanauer, who is second
all-time in UHRA career wins (61), one behind Bill Muncey.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did that and this sport has more life in it this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the sport so desperately needs credibility and
stability, we now have had three or four commissioners in less than
a year. That is not going to help our cause in motor sports. This
is just shooting ourselves in the foot.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of Muscatel taking on additional
duties and the appearance of a conflict of interest since he is a
competitor as well as a series official. Hydro partipants don't
seem as worried about Muscatel's ethics as competitor vs. series
executive. Instead, the concern is how productive one person can be
when doing the jobs of so many.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a bit much, that's safe to say,'' said
Muscatel, who also maintains a full-time practice in Seattle as a
clinical psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, on the face of it, it's a conflict of interest, but
the loser is me. My boat didn't even qualify for the first two
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to play it straighter than anyone since I'm wearing so
many hats. We're trying to do the right thing, though, and I
believe we're headed in the right direction.''

JOHNSON TO START AGAINST MARINERS ON TUESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Arizona Diamondbacks manager Buck Showalter confirmed
Tuesday that left-hander Randy Johnson will start next Tuesday at
Safeco Field. The former Mariner will start at Texas tomorrow, then
start the finale of Arizona's series in Seattle on July 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any pitcher relishes the opportunity to pitch
against a team with 100-some home runs,'' Johnson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Padres right fielder Tony Gwynn also will see action
at Safeco Field. Gwynn, who was elected to the starting lineup for
Tuesday night's All-Star Game but is on the disabled list with a
strained calf, will be activated and bat cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm playing right or designated hitter,''
Gwynn said during the National League's batting practice. ``But as
late as 10 minutes ago, I'll be in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's two children are more enthusiastic over Safeco Field
than he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a new ballpark, I know it's a big thing _ just
want to get back on the field, man,'' Gwynn said. ``I'm not caught
up in all of that, because I want to play. My biggest concern is
going out there and seeing if I can do my job, let alone opening up
a new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm sure it will be exciting. My kids didn't want to come
here _ they wanted to go to Seattle. So I'll be meeting them up
there. But in all honesty, I could care less that it's a new
ballpark. I just want to get out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   ACTIVE LEGENDS: Mariners center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. was one
of eight current players named to the ballot for the All-Century
Team. A panel of media members, executives and historians chose 100
players for the ballot, including St. Louis' Mark McGwire,
Baltimore's Cal Ripken, San Francisco's Barry Bonds, San Diego's
Tony Gwynn, the Mets' Rickey Henderson, the Yankees' Roger Clemens
and Atlanta's Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   Only Ripken and Henderson appeared among the 27 retired legends
at a news conference Tuesday, and not all players were aware of the
honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will vote for two players at each infield position, nine
outfielders (out of 34) and six pitchers (out of 26). Voting will
be done at major league ballparks, K-Mart stores and on Major
League Baseball's Web site, with the team of 25 to be announced
just before the World Series. An additional five players will be
added to the team in case of ``inequities'' in the voting,
commissioner Bud Selig said.
</P>
<P>
   PATIENCE: ``Safeco Field is a bandbox,'' Frank Robinson said,
before a question was even asked.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the Hall of Famer who hit 586 career home runs, said
people have rushed to judgment on how the Mariners' new ballpark
will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for Camden Yards and Coors Field, people have always
complained about the ball not traveling in a new ballpark,'' he
said. ``What you have to do is wait a year. In April, you don't
know how it's going to play compared to June, July and August _ the
air current, the atmosphere. They complained about SkyDome, and all
of a sudden balls were flying off the Hard Rock Cafe. Give it time,
give yourself time to mentally adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Hall of Famer, Harmon Killebrew, said he was looking
forward to his first visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Idaho, and I'll be excited to see it,'' he said.
``I've been invited to come up, but I'm doing so many things and
it's difficult to do that. But I'll get there.''

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BOSTON _ You can take andro. I'll take Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   You can take the Monday night Home Run Derby and all its
spectacle of bulging biceps and towering drives. I'll take the
classic pitching thoroughbred, the guy named Pedro Martinez, and
his classic array of pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a fastball, a changeup and a curveball,'' the Boston
Red Sox ace said of his wicked arsenal. ``It's nothing very
different just pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what made it all so special. In a classic setting
amid the greatest names the game has known, it was a brief but
refreshing performance Martinez put on. It was just baseball.
</P>
<P>
   You flex your biceps. Pedro bends your knees. You step up there
with the flashbulbs popping. Pedro gets you to swing at air three
times in a row. You bring your best. Pedro brings something better.
</P>
<P>
   And Pedro wins 4-1 in the first All-Star Game of the rest of
baseball's life, as he put on a show for the ages Tuesday night at
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the age Martinez brought back was that of Babe
Ruth, Lou Gehrig and the like. Not since Carl Hubbell in 1934
struck out in succession five members of the century's greatest
players _ Ruth, Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin _
has someone put on such an exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably could tell you what he's throwing and still get
you out,'' Colorado Rockies slugger Larry Walker said of Martinez.
``He's probably the top pitcher in the game, and he'll be there for
a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   He showed it in the first two innings of the game, striking out
an array of names that could make their way to baseball's Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Barry Larkin, Walker, Chicago's Sammy Sosa, St.
Louis' Mark McGwire and the Astros' Jeff Bagwell struck out. Larkin
and Walker never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only really saw about two pitches,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   A Martinez curveball buckled Sosa at the knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw he didn't react real good to my curve,'' Martinez said.
``I threw another one, and then I threw the changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire never stood a chance, whiffing on three pitches, then
dragging his bat back to the dugout as he shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell fouled one off, but it's as close as he got. The only
player who got wood on the ball during Martinez's awesome display
was Arizona's Matt Williams, who reached on an error by Roberto
Alomar but was thrown out trying to steal on Bagwell's strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   The performance set the table for the American League's win and
marked the first time any All-Star pitcher struck out the first
four batters. It also made Martinez, the home team's hero, the easy
choice for Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone told me in the dugout that it was a record,'' Martinez
said. ``It makes me happy and proud. I was really emotional, but it
wasn't because of the record. It was because so many of the great
players to ever play the game were there, people that were heroes.
So many glories of baseball were out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But none stood out as much as Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when one of the game's great stages _ Fenway Park _
stood up and took a nostalgic last bow, Martinez put on a nostalgic
show that was important to see.
</P>
<P>
   After all, for all the great things the home-run battle of 1998
between Sosa and McGwire provided, for all the good it did for the
game, this was similarly significant and good.
</P>
<P>
   You can marvel at the feats of the burly monsters slamming shots
over the fences. You can love it, like we all did a year ago, and
know that it resuscitated a game left for dead only a few years
back. But give me a pitcher like Martinez, and I still win.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (15-3) was as overwhelming Tuesday as he's been all
season. He is on a pace to win 30 games, a feat that few believe is
attainable in this era of towering home runs, bulked-up hitters,
and field and playing conditions _ low mounds and tempting stadium
dimensions _ that are suited more for hitters than pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But if Martinez challenges the 30-win mark and continues to mow
down batters, he might do as much for the purists of the game as
all those camera-toting new fans that have been clicking turnstiles
since last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how exciting it was for me tonight,''
Martinez said. ``We saw great baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   We saw a great pitcher. It was fitting and fun, particularly at
old Fenway. It was classic.

HUMID HEAT MUGS L.A. VALLEYS WHILE STORMS DRENCH NEARBY DESERTS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tropical weather out of the Gulf of Mexico washed
over Southern California on Tuesday, bringing record rainfall to
the high desert and baking the Los Angeles Basin with a sweltering,
Florida-like heat wave, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual combination of heat and humidity kept tow truck
drivers and air conditioning repairmen scrambling to keep up with
calls for help.
</P>
<P>
   For Jackie Cortes, the afternoon heat proved too much for her
faithful Honda Civic wagon, which fell victim to an overheated
radiator in the hills above the community of Tarzana, in Los
Angeles' San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming up that hill and it being so hot was too much for it,''
said Cortes, 59, who was further stressed because the breakdown
kept her from picking up her 83-year-old mother from outside a bank
in Hollywood. ``This is a bad day for this to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar refrains were echoed throughout the Southern California
area on Tuesday, according to tow truck drivers and mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starters freeze, radiators blow up, belts get hot and start
warping,'' said Scott Giles of H.A.R. Towing &AMP; Transport, who came
to Cortes' aid. ``The Valley's usually hot but the humidity is
killing us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ``misery index'' hit about 120 degrees in the
Woodland Hills community of the San Fernando Valley and other parts
of the Valley. That index measures how much hotter the high
temperature of 102 degrees felt because of the humidity.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Civic Center recorded a high Tuesday of 87
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The desert communities of Lancaster and Palmdale hit respective
highs of 96 degrees and 97 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms also brought record rainfall to both communities.
Lancaster got 0.67 of an inch, more than doubling its previous
record of 0.32 set in 1984. Palmdale also had record-setting rain
with 0.42 of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning in Palmdale may have injured a steamroller operator
who said he felt a jolt and was thrown into the air about 3:30 p.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the Los Angeles Basin escaped the rain, it was bathed in
humidity of over 50 percent on average, compared with 20 percent on
a normal day, said National Weather Service meteorologist Bruce
Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Recent days have seen a reverse of that pattern as moisture
drifted in from the southeast, giving rise to towering afternoon
cumulonimbus or ``thunderhead'' clouds over the San Gabriel
Mountains near Los Angeles that brought disastrous flash floods to
some areas.
</P>
<P>
   In the desert community of Twentynine Palms, about 90 miles east
of Los Angeles, a Marine was killed when his armored vehicle was
swamped in a flash flood during training exercises Monday, the
military and coroner's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms in the San Bernardino Mountains sent high waters
gushing through the mountain community of Forest Falls late
Tuesday, two days after flash flooding carried away homes and
caused one death and five injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Weather Service posted a flash-flood watch throughout the
day Tuesday for mountains and foothills of Los Angeles and Ventura
counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't get the humidity like this,'' said Weather
Service meteorologist Dennis Tuffey. ``We always get the warmer
temperatures off and on this time of year but the humidity makes it
even more uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who service air conditioners, that spelled booming
business.
</P>
<P>
   Some shops, like D.E. Smith Heating and Air Conditioning in the
community of Canoga Park, had to turn away business or refer
callers to competitors who, more often than not, also were booked
solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only squeezing in preferred customers at this time, if I
can do that,'' said operations manager Dave Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Many callers mistakenly thought their air-conditioning units are
malfunctioning because the humidity is causing extra condensation
to spill out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lady said she had a heart problem and was going to blame
me if she had a stroke so I pulled an installer off a job,''
Robinson said. ``The unit was working fine. She just wanted icicles
on her nose and we couldn't do that for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had been referring customers to Canoga Park Heating and
Air Condition, whose president, Bob Wiseman, has been fielding more
than 500 calls on each of the past two days, which compares with 50
on a normal summer day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan for these times, we know it happens each year and we
get ready for it, but it's still hard to keep up with the volume
right now,'' Wiseman said. ``People are just dialing through the
phone book trying to find anyone to come out now and of course its
not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Water to drink and splash in was all that was available to high
school football players doing preseason conditioning drills Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Several coaches said they have taken precautions to make sure
players don't overheat, especially after a 15-year-old Upland High
School player collapsed and died Monday in 100-degree heat while
running wind sprints with his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we felt it was getting too hot we'd call off practice,''
said Chatsworth High football offensive coordinator Ron Martinez.
``If anyone gets fatigued or feels nausea we tell them to get in
the shade and we soak them down.''
</P>
<P>
   At Crespi High School in the community of Encino, coaches hold
varsity football practice at 5:30 p.m. to avoid the midday sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heat can be oppressive and when it's humid it's even more
so,'' said Crespi's athletic director, Richard Fong.

UNDERCURRENT OF SADNESS, ANGER HAUNTED MAN WHO SURVIVED SNOW
ORDEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Outwardly, the last days of George Back's life were
happy, filled with friendship, horses and the comforts of family
life.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in many months, the Kelso, Wash., man talked
hopefully about picking up the pieces of a life shattered last
winter when he and his wife were stranded during a short
snowmobiling trip that turned into a frozen 11-day ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Back survived but lost his feet to frostbite; his wife Diane
McManus, died on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   A fresh start was all Back talked about to the Vancouver, Wash.,
couple caring for him while he recuperated.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday morning, Bonnie Johnson found Back in bed, a plastic
bag wrapped around his head and a bottle of prescription
painkillers overturned nearby.
</P>
<P>
   To Vancouver police, who are handling Back's death as a suicide,
it seems a sad ending to a simple story of grief: ``It looks like
he decided that he didn't want to live without his wife,'' police
Sgt. Dave King said.
</P>
<P>
   Back, a Vietnam War veteran who battled depression all his life,
seemed at once ``happy but burdened'' to Arthur Johnson, a fellow
veteran who with his wife was caring for Back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last conversation I had with George around 10 p.m on
Sunday night, he seemed in pretty good spirits,'' said Johnson, a
licensed caregiver who was helping Back recover in his Vancouver
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was only in our home for five days, but he told me over and
over again how much he enjoyed being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, and his wife, Bonnie, a nurse, were familiar with their
patient's history of depression when he was placed in their home
after his July 8 release from a Department of Veterans Affairs
rehabilitation center in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Back told Portland's Oregonian newspaper that he
suffered from chronic depression and had a history of suicide
attempts even before he and his wife's ordeal in the mountains near
Leavenworth, Chelan County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was dead,'' he told the reporter then, later
wondering why God would take his fun-loving wife while sparing
someone who wanted to die.
</P>
<P>
   However briefly, the Johnsons bore witness to Back's struggles.
But they also saw signs that Back was moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Back and the couple shared laughter, played cards
and wrestled with philosophical questions of life and death. They
visited the Johnsons' horse on a farm outside of town. Later, Back
recalled teaching his wife to play Scrabble, letting her win early
games until she began to beat him on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Back asked to be introduced to a nice lady. Arthur Johnson
invited a friend he thought Back would like to a birthday party
planned for Wednesday evening. Back would have turned 51.
</P>
<P>
   But the undercurrent to the smiles and the plans was the guilt
Back still harbored about his survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very saddened by this. He was a very kind man who had
very many burdens,'' Arthur Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Back's story of survival began on Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, Back and McManus rented a pair of snowmobiles for
their first trip into the backwoods of Wenatchee National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in warm clothes for a two-hour ride along the groomed
trails near the Fish and Wenatchee lakes, the couple carried their
tiny Norfolk terriers, Keeper and Justine, in pouches on their
chests.
</P>
<P>
   Neither McManus nor Back, who had survived Vietnam in the 1960s
when he served as a helicopter crew chief for the Army, carried
provisions for a longer stay on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   When they got lost in hip-deep snow, they slowly lost hope of
being found. Rescue authorities think McManus died on about the
fifth day. Back, who weighed 385-pounds at the time, snuggled into
a pocket of snow with the dogs and survived by eating melted ice.
Rescuers found him 11 days later. The tiny dogs also survived,
emerging hungry, but in good health.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he came to the Johnsons' home, after undergoing
months of treatment for nerve damage caused by the freezing
temperatures and weeks of post-amputation rehabilitation, Back
weighed 245 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Using the dark humor that peppered his jokes, Back called his
transformation ``the George Back weight-loss plan: Spend 11 days
lost in the snow with no food, amputate your feet and you're
halfway there.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with his large frame, Back's dogs are credited with
providing the body heat that helped him survive.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the tiny brown dogs were being cared for by
relatives at Back's home in Kelso.

MARTINEZ CAPS BOSTON SHOWCASE IN AL WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The pregame reception given to Ted Williams last night
was a reminder why he has become the most-beloved player to ever
wear a Boston Red Sox uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings of pitching by Pedro Martinez showed why he's
considered the best pitcher in baseball. The Red Sox ace is
probably the only guy who could have followed Williams last night.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez was worthy of the assignment. His two dominating
innings set the tone for American League pitchers, and they
overpowered the National League, 4-1, in the 70th All-Star Game at
Fenway Park last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pumped up sky high,'' New York Yankees and AL manager
Joe Torre said. ``I'm glad he was on my side tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out five of six batters he faced and was named
most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers relievers Jeff Zimmerman and John Wetteland both
contributed to the American League pitching effort. Zimmerman threw
a shaky but scoreless seventh, and Wetteland worked the ninth to
get the save.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be so many wonderful memories I'm going to
take with me from this All-Star Game,'' Wetteland said. ``They're
going to be on my hard drive for a long time. It will take a couple
of days to sort it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's wild and woolly performance will be among the
memories. He showed the typical rookie jitters by starting off by
throwing seven consecutive balls and walking the first two hitters
he faced. But catcher Brad Ausmus and shortstop Omar Vizquel saved
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful,'' Wetteland said. ``I was down there in the
bullpen on the edge of my seat. On one hand I was saying, `C'mon,
Jeff.' On the other hand, I was saying, `I understand, I
understand.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman walked Brian Jordan on four pitches, but Ausmus threw
him out trying to steal. Jeff Kent drew a walk and, after Alex
Gonzalez popped out, went to third on Jose Offerman's throwing
error off Luis Gonzalez's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel, however, rescued Zimmerman from further trouble by
ranging up the middle to snag Vladimir Guerrero's grounder, then
flipping the ball with his glove to second for the force.
</P>
<P>
   That was the most dazzling defensive play of the night. Most of
the dazzle came from Martinez's right arm as he had the crowd
electrified from the moment he stepped on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited,'' Martinez said. ``Of all the All-Star
games, this was the most exciting I've been to. I didn't know
Boston was going to be so much on top of the All-Star Game. Do
people eat baseball and drink baseball? It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out Barry Larkin, Larry Walker and Sammy Sosa in
the first inning. Mark McGwire went down on three pitches to start
the second as Martinez became the first pitcher in All-Star Game
history to strike out the first four batters of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't take too long for him to get rid of me,'' Walker
said. ``He was throwing the ball very hard and very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams kept Martinez from matching Carl Hubbell's
historic 1934 streak of five consecutive strikeouts with a grounder
to second baseman Roberto Alomar, who fumbled it for an error. But
Martinez came back to strike out Jeff Bagwell, and Williams was cut
down by Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez trying to steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro's the best pitcher in the game,'' Rodriguez said. ``The
first two pitches he threw, I wasn't able to see. After that I got
used to him, and he did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and McGwire, who have been thrilling the world with their
home runs the past few years, had rough nights. They came up with
runners at second and third in the fifth, but Baltimore's Mike
Mussina struck them out to keep the National League from scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see the best of the best, they're going to go right
at you with their best stuff,'' McGwire said. ``That's what
happened. That's why you rarely see a high-scoring game at the
All-Star Game because you're going against the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro batted twice last night and had a run-scoring
single in the fifth. Rodriguez grounded out and struck out.

turned out to be just another piece of an old building.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who came to see what would happen when baseball's best
sluggers took aim at the most famous wall this side of China left
disappointed. The Green Monster turned out to be a paper monster _
a non-factor in the American League's 4-1 victory over the National
League Tuesday night at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Mark McGwire and Co. fly the Green Monster with
ease in Monday's Home Run Derby and again in batting practice prior
to Tuesday's game, there was reason to expect a few fireworks when
it counted.
</P>
<P>
   But who could have imagined that a collection of hitters who
combined for 711 home runs during the first half of the season
wouldn't so much as nick the most famed home-run target in
baseball?
</P>
<P>
   The primary prerequisite for hitting home runs is making
contact, which didn't happen as often as most expected. A
star-studded collection of pitchers _ led by Boston's Pedro
Martinez, the game's Most Valuable Player _ took the Green Monster
out of play and upstaged the best hitters baseball has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The two pitching staffs combined for 22 strikeouts _ a record
for a nine-inning All-Star Game _ and held batters from both teams
to just 13 hits. It was the first homerless All-Star Game since the
1990 contest at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to the hitters, there's not much you can do when
pitchers exhibit the impeccable command that was on display Tuesday
night. Sixty-six percent of the pitches thrown were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge anyone to score a lot of runs if this is the kind
of pitching you have to face every day,'' Reds shortstop Barry
Larkin said. ``I was surprised no one got a ball to yank over that
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the old adage is that good pitching beats good hitting,
and that's what you saw here. I don't care what the atmosphere is,
when the pitching is this good, there's not going to be much
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez opened the game in his typical dominant fashion,
striking out five of the six batters he faced, including the first
four in a row _ an All-Star Game record.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, Larry Walker, Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire each went down
on strikes before Matt Williams finally reached on an error with
one out in the second. But Williams was caught stealing to complete
a double play that began with a strikeout of Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's performance was reminiscent of the 1934 All-Star
Game, when New York Giants lefty Carl Hubbell struck out Babe Ruth,
Lou Gehrig, Jimmy Fox, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin in succession.
Martinez's five strikeouts tied an All-Star record for an AL
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more than I expected,'' Martinez said. ``(Being named
MVP) is right there with the Cy Young Award. I wasn't expecting
this. I just threw good pitches _ fastballs, curveballs and
changeups. I don't have too much else to say.''
</P>
<P>
   His two innings of work said it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now he's the top pitcher in the game, and he will be for
a while,'' Walker said. ``He was dominating. He was throwing all of
his pitches for strikes. I only saw a couple of pitches, so it
didn't take very long for him to get rid of me. He could have told
you what was coming, and you still wouldn't have been able to hit
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the AL first, Kenny Lofton legged out an infield
single, aided by Curt Schilling's delayed coverage of first base.
Lofton stole second and scored a single up the middle by Indians
teammate Jim Thome. Cal Ripken's RBI single gave the AL a 2-0 lead
after one inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny did his normal thing and got on base, and I got lucky
and got a hit,'' Thome said. ``Pedro really kind of dominated and
got everybody lifted up after the first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The NL offense showed its only signs of life in the third inning
after Martinez had surrendered the mound to Yankees righthander
David Cone. Larkin's RBI single made it a one-run game.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Bottenfield, the NL's winningest pitcher with 14 victories
for St. Louis, walked Thome and hit Ripken to open the bottom of
the fourth inning. That helped the AL score two more runs _ one on
a single by Rangers designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro and another
on Roberto Alomar's ground ball to third base.
</P>
<P>
   The AL has won nine of the last 12 All-Star Games, including the
last three in a row. However, the NL still leads the all-time
series 40-29-1.

CENTURY'S GREATS SHARE SPOTLIGHT IN AL ALL-STAR VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ They gathered at the edges of the old diamond, which
sparkled as never before.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest players in baseball history stood on the basepaths
between first and third. The greatest players in today's game lined
up on either baseline. And the greatest hitter who ever lived _
that's how he was introduced to the only home crowd he's ever known
_ was brought into the center, then surrounded in a circle of
affection.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams, the 80-year-old Boston Red Sox Hall of Famer,
threw out the first pitch at Fenway Park before Tuesday night's
All-Star Game, won by the American League, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't it great!'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes of the past, on hand as baseball celebrated its
All-Century Team, joined this year's All-Stars in greeting Williams
at his cart. They exchanged handshakes and hugs with the man whose
No. 9 was painted onto the center field grass, the legend who
tipped his cap to the 34,187 fans _ something he never did for the
last two decades of his playing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see Ted Williams with a tear running down his eye,
it's an emotional time,'' said St. Louis Cardinals first baseman
Mark McGwire, who told Williams that, yes, he does smell the wood
after a hard foul ball. ``What a man. He's loved all over Boston,
and he's loved all over baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   This game will take place at Safeco Field two years from now,
but this scene could happen only in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to a few of them, but what happened with Boston?''
said the Red Sox's Pedro Martinez, who started for the American
League and was named Most Valuable Player. ``What's here? Do the
people eat baseball and drink baseball? It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   For today's generation, there is no player who enthralls New
Englanders more than Martinez. He showed why immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander struck out the first three batters of the game,
which had never been done in the 69 previous All-Star Games.
</P>
<P>
   The first pitcher in 11 years to have 15 wins at the break,
Martinez fanned Barry Larkin, Larry Walker and Sammy Sosa to start
the game, then struck out McGwire leading off the second. After
Matt Williams reached on an error, Martinez struck out Jeff Bagwell
as Williams was erased at second on a stolen base attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Ferguson Jenkins in 1967 had a pitcher struck out five
in an All-Star Game. No AL pitcher has ever struck out more. The
Martinez legend grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro was just that dominating today, throwing hard, spotting
his fastball,'' Larkin said. ``The last pitch he struck me out on
was a changeup with tremendous movement. You could feel the fans
were into it; it was a great situation. I didn't really appreciate
leading off today, but I had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking to see it,'' said Walker, who was humbled
by Martinez and the 87-year-old ballpark, of which he took a chunk
of turf. ``I didn't see the ball when it went by me. He threw a
changeup first pitch, maybe I was waiting for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I felt my fingers or my arms when I was up there
hitting. When I was warming up before the game, I wasn't aware
where I was going. I had no feeling, I was in awe looking at the
sign that said Fenway Park and the big wall in left field.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's opponent from the National League, the Philadelphia
Phillies' Curt Schilling, gave up two runs in the first inning on
singles by Jim Thome and Cal Ripken. Schilling was relieved by the
Arizona Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson, who got Nomar Garciaparra to
fly to center and then stared in at a familiar figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' Ken Griffey Jr., who struck out looking in his
first at-bat, stood in against his former teammate for the first
time. Johnson got ahead, 0-and-1, then missed outside to run the
count to 2-and-1. On the fourth pitch, a fastball down and in,
Griffey bounced to McGwire at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were teammates for 9{ years, so it seemed a little unusual
facing him,'' Johnson said. ``My only time facing him prior to
tonight was probably spring training (batting practice).''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's approach?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing really,'' he said. ``Just throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson needed only nine throws in his 1-2-3 inning, striking
out Manny Ramirez to complete it. A four-time All-Star for Seattle,
he was one of three former Mariners in the game Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel worked his usual magic,
scooping a grounder up the middle and flipping from his glove to
second, forcing out Luis Gonzalez to end the top of the seventh. In
the bottom of the inning, Houston Astros pitcher Mike Hampton
retired the only two batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's memorable home run derby, there were no homers
Tuesday; no ball even dented the Green Monster. There were two
doubles, one by Jeromy Burnitz, who scored the NL's only run in the
third when he came home on a single by Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   The AL's other two runs came on a single by Rafael Palmeiro and
an error by NL third baseman Williams on a grounder by Roberto
Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   The pitchers' duel, which resulted in the third consecutive AL
victory, was a far cry from last year's game in Denver, which
featured 24 runs and 31 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's heroics foretold more strong pitching, but a hitter
still stole the show. The greatest hitter of them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really amazing,'' Martinez said of the reception for
Williams, who watched from a box above left field. ``I expected it,
though. It didn't take me by surprise to see the people out there
just roaring, trying to just step on the field and probably get a
piece of him. I don't think that there will be any other man that's
going to replace that one.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all Martinez could do to even come close.

RODEO WISHES COMING TRUE FOR NEW CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've longed for an evening like this past Sunday, when I could
recline at home on a weekend and watch rodeos in prime-time viewing
slots. I've also had the conviction that more rodeos should offer
weekend get-away packages for tourists. I've also longed for rodeos
featuring the sport's high-profile athletes on a national tour.
</P>
<P>
   As rodeo gallops into the next century, all three wishes are
becoming reality, for three reasons. One, the Professional Rodeo
Cowboys Association hired commissioner Steve Hatchell a year ago.
Two, the continued growth of the Professional Bull Riders Tour. And
last, the renovation of the Mesquite Championship Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   First to Hatchell, the former commissioner of the Big 12
Conference. He has the credentials to take the sport to another
level. The first signs of his leadership skills are beginning to
surface. Sunday night, the first major show of the summer was aired
at 7 p.m. from Reno, Nev. It was Hatchell's first success story and
a far cry from rodeo's previous TV time slots, such as Saturday at
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Greg Potter of Weatherford win Reno's bull-riding
title on the PRCA's one-hour broadcast Sunday, I flipped over to
The Nashville Network for another hour of rodeo, the airing of the
Professional Bull Riders Bud Light Cup Series stop in Tunica,
Miss., and saw Adam Carrillo of Stephenville pace the field.
</P>
<P>
   Prime-time telecasts are the key for rodeo's advancement. And
nobody is more qualified to negotiate the contracts than Hatchell,
who helped sign big-time collegiate football packages for the Big
12.
</P>
<P>
   The PBR tour, meanwhile, has, in only six years, grown to
support a $5.5 million season. It will offer $1.5 million in prize
money for the Oct. 28-31 finals in Las Vegas, which caps a 29-city
tour. The PRCA is also working on implementing a tour for its
marquee competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The PBR's formula for success is simple: high-profile riders
pitted against bulls with storied histories of making men
horizontal. It's men with championship buckles vs. bulls with
Bodacious reputations. In the past two years, I've marveled at
standing-room crowds shoe-horned into venues ranging from the
Washington suburb of Landover, Md., to the Great Barrier Reef
coastal city of Mackay, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Mesquite is also filling its stands. The weekly rodeo, which
began in 1958, offers a superb get-away package for tourists.
Tourists can arrive on the hilltop property at a towering,
moderate-priced hotel. After check-in, one can take the covered
walkway to the adjacent arena and catch a two-hour PRCA rodeo on
Friday and Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Stockyards also offers accommodations and weekly
rodeos.
</P>
<P>
   The mission at both venues is very clear: rope in the tourists
who have little rodeo background. Attending a performance is a
novelty for fans, whether they have Delaware license plates or
Chinese passports.  &LR; tagtop:Brett Hoffman, (817) 390-7163

 &LR; subheds:Doyal on the move Bull rider Royd Doyal has competed twice
at the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. And after finishing in
the money twice last weekend, he's aiming for a third appearance
there.
</P>
<P>
   Doyal rocketed from 28th to 14th place in the PRCA's bull riding
title race after pocketing $7,912 during the weekend. Only the top
15 contestants in each event at season's end will qualify for the
NFR, scheduled Dec. 3-12.
</P>
<P>
   Doyal, who resides in the East Texas town of Pittsburg, topped
the David Bailey Rodeo Company's Copenhagen Grey Cat to a 90-point
victory worth $6,262 at the Hamel Rodeo and Bull Ridin' Bonanza in
Hamel, Minn. Doyal, a 1995-96 NFR qualifier, also got a check at

member of the Ennis Lions Club, the Chamber of Commerce and the
Tabernacle Baptist Church. Walker retired as a firefighter in
Dallas in 1973 and was owner and president of the Bob Walker
Insurance Agency in Ennis.
</P>

PRCA hopes TV dates boost interest in rodeo
In the first of several steps aimed at strengthening the sport's
television exposure, the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association has
added five rodeos to its 1999 ESPN/ESPN2 schedule and has moved its
shows to prime-time positions.
</P>
<P>
   The first additional PRCA event slated for broadcast was the
Reno (Nev.) Rodeo, which aired Sunday. Other rodeos scheduled to
air include Greeley, Colo.; Salinas, Calif.; Colorado Springs,
Colo.; and Caldwell, Idaho. The addition of the five rodeos
represents the PRCA's effort to provide significantly more
programming for an audience that has shown an appetite for more
televised rodeo. In addition, these shows will air during peak
prime-time hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really excited to have the opportunity to present rodeo
in prime-time slots on a consistent basis,'' PRCA commissioner
Steve Hatchell said. ``Fans will be able to follow rodeo more
closely and carefully and with a lot of excitement. We appreciate
the help ESPN has provided and we appreciate the support of our
corporate partners. They've made major commitments to help achieve
these two objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say the PRCA plans to expand its coverage next year,
adding more rodeos to its broadcast schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``More television definitely has a positive financial impact on
rodeo and the PRCA,'' said Troy Ellerman, chairman of the PRCA
board of directors. ``Ideally, the more television exposure we can
get for rodeo, the wider the fan base and interest in rodeo
becomes, which leads to a larger sponsor base and, ultimately, more
money for the cowboy, contract personnel and everyone involved in
the sport.''

AMONG DEFECTS NOT FIXED ON PIPELINE WERE THREE AT BLAST SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ An inspection of the 400-mile Olympic pipeline turned
up more than 250 potential defects three years ago. The company dug
up and repaired at least two problems and earmarked others for
future work, but considered nearly all of the problems too minor to
investigate further.
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems considered by the Olympic Pipe Line Co. to be
inconsequential in 1996 were three defects in the section of oil
products pipe that ruptured June 10 in Bellingham, Wash., resulting
in an explosive fire and three deaths.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 19 ``anomalies'' were discovered in the 37.4-mile
segment of the line between Ferndale and Allen in northwestern
Washington that has been closed since the blast.
</P>
<P>
   According to an internal company document dated Dec. 12, 1996,
the inspection turned up dents, buckles and thinning of pipe walls.
</P>
<P>
   Potential problems occurred next to rivers, in rural land and in
the populated suburbs east of Lake Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic would say little Tuesday about the 1996 inspection.
Company spokeswoman Maggie Brown noted that the National
Transportation Safety Board is investigating a number of possible
factors that may have caused the June 10 accident, including
anomalies in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of respect for that investigation, Olympic is not going to
comment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she noted that the company is cooperating with the
investigation, and is working with Bellingham on proposals to
replace and restart the pipeline. Olympic is also working to comply
with safety requirements that federal regulators slapped on it
after the deadly accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olympic has operated an extremely safe pipeline for 34
years,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The company documents were obtained by opponents of Olympic's
proposed pipeline across the Cascades. Late last month, the company
withdrew its cross-Cascades proposal. Seattle attorney David
Bricklin, who represented some of the opponents, allowed the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer to review company inspection documents.
</P>
<P>
   The potential problems were found by devices known as ``smart
pigs.'' Smart pigs, which were developed in the 1960s, are commonly
used throughout the industry. In fact, federal regulators require
new or replaced pipelines to be big enough to accommodate smart
pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The cylinder-shaped smart pigs are instrument-carrying modules,
traveling through a pipeline in front of a flow of liquid. Their
articulated connections allow them to move around bends in pipe.
</P>
<P>
   The pigs create a magnetic field as they move through a pipe.
Corrosion, dents and other imperfections cause disturbances in the
magnetic field and are recorded.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, pipe where potential problems were identified was
coated with a substance to ward off corrosion but was not replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The company used standards of a national engineering society to
decide whether a defect warranted attention. The standards of the
American Society of Mechanic Engineers specify how serious a dent
or gouge should be for pipe to be repaired or replaced. It depends
not only on the size of the dent but also on where it occurs on a
pipe _ on a weld or seam such a defect is more serious _ or on what
type of pipe.
</P>
<P>
   In at least two cases, the company repaired sections of the
pipeline even though the damage was slightly less than the
standards set for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   South of the Skagit County town of Allen, a section of pipe was
dug up and replaced in the fall of 1996 after a buckle of less than
1.5 inches was found on the bottom of the pipe.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 miles south of there a dent less than 1 inch deep
but 3.5 inches wide and 5.5 inches long was found in a section that
had settled on a rock. Crews used a jackhammer on the rock, then
welded a sleeve on the pipe.
</P>
<P>
   But the document also noted that repairs on other sections would
have to wait for better weather, including potential problems east
of Everett and near the Snohomish River and two sloughs.
</P>
<P>
   A dented piece of pipe with a buckle 25 inches long in Bellevue
was scheduled to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Four defects were found within 400 feet of each other near Coal
Creek Park in the Newport Hills section of the Eastside. Nearby, a
fifth potential problem was found in the pipeline as it crossed a
back yard.
</P>
<P>
   It could not be determined Tuesday whether those lines were dug
up and repaired as planned.

All-Century Team, joined this year's All-Stars in greeting Williams
at his cart. They exchanged handshakes and hugs with the man whose
No. 9 was painted onto the center field grass, the legend who
tipped his cap to the 34,187 fans _ something he never did for the
last two decades of his playing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see Ted Williams with a tear running down his eye,
it's an emotional time,'' said St. Louis Cardinals first baseman
Mark McGwire, who told Williams that, yes, he does smell the wood
after a hard foul ball. ``What a man. He's loved all over Boston,
and he's loved all over baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   This game will take place at Safeco Field two years from now,
but this scene could happen only in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to a few of them, but what happened with Boston?''
said the Red Sox's Pedro Martinez, who started for the American
League and was named Most Valuable Player. ``What's here? Do the
people eat baseball and drink baseball? It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   For today's generation, there is no player who enthralls New
Englanders more than Martinez. He showed why immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander struck out the first three batters of the game,
which had never been done in the 69 previous All-Star Games.
</P>
<P>
   The first pitcher in 11 years to have 15 wins at the break,
Martinez fanned Barry Larkin, Larry Walker and Sammy Sosa to start
the game, then struck out McGwire leading off the second. After
Matt Williams reached on an error, Martinez struck out Jeff Bagwell
as Williams was erased at second on a stolen base attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Ferguson Jenkins in 1967 had a pitcher struck out five
in an All-Star Game. No AL pitcher has ever struck out more. The
Martinez legend grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro was just that dominating today, throwing hard, spotting
his fastball,'' Larkin said. ``The last pitch he struck me out on
was a changeup with tremendous movement. You could feel the fans
were into it; it was a great situation. I didn't really appreciate
leading off today, but I had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking to see it,'' said Walker, who was humbled
by Martinez and the 87-year-old ballpark, of which he took a chunk
of turf. ``I didn't see the ball when it went by me. He threw a
changeup first pitch, maybe I was waiting for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I felt my fingers or my arms when I was up there
hitting. When I was warming up before the game, I wasn't aware
where I was going. I had no feeling, I was in awe looking at the
sign that said Fenway Park and the big wall in left field.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's opponent from the National League, the Philadelphia
Phillies' Curt Schilling, gave up two runs in the first inning on
singles by Jim Thome and Cal Ripken. Schilling was relieved by the
Arizona Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson, who got Nomar Garciaparra to
fly to center and then stared in at a familiar figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' Ken Griffey Jr., who struck out looking in his
first at-bat, stood in against his former teammate for the first
time. Johnson got ahead, 0-and-1, then missed outside to run the
count to 2-and-1. On the fourth pitch, a fastball down and in,
Griffey bounced to McGwire at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were teammates for 9{ years, so it seemed a little unusual
facing him,'' Johnson said. ``My only time facing him prior to
tonight was probably spring training (batting practice).''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's approach?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing really,'' he said. ``Just throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson needed only nine throws in his 1-2-3 inning, striking
out Manny Ramirez to complete it. A four-time All-Star for Seattle,
he was one of three former Mariners in the game Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel worked his usual magic,
scooping a grounder up the middle and flipping from his glove to
second, forcing out Luis Gonzalez to end the top of the seventh. In
the bottom of the inning, Houston Astros pitcher Mike Hampton
retired the only two batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's memorable home run derby, there were no homers
Tuesday; no ball even dented the Green Monster. There were two
doubles, one by Jeromy Burnitz, who scored the NL's only run in the
third when he came home on a single by Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   The AL's other two runs came on a single by Rafael Palmeiro and
an error by NL third baseman Williams on a grounder by Roberto
Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   The pitchers' duel, which resulted in the third consecutive AL
victory, was a far cry from last year's game in Denver, which
featured 24 runs and 31 hits. The two teams struck out 22 times
Tuesday, an All-Star record for a nine-inning game.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's heroics foretold more strong pitching, but a hitter
still stole the show. The greatest hitter of them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really amazing,'' Martinez said of the reception for
Williams, who watched from a box above his old left field. ``I
expected it, though. It didn't take me by surprise to see the
people out there just roaring, trying to just step on the field and
probably get a piece of him. I don't think that there will be any
other man that's going to replace that one.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all Martinez could do to even come close.

STUDY SHOWS LOS ANGELES TRAILS ONLY THE SILICON VALLEY ON LIST OF
HIGH-TECH REGIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The entertainment industry helped make the Los Angeles
metropolitan area the nation's second-largest high-tech region last
year, trailing only the Silicon Valley, a study released Tuesday
showed.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the nonprofit Milken Institute said the Los
Angeles-Long Beach metro area accounted for 5.11 percent, or better
than $1 of every $20, of the nation's output in the high-tech
sector.
</P>
<P>
   The first-ever study asserted that Los Angeles' high ranking
resulted from growth in multimedia entertainment, including
special-effects companies serving the film industry, television,
video games and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles also ranked an impressive third among so-called
``Tech-Poles,'' the institute's name for areas with high
concentrations of and output from high-tech industries such as
computer services, drug manufacturing, motion picture production
and aerospace. Northern California's San Jose metro area, which
includes the Silicon Valley, also earned first place in that
category while Dallas ranked as the second-largest Tech-Pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really positive news, because we were really
lagging behind five or six years ago,'' Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan said of the study results. ``We've really come a long way
since then.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-area numbers are somewhat inflated because not
all motion picture production and services use advanced technology,
according to Ross DeVol, the institute's director of regional and
demographic studies and primary author of the report. But he noted
that the numbers boded well for the area's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the decline in aerospace work, he said, ``It's
remarkable how much high-tech activity remains in the Los Angeles
area.''
</P>
<P>
   A large part of that continued success, DeVol said, is the
proximity of top-flight universities and research institutions and
a pool of talented workers in high-tech service areas such as
computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   Motion picture production and services were included in the
rankings to reflect emerging technologies such as computer
animation and digital-audio sound effects. But even without the
motion picture segment _ which the report estimated at about 4
percent of the area's total economy _ Los Angeles-Long Beach would
rank seventh in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In its 123 pages of rankings, charts and economic analysis, the
Milken Institute study _ titled ``America's High-Tech Economy:
Growth, Development, and Risks for Metropolitan Areas'' _ argued
that high-tech industries have spearheaded the economic growth of
both the United States and its metro areas.
</P>
<P>
   The study claims that annual growth in high-tech products and
services averaged 20percent over the past three years, ``directly
elevating'' the overall U.S. Gross Domestic Product by 1.5percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The report also listed ways that government investment
contributes to, and can further support, the industry. Key areas
include lifelong learning programs, tax incentives, minimizing
regulations and the role of research institutions and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The information is particularly important to city governments,
DeVol said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't address these critical factors, their residents
risk being left behind in the new economy,'' DeVol said.``Their
standard of living is going to be directly related to how well they
do in these high-tech industries.''
</P>
<P>
   But the institute's report said the rising importance of the
high-tech industry will bring risks as well as benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the report simulated the effects of a ``1990-91 style
recession,'' concluding that ``high-tech manufacturing industries
would experience a substantially more severe decline than the
overall economy and could even exacerbate the overall decline in
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the high-tech industry, particularly the
computer and office-equipment segment, is reacting more in line
with changes in the overall business cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed that any embrace of the high-tech industry
should be a cautious one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants what the Silicon Valley has,'' said Tom
Lieser, executive director of the Anderson Forecast at the
University of California, Los Angeles. ``The question is, as the
industry becomes more mature and more cyclical, it poses a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing social tension is another risk.
</P>
<P>
   Besides an influx of immigrants and a dramatic economic shift,
the high-tech industry can contribute to income disparities and
tension, DeVol said, adding that the government needs to play a
problem-solving role in that area.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's leading metropolitan areas for technology output,
according to a Milken Institute study released Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   1. San Jose
</P>
<P>
   2. Los Angeles-Long Beach
</P>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Pedro Martinez, still miffed because he didn't start
last year's All-Star Game, dazzled the vaunted National League
hitters on Tuesday night and made All-Star history doing it. The
talented Boston Red Sox pitcher became the first pitcher to strike
out the first four batters in an All-Star Game and wound up
striking out five of the six batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   For his efforts, Martinez was named the most valuable player in
the American League's 4-1 victory, its third straight and ninth in
the last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably more than I expected,'' Martinez said after
the game, ``and a lot of whipped cream and sweets in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the string of strikeouts were Sammy Sosa and Mark
McGwire, batting in the same lineup for the first time since they
electrified America last season with their scintillating race to
the home run record. Sosa struck out for the third out in the first
inning, and McGwire struck out for the first out in the second
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was putting everyone away with fastballs,'' said Larry
Walker, one of Martinez's victims, ``but he probably could have
told you what was coming and still got you.''
</P>
<P>
   For the fans at Fenway Park, who were treated to a poignant
reminder of past Red Sox glory when the Hall of Famer Ted Williams
threw out the ceremonial first pitch, Martinez's performance was
nothing new. He leads the league in strikeouts with 184 (84 more
than the next pitcher, David Wells, has), in victories with 15 and
in earned run average with 2.10. If he were to maintain his lead in
all three, Martinez, whose 28th birthday is on July 25, would win
the pitching version of the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre of the New York Yankees, the winning manager for the
second time in three years, said for batters facing Martinez:
``It's like hitting in a dark room. With the fans cheering for him,
he was pumped up sky high.'' Bruce Bochy of San Diego, the N.L.
manager, called Martinez ``the best pitcher in the game right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance Martinez staged recalled the record strikeout
string Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants reeled off in 1934 in
the second All-Star Game. Hubbell, the first pitcher to start an
All-Star Game in his home park, the Polo Grounds, allowed the first
two American League batters to reach base, then struck out Babe
Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx. In the second inning, Hubbell
kept the streak going by striking out Al Simmons and Joe Cronin.
Bill Dickey ended it with a single to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, the latest pitcher to start in his home park, Fenway,
and the first since 1982, struck out Barry Larkin of Cincinnati,
Walker of Colorado and Sosa of Chicago in the first. Larkin went
down on a feeble swing, Walker took a third strike and Sosa swung
mightily and missed for his third strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw Sammy a couple of breaking balls,'' Martinez said. ``I
saw his reaction. He didn't react well to the breaking ball. I
threw one, then a second one.'' But he struck him out with a
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this the first time a pitcher had struck out the
first three batters in a game, but it was also the first time since
the 1984 game that a pitcher had struck out all three batters in
any inning. Fernando Valenzuela struck out Dave Winfield, Reggie
Jackson and George Brett that year.
</P>
<P>
   As Martinez went to the dugout after the first inning, the
highly partisan crowd of 34,187 chanted, ``Pedro, Pedro, Pedro,
Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   When the National League team went to bat in the second inning,
nothing much changed. McGwire, who 24 hours earlier had crushed 13
home runs in 23 swings in the first round of the home run contest,
led off and struck out swinging. Matt Williams of Arizona then
spoiled the string, hitting a grounder to second that Roberto
Alomar of Cleveland bobbled for an error and the N.L.'s first base
runner.
</P>
<P>
   But the right-handed Martinez reverted to form, striking out
Jeff Bagwell of Houston, the designated hitter, as Williams tried
unsuccessfully to steal second base. Ivan Rodriguez of Texas threw
him out for an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the game of his former Montreal teammate, Walker
said, ``I wouldn't be surprised to see him go three up and three
down and three up and three down in the first two innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez virtually pitched to Walker's prediction, dispatching
the National League in the first two innings with 28 swift pitches,
19 of them strikes. ``What you saw is Pedro,'' said his teammate,
Nomar Garciaparra. ``That's what we see all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just be thankful you don't have to face him,'' McGwire shot
back, sitting next to Garciaparra in the interview room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would challenge anybody to score runs off that pitching
staff,'' Larkin said. ``I was surprised nobody got a ball to yank
over the left-field wall. In b.p., everybody did it. Good pitching
beats good hitting. That's what it came down to tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez set the tone for the game, which saw a nine-inning
record 22 strikeouts for both teams. Curt Schilling of
Philadelphia, the N.L. starter, and David Cone of the Yankees each
struck out three batters. Mike Mussina of Baltimore struck out two,
Sosa and McGwire, with runners at second and third in the fifth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina's effort preserved the American's 4-1 lead that it
gained with a pair of runs in the first inning against Schilling
and another pair in the fourth against Kent Bottenfield of St.
Louis, the surprise league leader with 14 victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland contingent of four starters contributed heavily to
the A.L. victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Lofton, the Indians' leadoff hitter, began the first
inning by hitting a grounder wide of first to McGwire and beating
Schilling to the base for a hit. Two outs later, Lofton stole
second and remained there as Manny Ramirez, his teammate, walked.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome, the third member of the Indians in the lineup, then
lined a single to center, driving in Lofton, and Cal Ripken of
Baltimore, an All-Star for the 17th time, singled to right, sending
Ramirez home.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Bottenfield walked Thome and hit Ripken with a
pitch, putting himself in instant trouble. Rafael Palmeiro of Texas
singled Thome across and, after Rodriguez struck out, Alomar,
Cleveland starter No. 4, rapped a grounder that Williams couldn't
handle at third base and Ripken scored.
</P>
<P>
   The N.L. scored its lone run just after Martinez left the game.
Cone struck out two of the first three batters he faced in the
third inning, but the one in between, Jeromy Burnitz of Milwaukee,
rapped a double along the right-field line. The batter after the
second strikeout, Larkin, singled him home. The N.L. loaded the
bases against Cone in the fourth on a walk to McGwire and two-out
singles by Bagwell and Mike Piazza of the Mets, but Cone induced
Burnitz to ground to first for the third out.  &QL;

<P>
   Just 1.6 percent of visits to online merchants result in a
purchase, according to a study by the Boston Consulting Group for
Shop.org, an industry organization for Web retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Why? After security and privacy concerns, consumers cite the
need to reenter personal data at different merchants as one of the
main drawbacks of shopping online, says David Pecaut, head of the
E-commerce practice at Boston Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wallet,'' he says, ``has the potential to make things much
simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   What's a virtual wallet? Simply a standardized form into which
you enter your name, address, and credit-card number. Every time
you make a purchase online, the affiliated merchant gets access to
your billing and mailing data from the wallet.
</P>
<P>
   A boon for cyber-shoppers? It promises to be, but it isn't yet.
</P>
<P>
   The assortment of wallets is likely to confuse even hard-core
techies. Expect to encounter pitches for virtual wallets from
online stores, Web portal sites like Yahoo and Excite, and banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a chaotic period,'' says Denis Yaro, executive
vice-president of CyberCash, an electronic-commerce company in
Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The CyberCash solution, InstaBuy, lets you sign up for a wallet
at a participating merchant and use it to shop at other InstaBuy
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Through partnerships with SkyMall and the Impulse Buy Network,
InstaBuy customers have access to more than 150 stores, including
such high-end retailers as Calyx &AMP; Corolla and Sharper Image.
</P>
<P>
   InstaBuy is a ``server-based'' solution: It stores your personal
data on a remote computer. Obviously aware of consumers' concerns
about hackers, CyberCash is teaming up with financial institutions,
such as First USA, to secure shoppers' financial information.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has a wallet of its own, enabling consumers to
shop at affiliated merchants without reentering personal data.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's Quick Checkout lets members store information for up to 10
credit cards and 50 shipping addresses; the data is kept on AOL's
servers. For security reasons, the full credit-card number is never
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another option is eWallet, a software application that can
be downloaded (at www.ewallet.com). EWallet stores your personal
data on your computer, which may be more secure, but this also
requires you to install and maintain the software yourself.
</P>
<P>
   EWallet works at nearly all Web stores; when you're ready to
make a purchase, eWallet helps you with the forms. During the
holiday season, about 250,000 copies of eWallet were downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   For all the uncertainty over the eventual standard-bearer, one
thing is certain: Not all of these wallets will be in use a year
from now.
</P>
<P>
   In the standard-less interim, choose a wallet with care. Don't
try them all, or you may find yourself with multiple accounts at
some merchants. Consider the stores connected with the wallet; for
now, selection is probably the deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a regular at just one or two online shops, don't
bother with a wallet. As with much that involves consumer
technology, you won't miss a lot by waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, one or more of these systems will achieve that magic
combo of convenience and ubiquity. Until then, America Online and
the portal sites have an edge, largely because they have the
attention of millions of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate winner will let you buy from any store on the Web,
or close to it, without downloading software to your PC. By then,
the wallet will help you find the best prices for your items of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The wallet may even suggest, based on your past purchases, what
wines or books you might like to buy. Sort of scary, but
convenient, too. ``Chaos doesn't reign very long,'' says Yaro. ``It
won't be tolerated.'' &QL;

<P>
   Sought after though they have become, employment contracts are
fraught with pitfalls for executives.
</P>
<P>
   Their status as status symbol is, of itself, a danger. Managers
often are so flattered to have one they don't realize what they've
signed away to get it.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, even the most seemingly innocuous provisions _ such
as the basic job description _ can have unexpected consequences.
Boss to employee: ``It says here you agreed to work anywhere in the
U.S. I'm sure you'll just love your new assignment in Hammond,
Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way: Your employer undoubtedly has negotiated a
lot more of these deals than you ever will (or at least let's hope
that's the case). So who's more likely to gain the upper hand?
</P>
<P>
   To help even the odds, here's a provision-by-provision guide to
the modern employment contract, along with some pointers.
</P>
<P>
   1. TERM: This section defines the length of the contract _ one
year, two years, etc. Its inclusion is more than a formality. In
most states, employers can fire an employee for any reason at any
time and without further compensation (unless civil-rights or
discrimination laws apply).
</P>
<P>
   However, if your contract specifies the term of employment,
you're entitled to receive the balance due if you're canned without
cause (as defined in Section 5 of this article).
</P>
<P>
   2. DUTIES: Many employment contracts are far too vague or
sketchy when it comes to defining the job itself. There's nothing
wrong with flexibility, of course _ so long as everyone's happy.
But if the relationship sours, latitude makes it possible for an
employer to dream up loathsome or even humiliating work assignments
_ perhaps in a deliberate effort to persuade the employee to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, you and your employer can always agree to make changes
in a contract. So if your pride can't stand emptying the trash or
having your desk moved to the stairwell, make sure your contract
says something about what you'll be doing and where you will be
doing it. (One client of mine got a clause that allowed him to work
one month each year in Vail, Colo.).
</P>
<P>
   Get as specific a description of your duties and
responsibilities as you can. If that's not possible, at least make
sure this section of your contract says that your duties will be
restricted to those that are ``reasonable and customary'' for the
position you hold.
</P>
<P>
   3. COMPENSATION: The rule here: If it ain't written down, it
ain't going to end up in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that can be remotely considered compensation _ from
vacation days and perks to salary and stock options _ should be
detailed in this section. (This is where you can ask for a rabbi
trust or a paid-for vacation home in the Hamptons, as clients of
mine have done.)
</P>
<P>
   Unless you don't expect a raise during the time period covered
by the agreement, this section should also spell out the procedure
for determining pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   4. EXCLUSIVE EMPLOYMENT: Many companies today offer employment
contracts precisely because they want their charges to sign a
document that restricts their ability to jump ship _ or take
proprietary information with them when they do.
</P>
<P>
   The covenants contained in this section are where employers seek
to obtain this protection. In other words: Watch your flanks. Your
objective should be to give yourself as much career flexibility as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Employers like to push for extreme limits on whom you can work
for and when. In a sense, they'd just as soon have you drop off the
face of the earth if you're not going to be toiling for them.
</P>
<P>
   In examining the validity of the exclusions contained in this
section, courts weigh the employer's legitimate business interests
against the ability of an employee to earn a livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a court might agree to bar the employee of a
children's TV program on cable television from working for another
show with a similar audience. But the court might let the employee
work for a cable-TV show about monster trucks. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While there's no requirement for employers to offer employees
compensation for these covenants, such payments have sometimes
helped courts overcome their problems with employee livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you can't eliminate or soften restrictions on
where you can earn a living, try to shorten the period and/or get
compensation for them.
</P>
<P>
   You can also work to subtly undermine exclusions you can't
negotiate away through your choice of the law governing the
agreement (see Section 7. Governing Law. Jurisdiction).
</P>
<P>
   Companies understandably try to keep all internal information
confidential. Nevertheless, courts have ruled that there are limits
to confidentiality. Client lists, for instance, are protected only
if the information can't be obtained elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, publicly known or previously published contracts,
pricing policies, and buying habits aren't protected. That doesn't
mean the provisions don't have some teeth: Courts have held
employees liable for the disclosure of confidential information
whether or not the disclosure was willful. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. REASONS FOR TERMINATION: A paragraph should be added that
provides for a ``cure period'' during which, after a warning, you
are given a chance to address your employer's complaints about your
work. This should apply to performance issues _ a failure to
produce promised results _ instead of, say, a conviction for
insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   If your employer balks at such language, explain that the firm
will benefit by having its potential exposure to litigation
limited.
</P>
<P>
   An additional reason for termination is ``change of control or
ownership.'' This should be specifically listed here so that it can
be discussed in the subsequent section.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, wording should be included that calls or ample notice
(such as six months) if your contract isn't going to be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   6. RESULTS OF TERMINATION: Ask for full payment of your
contracted salary if you're terminated without cause or if your
employer breaches the agreement. But be prepared to cut a deal. By
expanding the reasons for termination in the previous section, you
can include language here outlining your severance rights after a
change in management or ownership.
</P>
<P>
   7. GOVERNING LAW. JURISDICTION: This may seem like neutral
boilerplate. It's not. The common-law obligations of employers and
employees vary from state to state. So, too, does the way local
courts interpret and enforce the covenants outlined in Section 4.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of governing law and jurisdiction in the agreement
will ultimately determine what elements of Section 4 can be
enforced and how strenuously they will be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Use the state law most beneficial to you. If, for example, you
work in the California office of a corporation headquartered in
Alabama, your employer will want Alabama law to govern the
contract, since it's considered employer-friendly. But California
law is employee-friendly. &QL;

HOUSE GOP PROPOSES HUGE TAX CUT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ House Republicans rolled out the biggest tax
cut since Ronald Reagan's first term as president Tuesday,
proposing to slash income tax rates by 10 percent across the board
and reduce or eliminate a host of other taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year, $864 billion tax cut goes even further than a $792
billion Senate version introduced last week, and together they will
frame the battle with the White House over tax and spending policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of liberty is the history of restraint on
government power,'' Rep. Bill Archer, a Texas Republican and the
plan's architect, declared at a morning news conference, surrounded
by a clutch of taxpayers from nearby Virginia. ``The more people
are taxed, the more power comes to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are talking about today is the defining difference
between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats believe the government
can spend money more efficiently and more wisely than the people
can spend their own money. We believe people can spend their money
more wisely than politicians or bureaucrats in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has registered his objections to both the
House and Senate versions, demanding that the projected $1 trillion
surplus over the next 10 years be used to beef up Medicare,
defense, education and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Miami, Clinton revived his charge that GOP tax
cuts would harm Medicare. ``That will not happen on my watch,''
Clinton pledged to a cheering union crowd. ``So I ask again the
Republican leaders in Congress, for the sake of saving Medicare and
strengthening our future, to reduce the size of your tax cut and
join us in putting first things first.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer insisted that the projected surplus is large enough to
accommodate as much as $600 billion more for Medicare and a big tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, Archer's tax cut would be the largest since 1981,
when a newly elected President Reagan pushed through a sweeping
across-the-board cut in income tax rates and opened the
conservative drive to shrink government.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes substantial tax breaks for business,
slashing the corporate capital gains tax rate from 35 percent to 25
percent and eliminating the alternative minimum tax. It also
targets cuts for the farm, oil, timber and steel industries.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans took a less confrontational approach Friday
with a proposal that hopes to court Democratic support by tilting
the tax cuts toward the lowest income bracket and omitting cuts in
capital gains or inheritance taxes, both of which are key elements
of Archer's proposal and long-standing Republican targets.
</P>
<P>
   Archer dismissed Democratic charges that his plan is little more
than a partisan ploy to invite a Clinton veto and give Republicans
a platform to distinguish themselves from what Archer calls
``tax-and-spend'' Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has changed course before,'' Archer said. ``We
are going to pursue what's right and hope the president will
eventually see the light and sign this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has shown little sign yet of acquiescing,
dispatching officials this week to attack the GOP tax cuts as
``potentially explosive'' and a ``shell game.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise appearance of huge projected budget surpluses has
renewed the decades-old ideological fight between Democrats and
Republicans over taxes and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have agreed to set aside all surplus revenues from
Social Security _ estimated at $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years
_ to pay down the debt and presumably prevent Congress from dipping
into payroll taxes to fund other spending.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle is over the remaining $1 trillion in projected
non-Social Security surpluses over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats want to spend most of the money on defense, education,
Medicare and the environment. Republicans call the surplus an
``overpayment'' by taxpayers and insist it should be returned.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said that Clinton would be willing to devote
$250 billion of the surplus on the administration's proposal for
USA savings accounts, which would give tax breaks and matching
government contributions to low-income savers.
</P>
<P>
   Archer insisted that his plan would still leave some $600
billion for either higher Medicare spending or debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said paying down the national debt would be a good
alternative, but he insisted that the surplus will never
materialize if politicians get their hands on it. ``If we leave
that money in Washington, it won't be there to pay down the debt,''
Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Archer also said that his tax cut was better than the Senate GOP
plan, which would reduce only the bottom 15 percent tax rate to 14
percent. Archer would cut rates equally for all income brackets,
and he does not shy away from controversial cuts in the capital
gains and inheritance taxes that Democrats have repeatedly attacked
as aiding ``the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer was unapologetic. ``This gives back equally to those who
are paying more income taxes who make this surplus possible,''
Archer said. ``It's across-the-board to everybody ... and we
shouldn't be taking the money in the first place, because we don't
need it other than to expand government.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting and even eliminating the inheritance tax has surprising
support among some Democrats who traditionally oppose tax cuts,
including Contra Costa's Ellen Tauscher and San Jose's Zoe Lofgren.
</P>
<P>
   The tax falls especially heavily on small business owners and
farmers _ not to mention newly wealthy investors who have seen
their stock and real estate holdings swell in value _ who complain
that the tax forces their families to liquidate their farms and
businesses to pay the tax.
</P>
<P>
   There is also some agreement between the parties on tax breaks
for health insurance premiums for those not covered by employers,
as well as tax breaks for long-term care insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hard-line stance adopted by each side, there are
signs that a White House-GOP compromise could be possible, despite
steadfast opposition from House Democrats. Republicans tentatively
agreed with Clinton on Monday to provide some kind of drug coverage
in Medicare, widely seen as a White House quid pro quo for at least
some tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over how to spend the surplus comes amid warnings from
budget analysts that its existence is largely contingent on both
parties hewing to the 1997 budget pact that put increasingly tight
caps on domestic discretionary spending. Those caps were
``backloaded,'' requiring each future Congress to make more
stringent cuts.
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread acknowledgment among both parties that there
are simply not enough votes among either party to pass this year's
spending bills under those caps, much less in following years.
Moreover, because both parties have agreed to big increases in
defense and transportation spending, the cuts must now fall heavily
on all other domestic nonentitlement programs.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus projections also assume that Congress will refrain
from multibillion-dollar ``emergency spending'' bills that have
become routine.

CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS TO BE REQUIRED TO TELL PATIENTS ABOUT PAIN 
 RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Advocates for better pain control for patients
in California have enlisted a powerful new ally: the folks who
write the checks for federal health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Under a newly adopted policy, the federal Health Care Financing
Administration, which administers the Medicare program, plans to
require hospitals and other health care providers to start formally
advising patients about their pain-relief options.
</P>
<P>
   The policy was outlined in a June 25 letter from agency
Administrator Nancy-Ann Min DeParle to Kathryn Tucker, director of
legal affairs for Compassion in Dying, an Oregon-based group active
in that state's battle over physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the group has been pushing regulators to take
stronger measures to improve access to narcotics and other pain
medications often denied to people with terminal disease.
</P>
<P>
   California's Patient Self-Determination Act already gives
patients the right to make their own decisions about their medical
care. Providers are responsible for giving people access to
information needed for informed consent.
</P>
<P>
   The law does not specifically cover pain treatment, a
controversial area of medicine because many of the drugs are prone
to misuse and can be addictive. Physicians have sometimes lost
their licenses or faced criminal prosecution for overprescribing
pain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the June 25 Health Care Financing Administration
pronouncement, pain medication is considered ``part of the
mitigation and treatment of disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, this means that ``patients must be informed of
their rights under state law to request or reject specific pain
medication,'' DeParle wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Financing Administration has authority to
enforce that reading of the law through periodic audits and
financial penalties. Managers in the agency's San Francisco office
have been directed to take the necessary steps to ensure
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Pain-control advocates, who held a news conference at San
Francisco General Hospital Tuesday to trumpet the Health Care
Financing Administration pronouncement, conceded that little will
change right away.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the agency gets the word out, they said, the result
could be little more tangible than a slightly reworded hospital
brochure or some new fine print among the many documents patients
must sign when checking into a health care facility.
</P>
<P>
   But the financing administration's decision could help to
generate more demands on providers if patients and their families
begin to realize that pain can nearly always be relieved through
proper treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients will have to be informed of their rights,'' said Dr.
Robert Brody, head of pain consultation at San Francisco General,
predicting ``an entirely different dynamic'' in the doctor-patient
relationship.

 IT'S NOT THE HEAT, IT'S THE STUPIDITY   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Spare the air? How about share the air?
</P>
<P>
   With all this smog hanging over the city, most of it brought up
from L.A. in tourists' suitcases, there's a limited supply of good
stuff to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   So why are the joggers, in-line skaters and other exercise
freaks allowed to hog more than their fair share of the air? What
is the Board of Supervisors doing about this gentrification of our
oxygen?
</P>
<P>
   At every health club in the city, hipless hipsters on fleets of
climbing, rowing and biking machines are sucking in tons of good
air and huffing out clouds of used air laden with burned-off
fat-calorie molecules.
</P>
<P>
   When people lose weight, it has to go somewhere, right?
</P>
<P>
   For all we know, those airborne fat particles expelled by the
zealously healthy might be communicable, like flying flu germs.
</P>
<P>
   THE HEAT causes us to do strange things, to become unclear on
the concept.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fourth of July parade in Piedmont, noted Allen Matthews,
the Daughters of the American Revolution rode proudly in a
Rolls-Royce. At least they weren't sipping English breakfast tea.
</P>
<P>
   And the mercury hits 102 in Marin, so John Martini and his wife
head for Guaymas, a nice restaurant on the water in Tiburon. They
get a table outside, kissed by a slight Bay breeze. Then the
busboys come around and fire up the large propane space heaters.
</P>
<P>
   The hostess explains that some diners are complaining about the
chilly breeze. Tourists from Saudi Arabia, guesses Martini, who is
no longer a dry Martini and who takes his business down the street
to the deck at Sam's Anchor Cafe, where the climate is manipulated
by Mom Nature.
</P>
<P>
   THE NAACP is protesting the absence of black actors on new TV
programs. Of the 26 new comedy and drama shows on the four major
networks, there are approximately zero blacks or other minorities
in lead or support roles.
</P>
<P>
   You really can't blame the networks. The problem is finding
qualified black actors for the type of roles available. Very few
black actors are hip, 27-year-old white people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I can see where the NAACP would be unhappy over rumors
that the networks plan to bring back ``The Jeffersons,'' ``The Bill
Cosby Show'' and ``Soul Train'' with all-white casts.
</P>
<P>
   If it's diversity you're looking for, there's always ``Sesame
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   IT'S SEMI-CRAZY downtown this week due to the invasion of the
semiconductor conventioneers. What are these people called?
Chippies?
</P>
<P>
   They're spending big, threatening to wipe out the city's stock
of lobster. Wherever the chippies go, they maintain virtual contact
with reality via the Holy Trinity _ a cell phone, a pager and a
laptop. Some accessorize with a Palm Pilot and a Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped in at John's Grill for lunch and asked to be seated in
non-faxing.
</P>
<P>
   AND SPEAKING of John's, owner John Konstin is on the verge of
stealing one of New York's young superstar chefs and creating a
French-flavored dining experience in the old Scott's Seafood on
Lombard in the Marina.
</P>
<P>
   A ``dining experience'' is similar to a ``restaurant,'' only
more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   TEMPEST STORM, who must be pushing 70, is at the Mitchell
Brothers O'Farrell Theater this week. She's still a classy and
dynamite performer, I'm told, and no truth to the report that she's
been downgraded to a tropical depression.
</P>
<P>
   It's good to know that burlesque has a Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   THERE'S A RUMOR that the great DiMaggio's Florida lawyer will
seek royalties whenever anyone in San Francisco orders a cuppa Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if DiMaggio's power-crazed attorney would object if
we rename the country the United States of DiMaggio,'' says Arthur
Louis. ``Or does Amerigo Vespucci have a Florida lawyer, too?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'D LIKE to pay, pump and bolt,'' says the woman on the new
Shell gas-station billboards.
</P>
<P>
   You've come to the right town, sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I always drive up to the ``Stand Around and Chat Afterward''
island.
</P>
<P>
   But then I'm like the telephone tipster who told The Chronicle's
Peninsula columnist Mark Simon, ``I'd like to remain anomalous.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A revolution within the revolution. Looking back, we might have
seen it coming.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming democratic vote for the Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami two years ago and then the repression, the closing
of newspapers, the trial of Tehran's mayor, the murder of
intellectuals, the repeated flouting by the old parliament of
Khatami's call for a ``civil society,'' for a place without fear.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a sign of the arrogance of the old guard _ the
bazaaris and the mullahs and those who clustered around the Supreme
Leader _ that they never guessed that an attack on the students of
Tehran would ignite the flame.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, it is the students who now find
themselves amid the flames.
</P>
<P>
   It was the students who were attacked by police on the Tehran
campus, the students who marched in the street crying for ``an end
to despotism'' _ how like the revolution of 1979 _ and the students
whose power forced the arrest of the senior policemen who assaulted
them.
</P>
<P>
   It was students, too, who appeared on the streets of Tehran
again Tuesday, ignoring even their president's appeals for calm as
they came under tear-gas attack from the police.
</P>
<P>
   And those very men who had achieved such total theocratic power
on the shoulders of Khomeini's students, who had wrested Iran from
the most powerful dictator in the Middle East with students' blood,
who had encouraged the ``students of the Imam'' to clamber over the
walls of the American and British embassies 20 years ago, forgot
the very source of their own street power.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, the interior ministry police and their vigilante
allies decided to teach Tehran University undergraduates a lesson
last week _ the students had been protesting at the closure of
another pro-Khatami newspaper, Salam _ and found themselves facing
a revolt.
</P>
<P>
   It all fitted into a familiar history. In January, 1962, the
Shah had sent his police into Tehran University, viciously
assaulting male and female students and prompting the chancellor to
resign with the angry accusation that ``when we inspected the
university buildings we were faced with the same situation as if an
army of barbarians had invaded an enemy territory.''
</P>
<P>
   And last week, the police of the Islamic Republic moved into the
same university _ just 37 years later _ prompting the resignation
of the university president and the minister of higher education
amid identical scenes of brutality. Tuesday, tear gas was still
drifting through the student dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   To generalize about the causes of the student revolt is easy.
Frustration and economic misfortune, a gathering fury at the
intolerance of the old and uneducated men who chose to shut off the
freedoms they had been promised, a conviction that they were being
cheated of the democracy they had voted for.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally easy to be taken in by the cliches of the
West: that this is a struggle between ``doves and hawks,'' between
``hard-liners and moderates'' and all the other characters from
satellite television's central casting.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the structure of the Islamic Republic set up
by Ayatollah Khomeini was deeply flawed. By creating both an
elected president and an unelected Supreme Leader, Iran would
inevitably fail to function as a nation-state.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the president tolerated a theocracy _ or, given the
Shia Muslim fascination with death, a necrocracy _ and as long as
the guidance of the Supreme Leader went as unquestioned as a
medieval pope, Iran could hold together.
</P>
<P>
   But the moment a president _ in this case Khatami _ demanded the
rule of civil law before the law of religion, he would come into
conflict with the theological regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   And so, what emerged after the May 1997 elections was
inevitable: the unelected regime of Khamenei became the government
and the elected government of Khatami became the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it is extraordinary _ and a mark of Khatami's
peaceful intentions _ that it took two years for this contradiction
to explode into violence.
</P>
<P>
   And the regime's power _ the very theological edifice that
demanded the obedience of every Iranian in Imam Khomeini's name _
has now begun to crumble. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 700. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The students demanded _ unspeakable heresy _ ``explanations''
from the Supreme Leader who had never had to explain himself.
Khamenei tried to explain himself and condemned the security
forces. The two police chiefs were forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   There would be compensation for those arrested and a full
inquiry into the deaths of two students _ a Khatami man in Tehran
and a Khamenei man in Tabriz _ and a harsh condemnation from
President Khatami of the interior ministry police and their Ansar
e-Hizballah vigilante friends who stormed into the university
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday night, there were signs that the erring security
police would at last be transferred from the control of Khamenei to
the Khatami-run interior ministry _ a sure sign that the elected
government might be taking power from the unelected regime.
</P>
<P>
   That the conservatives in parliament have still not understood
this is inevitable. Guardians of the sacred memory of Khomeini,
they would not _ could not _ accept any criticism.
</P>
<P>
   When Salam published documents purporting to prove that an
Iranian secret service agent was not only guilty of political
assassination but of instigating anti-press laws, they rushed to
shut it down. And the students of Tehran objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were peaceful and no one expected this response from the
authorities,'' a Tehran businessman said Tuesday after prowling
through the ruins of one university block. ``But the police made a
big mistake _ to attack students like this and at night!
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the president and the guide (Supreme Leader) were obliged
to say `we support the students.' But it is positive for Mr.
Khatami. It has made our President very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   It has certainly weakened Khamenei. The Supreme Leader, speaking
to 10,000 demonstrating students in Tehran, was met with shouts of
derision from the crowd who yelled: ``Either Islam and the law _ or
another revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This bitter incident,'' Khamenei said of the police attack,
``hurt my heart.'' The students could scarcely hear him. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   A revolution within the revolution. Looking back, we might have
seen it coming.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming democratic vote for the Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami two years ago and then the repression, the closing
of newspapers, the trial of Tehran's mayor, the murder of
intellectuals, the repeated flouting by the old parliament of
Khatami's call for a ``civil society,'' for a place without fear.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a sign of the arrogance of the old guard _ the
bazaaris and the mullahs and those who clustered around the Supreme
Leader _ that they never guessed that an attack on the students of
Tehran would ignite the flame.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, it is the students who now find
themselves amid the flames.
</P>
<P>
   It was the students who were attacked by police on the Tehran
campus, the students who marched in the street crying for ``an end
to despotism'' _ how like the revolution of 1979 _ and the students
whose power forced the arrest of the senior policemen who assaulted
them.
</P>
<P>
   It was students, too, who appeared on the streets of Tehran
again Tuesday, ignoring even their president's appeals for calm as
they came under tear-gas attack from the police.
</P>
<P>
   And those very men who had achieved such total theocratic power
on the shoulders of Khomeini's students, who had wrested Iran from
the most powerful dictator in the Middle East with students' blood,
who had encouraged the ``students of the Imam'' to clamber over the
walls of the American and British embassies 20 years ago, forgot
the very source of their own street power.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, the interior ministry police and their vigilante
allies decided to teach Tehran University undergraduates a lesson
last week _ the students had been protesting at the closure of
another pro-Khatami newspaper, Salam _ and found themselves facing
a revolt.
</P>
<P>
   It all fitted into a familiar history. In January, 1962, the
Shah had sent his police into Tehran University, viciously
assaulting male and female students and prompting the chancellor to
resign with the angry accusation that ``when we inspected the
university buildings we were faced with the same situation as if an
army of barbarians had invaded an enemy territory.''
</P>
<P>
   And last week, the police of the Islamic Republic moved into the
same university _ just 37 years later _ prompting the resignation
of the university president and the minister of higher education
amid identical scenes of brutality. Tuesday, tear gas was still
drifting through the student dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   To generalize about the causes of the student revolt is easy.
Frustration and economic misfortune, a gathering fury at the
intolerance of the old and uneducated men who chose to shut off the
freedoms they had been promised, a conviction that they were being
cheated of the democracy they had voted for.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally easy to be taken in by the cliches of the
West: that this is a struggle between ``doves and hawks,'' between
``hard-liners and moderates'' and all the other characters from
satellite television's central casting.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the structure of the Islamic Republic set up
by Ayatollah Khomeini was deeply flawed. By creating both an
elected president and an unelected Supreme Leader, Iran would
inevitably fail to function as a nation-state.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the president tolerated a theocracy _ or, given the
Shia Muslim fascination with death, a necrocracy _ and as long as
the guidance of the Supreme Leader went as unquestioned as a
medieval pope, Iran could hold together.
</P>
<P>
   But the moment a president _ in this case Khatami _ demanded the
rule of civil law before the law of religion, he would come into
conflict with the theological regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   And so, what emerged after the May 1997 elections was
inevitable: the unelected regime of Khamenei became the government
and the elected government of Khatami became the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it is extraordinary _ and a mark of Khatami's
peaceful intentions _ that it took two years for this contradiction
to explode into violence.
</P>
<P>
   And the regime's power _ the very theological edifice that
demanded the obedience of every Iranian in Imam Khomeini's name _
has now begun to crumble. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 700. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The students demanded _ unspeakable heresy _ ``explanations''
from the Supreme Leader who had never had to explain himself.
Khamenei tried to explain himself and condemned the security
forces. The two police chiefs were forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   There would be compensation for those arrested and a full
inquiry into the deaths of two students _ a Khatami man in Tehran
and a Khamenei man in Tabriz _ and a harsh condemnation from
President Khatami of the interior ministry police and their Ansar
e-Hizballah vigilante friends who stormed into the university
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday night, there were signs that the erring security
police would at last be transferred from the control of Khamenei to
the Khatami-run interior ministry _ a sure sign that the elected
government might be taking power from the unelected regime.
</P>
<P>
   That the conservatives in parliament have still not understood
this is inevitable. Guardians of the sacred memory of Khomeini,
they would not _ could not _ accept any criticism.
</P>
<P>
   When Salam published documents purporting to prove that an
Iranian secret service agent was not only guilty of political
assassination but of instigating anti-press laws, they rushed to
shut it down. And the students of Tehran objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were peaceful and no one expected this response from the
authorities,'' a Tehran businessman said Tuesday after prowling
through the ruins of one university block. ``But the police made a
big mistake _ to attack students like this and at night!
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the president and the guide (Supreme Leader) were obliged
to say `we support the students.' But it is positive for Mr.
Khatami. It has made our President very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   It has certainly weakened Khamenei. The Supreme Leader, speaking
to 10,000 demonstrating students in Tehran, was met with shouts of
derision from the crowd who yelled: ``Either Islam and the law _ or
another revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This bitter incident,'' Khamenei said of the police attack,
``hurt my heart.'' The students could scarcely hear him. &QL;

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: One take this week.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>
<P>
   q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I still have a POW bracelet from the Vietnam War. I was
wondering if there was an address or phone number I could call so I
might locate the family of the soldier on my bracelet. I would like
to find out if he is still alive or was ever found, and would like
to return the bracelet to his family.
</P>
<P>
   A: A good place to start would be to call the National League of
POW/MIA Families in Washington, at 202-223-6846.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to know if there still are still world's fairs going
on. I haven't heard about any lately. If so, where's the next one
going to be, and when?
</P>
<P>
   A: Take heart, the world's fair is not an extinct species. A
world's fair, as defined by the World Book Encyclopedia, is ``an
international exposition that features exhibits dealing with
commerce, industry and science. Most fairs also offer entertainment
and cultural activities and promote tourism in a region or
country.'' World's fairs have been around awhile, the first one
having been held in London in 1851 and called the Great Exibition
of 1851.
</P>
<P>
   And while the word ``fair'' conjures up images of ferris wheels
and funnel cakes, world's fairs also have been the showcase for
some pretty impressive innovations. Alexander Graham Bell's
telephone was shown off publicly for one of the first times at
Philadelphia's Centennial Exposition in 1876, and early
automobiles, along with ice cream and iced tea, were on display at
St. Louis' 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Such notable
buildings as the Eiffel Tower and the Seattle Space Needle were
constructed for world's fairs as well.
</P>
<P>
   World's fairs are regulated by the Bureau of International
Expositions, who rule that only one major fair can be held per
decade. So, brush up on your German, for the next world's fair is
going to be next year in Hannover, Germany. Known as the Millenium
world's fair in the United States, Expo 2000 promises to be a
grandiose and impressive way to get the 21st century started.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming world's fair will focus on four basic components:
worldwide projects, national pavilions with focus on
man-nature-technology, a theme park, and cultural events.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you happen to have the address and phone number for the
Innocence Project?
</P>
<P>
   A: Innocence Project, according to its Web site, ``provides pro
bono legal assistance to inmates who are challenging their
convictions based on DNA testing of evidence, though clients must
obtain funding for testing.'' This organization, founded in 1992 by
well-known defense lawyer Barry Scheck, focuses on freeing people
who were incarcerated under suspicious or inadequate evidence.
Innocence Project is affiliated with the Benjamin N. Cardozo School
of Law, 55 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10003; telephone 212-790-0200.
And you can find it on the Internet at
www.yu.edu/cardozo/law/innocent.html
</P>
<P>
   Q: Buildings and homes used to come standard with lightning
rods. Are they still built in _ and do they work?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lightning rods no longer are standard on homes and buildings,
so these days, if you'd like one built into your house, you would
have to specially request it from your contractor.
</P>
<P>
   As for their effectiveness, Greg Forbes, severe weather expert
at The Weather Channel, they are only ``relatively'' effective.
Forbes explains that a lightning rod offers a 45-degree cone of
protection on either side of the rod. This cone of protection is
intended to divert the lightning. So, while they may offer some
assistance in a lightning storm, they are hardly a foolproof
measure against the wrath of Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   On an interesting note regarding lightning, Forbes notes that
not every lightning stroke is equally capable of producing a fire.
To have a good fire-starting lightning strike, the stroke itself
has to have a longer, more continuous current. So, while it pays to
be cautious during a lightning storm, not every stroke of lightning
is going to spark a towering inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the movie ``Selena,'' did Jennifer Lopez sing all the
songs herself or was that the real Selena's voice?
</P>
<P>
   A: The vocals you hear in the movie based on the life and early
death of tejano singer Selena are sung by none other than the real
Selena. Lopez, who played the title role in the 1997 movie, was
merely lypsynching the vocals, although she did perform all the
dancing herself. Now, Jennifer Lopez lypsynchs to no one. Having
just released an album of her own, she is poised to conquer the
music business after having already conquered the movie world.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Atlanta is going to have the NCAA Women's
Final four in 2003. How would I go about getting tickets for it?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll have to wait until 2002 before you can even think
about it. However, keep your eye out throughout the tournament in
2002. During the commercial breaks of the televised games, look for
an address to which you can apply for tickets for the following
year. Before you can purchase any tickets you will have to apply
for them, so don't channel surf during commercials or you might
miss the address to send your application.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was watching a Fourth of July television music special and
couldn't help noticing the Washington Monument. I'm curious about
what they've done to it. It looks as though there are windows on
each level.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Washington Monument has been an icon of Americana for 110
years now. However, the wear and tear of being a national monument,
not to mention the extreme weather of Washington, D.C., have taken
a toll, and the windows you saw are the scaffolding in place until
restoration is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration, which should be finished sometime next year, is
being funded by the National Park Foundation and Target stores.
Among the many jobs are cleaning 59,000 square feet of interior
wall surface and sealing 500 feet of exterior and interior stone
cracks. Now that's housecleaning! For more information, write the
National Park Foundation, 1101 17th St. N.W., Washington D.C.
20036, or call 202-785-4500.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you provide some data on charter schools? What is their
legal tie to school boards? Which school standards do they have to
adhere to? Is the charter school program considered a success? Any
statistics on this experiment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The success of charter schools is hotly debated. Many studies
show that they offer a higher level of accountability and vitality
than other public schools, and put healthy pressure on entire
systems by offering parents a choice. Some in other states have
been failures, but the fact that some of these failures have been
shut down is cited by supporters as proof that charters work. When
is the last time you heard of a regular public school being shut
down because of failure?
</P>
<P>
   You can find statistics and studies on charter schools, which
are tax-supported schools that enjoy relative independence and
compete for students, on the Web. Two Web sites are
www.uscharterschools.org or www.ecs.org. Or you can contact
organizations such as the Center for School Change, Humphrey
Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota _
director Joe Nathan, 612-626-1834; jnathan(at)hhh.umn.edu _ or
Education Commission of the States, 707 17th St., No. 2700 Denver,
CO 80202; 303-299-3600; ecs(at)ecs.org
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, an estimatated 1,100 charter schools are operating
in 34 states that permit charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a ``lifetime learning credit''? I believe it may be a
tax deduction for money spent on continuing education. Does it
apply to individuals?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Lifetime Learning Credit can save you up to $1,000 a year
($2,000 after 2002) against what you owe in federal income taxes,
based on tuition and related expenses you have paid since June 30,
1998, at a wide range of eligible post-secondary schools. It is the
companion piece of a Clinton administration initiative called the
Hope tax credit, which borrowed its name and inspiration from
Georgia's HOPE scholarship, but has nothing to do with a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Hope tax credit of $1,500 is available only to
undergraduates who are enrolled at least half-time in an eligible
degree or certificate program. The Lifetime Learning Credit is less
restrictive _ though an individual can't get both at the same time.
So, yes, it applies to individuals and may be available for
continuing education expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Fats Domino? Has he retired? Is he still
alive?
</P>
<P>
   A: The famous, gravel-voiced rock pioneer is very much alive and
unretired. Famous as the piano playing singer of such '50's hits as
``Blueberry Hill'' and ``Ain't That a Shame,'' Domino is widely
respected as a true rock and roll pioneer and was inducted into the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fats Domino spends most of his time these days at his
home in New Orleans with his wife, Rosemary, he has been known to
make an appearance on occasion to tickle the ivories and vocalize
in public.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been watching the Women's World Cup, and I have two
questions. One, in the stats, what is a ``cap''? And what does FIFA
stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Good questions. The ``cap'' you refer to has to do with the
number of international games a player has played for the national
team. The term goes back several decades, originating from an
actual cap the players would wear, a different one for each
international game.
</P>
<P>
   As for FIFA, the letters stand for the Federation Internationale
de Football Association, or the International Football Association
to us Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If Bill Clinton were elected senator from Arkansas in 2002,
could the Senate refuse to seat him? Has any senator or
representative ever been refused a seat? If so, who and when, and
what were the circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Senate has the sole right to seat, unseat and punish its
own members. There have been 16 cases in which a newly elected
senator's right to take the oath of office has been challenged, and
three senators-elect have been excluded from membership, according
to Congressional Quarterly's Guide to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When senators-elect are being sworn in, the presiding officer,
acting on his own authority or in response to a motion, may ask a
challenged person to stand aside. The controversy usually is
referred to a Senate committee, which holds hearings and presents
its recommendations. The issue then is decided by a majority vote
of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifications for membership have been challenged on grounds of
citizenship, residence, loyalty, sanity, age, character, membership
in the Mormon church, and voting fraud. The three senators-elect
who were excluded were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Albert Gallatin (D-Pa.) in 1793, for insufficient years of
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   _ James Shields (D-Ill.) in 1849, for insufficient years of
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   _Phillip Thomas (D-Md.) in 1867, for having disloyally
encouraged his son to serve in the Confederate military.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1913, when the 17th Amendment to the Constitution gave
voters rather than state legislatures the right to choose senators,
seven senators-elect have been challenged _ four on grounds of
character, one on age, one on residence and one on voting fraud _
but none has been excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My question is, I often hear Delilah on an Atlanta radio
station in the evenings, but while traveling I've also heard her on
other stations. Where does she broadcast from, and how wide is her
syndication?
</P>
<P>
   A: The silky voiced evening DJ broadcasts out of Seattle. Since
she is syndicated on at least 160 radio stations there's a good
chance that wherever in the United States you may roam you'll be
able to find Delilah somewhere on the dial!
</P>

   A: Lightning rods no longer are standard on homes and buildings,
so these days, if you'd like one built into your house, you would
have to specially request it from your contractor.
</P>
<P>
   As for their effectiveness, Greg Forbes, severe weather expert
at The Weather Channel, they are only ``relatively'' effective.
Forbes explains that a lightning rod offers a 45-degree cone of
protection on either side of the rod. This cone of protection is
intended to divert the lightning. So, while they may offer some
assistance in a lightning storm, they are hardly a foolproof
measure against the wrath of Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   On an interesting note regarding lightning, Forbes notes that
not every lightning stroke is equally capable of producing a fire.
To have a good fire-starting lightning strike, the stroke itself
has to have a longer, more continuous current. So, while it pays to
be cautious during a lightning storm, not every stroke of lightning
is going to spark a towering inferno.

<P>
   Q: In the movie ``Selena,'' did Jennifer Lopez sing all the
songs herself or was that the real Selena's voice?
</P>
<P>
   A: The vocals you hear in the movie based on the life and early
death of tejano singer Selena are sung by none other than the real
Selena. Lopez, who played the title role in the 1997 movie, was
merely lypsynching the vocals, although she did perform all the
dancing herself. Now, Jennifer Lopez lypsynchs to no one. Having
just released an album of her own, she is poised to conquer the
music business after having already conquered the movie world.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Atlanta is going to have the NCAA Women's
Final four in 2003. How would I go about getting tickets for it?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll have to wait until 2002 before you can even think
about it. However, keep your eye out throughout the tournament in
2002. During the commercial breaks of the televised games, look for
an address to which you can apply for tickets for the following
year. Before you can purchase any tickets you will have to apply
for them, so don't channel surf during commercials or you might
miss the address to send your application.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was watching a Fourth of July television music special and
couldn't help noticing the Washington Monument. I'm curious about
what they've done to it. It looks as though there are windows on
each level.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Washington Monument has been an icon of Americana for 110
years now. However, the wear and tear of being a national monument,
not to mention the extreme weather of Washington, D.C., have taken
a toll, and the windows you saw are the scaffolding in place until
restoration is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration, which should be finished sometime next year, is
being funded by the National Park Foundation and Target stores.
Among the many jobs are cleaning 59,000 square feet of interior
wall surface and sealing 500 feet of exterior and interior stone
cracks. Now that's housecleaning! For more information, write the
National Park Foundation, 1101 17th St. N.W., Washington D.C.
20036, or call 202-785-4500.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you provide some data on charter schools? What is their
legal tie to school boards? Which school standards do they have to
adhere to? Is the charter school program considered a success? Any
statistics on this experiment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The success of charter schools is hotly debated. Many studies
show that they offer a higher level of accountability and vitality
than other public schools, and put healthy pressure on entire
systems by offering parents a choice. Some in other states have
been failures, but the fact that some of these failures have been
shut down is cited by supporters as proof that charters work. When
is the last time you heard of a regular public school being shut
down because of failure?
</P>
<P>
   You can find statistics and studies on charter schools, which
are tax-supported schools that enjoy relative independence and
compete for students, on the Web. Two Web sites are
www.uscharterschools.org or www.ecs.org. Or you can contact
organizations such as the Center for School Change, Humphrey
Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota _
director Joe Nathan, 612-626-1834; jnathan(at)hhh.umn.edu _ or
Education Commission of the States, 707 17th St., No. 2700 Denver,
CO 80202; 303-299-3600; ecs(at)ecs.org
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, an estimatated 1,100 charter schools are operating
in 34 states that permit charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a ``lifetime learning credit''? I believe it may be a
tax deduction for money spent on continuing education. Does it
apply to individuals?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Lifetime Learning Credit can save you up to $1,000 a year
($2,000 after 2002) against what you owe in federal income taxes,
based on tuition and related expenses you have paid since June 30,
1998, at a wide range of eligible post-secondary schools. It is the
companion piece of a Clinton administration initiative called the
Hope tax credit, which borrowed its name and inspiration from
Georgia's HOPE scholarship, but has nothing to do with a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Hope tax credit of $1,500 is available only to
undergraduates who are enrolled at least half-time in an eligible
degree or certificate program. The Lifetime Learning Credit is less
restrictive _ though an individual can't get both at the same time.
So, yes, it applies to individuals and may be available for
continuing education expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Fats Domino? Has he retired? Is he still
alive?
</P>
<P>
   A: The famous, gravel-voiced rock pioneer is very much alive and
unretired. Famous as the piano playing singer of such '50's hits as
``Blueberry Hill'' and ``Ain't That a Shame,'' Domino is widely
respected as a true rock and roll pioneer and was inducted into the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fats Domino spends most of his time these days at his
home in New Orleans with his wife, Rosemary, he has been known to
make an appearance on occasion to tickle the ivories and vocalize
in public.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been watching the Women's World Cup, and I have two
questions. One, in the stats, what is a ``cap''? And what does FIFA
stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Good questions. The ``cap'' you refer to has to do with the
number of international games a player has played for the national
team. The term goes back several decades, originating from an
actual cap the players would wear, a different one for each
international game.
</P>
<P>
   As for FIFA, the letters stand for the Federation Internationale
de Football Association, or the International Football Association
to us Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If Bill Clinton were elected senator from Arkansas in 2002,
could the Senate refuse to seat him? Has any senator or
representative ever been refused a seat? If so, who and when, and
what were the circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Senate has the sole right to seat, unseat and punish its
own members. There have been 16 cases in which a newly elected
senator's right to take the oath of office has been challenged, and
three senators-elect have been excluded from membership, according
to Congressional Quarterly's Guide to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When senators-elect are being sworn in, the presiding officer,
acting on his own authority or in response to a motion, may ask a
challenged person to stand aside. The controversy usually is
referred to a Senate committee, which holds hearings and presents
its recommendations. The issue then is decided by a majority vote
of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifications for membership have been challenged on grounds of
citizenship, residence, loyalty, sanity, age, character, membership
in the Mormon church, and voting fraud. The three senators-elect
who were excluded were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Albert Gallatin (D-Pa.) in 1793, for insufficient years of
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   _ James Shields (D-Ill.) in 1849, for insufficient years of
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   _Phillip Thomas (D-Md.) in 1867, for having disloyally
encouraged his son to serve in the Confederate military.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1913, when the 17th Amendment to the Constitution gave
voters rather than state legislatures the right to choose senators,
seven senators-elect have been challenged _ four on grounds of
character, one on age, one on residence and one on voting fraud _
but none has been excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My question is, I often hear Delilah on an Atlanta radio
station in the evenings, but while traveling I've also heard her on
other stations. Where does she broadcast from, and how wide is her
syndication?
</P>
<P>
   A: The silky voiced evening DJ broadcasts out of Seattle. Since
she is syndicated on at least 160 radio stations there's a good
chance that wherever in the United States you may roam you'll be
able to find Delilah somewhere on the dial!

BACK WHERE HE BELONGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He was playing for the University of Hartford when he
first set foot upon the Fenway Park greensward, realizing, finally,
a childhood dream of playing in the legendary ballpark. ``But there
was like 1,200 people there at that game,'' recalled Jeff Bagwell.
``It was a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was drafted by the Red Sox in the fourth round of the
1989 amateur draft, the Boston-born Bagwell had hopes of playing in
front of bigger Fenway crowds. What he never figured, though, was
that it would take him almost a decade _ and a trade to the Houston
Astros in August 1990 in exchange for relief pitcher Larry Andersen
_ before he'd get the chance to return to a jam-packed Fenway for
the 70th All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my friends in college were all Red Sox fans and things
like that,'' he said, ``but we never got to a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even living in Hartford? ``Yeah, we didn't go that much, because
it was 2 1/2 hours,'' Bagwell said. ``We played all the time in
college and never really had a day off, but when I was a kid my dad
used to bring me up here in the summertime, but other than that, I
haven't been here since that college All-Star Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the sellout crowd in Boston was Bagwell's mother, Janice,
and his aunt, Kathy. And, oh yes, some friends from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about it,'' Bagwell said. ``I didn't have to get that
many tickets. I don't really have a big family, I really don't. So
I was really fortunate. And the rest of my friends, they've got to
go to work, so it's too far for them to drive up.''
</P>
<P>
   One person Bagwell wished could have been in attendance was his
grandmother, Alice. She passed away in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   An avid Red Sox fan, Bagwell's grandmother would have been
particularly proud at the sight of her grandson posing for a photo
in front of the Green Monster with the rest of the National League
All-Stars _ then with Houston teammates Mike Hampton, Billy Wagner,
and former Astro Luis Gonzalez, now with the Arizona Diamondbacks _
before the 1999 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God yeah, I wished she could be here,'' Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Was she a dyed-in-the-wool Sox fan?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, very much so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was responsible for making him a Red Sox fan,
Bagwell nodded, ``Yeah, well my whole family was. My Dad's from
Watertown and my mom's side is from Newton, but that's what it was
_ it was the Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   He never made it to the majors with the Sox. His career as a
third baseman at Double A New Britain took a 180-degree turn away
from Fenway when he was traded to the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox parted with a prospect who became the NL's Most
Valuable Player in 1994 and got in return Andersen, a veteran
reliever whose biggest contribution in Boston's abbreviated playoff
series against the Oakland A's _ three and out _ was the comic
relief he brought to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was tough at the time,'' Bagwell said. ``I was
perfectly happy where I was. I was in Double A and making my
progression, hopefully going to Triple A (Pawtucket) only to get
traded the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it might have embittered another up-and-coming player,
Bagwell understood the move. He understood he was fourth in line at
third base behind incumbent Wade Boggs, Scott Cooper, and Tim
Naehring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned at an early age, that's baseball, and it's a
business,'' said Bagwell, the NL's starting designated hitter after
hitting .316 with 28 home runs and 78 RBIs in the first half. ``It
turned out to be the best thing that could ever happen to me. Who
knows what would've happend if I stayed with the organization? Now
it turns out I played a while in the big leagues and I'm in
Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   But, oh, how things might have been different had he been
wearing a Red Sox uniform at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' said Bagwell, recalling his first visit to
Fenway. ``It's something I saw on TV and in books and things like
that. Just to actually step foot in here, I mean, what do you say
to a kid that's been a baseball fan his whole life when he comes to
Fenway Park?''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back.

THIS IS AN OLD RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The intensity could be felt as soon as the players
arrived in the locker room from cities all across America. Orlando
Cepeda remembered it vividly. The rivalry was real.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have a meeting before the game . . . always,'' said
Cepeda, the former great sluggger for the San Francisco Giants.
``And every meeting we all would say the same to each other, `Let's
go after the American League.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The American League did not like the National League. The
National League despised the American League. From the top _ league
officials and staff _ down to the players in each league, a sharp
rivalry burned between the leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, there was pride involved,'' said Cepeda, as he sat in
the National League dugout at Fenway Park before the All-Star Game.
``There was pride involved as to who was the best league. We wanted
to beat the American League very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   On the field, as Cepeda talked, the American League players were
finishing batting practice and the National League players were
ready to take the field. As it has been for two days in Boston,
there was bantering between the leagues' players. The rivalry did
not seem as sharp as it was when Pete Rose crashed into Ray Fosse,
or when Willie Mays would lead off for the National League and
madly steal bases and hit homers.
</P>
<P>
   As it has been for two nights in Boston, a few feet from Cepeda,
Frank Robinson was standing by the dugout _ the National League
dugout _ and not the American League dugout. Robinson's career was
almost equally divided between Cincinnati and Baltimore, and
Robinson seemed the perfect man to ask the question of the day:
Which league was he rooting for?
</P>
<P>
   ``National League,'' Robinson replied instantly, `` . . . always
the National League.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is with the fans. Baseball may change but fans seldom do.
Once an American League fan, always an American League fan, and the
same for National League fans. The rivalry still burns for the
fans, even with interleague play, despite players moving from
league to league, more loyal to the same agent than the same
league.
</P>
<P>
   But the players?
</P>
<P>
   ``I always liked the Home Run Derby and not the All-Star game as
much,'' said Scott Williamson, a rookie pitcher with Cincinnati.
``I didn't think guys were trying that hard in the game; but, being
here, I found out that's not true. The only thing these guys are
talking about is the game and I'm eating my words.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But as Cepeda looked out onto the field, he said there
was one player that epitomized the rivalry between the leagues and
the name virtually darted from Cepeda's mouth. ``Willie Mays. I
mean, Willie Mays was very, very serious about winning the All-Star
Game.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer is there white-hot heat between the leagues. Joe
Torre, the American League manager, kept checking himself, saying
how much ``fun'' this All-Star experience is, adding that, of
course, his team was doing the utmost to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fenway is one of the great ballparks and Boston one of the
great cities and the fans are ferocious sports fans here,'' said
Torre, noting that the game being in Boston added to his enjoyment.
``I've always admired it from afar. Coming into this park is always
special and I'm always going to treasure this night.''
</P>
<P>
   But burning to win the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``The best players in the world are here,'' said Torre, ``So no
matter what move I make, no matter what changes I make, I can't go
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was a player with the Cardinals and Braves, Torre
conceded, ``There was a bitter rivalry between the leagues. But
with free agency now, everybody's got a chance to cross paths, and
both sides of the field are represented by the same agents. So the
players are a lot friendlier (with each other) than they used to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Torre was quick to caution, ``The word you have to use _
for players back then and now _ is `respect.' The players all
respected the players on the other side. That's why, to me, the
All-Star Game has always been a special experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Special, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Only not as hot.

NO. 1 AT SECOND BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ It was anything but a routine infield grounder.
The ball bounced high and unpredictably off the artificial turf.
The fans at the Metrodome watched it head for the hole between
first and second. They assumed an automatic base hit.
</P>
<P>
   But second baseman Roberto Alomar had positioned himself
perfectly to stop the ball on its last high bounce before it
reached the outfield. He strided effortlessly toward the hole.
Moving to his left, the Cleveland infielder caught the ball in
mid-sideways shuffle. With his back to home plate, he flipped the
ball backhanded to Richie Sexson at first. The play wasn't even
close.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd let out two gasps _ one live and one for the replay on
the big screen in center field. Elected as a starter in the
All-Star Game, the fluid fielding display reinforced the popular
choice. To appreciate Alomar's talent, you must watch him in
motion. He is the product of practiced efficiency and perfect
baseball lineage. Raised on the game and respectful of the skill it
requires, Alomar works hard to make it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from a lot of big leaguers being in a baseball
family and being around ballplayers all the time,'' he said. ``I
think I learned a lot when I was young. I took all that knowledge
to my game and I think I took advantage of that situation. I asked
the ballplayers questions and now I'm here playing the game of
baseball in the big leagues . . . When I was young, I knew that I
had a talent and loved to play the game. I worked hard with the
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   As the son of 15-year major league veteran Sandy Alomar Sr. and
younger brother of Indians catcher Sandy Jr., it was clear early
that Robbie benefited from a genetic gift and a childhood spent in
professional ballparks. The Alomar family was always around the
game and its stars. When not traveling with his father, Robbie
recalls playing pickup ball in the streets any time he could gather
a group of friends. He keeps pictures of him posing with Hank
Aaron, Catfish Hunter, and Thurman Munson among other great former
players.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the best play as a kid made Robbie a student of the
game. From the dugout, he keeps track of pitchers' timing _ how
long it takes them to throw home _ and the way they build counts
against All-Star teammates Kenny Lofton and Omar Vizquel. He takes
mental notes on the game's best hitters and base stealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to watch different ballplayers,'' said Robbie Alomar.
``I watch all of them. When I first came up, I used to watch Ryne
Sandberg. When you talk about stealing bases, you watch Rickey
Henderson. I got the chance to play with Rickey. When you talk
about hitting you can talk about Paul Molitor, Edgar Martinez, Ken
Griffey Jr. _ all those good hitters. I'm always watching all those
good players to see if I can learn something from them that might
help my game later on. I talk to them about different things, to
see what they have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar's first-half numbers (.324 average, 12 home runs, 60
RBIs) helped him record 2,793,891 All-Star votes, putting him 2.1
million ahead of runner-up Chuck Knoblauch _ the largest margin at
any position in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But more often, it's Alomar's ability to close gaps with his
defense that catches stares.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best players I've been around and just playing
with him is a pleasure,'' said shortstop Vizquel. ``He makes my job
a lot easier. I get to speak Spanish with him all the time and
there's a good feeling being next to him on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if my game has improved (with Alomar at second).
I have more errors than I had before. But sometimes I just get
caught up watching him take ground balls and making plays I never
thought he was going to make. Sometimes, because I never had a
chance to play with a guy like that, I get caught up in that and I
don't concentrate as much when I'm watching him.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Alomar and Vizquel _ two Gold Glove Award
winners _ has shored up the Indian infield. After trading Carlos
Baerga to the Mets in 1996, Vizquel saw 15 different second base
partners before Alomar signed a free agent contract last November.
Despite the shortstop's increase in errors, Vizquel and Alomar
complement each other's skills so much that both earned All-Star
bids. While Alomar makes his ninth consecutive start and 10th
straight appearance, Vizquel is a reserve in his second midsummer
classic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet prior to his arrival in Cuyahoga County, a tarnished
reputation preceeded him. When Alomar spit in the face of plate
umpire John Hirschbeck in September 1996, the usually soft-spoken
second baseman became a symbol of spoiled professional athletes.
The incident has shadowed his career ever since and he has drawn
jeers of ``spitter'' from opposing fans. He admitted his actions
were wrong, though the issue regularly resurfaces whenever a
well-paid athlete complains or acts immaturely.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Alomar prefers the image of a player who cares about
the game and his place in history alongside the greats he knows
from his father's era. He does all he can to guarantee fans
appreciate and remember him for his play.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the Metrodome last week, he heard a mother yell out,
``Mr. Alomar, can you sign this for my kids?'' The woman was a good
50 yards down 4th Street. Alomar could easily have pretended not to
hear her and hail a taxi back to the hotel. But he waited and
autographed a few balls and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Said Alomar, `Whenever I retire, I'm going to remember those
special days that I have playing the game of baseball. I can tell
my family this is what I used to do and this is how much fun I used
to have.''
</P>
<P>
   And he hopes fans remember the days he caught infield grounders
on a high hop, tossed the ball backhanded to first base for the
easy out, and left them gasping in amazement.

ACE WAS IN HOLE AGAINST MARTINEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Curt Schilling admits he had pregame jitters to begin
with.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez certainly didn't help calm his nerves.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox ace opened the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park by
fanning, in order, Barry Larkin, Larry Walker, and Sammy Sosa. Then
he turned the mound over to Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez proved too tough an act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling was touched for three singles by Kenny Lofton, Jim
Thome, and Cal Ripken, and those, sandwiched around a walk to Manny
Ramirez, put him in a 2-0 hole after an inning. He settled down in
the second to retire the side in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I started to breath, after about the third or fourth
hitter, it was tough,'' said Schilling, the Phillies' righthander
who was 13-4 with a 3.14 ERA in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, how do you follow what he (Martinez) did. In his
hometown, having arguably one of the best first halves in the
history of the game and he goes out and strikes out three above-
average hitters. I said `that's nice, I have to follow that in the
first.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He followed, but not with the same success as Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton beat out an infield grounder to first baseman Mark
McGwire, outracing Schilling to the bag. After Nomar Garciaparra
lined deep to right and Lofton stole second, Schilling struck out
Ken Griffey looking for the second out. But he walked Ramirez,
setting the stage for RBI singles by Thome and Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he knew some of the AL batters he faced, Schilling
said, ``Yeah, they're usually in the top 10 in every category, so
you see their names in the paper every day. I gave myself a chance
to go over the lineup last night and had an idea how I wanted to
pitch them. That went out the window when I got the ball and got on
the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   After his two innings of work, Schilling had thrown 28 pitches,
19 for strikes, and struck out three. The effort left him
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' he said. ``I certainly wish I would have thrown
two scoreless innings. I'm happy I got the start and I wouldn't
trade it for anything. The important thing for me was representing
the Phillies and the city of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up three hits to a pretty decent lineup. I would have
liked to have shut them down, but I enjoyed every second of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling said he, not McGwire, was responsible for Lofton
reaching base in the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally my fault,'' he said. ``I saw Mark catch the
ball and I stutter-stepped, thinking he was going to take it. You
never stop going to first until the first baseman waves you off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I stopped, I was in a footrace with (Lofton) and he's
going to beat me by a step or two. Unfortunately, I thought Mike
(Piazza) threw him out at second. He made a good throw, but
fundamentals can hurt you any time and that's certainly what
happened in the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentals, and a pitcher named Martinez.

<P>
   BOSTON -- Sammy Sosa arrived at Fenway Park at the absolute peak
of his career. Leading the National League with 32 homers, he was
the top vote-getter in the NL, another sign of how last year's
record-setting home run duel with Mark McGwire turned him into a
household name.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has been exercising his seemingly bottomless charm ever
since his magical season, pitching products, helping hurricane
victims, and promoting his native Dominican Republic. But he was
nowhere to be found after a disappointing All-Star performance that
once again left him overshadowed by McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hit just one home run in Monday's Derby. Then, Tuesday
night, he went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts. He was one of Pedro
Martinez's first-inning victims, and later, with runners on second
and third in the fifth, he found himself equally blown away by Mike
Mussina.
</P>
<P>
   As McGwire and others paraded before the media to talk movingly
about it, particularly their encounter with Ted Williams, Sosa
declined to speak. He left after his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Sosa may have been feeling pressure, National League
manager Bruce Bochy said, ``No, he knows what this is about. He was
having fun, and he was trying. I don't think you can look at three
at-bats and say he was struggling. Hey, they just made good
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was in a good mood as recently as Monday, when he joked he
might hit 72 homers a season if he played at Fenway. However, after
the Home Run Derby, he explained his performance by saying it's
really his 32 regular-season homers that count.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa usually handles his celebrity with aplomb, but it must be
strange for him to be linked so strongly with McGwire, only to be
constantly overshadowed. McGwire, too, struggled, but before the
game he was named as one of the top 100 players of the century.
Sosa was not.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said he thought Sosa may have been
distracted by his growing celebrity. He said Sosa brought a large
entourage to Boston, and it would be good for him to get back to
Chicago, where he can focus on the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have him get his hits when we get back home,''
Riggleman said. ``You can only hold Sammy down for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Sosa, who batted third in front of McGwire, came up
in the first, it was clear Martinez was on fire. Martinez already
had struck out Barry Larkin on an impossible changeup and Larry
Walker on a fastball, so the tension surrounding Sosa's first
at-bat was heightened.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck him out on five pitches, including a curveball
that caused his knees to buckle. He fanned on an overpowering
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy was aggressive as usual, just going after it hard,''
said Riggleman. ``But when somebody's as sharp as Pedro threw
tonight, then there are not going to be many people who are going
to catch up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa popped out against David Cone in the third. In the fifth,
he came up with runners on second and third after Luis Gonzalez
doubled off Mussina. But Mussina blew fastballs past Sosa and
McGwire to get out of the jam.
</P>
<P>
   During the game, as Major League Baseball paraded its stars
before the media, McGwire talked long and movingly about the
experience, even though he, too, had gone hitless. A baseball
official said Sosa refused to answer questions before or after the
game. He was last seen outside Fenway, getting into a limousine and
disappearing into the night.

NL CAME TO PEDRO'S PLACE, SAW WHAT THE FUSS IS ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEDRO CITY, USA _ The National Leaguers remember Pedro Martinez,
but they haven't seen him since he got into local politics. They
haven't seen him since he switched uniforms, got himself elected
the Chief Operating Officer of a storied patch of real estate in
the Fenway section of Boston, and decided that he might as well
become the best pitcher in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't seen him since he went from an exalted pitching
level and a Cy Young Award in their league two years ago to the
new, almost unimaginable plateau from which he operates nowadays.
So it was at Pedro's press gathering after the game that an old
friend and former teammate had a kibitzing query for the mayor of
Pedro City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro,'' inquired Larry Walker, ``were you throwing 400 miles
an hour out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Fair question, that. For what Walker had done as a strikeout
victim in the top of the first inning of the 70th All-Star Game was
help make history. He was strikeout victim No. 2 in an All-Star
record-breaking streak of four Ks to open a game. Walker was
strikeout victim No. 2 of what would turn out to be an American
League record-tying total of five, a figure that might very easily
have tied the overall individual record of six had Matt Williams,
who had reached on an error, not been gunned down by the legendary
arm of Ivan ``Pudge'' Rodriguez at the tail end of a
strike-'em-out, throw-'em-out double play to end the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that Williams was the only National League
base runner allowed by the 1999 All-Star Game Most Valuable player
in his two innings of work, and that the only reason he was
fortunate enough to find himself at first base was that for some
inexplicable reason Gold Glove second baseman Roberto Alomar made a
complete pick-up-and-throwing mess of the Diamondback's 77-hopper
to second with one away in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The first six batters in a fairly awesome National League lineup
strongly resembled the first six batters in any ordinary 1999 Pedro
Martinez game. That is to say, they were helpless against the scary
repertoire of pitches at the command of the mayor of Pedro City.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did I strike out on?'' repeated Walker at one point. ``I
don't know. Fastballs, I guess. I didn't see many pitches. It
didn't take long to get me out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Do keep in mind that this man entered the game batting .382 with
25 homers and 77 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have told you what was coming, and it wouldn't have
made any difference,'' insisted Walker. ``He threw very hard and
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, so? Tell us something we constituents of the mayor didn't
already know. We know he throws hard and he throws well. He also
throws baseballs that move in very strange ways, and that sometimes
appear to be one thing leaving his hand and are quite another as
they sashay their way up to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't this the mayor's fantasy? Angered by what he felt was a
starting snub last year, he was going to make his first All-Star
start in his home ballpark, and when we say his home ballpark we
mean his home ballpark. Not since Luis Tiant has a pitcher
commanded such unconditional devotion around here, and that
includes Roger Clemens, who received a very mixed reaction from the
Fenway crowd when introduced as one of the top 100 players of the
century in a dramatic pregame ceremony. At this point, it's safe to
say that around here, as far as the Rocket is concerned, it's
pretty much a case of Roger Who? The mayor of Pedro City is all
these people need.
</P>
<P>
   The man himself appeared a bit dazed by it all. Normally a man
with superb recall, he was something less than his perceptive self
when asked to analyze his dazzling performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have much to say,'' said the mayor. ``Three
pitches. Fastball, changeup, curve. I'm not sure how I used them.''
</P>
<P>
   The first batter was the toughest. Barry Larkin battled, fouling
off three straight pitches after going 2 and 2. But the mayor wound
up winning that confrontation. Now he was ready to unload. Walker
was just about a no-hoper. That brought up Sammy Sosa, a prime K
candidate in any circumstance. ``I threw Sammy a couple of breaking
balls,'' said the mayor, his memory now kicking in, ``and I noticed
he didn't react well to the breaking ball.'' Set up nicely, Sosa
fanned on a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in All-Star Game history that someone had
begun a game by striking out the side. That strikeout total would
stretch to four when Pedro started the second inning by whiffing
Mark McGwire. Williams broke the spell with his dribbler to second;
Alomar bobbled it and then threw too late for a juicy E-4.
</P>
<P>
   All that did was give Rodriguez a chance to show off. Williams
took off on a swinging third-strike pitch to Jeff Bagwell (making
his first official plate appearance in Fenway since homering in a
college All-Star game many years ago), and Rodriguez gunned out the
Arizona third baseman to complete the double play. As if anyone
should be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't exactly been the All-Star experience the mayor was
expecting. It has, in fact, been better, and that's because he's
still learning what Boston is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great,'' he gushed. ``Out of all the All-Star Games
I've been in, this is probably the most exciting one I've been to.
I didn't know that Boston was going to be so much on top of the
All-Star Game. I've been to a few of them, but what happened with
Boston? What's here? Do the people eat baseball and drink baseball?
It's unbelievable. I don't really have the words to explain how
good it feels just to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do most people have the words to describe his 1999 pitching.
``That's him,'' said Nomar Garciaparra. ``That's Pedro. He loves
pitching in front of this crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Not crowd, Nomar. Subjects. When this man takes the mound, it is
no longer Fenway Park. All-Star Game or no All-Star Game, the name
of the place is Pedro City.

GARCIAPARRA ISN'T SHORT ON MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Long after the final score is a statistic in a record
book, and long after the box score of the 1999 All-Star Game has
yellowed a bit in his scrapbook, Nomar Garciaparra's enduring
memory will be a moment of conversation with a baseball legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' said Garciaparra, whose appearance in the game
began with a 30-second ovation when he was announced as the
starting shortstop and continued with a memorable convergence of
All-Stars, past and present, at the mound with Ted Williams. After
his 0-for-2 outing, Garciaparra's night ended with another ovation
when he was replaced by Derek Jeter at the start of the fourth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was really nice the way everybody just kind of
surrounded him. It was kind of funny when they announced for people
to please leave for the dugout, and everybody said, `No.' Nobody
wanted to leave,'' said Garciaparra of the emotional, impromptu
gathering around Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `Ted, how's everything?' And he said, `Nomar,
how's everything going? It's so good to see you.' He said, `We'll
definitely be talking, and I'll see you again.' And I said, `That's
for sure.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When the pregame ceremonies were over, Garciaparra got down to
some not-so-familiar business. His groin injury had kept him out of
the Sox lineup for nine games over a two-week span, but he said he
felt fine after his brief stint.
</P>
<P>
   The way Pedro Martinez and David Cone were pitching, there
wasn't much opportunity for Garciaparra to show off in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Batting second, Garciaparra, the first Sox shortstop to start in
the midsummer classic since Rick Burleson in 1977, had a crack at
Curt Schilling in the first inning (a warning track fly out) and
Randy Johnson in the third (a soft popup).
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Garciaparra downplayed being voted the starting
shortstop for the American League, choosing instead to salute all
of his major-league peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, we're the best in the world. We're
all All-Stars,'' he said. ``I felt good. I felt really good.
Everything's coming along great, and I'm looking forward to getting
back out there and starting the second half on Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Garciaparra came to making a play in the field came
with two outs in the third. With Jeromy Burnitz on second, Barry
Larkin hit a hard grounder up the middle, and Garciaparra's lunge
just missed as Burnitz scored the National League's first run.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's night officially ended when he took the field for
the fourth and was replaced by Jeter before the first pitch was
thrown, something Garciaparra knew would happen after being told
beforehand by American League manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just shows what a class guy he (Torre) is,'' said
Garciaparra. ``I thanked him over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of light moments at the postgame press
conference when Garciaparra strode to the podium just as Texas
stars Ivan Rodriguez and Rafael Palmeiro were making their exit.
Rodriguez motioned with a sweep of his arm for Garciaparra to take
center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first question could be asked, Garciaparra joked, `No
questions? Good, I'll see you.'' Then he was joined by Mark
McGwire, who was asked about Martinez's performance.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire paused, turned to Garciaparra, and said, ``Thank God you
don't have to face him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a humorous climax to a special evening for Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an electricity out there,'' he said. ``Nobody wanted
to leave (after Williams was introduced). It was just one of those
things where they appreciated the game and understanding there's a
tradition and we are part of it. That was a special moment.''

MCGWIRE'S CLOUT ON DISPLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- America's continuing love affair with the home run
grew even more intense Monday night with each swing of Mark
McGwire's bat. Big Mac didn't win what will be remembered as the
granddaddy of all home run derbys, but his lumberjack cuts and
colossal clouts electrified Fenway Park and once again turned the
national pastime into a study in tape-measure shots and
red-stitched rainbows.
</P>
<P>
   In his first of rounds of at-bats, McGwire socked a record 13
homers _ one more than the standing mark set by Cal Ripken in '91 _
including a 488-footer that capped the awesome exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   With flashbulbs popping throughout the packed stands, seemingly
sprinkling pixiedust around each of McGwire's swings _ the scene
turned nearly surrealistic. The third of his 13 dingers clanged off
the top of the light tower in straightaway left field. No. 13 was
slightly lower, passing just to the left of the light tower in
left-center, and easily traveled the deepest into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's 480 feet to the Mass. Pike,'' said an
incredulous Nomar Garciaparra, who felt that McGwire had been
shortchanged on some of the measurements of his prodigious clouts.
``I think it's a little farther than that. Hey, we play, but we're
fans, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Strung together, McGwire's 13 smashes measured 5,692 feet. More
than a mile. In the end, Ken Griffey won the Derby, defeating
Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz in Round 3, but the night forever would
be remembered for the one McGwire plate appearance. He hammered the
soft-serve batting-practice tosses of San Diego coach Tim Flannery
one after another into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Years from now, when only a portion of Fenway remains standing
as a museum piece, aged Sox fans will tell their sons and daughters
of the night they saw Big Mac shake the Hub's foundation.
</P>
<P>
   After No. 9 left the yard _ one more over the screen _ star Red
Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez walked slowly to the batter's box and
playfully wrested the bat away from Big Mac. The good-natured
McGwire had to leave the launch area to get it back from Martinez,
then returned to smash Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13. As changeups go, it was
by far the worst of Martinez's career.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the McGwire torrid tour de force ended, Sox
broadcaster Sean McDonough kiddingly suggested that Martinez, if he
were pitching to McGwire, eventually would have had to buzz Big Mac
with an inside pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think so,'' said Martinez, who took the hill as
the American League's starting pitcher in  &UR; last night &LR; 's All-Star
Game, ``but I'd probably take myself out.''
</P>
<P>
   The shot that McGwire lifted into the light tower is believed to
be only the second ball ever to reach the high-wattage heights. The
only other came on Oct. 1, 1991, when then-Detroit Tiger Pete
Incaviglia wheeled around on a Roger Clemens fastball. Installed in
1947, the lights stood unscathed for some 44 years before that
shot. Almost eight years later, McGwire matched it, without the
advantage of a 90-mile-per-hour-plus fastball to fuel the
trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like that,'' Incaviglia said that day, ``you don't
even feel it.'' Clemens, who saw the Sox knocked out of playoff
contention that same day, never turned around to watch the shot.
Told later that it banged into the column of lights, he said,
``Easy, he killed it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and the Cubs' Sammy Sosa, who hit only one homer in
Monday night's Derby, wooed the baseball world with their long-ball
dogfight last summer. They both shattered Roger Maris's mark of 61,
McGwire going on to finish with 70 and Sosa with 66. McGwire
reiterated Monday night that he believe his mark of 70 will remain
secure for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that pursuit will happen in our lifetime,'' he
said. ``We were talking about it earlier, someone will probably hit
60 again, but the number 70, I don't think that's going to be
touched in our lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   WBZ reported  &UR; last night &LR;  that the balls used in the home run
competition Monday night were underweight, by approximately 8
ounces.
</P>
<P>
   American League president Gene Budig, whose name appears on the
Rawlings-made balls, refuted the station's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard of that,'' said Budig, at Fenway  &UR; last
night &LR; . ``I've never heard of such a thing. We talk periodically to
Rawlings. They have a system of checking the balls. They are
checked on a regular basis and they are in compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest home run mark of them all, Hank Aaron's 755, also
appears safe for many years to come. All these years past Aaron's
retirement, the game has no one in serious pursuit of his standard.
Yet with the century about to close, America, more than ever, is
fascinated with long drives and the men who say, ``Leave the
driving to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, surprisingly, doesn't hold the same fascination for the
clout that remains his signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to play it down,'' Aaron said last week, before
coming here to throw out the first pitch (Bernie Carbo his catcher)
prior to the Derby. ``I know nothing is ever going to replace the
homer for the fans _ they'll always see it as the ultimate. But as
a player, the most exciting thing in the game _ what I'd rather see
for a thrill _ is a triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a home run. It's hit _ BAM! _ you cheer and that's it.
Think of it in football terms. Take a guy who's got 40 touchdowns
in a year, and everyone one of 'em he's scored from the 1-yard
line. Each of those touchdowns has been only one moment of
happiness. Now compare that to a 99-yard touchdown run where the
fans are in the stands, yelling and cheering as he runs down the
field. To me, that's the excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammerin' Hank remains the authority on the art he crafted
better than anyone else. His status as the game's home run king
validates his three-base theory. But here in the summer of '99, the
long ball remains the rage, and for one night _ one very memorable
night _ Fenway played the stage.

NO BUCKING THE PREPARATION IN THE FOX BOOTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD   MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It's about 2 p.m. and Joe Buck is having lunch at the
Ritz-Carlton. The All-Star Game is not for another six hours, and
his bowl of chowder and club sandwich must do until after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Too much to worry about. Too much to know. Little things like
the fact that Jay Bell played in the 1993 Game and didn't get an
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   It drives him crazy, assembling all the statistics and other
information that will give his play-by-play call for Fox an edge of
authority. Yet he makes it seem effortless.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what you are going to use on air,'' Buck said.
``You check out one player, and then something else comes into your
head and you check that out. It's like your short-term memory is
working on overload. The sad part is that I'll probably only use
.03 percent of the stuff. But you never know what that .03 percent
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   At 29, Buck is sports broadcasting's boy wonder du jour. As
Fox's lead baseball announcer, he has already called two World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for his success is that he was raised right
by his father, legendary broadcaster Jack Buck. The elder Buck,
longtime play-by-play man for the St. Louis Cardinals, has called
about 10,000 games over his career. With the exception of a
one-year stint on an ill-faded sports show with Bryant Gumbel, Buck
has been in the broadcast booth every season since 1954. He grew up
in Holyoke and saw his first baseball game at Fenway Park in the
late '20s.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Buck sometimes calls his father for feedback on his
broadcasts. His father is not always forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did I do?'' Joe Buck recently asked his father after a
nationally televised game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I didn't know you had a game,'' his father quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Of course he had watched the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would have made Joe Buck happier than to have had his
father at Fenway Park. But instead of flying to Boston, Jack Buck
is using the All-Star break to visit a close friend who is in poor
health. That's classic Buck. He once was to be honored with the
Horatio Alger Award, given to a person who has gone from rags to
riches, but elected to turn it down because he felt it made his
parents seem unfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught me a lot of great lessons,'' Joe Buck said. ``I'll
be thinking about him when I'm in the booth. I always try to
picture what he would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hype surrounding the All-Star Game, Buck is not
planning on doing anything special. His coordinating producer,
Michael Weisman, has that angle covered. Fox's 40-minute pregame
show was patterned after ``Field of Dreams,'' with the film's star,
Kevin Costner, doing a voiceover for the opening two-minute segment
and Buck providing the voice for the two-minute closing.
</P>
<P>
   The opening segment featured legendary all-stars walking out of
a cornfield, followed by current all-stars. On the screen the faces
of the legends morphed into the faces of the new players. The last
person to appear was Ted Williams, being carted from center field
to throw out the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The closing segment included James Earl Jones's soliloquy from
``Field of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   It's baseball, it's drama, it's emotion, it's Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will open very strong and we will close very strong,''
Weisman said. ``As far is the middle, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Not too much to worry about there. Fox dispatched 24 cameras, 64
microphones, and 150 reporters, engineers, and production folks to
Fenway to cover everything that moves.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lyons's role typified the Fox effort. For the last three
days, he arrived at Fenway at 7 a.m. to report feature stories for
both the network and its cable service, Fox Sports Net. By noon
Tuesday, he had taped an hour-long ``hardcore'' baseball show for
the cable network. After lunch he was back on the field taping
segments for Tuesday night's show. During the game, Lyons was
interviewing players for the Fox telecast. And after the game,
Lyons worked as an anchor for Fox's cable show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing after another,'' Lyons said. ``It never
stops.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisman was right about one thing: Wherever a camera or
microphone is aimed, there is a story. Monday's Home Run Derby, for
instance, earned a 7.5 rating and reached 5.7 million households.
It was the most-watched show on ESPN this year.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the reason Buck didn't have time to eat until after
the game. He left the Ritz at around 3 p.m. to soak up the
atmosphere at Fenway, study up on the players, and reread Kurt
Smith's ``Our House,'' a classic about the Red Sox and Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready,'' he said before leaving for the park.
</P>

 &HT;    Lefties have rights, too
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A minority class of Americans silently suffers
daily discrimination at the hands of an uncaring majority.
</P>
<P>
   The discrimination is so ingrained that the guilty parties are
not even aware of the indignities they routinely inflict on their
fellow citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The minority citizens in question are left-handed Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handers have made a world that is convenient and easy for
them but extremely inconvenient and difficult for the 12 percent of
Americans who, through no fault of their own, were born
left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   I'll admit there is a heated nature-nurture debate over whether
people are born left-handed or whether they become left-handed due
to environmental influences.
</P>
<P>
   For my part, I prefer to believe that I was born left-handed. I
also believe that all right-thinking people believe that
left-handedness is genetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right-thinking'' is a genuine compliment, not a left-handed
compliment, which is an insult.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 13 is International Left-Handers Day, not that
right-handers would ever call for a holiday that celebrated the
qualities, accomplishments and contributions made by left-handers
in the face of hardships no right-hander could understand.
</P>
<P>
   One celebration honoring Left-Handers Day will be held in
Farmington, Mich., where festivities will include a professional
baseball game, a variety of sporting activities and serious group
discussions on topics ranging from the special teaching needs of
left-handed children to everyday health and safety concerns of
left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   A similar celebration in New York City will include displays of
a left-handed world in which all the products and activities now
designed for right-handers are redesigned to accommodate
left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handers are invited to step into left-handed displays and
sample daily discriminations, frustrations and humiliations
associated with having special needs that are ignored by the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handers on average do not live as long as right-handers. No
one knows exactly why. I suspect it is due to the constant
frustrations of being forced to perform routine activities
backward.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handers should consider what it would be like to wake up
one morning in a left-handed world _ a world in which left-handers
made slighting comments about northpaws but no products to take
into consideration their natural needs.
</P>
<P>
   Consider using a telephone designed to be dialed with your
opposite hand. Consider punching in microwave instructions with
your left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Ever use a computer? Consider using a two-button mouse designed
only for left-handers. Consider using a keyboard number pad on the
left side. Think about using a computer joystick designed for
left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what it would be like if you woke up to a world in which
the controls for practically every manufactured item that required
dexterity was made for left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose your metal tape measure was made for left-handers and
the spouts on all your ladles, pots and pans made you use your left
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if nearly all musical instruments were made for
left-handers, and your pocket knives had blades made to be opened
with the left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Considering using measuring cups with the measurements on on the
wrong side and butter knives that you had to turn upside down.
</P>
<P>
   You might also imagine how you would feel if most hand tools and
power tools were considerably more dangerous for you to use than
for left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, if the world were suddenly reversed for
right-handers, they could take solace in the fact that extra
hardships build extra skills in dealing with adversity. It's not
much, but it's something.

 &HT;    Technology gives girls heart-to-heart
 &HT;    By Dale Huffman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Melissa ``Missy'' House, born with a serious
heart malfunction, has lived a cautious, restricted life for her
nine years on this earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just hasn't had a girlfriend sleep over. She misses those
wonderful moments of giggles and girl talk,'' said Missy's mother,
Chris. ``She has kind of gone into a little shell lately. I hope
this helps her break out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to technology, Missy, who makes her home in Brookville,
Ohio, was hooked up Tuesday, via television, with a new friend in
Burlington, Vt., who is dealing with many of the same problems that
Missy faces every day.
</P>
<P>
   The medical telecommunications experiment brought Missy and her
mother and two sisters face-to-face on television with Haley
Bishop, 11, and her family in Vermont. The exchange of medical and
personal information took place on this end in the Center for
Interactive Learning on the campus of Sinclair Community College.
In Vermont, the Bishops were at the University of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at each other's image on the screen, the two young women
were a bit shy at first. By the time the hour-and-13-minute
conversation ended, there was bonding.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Missy learned that Haley slept with a
good-luck favorite blanket since birth, and has taken it to
hospitals with her when she had surgery. Haley learned that Missy
never parts with her good luck white teddy bear named Bund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haley is a very sweet and pretty girl,'' Missy said after the
conversation. ``I think we can be best friends. We seem to be a lot
alike.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart problem each of the young girls is fighting is called
Truncious Arteriousis,''The artery coming from the heart didn't
grow correctly and doesn't function effectively,'' said Chris
House. ``So, Missy had to undergo major surgery on three occasions.
We face infection and new problems every day.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Missy frequently wears a face mask to protect her
from germs when she ventures out. She is also home-schooled.
However, she is hooked up with classmates at Westbrook Elementary
School electronically, and every afternoon at 1:45 p.m. she clicks
on her computer and is able to interact with fellow students in
teacher Ricci Blair's social studies class.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a blessing,'' Mrs. House said. ``She can talk to the
kids and be a part of the classroom experience, even if it is an
electronic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Missy's father Michael, and her two sisters, April, 13. and
Rachel, 11, are supportive, her mother said. And the family lives
with hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great new things are happening in the field of medicine every
day,'' Mrs. House said. ``We pray that one day soon Missy will be
well enough to go safely out into the world and interact.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, thanks to the ever improving world of
technology, Missy saw the image of a young lady with blond hair
named Haley in far-off Vermont on a television screen. It was the
clear picture of someone in this world who mirrors Missy's own
fight, and who can become a soulmate in the battle of life.

 &HT;    Disorder causes inability to control mood
 &HT;    By Dr. Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ One of the most challenging, severe, difficult to
understand and manage of all of the variety of personality
disorders is borderline personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Like other personality disorders, the borderline personality
disorder is a chronic mental condition that affecting a person's
ability to function in everyday activities. It usually affects
one's work, family and social relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Many individuals have some of the traits and characteristics of
personality disorders. Burder to be labelity disorder these traits
must be pervasive (long-standing) and persistent. A correct
diagnosis is sometimes difficult and time-consuming and is usually
only given after examination by a mental-health professional.
During times of prolonged stress or during certain development
stages (especially adolescence),haracteristics are more intense and
problematic. Personality disorders often coexist with other mental
illnesses such as depression and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals with borderline personality disorder are often said
to be living on a psychological edge. They experience instability
in identity, moods and relationships. These individuals intensely
fear and frantically avoid real or imagined abandonment. Often
experiencing despondency, rage and fury, self-hatred, arrogance,
anxiety and uncertainty, thesens.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the above mentioned features, Those with borderline
personality disorder also exhibit feelings of emptiness, clingy
dependency and violent, often self-damaging impulses. They are
often said to be living in perpeanguish. Some mental-health
professionals have described this condition as a form of
``emotional hemophilia'' _ these individuals lack the psychological
clotting mechanisms that enable them to control feelings in a
healthy manner.
</P>
<P>
   Often they are described as being incapable of exhibiting in
moderate proport-- impulsive to the point of being self-damaging,
These individuals may exhibit impulsivity in spending and/or sexual
behavior, substance abuse, binge eating and other reckless
behaviors. They often engage in self-mut them difficult for other
people to deal with. At times, they have problems that manifest
themselves in such extreme ways as a temporary loss of feelings of
reality and/or severe disassociative symptoms. Transient
stress-related paranoia is also experienced by those suffering from
borderline personality disorder.
</P>
<P>

of the general population and impairments from this disorder and

in women than men and is more common among first-degree biological
relatives of those with the disorder. A high percent of these
individuals have beon to poor mood regulation and impulse control.
</P>
<P>
   Most borderline individuals come from parenting backgrounds that

 &HT;    Parenting guide's focus is young child
 &HT;    By Emily Rahimi
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you are sick of reading parenting books that
are peppered with lists and advice, Dr. Kyle Pruett has a solution.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest book, Me, Myself and I: How Children Build Their
Sense of Self (Goddard Press, $19.95), Pruett guides parents on how
to shape children from 18 months to 36 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moms and dads hardly have time to look at the labels in their
clothing, besides reading a textbook,'' he said. ``There is a lot
of science, but I disguise the fact.'' As a result, this book has
simple language and includes many examples to help parents
strengthen their relationships with their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of babyhood, where children become
themselves,'' said Pruett. Because most people do not have a memory
before the age of 5, many feel that this time is not significant in
a child's life. However, Pruett said this is not true. ``The first
years really last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a variety of people, including men, women, parents and
grandparents, find this book useful, as well as people who are
considering having children: ``It helps them think of whether they
are ready.''
</P>
<P>
   As a father of three ranging in age from 27 to 5 months, Pruett
has firsthand experience. Residing in Guilford, Conn., he has
practiced child and family psychiatry for more than 20 years,
working as a clinical professor of child psychiatry at Yale
University and writing for many parenting and family magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett also works with national agencies for the assistance of
young children. He is president of Zero to Three: National Center
for Infants, Toddlers and Families, an early-childhood development
``think tank,'' and a founding member of Father to Father, chaired
by Al Gore, which is a campaign to unite men in being positive
influences in children's lives. Additionally, he is a presidential
appointee and consultant to the Committee on Preschool Children of
the American Psychiatric Association.

 &HT;    Technology gives girls heart-to-heart
 &HT;    By Dale Huffman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Melissa ``Missy'' House, born with a serious
heart malfunction, has lived a cautious, restricted life for her
nine years on this earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just hasn't had a girlfriend sleep over. She misses those
wonderful moments of giggles and girl talk,'' said Missy's mother,
Chris. ``She has kind of gone into a little shell lately. I hope
this helps her break out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to technology, Missy, who makes her home in Brookville,
Ohio, was hooked up Tuesday, via television, with a new friend in
Burlington, Vt., who is dealing with many of the same problems that
Missy faces every day.
</P>
<P>
   The medical telecommunications experiment brought Missy and her
mother and two sisters face-to-face on television with Haley
Bishop, 11, and her family in Vermont. The exchange of medical and
personal information took place on this end in the Center for
Interactive Learning on the campus of Sinclair Community College.
In Vermont, the Bishops were at the University of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at each other's image on the screen, the two young women
were a bit shy at first. By the time the hour-and-13-minute
conversation ended, there was bonding.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Missy learned that Haley slept with a
good-luck favorite blanket since birth, and has taken it to
hospitals with her when she had surgery. Haley learned that Missy
never parts with her good luck white teddy bear named Bund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haley is a very sweet and pretty girl,'' Missy said after the
conversation. ``I think we can be best friends. We seem to be a lot
alike.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart problem each of the young girls is fighting is called
Truncious Arteriousis,''The artery coming from the heart didn't
grow correctly and doesn't function effectively,'' said Chris
House. ``So, Missy had to undergo major surgery on three occasions.
We face infection and new problems every day.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Missy frequently wears a face mask to protect her
from germs when she ventures out. She is also home-schooled.
However, she is hooked up with classmates at Westbrook Elementary
School electronically, and every afternoon at 1:45 p.m. she clicks
on her computer and is able to interact with fellow students in
teacher Ricci Blair's social studies class.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a blessing,'' Mrs. House said. ``She can talk to the
kids and be a part of the classroom experience, even if it is an
electronic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Missy's father Michael, and her two sisters, April, 13. and
Rachel, 11, are supportive, her mother said. And the family lives
with hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great new things are happening in the field of medicine every
day,'' Mrs. House said. ``We pray that one day soon Missy will be
well enough to go safely out into the world and interact.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, thanks to the ever improving world of
technology, Missy saw the image of a young lady with blond hair
named Haley in far-off Vermont on a television screen. It was the
clear picture of someone in this world who mirrors Missy's own
fight, and who can become a soulmate in the battle of life.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: One take this week.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>
<P>
   q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I still have a POW bracelet from the Vietnam War. I was
wondering if there was an address or phone number I could call so I
might locate the family of the soldier on my bracelet. I would like
to find out if he is still alive or was ever found, and would like
to return the bracelet to his family.
</P>
<P>
   A: A good place to start would be to call the National League of
POW/MIA Families in Washington, at 202-223-6846.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to know if there still are still world's fairs going
on. I haven't heard about any lately. If so, where's the next one
going to be, and when?
</P>
<P>
   A: Take heart, the world's fair is not an extinct species. A
world's fair, as defined by the World Book Encyclopedia, is ``an
international exposition that features exhibits dealing with
commerce, industry and science. Most fairs also offer entertainment
and cultural activities and promote tourism in a region or
country.'' World's fairs have been around awhile, the first one
having been held in London in 1851 and called the Great Exibition
of 1851.
</P>
<P>
   And while the word ``fair'' conjures up images of ferris wheels
and funnel cakes, world's fairs also have been the showcase for
some pretty impressive innovations. Alexander Graham Bell's
telephone was shown off publicly for one of the first times at
Philadelphia's Centennial Exposition in 1876, and early
automobiles, along with ice cream and iced tea, were on display at
St. Louis' 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Such notable
buildings as the Eiffel Tower and the Seattle Space Needle were
constructed for world's fairs as well.
</P>
<P>
   World's fairs are regulated by the Bureau of International
Expositions, who rule that only one major fair can be held per
decade. So, brush up on your German, for the next world's fair is
going to be next year in Hannover, Germany. Known as the Millenium
world's fair in the United States, Expo 2000 promises to be a
grandiose and impressive way to get the 21st century started.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming world's fair will focus on four basic components:
worldwide projects, national pavilions with focus on
man-nature-technology, a theme park, and cultural events.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you happen to have the address and phone number for the
Innocence Project?
</P>
<P>
   A: Innocence Project, according to its Web site, ``provides pro
bono legal assistance to inmates who are challenging their
convictions based on DNA testing of evidence, though clients must
obtain funding for testing.'' This organization, founded in 1992 by
well-known defense lawyer Barry Scheck, focuses on freeing people
who were incarcerated under suspicious or inadequate evidence.
Innocence Project is affiliated with the Benjamin N. Cardozo School
of Law, 55 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10003; telephone 212-790-0200.
And you can find it on the Internet at
www.yu.edu/cardozo/law/innocent.html
</P>
<P>
   Q: Buildings and homes used to come standard with lightning
rods. Are they still built in _ and do they work?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lightning rods no longer are standard on homes and buildings,
so these days, if you'd like one built into your house, you would
have to specially request it from your contractor.
</P>
<P>
   As for their effectiveness, Greg Forbes, severe weather expert
at The Weather Channel, they are only ``relatively'' effective.
Forbes explains that a lightning rod offers a 45-degree cone of
protection on either side of the rod. This cone of protection is
intended to divert the lightning. So, while they may offer some
assistance in a lightning storm, they are hardly a foolproof
measure against the wrath of Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   On an interesting note regarding lightning, Forbes notes that
not every lightning stroke is equally capable of producing a fire.
To have a good fire-starting lightning strike, the stroke itself
has to have a longer, more continuous current. So, while it pays to
be cautious during a lightning storm, not every stroke of lightning
is going to spark a towering inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the movie ``Selena,'' did Jennifer Lopez sing all the
songs herself or was that the real Selena's voice?
</P>
<P>
   A: The vocals you hear in the movie based on the life and early
death of tejano singer Selena are sung by none other than the real
Selena. Lopez, who played the title role in the 1997 movie, was
merely lypsynching the vocals, although she did perform all the
dancing herself. Now, Jennifer Lopez lypsynchs to no one. Having
just released an album of her own, she is poised to conquer the
music business after having already conquered the movie world.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Atlanta is going to have the NCAA Women's
Final four in 2003. How would I go about getting tickets for it?
</P>
<P>
   A: You'll have to wait until 2002 before you can even think
about it. However, keep your eye out throughout the tournament in
2002. During the commercial breaks of the televised games, look for
an address to which you can apply for tickets for the following
year. Before you can purchase any tickets you will have to apply
for them, so don't channel surf during commercials or you might
miss the address to send your application.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was watching a Fourth of July television music special and
couldn't help noticing the Washington Monument. I'm curious about
what they've done to it. It looks as though there are windows on
each level.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Washington Monument has been an icon of Americana for 110
years now. However, the wear and tear of being a national monument,
not to mention the extreme weather of Washington, D.C., have taken
a toll, and the windows you saw are the scaffolding in place until
restoration is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration, which should be finished sometime next year, is
being funded by the National Park Foundation and Target stores.
Among the many jobs are cleaning 59,000 square feet of interior
wall surface and sealing 500 feet of exterior and interior stone
cracks. Now that's housecleaning! For more information, write the
National Park Foundation, 1101 17th St. N.W., Washington D.C.
20036, or call 202-785-4500.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you provide some data on charter schools? What is their
legal tie to school boards? Which school standards do they have to
adhere to? Is the charter school program considered a success? Any
statistics on this experiment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The success of charter schools is hotly debated. Many studies
show that they offer a higher level of accountability and vitality
than other public schools, and put healthy pressure on entire
systems by offering parents a choice. Some in other states have
been failures, but the fact that some of these failures have been
shut down is cited by supporters as proof that charters work. When
is the last time you heard of a regular public school being shut
down because of failure?
</P>
<P>
   You can find statistics and studies on charter schools, which
are tax-supported schools that enjoy relative independence and
compete for students, on the Web. Two Web sites are
www.uscharterschools.org or www.ecs.org. Or you can contact
organizations such as the Center for School Change, Humphrey
Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota _
director Joe Nathan, 612-626-1834; jnathan(at)hhh.umn.edu _ or
Education Commission of the States, 707 17th St., No. 2700 Denver,
CO 80202; 303-299-3600; ecs(at)ecs.org
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, an estimatated 1,100 charter schools are operating
in 34 states that permit charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a ``lifetime learning credit''? I believe it may be a
tax deduction for money spent on continuing education. Does it
apply to individuals?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Lifetime Learning Credit can save you up to $1,000 a year
($2,000 after 2002) against what you owe in federal income taxes,
based on tuition and related expenses you have paid since June 30,
1998, at a wide range of eligible post-secondary schools. It is the
companion piece of a Clinton administration initiative called the
Hope tax credit, which borrowed its name and inspiration from
Georgia's HOPE scholarship, but has nothing to do with a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Hope tax credit of $1,500 is available only to
undergraduates who are enrolled at least half-time in an eligible
degree or certificate program. The Lifetime Learning Credit is less
restrictive _ though an individual can't get both at the same time.
So, yes, it applies to individuals and may be available for
continuing education expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Fats Domino? Has he retired? Is he still
alive?
</P>
<P>
   A: The famous, gravel-voiced rock pioneer is very much alive and
unretired. Famous as the piano playing singer of such '50's hits as
``Blueberry Hill'' and ``Ain't That a Shame,'' Domino is widely
respected as a true rock and roll pioneer and was inducted into the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fats Domino spends most of his time these days at his
home in New Orleans with his wife, Rosemary, he has been known to
make an appearance on occasion to tickle the ivories and vocalize
in public.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been watching the Women's World Cup, and I have two
questions. One, in the stats, what is a ``cap''? And what does FIFA
stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Good questions. The ``cap'' you refer to has to do with the
number of international games a player has played for the national
team. The term goes back several decades, originating from an
actual cap the players would wear, a different one for each
international game.
</P>
<P>
   As for FIFA, the letters stand for the Federation Internationale
de Football Association, or the International Football Association
to us Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If Bill Clinton were elected senator from Arkansas in 2002,
could the Senate refuse to seat him? Has any senator or
representative ever been refused a seat? If so, who and when, and
what were the circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Senate has the sole right to seat, unseat and punish its
own members. There have been 16 cases in which a newly elected
senator's right to take the oath of office has been challenged, and
three senators-elect have been excluded from membership, according
to Congressional Quarterly's Guide to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When senators-elect are being sworn in, the presiding officer,
acting on his own authority or in response to a motion, may ask a
challenged person to stand aside. The controversy usually is
referred to a Senate committee, which holds hearings and presents
its recommendations. The issue then is decided by a majority vote
of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifications for membership have been challenged on grounds of
citizenship, residence, loyalty, sanity, age, character, membership
in the Mormon church, and voting fraud. The three senators-elect
who were excluded were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Albert Gallatin (D-Pa.) in 1793, for insufficient years of
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   _ James Shields (D-Ill.) in 1849, for insufficient years of
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   _Phillip Thomas (D-Md.) in 1867, for having disloyally
encouraged his son to serve in the Confederate military.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1913, when the 17th Amendment to the Constitution gave
voters rather than state legislatures the right to choose senators,
seven senators-elect have been challenged _ four on grounds of
character, one on age, one on residence and one on voting fraud _
but none has been excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My question is, I often hear Delilah on an Atlanta radio
station in the evenings, but while traveling I've also heard her on
other stations. Where does she broadcast from, and how wide is her
syndication?
</P>
<P>
   A: The silky voiced evening DJ broadcasts out of Seattle. Since
she is syndicated on at least 160 radio stations there's a good
chance that wherever in the United States you may roam you'll be
able to find Delilah somewhere on the dial!

   A: You'll have to wait until 2002 before you can even think
about it. However, keep your eye out throughout the tournament in
2002. During the commercial breaks of the televised games, look for
an address to which you can apply for tickets for the following
year. Before you can purchase any tickets you will have to apply
for them, so don't channel surf during commercials or you might
miss the address to send your application.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was watching a Fourth of July television music special and
couldn't help noticing the Washington Monument. I'm curious about
what they've done to it. It looks as though there are windows on
each level.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Washington Monument has been an icon of Americana for 110
years now. However, the wear and tear of being a national monument,
not to mention the extreme weather of Washington, D.C., have taken
a toll, and the windows you saw are the scaffolding in place until
restoration is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration, which should be finished sometime next year, is
being funded by the National Park Foundation and Target stores.
Among the many jobs are cleaning 59,000 square feet of interior
wall surface and sealing 500 feet of exterior and interior stone
cracks. Now that's housecleaning! For more information, write the
National Park Foundation, 1101 17th St. N.W., Washington D.C.
20036, or call 202-785-4500.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you provide some data on charter schools? What is their
legal tie to school boards? Which school standards do they have to
adhere to? Is the charter school program considered a success? Any
statistics on this experiment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The success of charter schools is hotly debated. Many studies
show that they offer a higher level of accountability and vitality
than other public schools, and put healthy pressure on entire
systems by offering parents a choice. Some in other states have
been failures, but the fact that some of these failures have been
shut down is cited by supporters as proof that charters work. When
is the last time you heard of a regular public school being shut
down because of failure?
</P>
<P>
   You can find statistics and studies on charter schools, which
are tax-supported schools that enjoy relative independence and
compete for students, on the Web. Two Web sites are
www.uscharterschools.org or www.ecs.org. Or you can contact
organizations such as the Center for School Change, Humphrey
Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota _
director Joe Nathan, 612-626-1834; jnathan(at)hhh.umn.edu _ or
Education Commission of the States, 707 17th St., No. 2700 Denver,
CO 80202; 303-299-3600; ecs(at)ecs.org
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, an estimatated 1,100 charter schools are operating
in 34 states that permit charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a ``lifetime learning credit''? I believe it may be a
tax deduction for money spent on continuing education. Does it
apply to individuals?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Lifetime Learning Credit can save you up to $1,000 a year
($2,000 after 2002) against what you owe in federal income taxes,
based on tuition and related expenses you have paid since June 30,
1998, at a wide range of eligible post-secondary schools. It is the
companion piece of a Clinton administration initiative called the
Hope tax credit, which borrowed its name and inspiration from
Georgia's HOPE scholarship, but has nothing to do with a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Hope tax credit of $1,500 is available only to
undergraduates who are enrolled at least half-time in an eligible
degree or certificate program. The Lifetime Learning Credit is less
restrictive _ though an individual can't get both at the same time.
So, yes, it applies to individuals and may be available for
continuing education expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Fats Domino? Has he retired? Is he still
alive?
</P>
<P>
   A: The famous, gravel-voiced rock pioneer is very much alive and
unretired. Famous as the piano playing singer of such '50's hits as
``Blueberry Hill'' and ``Ain't That a Shame,'' Domino is widely
respected as a true rock and roll pioneer and was inducted into the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fats Domino spends most of his time these days at his
home in New Orleans with his wife, Rosemary, he has been known to
make an appearance on occasion to tickle the ivories and vocalize
in public.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been watching the Women's World Cup, and I have two
questions. One, in the stats, what is a ``cap''? And what does FIFA
stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Good questions. The ``cap'' you refer to has to do with the
number of international games a player has played for the national
team. The term goes back several decades, originating from an
actual cap the players would wear, a different one for each
international game.
</P>
<P>
   As for FIFA, the letters stand for the Federation Internationale
de Football Association, or the International Football Association
to us Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If Bill Clinton were elected senator from Arkansas in 2002,
could the Senate refuse to seat him? Has any senator or
representative ever been refused a seat? If so, who and when, and
what were the circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Senate has the sole right to seat, unseat and punish its
own members. There have been 16 cases in which a newly elected
senator's right to take the oath of office has been challenged, and
three senators-elect have been excluded from membership, according
to Congressional Quarterly's Guide to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When senators-elect are being sworn in, the presiding officer,
acting on his own authority or in response to a motion, may ask a
challenged person to stand aside. The controversy usually is
referred to a Senate committee, which holds hearings and presents
its recommendations. The issue then is decided by a majority vote
of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifications for membership have been challenged on grounds of
citizenship, residence, loyalty, sanity, age, character, membership
in the Mormon church, and voting fraud. The three senators-elect
who were excluded were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Albert Gallatin (D-Pa.) in 1793, for insufficient years of
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   _ James Shields (D-Ill.) in 1849, for insufficient years of
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   _Phillip Thomas (D-Md.) in 1867, for having disloyally
encouraged his son to serve in the Confederate military.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1913, when the 17th Amendment to the Constitution gave
voters rather than state legislatures the right to choose senators,
seven senators-elect have been challenged _ four on grounds of
character, one on age, one on residence and one on voting fraud _
but none has been excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My question is, I often hear Delilah on an Atlanta radio
station in the evenings, but while traveling I've also heard her on
other stations. Where does she broadcast from, and how wide is her
syndication?
</P>
<P>
   A: The silky voiced evening DJ broadcasts out of Seattle. Since
she is syndicated on at least 160 radio stations there's a good
chance that wherever in the United States you may roam you'll be
able to find Delilah somewhere on the dial!

 &HT;    CRAB CAKES: Fresh jumbo lump variety carries big price _ and
flavor
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If corn and tomatoes are synonymous with summer,
so is another uniquely American specialty _ crab cakes.
</P>
<P>
   That's because premium crab meat _ the hand-picked fresh crab
from the Chesapeake Bay blue crabs _ usually became available in
the rest of the country only after an East Coast Fourth of July
celebration that was traditionally a crab orgy.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Pesarek of Midwest Seafood, the area's major seafood
wholesaler, explains that after July 4, the pickers go to work
producing crab for more widespread distribution.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it was and still is, except for one difference: the
price. Fresh blue crab meat has always been expensive _ hey, you're
paying someone for the tedium of picking crabs _ but this year may
set a record.
</P>
<P>
   When fresh-picked (as opposed to pasteurized, or, heaven help
us, canned) crab arrives on schedule this weekend, the price of the
jumbo lump crab, with its big succulent chunks, will be $13.60 a
half pound retail. Yes, that's $27.20 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, buyers can set their sights a little lower and choose
backfin crab, a mixture of lumps and smaller pieces, for $9.60 a
half pound ($19.20 a pound) or select crab, which is just broken
bits and costs just $7.60 a half pound ($15.20).
</P>
<P>
   That's why few area restaurants feature crab cakes made with
jumbo lump crab. L'Auberge in Kettering, Ohio, is one. On a
year-round basis, chef Dieter Krug seeks out that premier crab from
sources from the Chesapeake and beyond. Jay's seafood restaurant in
the Oregon District uses Dungeness lump crab in its crab cakes.
Jonah crab, from Maine, is showing up elsewhere and is markedly
cheaper at $11.95 a pound retail. Many chefs resort to the cheaper
frozen Alaskan snow crab, which has a telltale stringiness.
</P>
<P>
   Other chefs are making fish cakes from salmon, tuna and even
swordfish, though those species are expensive, also. Scallop/crab
combinations, with contrasting textures, are very contemporary, and
chef Jonathan Beck at Thomato's makes a version that uses scallop
mousse as a binder for the crab.
</P>
<P>
   These all have their place, but for this moment in the year,
old-fashioned crab cakes are at the top of the dining list.
</P>
<P>
   I have been known to say, without a trace of modesty, that I
make the best crab cakes ever. My friends recently reminded me that
I do that only every five years or so. That has something to do
with the price. So, properly chastised, I will make them this
summer, no matter how much crab costs.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe is simple and that's part of its success. It takes
the barest minimum of crumbs _ we're talking just the crumbs of one
slice of bread, maybe 3 or 4 tablespoons, to a pound of crab. I
turn my nose up at recipes that call for a cup of crumbs to a pound
of crab. Egg and some mayonnaise hold these crab cakes together.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a fan of a lot of additions. At the price of premier
crab I want to taste crab, not green peppers or Thai-style
seasonings, which can overwhelm the more delicate flavor of crab. I
will tolerate a little Old Bay seasoning or a hint of
Worcestershire.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my recipe, which I picked up from a chef in Chincoteague,
Va., years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think I've forgotten something, note that the crab
cakes are not dredged in flour or coated with crumbs before they
are cooked. Chef Krug also cooks them ``au natural'' because, he
says, that showcases the big pieces of crab.
</P>
<P>
   ANN'S CRAB CAKES
</P>
<P>
   Makes 3 to 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh crab meat, either jumbo lump or backfin
</P>
<P>
   1 slice bread, crusts removed
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons mayonnaise (not low fat)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Pick over the crab to remove any bits of cartilage. Be careful
not to break up the big lumps.
</P>
<P>
   Run the bread through a food processor to make rough crumbs.
Blend the egg, mayonnaise, parsley and seasonings, and add the
crumbs. Gently fold in the crab. Shape into patties, either four
large ones or six smaller ones. Place in the refrigerator, covered,
until ready to cook.
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet heat the oil and butter, swirling to coat the
pan. When the fat is sizzling, pan fry the crab cakes for 3 to 4
minutes per side, until nicely browned.
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cracker crumbs, such as Saltines, can be substituted.
</P>
<P>
   Optional added ingredients: 1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning or 1
teaspoon Worcestershire sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving (based on four
cakes): 303 calories, 20 g fat, 170 mg cholesterol, 937 mg sodium.

 &HT;    Defining Flako
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ What about those flakes of ``crab'' sold in the
seafood departments of some supermarkets?
</P>
<P>
   Customers may call them crab. The industry calls them surimi.
And Jerry Pesarek of Midwest Seafood calls them ``Fako Flako.''
</P>
<P>
   They are made with bland white fish such as pollack, processed
with sweeteners and food coloring and a hint of crab. In some
versions, such as the preformed ``legs,'' which look rather like a
red coaxial cable, that hint of crab is mostly juice.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the flaked surimi is about $3.99, which is its
major attraction. It should never be used in crab cakes.

 &HT;    A crash course in American crabs
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The varieties of American crabs used in making
crab cakes include blue crab, Jonah crab, snow crab and sometimes
Dungeness crab. They vary in price, taste and season.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a rundown on availability, quality and price of various
crabs. Prices are quoted from Midwest Seafood's retail shop,
Springboro, Ohio. Your prices may vary.
</P>
<P>
   Blue crab: The source of the premier jumbo lump crab meat picked
from the hard-shell crab (also the source of soft-shelled crabs).
Harvested along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and heavily from the
Chesapeake Bay region, freshly picked crab meat is available
midsummer through August. Choices include ``jumbo lump crab'' at
$13.60 a half pound; ``backfin crab,'' which includes some lumps as
well as smaller pieces, for $9.60 a half pound; and ``special,''
which is just the small broken pieces, for $7.60 a half pound.
Pasteurized picked blue crab is another choice that reduces the
price about $5 a pound. Blue crab is also marketed canned but that
is not an acceptable choice for crab cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Jonah crab: Being marketed to chefs as an alternative to blue
crab, this is harvested in the Northeast, often attributed to
Maine. The flavor is very mild compared with blue crab. Available
fresh for $11.95 per pound.
</P>
<P>
   Snow crab: Harvested in Alaska in regulated catches, most snow
crab is frozen. Restaurants buy frozen picked meat in five-pound
blocks. Snow crab is easy to spot because of its thread-like
texture, and the flavor is sweeter than blue crab. It's $6.99 per
pound for a mixture of 40 percent leg meat and 60 percent body
meat; all leg meat is available for $18 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Dungeness crab: A declining harvest in the Northwest states has
driven the price up. These crabs, sold whole, are available fresh
from October to December, usually at $3 to $5 a pound. The flavor
is markedly different from other crabs. Five-pound bags of fresh or
frozen picked meat are marketed to the restaurants but can be
special-ordered retail. Live Dungeness crabs are available on
special order from California.
</P>
<P>
   Crabs that are not used for crab cakes include:
</P>
<P>
   King crab: Harvested in and near Alaska in regulated catches, it
is occasionally brought in fresh, but is primarily frozen on the
boats. The taste is very sweet. Price of the frozen legs ranges
from $9 to $12 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Stone crab: The claws of the Florida stone crab are harvested
September through March and are sold fresh. This is one crab that
doesn't freeze well. When frozen, the meat sticks to the shell, and
that's easy for consumers to spot. The taste is mild and sweet, but
not as sweet as the king crab.

   ASTHMA _ Puffy eyes, slumping shoulders, a headache and a
bulging vein on the right side of his head. When these telltale
signs appear in her oldest son, Danielle Geddis has learned to
expect the worst. It means an asthma attack is under way and
perhaps, another trip to the emergency room and three, four or
seven days at Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center. The last
four years, the 30-year-old mom has spent many days there while
intravenous drips and breathing devices settle her child's severely
inflammed lungs. Asthma affects African-Americans and lower-income
families disproportionately, probably because of less access to
health care. Programs are teaching families to manage asthma before
an emergency room visit becomes inevitable. (Guthrie, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS, FACT BOX.

   HEALTH-TECHFRIENDS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Melissa ``Missy'' House,
born with a serious heart malfunction, has lived a cautious,
restricted life for her nine years on this earth. ``She just hasn't
had a girlfriend sleep over. She misses those wonderful moments of
giggles and girl talk,'' said Missy's mother, Chris. ``She has kind
of gone into a little shell lately. I hope this helps her break
out.'' Thanks to technology, Missy, who makes her home in
Brookville, Ohio, was hooked up Tuesday, via television, with a new

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Are sprouts as nutritious as everyone says they are?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sprouts, which are simply germinated seeds and beans, include
the common alfalfa and mung bean sprouts, but also broccoli,
radish, soybean, pumpkin and others. Most sprouts are low in
calories (less than 30 in a whole cup), although soybean and wheat
sprouts are higher.
</P>
<P>
   In one-cup servings, all are good sources of vitamin C, and some
are good sources of the B vitamin folate. Only mung bean sprouts
contain a good amount of vitamin C in smaller quarter-cup portions,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Broccoli sprouts contain high levels of sulforaphane, a
phytochemical that stimulates body enzymes that detoxify
carcinogens (cancer-causing substances).
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, however, bacterial contamination of seeds
used in sprouting (mainly alfalfa sprouts) has caused food-borne
illness in almost 1,000 Americans. The Food and Drug Administration
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that people
with weaker immune systems (children, the elderly, those with HIV
or diabetes) should avoid alfalfa sprouts until safety improves.
</P>
<P>
   All sprouts should be rinsed thoroughly with water, without soap
or detergent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will eating a lot of carrots or drinking carrot juice for
vitamin A help to treat acne?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The beta-carotene in carrots and a variety of other deep
orange or green fruits and vegetables is converted to vitamin A in
the body, but it's not the vitamin A we eat that affects acne.
Retinol (a form of vitamin A) is used in a prescription medicine
called Retin A to treat acne, but it is applied directly to the
skin. Taking the medicine internally can be toxic.
</P>
<P>
   If the basic skin care program you follow is not controlling
your acne, see a dermatologist. On the other hand, do keep eating
those fruits and vegetables _ while there's no reason to expect
help for acne, there's strong research supporting a major role for
fruits and vegetables in helping to prevent cancer and heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Carrots are great, but be sure to eat a variety of other fruits
and vegetables, too, so you get the broadest array of the many
vitamins and phytochemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Most mornings instead of a traditional breakfast I have a
blenderized ``smoothie'' drink made from milk, yogurt, egg whites,
tofu, and bananas, flavored with sweet chocolate milk flavoring.
What's your evaluation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Use of raw egg whites is strongly discouraged now because of
the dangers of salmonella food poisoning from uncooked eggs. So I'd
omit the egg whites, or switch to pasteurized egg whites or frozen
egg substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, since these are all healthy foods, if your
smoothie drinks carry you through the morning with good energy,
that's fine. There's really no one food or meal that can define
healthy eating. What counts is how it works with what you eat the
rest of the day to meet your nutrient needs. Your drink recipe
provides plenty of dairy protein and calcium, so you don't need to
load up on lots of milk the rest of the day. On the other hand,
this meal provides no whole grain products for fiber. You should be
getting several servings of whole grains throughout the rest of the
day. And, of course, be sure to work in a variety of other fruits
and vegetables during the day, too.

   ASTHMA _ Puffy eyes, slumping shoulders, a headache and a
bulging vein on the right side of his head. When these telltale
signs appear in her oldest son, Danielle Geddis has learned to
expect the worst. It means an asthma attack is under way and
perhaps, another trip to the emergency room and three, four or
seven days at Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center. The last
four years, the 30-year-old mom has spent many days there while
intravenous drips and breathing devices settle her child's severely
inflammed lungs. Asthma affects African-Americans and lower-income
families disproportionately, probably because of less access to
health care. Programs are teaching families to manage asthma before
an emergency room visit becomes inevitable. (Guthrie, Atlanta

   Jack Jackson can't remember the last time he wrote a check and
hasn't spoken face to face with a bank teller in years. Jackson has
handled his personal banking online with Bank Boston since 1989,
and he expanded to online banking for his public relations business
three years ago.

   Although he experienced two instances of bank errors that cost
him several hours on the phone with customer service, that has not
deterred him from banking online. ``I think I've had to deal with

be exacerbated when they go online. It's definitely not for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   One big difference with many online banking accounts is that as
soon as you direct the bank to send out a payment from your
account, that money's gone. You can't mail out a $50 check and
figure that you can get to the bank to deposit the money to cover
the check before it's presented by the recipient's bank for
payment. But one thing online customers gain is convenience _ the
bank's always open for business.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Jackson was unusual. Although some of the
largest banks in the country, including Wells Fargo, Citibank and
Chase Manhattan, have offered their customers online bill-payment
options for nearly a decade, only during the last couple of years
have customers really started to warm to the idea of clicking on
the Send button at an online banking site.
</P>
<P>
   According to IDC, a market research firm in Framingham, Mass.,
the number of people in the United States participating in at least
one online banking function (like viewing deposits, transferring
money between accounts and paying bills) rose to 12.4 million in
1999 from 1.4 million in 1996. IDC expects that number to rise to
18.7 million by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts cite the widespread availability of
modem-equipped computers as one reason for the increase in online
banking activity. They add that people are also finally starting to
get comfortable with the notion that entering bank account
information online is no riskier than giving a credit card number
over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online trading has really made people aware of how to bank
online,'' said Mitch Caplan, president of Telebank, a phone- and
Internet-based bank. ``The security issues aren't really there any
more.'' But while online trading offers discount services, many
banks charge more for online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It has become much more convenient to pay bills and transfer
money to other accounts via computer because many banks are moving
their entire online consumer banking areas onto the Internet and
off private networks, which required the customer to use
communications software and a modem to dial directly into a
company's computer system.
</P>
<P>
   To pay bills online with Chase in 1994, for example, a customer
had to call Chase's customer service and order software disks for
logging onto a private network. Since Chase moved its online
banking functions to the Internet last February, online customers
have been able to gain access to their accounts from any PC with an
Internet connection by going to the bank's Web site and punching in
an identifying name and password.
</P>
<P>
   So what should you expect if you wean yourself from your
checkbook? Setting up access to your bank account via the Internet
is relatively simple. After securing your bank accounts with a
customer ID and a password, you enter the account numbers and
addresses of each company or person you pay regularly. As long as
you can provide that information, you can send payments to large
companies (like your cable and credit card companies) as well as to
individuals, like your piano teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks charge a monthly fee, usually $5 to $15, for
unlimited bill payments, but many are providing Internet banking
access and bill payments at no extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience of online banking has won some fans, like Lisa
and Alex Giassa of Teaneck, N.J., who have had an online account
since August 1998. ``It's definitely a convenience thing for us,''
Ms. Giassa said. ``If I know I have a bill due in a few days, I can
go upstairs, pay it in a couple of minutes and not deal with any
envelopes.''
</P>
<P>
   But lest you think that the click of a Send button will
instantaneously send off your son's college tuition payment on the
day it is due, think again. Only about half of electronic payments
are actually transmitted to recipients electronically. Many utility
companies and merchants are not set up to receive electronic
payments. Such companies are sent checks via regular mail _ an
annoying lesson for those who don't make allowances for the delayed
delivery and miss payment deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   And that delay brings up the question of the ``float'' and why
there's more of a float in electronic banking. In banking terms, a
float is the period between the time you issue a check and the time
it becomes available to the recipient. If you issue a check to an
out-of-state recipient, the money will not be credited to the
account of that company or person for up to five business days
after the check gets to the recipient's bank. A recipient in the
same state gets access to the money in up to three business days
after it is deposited, while someone with an account at the same
bank will get the money within one business day.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a regular checking account and issue a check, the
money won't be deducted until it is presented to your bank by the
recipient's bank for payment. But for many electronic accounts, the
bank automatically debits your online account soon after you hit
the button to instruct the bank to issue a check out of your
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The float is a big psychological issue for a lot of people,''
said Jim Bruene, editor of Online Banking Report, an industry
newsletter. ``The tighter someone's funds are, the more he or she
relies on it. None of this is very meaningful when you're making 2
percent interest on cash balances.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some organization _ sometimes a bank, sometimes a
check-processing company _ is able to hang onto your money for the
length of the float means that it can make money off your money, in
very short-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a payment is taken out of an online account right
away, that doesn't necessarily mean that the recipient of the money
is paid quickly. For example, Philip Goodman, a film and video
producer in Manhattan, paid a friend $25 out of his Chase Online
checking account. His checking account was debited quickly, but the
money did not show up in the recipient's account for three days,
Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's electronic, but it's not,'' he complained.
``They debit your account and then send a check. I can send a
check!''
</P>
<P>
   Most online banks use third-party check consolidators like
Checkfree to process the checks from online accounts, send them
along and disburse the money. In those cases, the bank pays
Checkfree the amount of the check, and Checkfree pays the company
or person receiving the check.
</P>
<P>
   If the check recipient is set up to receive payments
electronically, through a process known as electronic transfer, the
payments move through an automated clearing-house system within 24
hours, said Matthew Lewis, a senior vice president at Checkfree.
</P>
<P>
   But if the recipient is not set up to receive payments
electronically, Checkfree mails a check to the recipient's bank,
where it is processed in a transaction that can take up to five
business days if the payment crosses state lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is not sure about online banking's effect on
the float. ``We've tried to do what we can to manage float, but
whatever happens with the electronic technology is still an unknown
at this point,'' said Doug Tillet, a spokesman for the New York
Federal Reserve Bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Knowing that money is paid out of an account right away can help
online customers if they want to make last-minute electronic
payments, he added. If the recipient of a payment is set up to
receive electronic transfers, most online banking customers can
issue a payment at, say, 4:59 p.m. on the day the payment is due
and won't have to allow for mail delivery times.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bank Rate Monitor, an online service that tracks
interest rates for credit cards and personal loans offered by major
banks, at least 215 of the 350 largest Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.-insured banks in the country offer the ability to pay bills
electronically. But bill consolidators like Checkfree are also
providing electronic payment services to nontraditional banks on
the Internet, which means your choice of where on the Internet to
pay your bills is becoming a lot broader. Internet-only banks can
be a good choice for people who keep a lot of money in their
checking accounts because they generally pay higher interest, but
they also tend to charge higher fees for automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Personal and business financial software like Quicken and
Microsoft Money offer an electronic bill-paying option via
Checkfree. Customers can also use such software, which gives a user
an overall financial picture, with many types of online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bill payments, Checkfree and other consolidators,
like Transpoint and Cybercash, are also working with banks and
other financial sites to bring your bills and account information
to you online.
</P>
<P>
   With its E-card, First U.S.A., a leading credit card issuer,
offers customers online access to detailed information about their
credit card purchases as well as the ability to pay their bills
online. Many banks are finding ways to let customers see their
bills online as a way of offering better service than the
nontraditional banking competitors who are zeroing in on their
business.
</P>
<P>
   A type of bill-presentment service was recently announced by
Chase Manhattan Bank, First Union and Wells Fargo; they are forming
a new company that will enable people and businesses to both
receive and pay bills electronically. The company, called the
Exchange, will serve as an electronic hub that will allow companies
issuing bills to reach consumers through their financial
institutions. Consumers will be able to log on to their online
banking site and view lists of their outstanding bills, said Sharon
Osberg, executive vice president for financial services at Wells
Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   The three banks will have a customer base of 60 million and
almost 60,000 corporations, said Wendy Grover, a spokeswoman for
Wells Fargo. Ms. Osberg added that by the time the Exchange is
fully up and running next year, all electronic payments will be
settled on the day they are issued, effectively eliminating any
float.
</P>
<P>
   But whether an electronic overdue notice will be easier to
ignore than a piece of paper that says ``account past due'' in red
letters on it remains to be seen.

   NEW YORK _ Picture this. You're watching ``Friends'' on your new
interactive television and love the BCBG cropped pants Rachel is
wearing. You click on the pants with your remote, see a list of
what colors and sizes they come in and order them directly from
your screen.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the pants show up at your doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   With the touch of a button _ and without ever leaving your couch
_ you can dress just like some of the hottest stars on TV today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually happening today, very quietly,'' said Larry
Namer, chairman of Steeplechase Media, a Santa Monica, Calif.,
interactive television content developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Friday, if you have Web TV, or a PC with Web for Windows
and a TV tuner card, you can watch `Judge Judy' and interact with
the show. You can click on the chat button and get into the
Internet chat room and watch `Judge Judy' at the same time. You can
guess how Judy will decide the case, or get information on the
plaintiff. You can click on Judge Judy's book and order it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the clothes are not for sale, the technology is in
place to allow that, Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   While many people reject home shopping, he said, this will be
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   According to Namer, 1.1 million homes in America have the
capacity for interactive TV. Some 800,000 of them are Web TV homes.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 44 million home computer screens that don't show
TV. Web for Windows allows a computer to be a TV set too. Many
computers today are being sold with TV tuner cards that can turn
them into TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three years, tens of millions of homes will have
interactive TV ability,'' Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   A study released this month by Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting
Group concluded that by the year 2002, e-commerce sales will top
$1.1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   A few networks and TV producers are taking their first steps by
selling merchandise based on their TV characters on their own web
sites or by joining forces with another party.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling was the first to start selling from his shows on
a web site, asseenin.com, that went up last month. The site sells
props and clothing from three Spelling shows: ``Charmed,'' ``Any
Day Now'' and ``Seventh Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are able to scan rooms from the various
shows and see close-ups and descriptions if they click on
individual items, which they will be able to purchase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a browser clicks on Piper's wardrobe in
``Charmed,'' she is shown several looks, such as a blue tank, that
can be ordered through bloomingdales.com, or a purple cardigan sold
at saksincorporated.com. A pair of gray pants directs you to
Barneys New York's Manhattan store.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, items can be purchased only through manufacturers and
retailers, but eventually the site's creators hope to handle sales
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Stylebranding, a New York-based firm, has been
developing technology and fulfillment capabilities to sell
merchandise from TV shows. It has asked several apparel and
home-furnishings companies to supply their products, on
consignment, so they can be incorporated into the TV characters'
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise will then be sold from a web site that's in
development. It has been showing its concept to the networks and is
currently in talks with NBC, said Joan Abraham, president and
executive producer of Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The browser will be able to go into a character's closet on the
web site and see and buy different looks a particular character
might wear, even though the character doesn't necessarily wear them
on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to do this with established programming and new
programming,'' said Bill Liptack, media executive with
Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The company has developed TV pilots that have merchandising
opportunities, as well, and has been talking to companies about
sponsoring them.
</P>
<P>
   Stylebranding will offer back-end facilities through third-party
resources, providing e-commerce activity, including credit
checking, warehousing, picking, packing and custom shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Sami, vice president, business development for NBC,
said, ``We have been looking at a couple of programs currently and
looking at ways we might be able to identify certain products that
we think people would have an interest in. I don't think it will
happen in a full-scale fashion in September. We're hopeful we might
have one program in place by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March, NBC acquired a 19.9 percent interest in Valuevision,
the third largest TV shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been talking to them about creating a seamless loop
between their shopping network and their web site _ and in turn to
promote some of that through NBC,'' Sami said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a careful study and we're looking at
one or two programs that would kick this process off. I wouldn't
really want to use `Friends' as a testing ground. There are a
couple of reasons. One, we would be looking more toward shows we
totally own. `Will and Grace' could be one. And I really think soap
operas do lend themselves to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Daytime shows are a particularly good avenue for selling
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are extremely loyal and they like to connect with
their shows in many different ways. This is a continual story and
continual characters that our viewers know better than they know
their own families,'' said Sallie Schoneboom, director of media
relations for ABC Daytime.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network is in the early stages of exploring e-commerce
from its TV shows, a spokeswoman said. She noted that a line of
pajamas called Ism, based on ``Ally McBeal,'' is available at
Bloomingdale's, Jacobson's, Macy's East and Fred Segal.
</P>
<P>
   One company, TVstyle.com is already set up to sell merchandise
featured on major network shows.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Roderick, general merchandise manager of TVstyle.com., said
she's been working on the project for about 1 1/2 years, prior to
which she had her own wardrobe company, working with more than 40
TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go online in September to coincide with the television fall
season,'' Roderick said. Her company is putting the content
together with various studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are going to have equity in our company,'' she
said, but she couldn't divulge the name of the shows or studios
yet. There will be 20 shows involved in September, including
sitcoms and shows such as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Party
of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   A show's costume designer would select the wardrobe as usual,
then TVstyle.com would choose five to 10 items per week per show to
offer for sale on either a ``Friends'' web site or on the
TVstyle.com site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Jennifer Aniston wears a Calvin Klein dress that was
bought three or four months ago at Barneys. We go back to the
designer and place a purchase order _ and ask if they can recut and
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the deal is linking up sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a character is wearing a Banana Republic, a J. Crew _ or
anyone who has a very strong e-commerce site _ we will link those
items. So we will confirm, for example, that Chandler from
`Friends' is wearing a Banana Republic shirt and we will also send
viewers to the point-of-sale area at Banana Republic to order that
shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the consumer accept this new way of buying apparel, or
will she feel that the TV show is being compromised?
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics are changing dramatically. People are coming
of age today. You'll find broad consumer acceptance of interactive
selling of many different forms,'' said Michael McLaughlin, partner
at Deloitte &AMP; Touche. ``Five to seven years from now, TV will be
history. What we'll see is a leading-edge viewing medium _ a
TV/Internet hybrid through a web application.'' &QL;

yet. There will be 20 shows involved in September, including
sitcoms and shows such as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Party
of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   A show's costume designer would select the wardrobe as usual,
then TVstyle.com would choose five to 10 items per week per show to
offer for sale on either a ``Friends'' web site or on the
TVstyle.com site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Jennifer Aniston wears a Calvin Klein dress that was
bought three or four months ago at Barneys. We go back to the
designer and place a purchase order _ and ask if they can recut and
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the deal is linking up sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a character is wearing a Banana Republic, a J. Crew _ or
anyone who has a very strong e-commerce site _ we will link those
items. So we will confirm, for example, that Chandler from
`Friends' is wearing a Banana Republic shirt and we will also send
viewers to the point-of-sale area at Banana Republic to order that
shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the consumer accept this new way of buying apparel, or
will she feel that the TV show is being compromised?
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics are changing dramatically. People are coming
of age today. You'll find broad consumer acceptance of interactive
selling of many different forms,'' said Michael McLaughlin, partner
at Deloitte &AMP; Touche. ``Five to seven years from now, TV will be
history. What we'll see is a leading-edge viewing medium _ a
TV/Internet hybrid through a web application.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Critics have blamed Austin Powers for many things,
including an elusive sense of good taste. Now they can add one
more: That international man of mystery, now romping across the
nation's movie screens in one of the summer's blockbuster movies,
might singlehandedly be bringing psychedelia back to fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Groovy, baby.
</P>
<P>
   The way Lloyd Singer, president of ABS Allen Schwartz, sees it,
``Consumers needed the signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin Powers, he said, was that signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make the '60s Mod looks more mainstream,'' said
Singer, who increased offerings of psychedelic prints from 10 to 30
percent for fall/holiday selling, because of the movie's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ABS's other Austin Powers-inspired looks are aqua peasant
blouses and lace pants with bell flares.
</P>
<P>
   Singer isn't alone. Other fashion executives believe that
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' just might help raise
hemlines and further push hot pink and bright orange into pop
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion observers pointed out that the movie, which features
Heather Graham in such styles as HotPants, over-the-knee boots and
bright pink and orange micromini crocheted dresses, is a refreshing
departure after ``Elizabeth,'' ``Titanic'' and ``Shakespeare in
Love.'' Those films, said retailers, helped spur sales of romantic
styles, such as ruffled shirts, but the fashions were serious.
</P>
<P>
   The new Austin Powers movie is believed by Singer and others to
be much more of a fashion influence than the original film _
``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery'' _ which came out
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that movie was set in the '90s, and the parts that took
place in the '60s were handled differently than those in the
sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more in the world of pop art,'' said Deena Appel,
costume designer for both movies. ``There was a lot of vinyl.
Fashion was also doing a lot of vinyl.''
</P>
<P>
   Appel said she wanted the sequel to have an explosion of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can directly pluck everything out of the
film and wear it on the street, but we are becoming more
comfortable with color,'' Appel said. ``This is certainly the year
of pink.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail executives said they believe their consumers are relating
to the Austin Powers sequel _ at least as far as fashion is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about it is the optimism and the freshness that
people haven't seen in a while,'' said James Aguiar, fashion
director for women's ready-to-wear at Bergdorf Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't used to so much color. I think people won't be
as afraid of prints, and they won't be afraid of going around in
microminis. I went to the movie with a friend of mine, and she told
me it made her realize how boring we have become.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar said the movie has ``certainly helped'' push sales of
shift dresses by Girlfriend in Pucci-inspired prints and geometric
patterns. The dresses, which retail for $200, are ``blowing out,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar added that Voyage's brightly colored camisoles and
scarves, as well as its skirts, are also doing well. In addition,
he believes that the sequel could help push sales of crocheted
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the movie is definitely helping,'' said Ed Burstell,
general manager at Henri Bendel. ``It will push everything out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, attributed booming sales of Girlfriend's brightly
colored designs in part to the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will subliminally push the '60s and '70s trends,'' said
Kalman Ruttenstein, fashion director at Bloomingdale's, adding that
he liked the crochet dresses in the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short hemlines have been in the wind, and we are starting to
sell short right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, J.C. Penney's is working with several of its private
label suppliers to develop a junior line inspired by the film,
according to Robin Schuellein, the junior tops buyer. She said she
wants to develop a line of Hippie Chic clothing and plans to
promote it with images from the movie.

   NEW YORK _ Picture this. You're watching ``Friends'' on your new
interactive television and love the BCBG cropped pants Rachel is
wearing. You click on the pants with your remote, see a list of
what colors and sizes they come in and order them directly from
your screen.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the pants show up at your doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   With the touch of a button _ and without ever leaving your couch
_ you can dress just like some of the hottest stars on TV today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually happening today, very quietly,'' said Larry
Namer, chairman of Steeplechase Media, a Santa Monica, Calif.,
interactive television content developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Friday, if you have Web TV, or a PC with Web for Windows
and a TV tuner card, you can watch `Judge Judy' and interact with
the show. You can click on the chat button and get into the
Internet chat room and watch `Judge Judy' at the same time. You can
guess how Judy will decide the case, or get information on the
plaintiff. You can click on Judge Judy's book and order it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the clothes are not for sale, the technology is in
place to allow that, Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   While many people reject home shopping, he said, this will be
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   According to Namer, 1.1 million homes in America have the
capacity for interactive TV. Some 800,000 of them are Web TV homes.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 44 million home computer screens that don't show
TV. Web for Windows allows a computer to be a TV set too. Many
computers today are being sold with TV tuner cards that can turn
them into TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three years, tens of millions of homes will have
interactive TV ability,'' Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   A study released this month by Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting
Group concluded that by the year 2002, e-commerce sales will top
$1.1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   A few networks and TV producers are taking their first steps by
selling merchandise based on their TV characters on their own web
sites or by joining forces with another party.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling was the first to start selling from his shows on
a web site, asseenin.com, that went up last month. The site sells
props and clothing from three Spelling shows: ``Charmed,'' ``Any
Day Now'' and ``Seventh Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are able to scan rooms from the various
shows and see close-ups and descriptions if they click on
individual items, which they will be able to purchase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a browser clicks on Piper's wardrobe in
``Charmed,'' she is shown several looks, such as a blue tank, that
can be ordered through bloomingdales.com, or a purple cardigan sold
at saksincorporated.com. A pair of gray pants directs you to
Barneys New York's Manhattan store.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, items can be purchased only through manufacturers and
retailers, but eventually the site's creators hope to handle sales
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Stylebranding, a New York-based firm, has been
developing technology and fulfillment capabilities to sell
merchandise from TV shows. It has asked several apparel and
home-furnishings companies to supply their products, on
consignment, so they can be incorporated into the TV characters'
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise will then be sold from a web site that's in
development. It has been showing its concept to the networks and is
currently in talks with NBC, said Joan Abraham, president and
executive producer of Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The browser will be able to go into a character's closet on the
web site and see and buy different looks a particular character
might wear, even though the character doesn't necessarily wear them
on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to do this with established programming and new
programming,'' said Bill Liptack, media executive with
Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The company has developed TV pilots that have merchandising
opportunities, as well, and has been talking to companies about
sponsoring them.
</P>
<P>
   Stylebranding will offer back-end facilities through third-party
resources, providing e-commerce activity, including credit
checking, warehousing, picking, packing and custom shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Sami, vice president, business development for NBC,
said, ``We have been looking at a couple of programs currently and
looking at ways we might be able to identify certain products that
we think people would have an interest in. I don't think it will
happen in a full-scale fashion in September. We're hopeful we might
have one program in place by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March, NBC acquired a 19.9 percent interest in Valuevision,
the third largest TV shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been talking to them about creating a seamless loop
between their shopping network and their web site _ and in turn to
promote some of that through NBC,'' Sami said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a careful study and we're looking at
one or two programs that would kick this process off. I wouldn't
really want to use `Friends' as a testing ground. There are a
couple of reasons. One, we would be looking more toward shows we
totally own. `Will and Grace' could be one. And I really think soap
operas do lend themselves to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Daytime shows are a particularly good avenue for selling
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are extremely loyal and they like to connect with
their shows in many different ways. This is a continual story and
continual characters that our viewers know better than they know
their own families,'' said Sallie Schoneboom, director of media
relations for ABC Daytime.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network is in the early stages of exploring e-commerce
from its TV shows, a spokeswoman said. She noted that a line of
pajamas called Ism, based on ``Ally McBeal,'' is available at
Bloomingdale's, Jacobson's, Macy's East and Fred Segal.
</P>
<P>
   One company, TVstyle.com is already set up to sell merchandise
featured on major network shows.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Roderick, general merchandise manager of TVstyle.com., said
she's been working on the project for about 1 1/2 years, prior to
which she had her own wardrobe company, working with more than 40
TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go online in September to coincide with the television fall
season,'' Roderick said. Her company is putting the content
together with various studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are going to have equity in our company,'' she
said, but she couldn't divulge the name of the shows or studios
yet. There will be 20 shows involved in September, including
sitcoms and shows such as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Party
of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   A show's costume designer would select the wardrobe as usual,
then TVstyle.com would choose five to 10 items per week per show to
offer for sale on either a ``Friends'' web site or on the
TVstyle.com site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Jennifer Aniston wears a Calvin Klein dress that was
bought three or four months ago at Barneys. We go back to the
designer and place a purchase order _ and ask if they can recut and
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the deal is linking up sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a character is wearing a Banana Republic, a J. Crew _ or
anyone who has a very strong e-commerce site _ we will link those
items. So we will confirm, for example, that Chandler from
`Friends' is wearing a Banana Republic shirt and we will also send
viewers to the point-of-sale area at Banana Republic to order that
shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the consumer accept this new way of buying apparel, or
will she feel that the TV show is being compromised?
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics are changing dramatically. People are coming
of age today. You'll find broad consumer acceptance of interactive
selling of many different forms,'' said Michael McLaughlin, partner
at Deloitte &AMP; Touche. ``Five to seven years from now, TV will be
history. What we'll see is a leading-edge viewing medium _ a
TV/Internet hybrid through a web application.'' &QL;

the show. You can click on the chat button and get into the
Internet chat room and watch `Judge Judy' at the same time. You can
guess how Judy will decide the case, or get information on the
plaintiff. You can click on Judge Judy's book and order it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the clothes are not for sale, the technology is in
place to allow that, Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   While many people reject home shopping, he said, this will be
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   According to Namer, 1.1 million homes in America have the
capacity for interactive TV. Some 800,000 of them are Web TV homes.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 44 million home computer screens that don't show
TV. Web for Windows allows a computer to be a TV set too. Many
computers today are being sold with TV tuner cards that can turn
them into TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three years, tens of millions of homes will have
interactive TV ability,'' Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   A study released this month by Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting
Group concluded that by the year 2002, e-commerce sales will top
$1.1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   A few networks and TV producers are taking their first steps by
selling merchandise based on their TV characters on their own web
sites or by joining forces with another party.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling was the first to start selling from his shows on
a web site, asseenin.com, that went up last month. The site sells
props and clothing from three Spelling shows: ``Charmed,'' ``Any
Day Now'' and ``Seventh Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are able to scan rooms from the various
shows and see close-ups and descriptions if they click on
individual items, which they will be able to purchase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a browser clicks on Piper's wardrobe in
``Charmed,'' she is shown several looks, such as a blue tank, that
can be ordered through bloomingdales.com, or a purple cardigan sold
at saksincorporated.com. A pair of gray pants directs you to
Barneys New York's Manhattan store.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, items can be purchased only through manufacturers and
retailers, but eventually the site's creators hope to handle sales
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Stylebranding, a New York-based firm, has been
developing technology and fulfillment capabilities to sell
merchandise from TV shows. It has asked several apparel and
home-furnishings companies to supply their products, on
consignment, so they can be incorporated into the TV characters'
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise will then be sold from a web site that's in
development. It has been showing its concept to the networks and is
currently in talks with NBC, said Joan Abraham, president and
executive producer of Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The browser will be able to go into a character's closet on the
web site and see and buy different looks a particular character
might wear, even though the character doesn't necessarily wear them
on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to do this with established programming and new
programming,'' said Bill Liptack, media executive with
Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The company has developed TV pilots that have merchandising
opportunities, as well, and has been talking to companies about
sponsoring them.
</P>
<P>
   Stylebranding will offer back-end facilities through third-party
resources, providing e-commerce activity, including credit
checking, warehousing, picking, packing and custom shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Sami, vice president, business development for NBC,
said, ``We have been looking at a couple of programs currently and
looking at ways we might be able to identify certain products that
we think people would have an interest in. I don't think it will
happen in a full-scale fashion in September. We're hopeful we might
have one program in place by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March, NBC acquired a 19.9 percent interest in Valuevision,
the third largest TV shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been talking to them about creating a seamless loop
between their shopping network and their web site _ and in turn to
promote some of that through NBC,'' Sami said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a careful study and we're looking at
one or two programs that would kick this process off. I wouldn't
really want to use `Friends' as a testing ground. There are a
couple of reasons. One, we would be looking more toward shows we
totally own. `Will and Grace' could be one. And I really think soap
operas do lend themselves to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Daytime shows are a particularly good avenue for selling
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are extremely loyal and they like to connect with
their shows in many different ways. This is a continual story and
continual characters that our viewers know better than they know
their own families,'' said Sallie Schoneboom, director of media
relations for ABC Daytime.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network is in the early stages of exploring e-commerce
from its TV shows, a spokeswoman said. She noted that a line of
pajamas called Ism, based on ``Ally McBeal,'' is available at
Bloomingdale's, Jacobson's, Macy's East and Fred Segal.
</P>
<P>
   One company, TVstyle.com is already set up to sell merchandise
featured on major network shows.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Roderick, general merchandise manager of TVstyle.com., said
she's been working on the project for about 1 1/2 years, prior to
which she had her own wardrobe company, working with more than 40
TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go online in September to coincide with the television fall
season,'' Roderick said. Her company is putting the content
together with various studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are going to have equity in our company,'' she
said, but she couldn't divulge the name of the shows or studios
yet. There will be 20 shows involved in September, including
sitcoms and shows such as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Party
of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   A show's costume designer would select the wardrobe as usual,
then TVstyle.com would choose five to 10 items per week per show to
offer for sale on either a ``Friends'' web site or on the
TVstyle.com site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Jennifer Aniston wears a Calvin Klein dress that was
bought three or four months ago at Barneys. We go back to the
designer and place a purchase order _ and ask if they can recut and
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the deal is linking up sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a character is wearing a Banana Republic, a J. Crew _ or
anyone who has a very strong e-commerce site _ we will link those
items. So we will confirm, for example, that Chandler from
`Friends' is wearing a Banana Republic shirt and we will also send
viewers to the point-of-sale area at Banana Republic to order that
shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the consumer accept this new way of buying apparel, or
will she feel that the TV show is being compromised?
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics are changing dramatically. People are coming
of age today. You'll find broad consumer acceptance of interactive
selling of many different forms,'' said Michael McLaughlin, partner
at Deloitte &AMP; Touche. ``Five to seven years from now, TV will be
history. What we'll see is a leading-edge viewing medium _ a
TV/Internet hybrid through a web application.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Critics have blamed Austin Powers for many things,
including an elusive sense of good taste. Now they can add one
more: That international man of mystery, now romping across the
nation's movie screens in one of the summer's blockbuster movies,
might singlehandedly be bringing psychedelia back to fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Groovy, baby.
</P>
<P>
   The way Lloyd Singer, president of ABS Allen Schwartz, sees it,
``Consumers needed the signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin Powers, he said, was that signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make the '60s Mod looks more mainstream,'' said
Singer, who increased offerings of psychedelic prints from 10 to 30
percent for fall/holiday selling, because of the movie's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ABS's other Austin Powers-inspired looks are aqua peasant
blouses and lace pants with bell flares.
</P>
<P>
   Singer isn't alone. Other fashion executives believe that
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' just might help raise
hemlines and further push hot pink and bright orange into pop
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion observers pointed out that the movie, which features
Heather Graham in such styles as HotPants, over-the-knee boots and
bright pink and orange micromini crocheted dresses, is a refreshing
departure after ``Elizabeth,'' ``Titanic'' and ``Shakespeare in
Love.'' Those films, said retailers, helped spur sales of romantic
styles, such as ruffled shirts, but the fashions were serious.
</P>
<P>
   The new Austin Powers movie is believed by Singer and others to
be much more of a fashion influence than the original film _
``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery'' _ which came out
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that movie was set in the '90s, and the parts that took
place in the '60s were handled differently than those in the
sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more in the world of pop art,'' said Deena Appel,
costume designer for both movies. ``There was a lot of vinyl.
Fashion was also doing a lot of vinyl.''
</P>
<P>
   Appel said she wanted the sequel to have an explosion of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can directly pluck everything out of the
film and wear it on the street, but we are becoming more
comfortable with color,'' Appel said. ``This is certainly the year
of pink.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail executives said they believe their consumers are relating
to the Austin Powers sequel _ at least as far as fashion is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about it is the optimism and the freshness that
people haven't seen in a while,'' said James Aguiar, fashion
director for women's ready-to-wear at Bergdorf Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't used to so much color. I think people won't be
as afraid of prints, and they won't be afraid of going around in
microminis. I went to the movie with a friend of mine, and she told
me it made her realize how boring we have become.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar said the movie has ``certainly helped'' push sales of
shift dresses by Girlfriend in Pucci-inspired prints and geometric
patterns. The dresses, which retail for $200, are ``blowing out,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar added that Voyage's brightly colored camisoles and
scarves, as well as its skirts, are also doing well. In addition,
he believes that the sequel could help push sales of crocheted
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the movie is definitely helping,'' said Ed Burstell,
general manager at Henri Bendel. ``It will push everything out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, attributed booming sales of Girlfriend's brightly
colored designs in part to the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will subliminally push the '60s and '70s trends,'' said
Kalman Ruttenstein, fashion director at Bloomingdale's, adding that
he liked the crochet dresses in the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short hemlines have been in the wind, and we are starting to
sell short right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, J.C. Penney's is working with several of its private
label suppliers to develop a junior line inspired by the film,
according to Robin Schuellein, the junior tops buyer. She said she
wants to develop a line of Hippie Chic clothing and plans to
promote it with images from the movie.

IT'S THE LAND OF THE FREE (COMPUTER) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swept up in the phenomenal rush of the global Internet that it
helped create, the personal computer industry is undergoing a
fundamental transformation.
</P>
<P>
   The PC has become inextricably linked to the Internet, causing
the two formerly distinct businesses to blend. Several PC makers
have begun offering free Internet access as an inducement to sell
more machines, while several Internet service providers have begun
giving away computers, or subsidizing their purchase, to entice
more customers to sign up for online services.
</P>
<P>
   Still another group of companies has started giving computers to
customers who agree to look at online advertising. The companies
hope that they can attract advertisers who are trying to reach a
population that is spending less time in front of the TV and more
time in front of the PC.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer, which gained popular acceptance in the
1980s for its ability to perform a wide variety of business and
scientific tasks, is increasingly being recognized in the late
1990s as primarily a communications device that enables anyone to
send and receive e-mail, participate in discussion groups and
browse for information on the Internet's World Wide Web. Marketing
surveys confirm that Internet access is the main reason people buy
a PC today.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the PC is following the model of the cellular phone,
which is often given away or sold at low cost to customers who sign
up for service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the largest Internet service providers, America
Online's Compuserve unit, the Microsoft Network and Prodigy
Internet, now offer $400 rebate programs that cover at least part
of the cost of a new PC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several of the largest PC makers, including Compaq,
Dell and Gateway, are driving the cost of their basic computers
well below $1,000 and experimenting with free Internet access to
get more customers.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy, CompUSA, Microcenter and Circuit City are among the
large national retailers that are offering similar deals in
conjunction with Internet service contracts, making the cost of a
PC comparable to the cost of, say, a video cassette recorder.
During test marketing at some stores, they have offered weekend
specials: a PC for $400, with a $400 instant rebate. Circuit City
offered a bundle of a monitor and printer for $99 extra.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as a free lunch, of course, and caveats
abound in these new schemes. There are no complete PC systems
available for $400, and the PC's that come closest are typically
bare-bones machines with minimal features, dubious warranties and
limited free technical support. The offers typically do not apply
to Apple Macintosh computers or PC companion devices like the Palm
Pilot. The Internet service contracts require payments of $700 or
more over three years, and if the customer gets frustrated by the
quality of the PC or the Internet service during that time, three
years is a very long time to stew.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is no doubt that these programs make
owning a PC and getting connected to the Internet much less
expensive than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a customer can buy a $399 Emachines PC with
Compuserve software already installed, sign up for a three-year
Compuserve account at $21.95 a month and get a $400 rebate check
from America Online. The Emachines computer does not come with a
monitor, which adds $100 or so. And while Compuserve is owned by
America Online, it lacks the strong lineup of family and
child-friendly features that have made AOL the world's most popular
online service.
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy, once the largest online service in America before it
fell on hard times, this month announced a rebate plan with the
Best Buy Co., the country's largest consumer PC retail chain. A
customer who signs a three-year contract for Prodigy Internet
access at $19.95 a month will get a $400 rebate that can be applied
to the cost of any desktop or portable PC at Best Buy. A two-year
contract will get a $250 rebate; a one-year plan, $100.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Network, or MSN, is testing a $400 rebate plan in
15 Microcenter computer stores, and last weekend it conducted a
limited ``free PC'' test with Staples office products stores. Like
the others, MSN requires a three-year commitment at $19.95 a month.
Microcenter has a $449 PC, but it does not include a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq offers free Internet access with its Presario line of
home computers, including one model that costs $599 with a monitor,
through a rapidly growing Internet service company called Net Zero.
Net Zero requires customers to reveal personal information and to
agree to watch advertisements geared to their interests. Compaq
also offers Internet access under its own Compaq.net service for
prices starting at $11.99 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway offers one year of free Internet access with any machine
priced over $1,000 and is said to be negotiating to buy Earthlink,
a major Internet service company.
</P>
<P>
   Global demand remains strong for powerful and expensive PC's
that can perform complex operations like managing large customer
accounts, designing software or playing the latest
three-dimensional computer games. But in the past year, consumers
have come to see PC's _ especially those that cost less than $1,000
_ mainly as the boxes that say ``You've Got Mail!'' and allow them
to buy books, trade stocks and participate in electronic garage
sales and auctions without leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   Although low-cost PC's are not suitable for designing rocket
ships or playing the latest 3-D games, most are more than adequate
for handling simple applications like e-mail, Web browsing and
online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, PC's appealed mainly to consumers who were
technologically adept or brave enough to put up with such a
notoriously complex, frustrating and expensive device. The
penetration of PC's into American homes reached about 40 percent,
then stayed there for several years, suggesting that most people
who wanted a PC already had one.

   The Internet has changed the landscape. The superiority of
e-mail over postal mail for keeping in touch with friends and
family, coupled with the ubiquity of ``www'' Internet addresses on
television and in print advertisements, is piquing the interest of
many consumers who until now had resisted owning a computer. They
may still hate the idea of having a computer, but they love the
idea of being on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With their new ``free PC'' plans, the Internet companies are
hoping to reach many of the 45 million American households that
have lacked either the interest or the money to bring PC's into
their homes. The ``free Internet'' schemes of the PC makers are
heading toward the same goal from the opposite route.
</P>
<P>
   If the most optimistic forecasts come true, computers may soon
become as ubiquitous as telephones or television sets. For that to
happen, PC's are going to have to be as easy to use as telephones
and television sets, which is definitely not the case today.
</P>
<P>
   But the price is right, finally.

   NEW YORK _ Picture this. You're watching ``Friends'' on your new
interactive television and love the BCBG cropped pants Rachel is
wearing. You click on the pants with your remote, see a list of
what colors and sizes they come in and order them directly from
your screen.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the pants show up at your doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   With the touch of a button _ and without ever leaving your couch
_ you can dress just like some of the hottest stars on TV today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually happening today, very quietly,'' said Larry
Namer, chairman of Steeplechase Media, a Santa Monica, Calif.,
interactive television content developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Friday, if you have Web TV, or a PC with Web for Windows
and a TV tuner card, you can watch `Judge Judy' and interact with
the show. You can click on the chat button and get into the
Internet chat room and watch `Judge Judy' at the same time. You can
guess how Judy will decide the case, or get information on the
plaintiff. You can click on Judge Judy's book and order it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the clothes are not for sale, the technology is in
place to allow that, Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   While many people reject home shopping, he said, this will be
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   According to Namer, 1.1 million homes in America have the
capacity for interactive TV. Some 800,000 of them are Web TV homes.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 44 million home computer screens that don't show
TV. Web for Windows allows a computer to be a TV set too. Many
computers today are being sold with TV tuner cards that can turn
them into TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three years, tens of millions of homes will have
interactive TV ability,'' Namer said.
</P>
<P>
   A study released this month by Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting
Group concluded that by the year 2002, e-commerce sales will top
$1.1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   A few networks and TV producers are taking their first steps by
selling merchandise based on their TV characters on their own web
sites or by joining forces with another party.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling was the first to start selling from his shows on
a web site, asseenin.com, that went up last month. The site sells
props and clothing from three Spelling shows: ``Charmed,'' ``Any
Day Now'' and ``Seventh Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are able to scan rooms from the various
shows and see close-ups and descriptions if they click on
individual items, which they will be able to purchase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a browser clicks on Piper's wardrobe in
``Charmed,'' she is shown several looks, such as a blue tank, that
can be ordered through bloomingdales.com, or a purple cardigan sold
at saksincorporated.com. A pair of gray pants directs you to
Barneys New York's Manhattan store.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, items can be purchased only through manufacturers and
retailers, but eventually the site's creators hope to handle sales
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Stylebranding, a New York-based firm, has been
developing technology and fulfillment capabilities to sell
merchandise from TV shows. It has asked several apparel and
home-furnishings companies to supply their products, on
consignment, so they can be incorporated into the TV characters'
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise will then be sold from a web site that's in
development. It has been showing its concept to the networks and is
currently in talks with NBC, said Joan Abraham, president and
executive producer of Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The browser will be able to go into a character's closet on the
web site and see and buy different looks a particular character
might wear, even though the character doesn't necessarily wear them
on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to do this with established programming and new
programming,'' said Bill Liptack, media executive with
Stylebranding.
</P>
<P>
   The company has developed TV pilots that have merchandising
opportunities, as well, and has been talking to companies about
sponsoring them.
</P>
<P>
   Stylebranding will offer back-end facilities through third-party
resources, providing e-commerce activity, including credit
checking, warehousing, picking, packing and custom shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Sami, vice president, business development for NBC,
said, ``We have been looking at a couple of programs currently and
looking at ways we might be able to identify certain products that
we think people would have an interest in. I don't think it will
happen in a full-scale fashion in September. We're hopeful we might
have one program in place by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March, NBC acquired a 19.9 percent interest in Valuevision,
the third largest TV shopping network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been talking to them about creating a seamless loop
between their shopping network and their web site _ and in turn to
promote some of that through NBC,'' Sami said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a careful study and we're looking at
one or two programs that would kick this process off. I wouldn't
really want to use `Friends' as a testing ground. There are a
couple of reasons. One, we would be looking more toward shows we
totally own. `Will and Grace' could be one. And I really think soap
operas do lend themselves to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Daytime shows are a particularly good avenue for selling
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are extremely loyal and they like to connect with
their shows in many different ways. This is a continual story and
continual characters that our viewers know better than they know
their own families,'' said Sallie Schoneboom, director of media
relations for ABC Daytime.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network is in the early stages of exploring e-commerce
from its TV shows, a spokeswoman said. She noted that a line of
pajamas called Ism, based on ``Ally McBeal,'' is available at
Bloomingdale's, Jacobson's, Macy's East and Fred Segal.
</P>
<P>
   One company, TVstyle.com is already set up to sell merchandise
featured on major network shows.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Roderick, general merchandise manager of TVstyle.com., said
she's been working on the project for about 1 1/2 years, prior to
which she had her own wardrobe company, working with more than 40
TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go online in September to coincide with the television fall
season,'' Roderick said. Her company is putting the content
together with various studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios are going to have equity in our company,'' she
said, but she couldn't divulge the name of the shows or studios
yet. There will be 20 shows involved in September, including
sitcoms and shows such as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Party
of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   A show's costume designer would select the wardrobe as usual,
then TVstyle.com would choose five to 10 items per week per show to
offer for sale on either a ``Friends'' web site or on the
TVstyle.com site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Jennifer Aniston wears a Calvin Klein dress that was
bought three or four months ago at Barneys. We go back to the
designer and place a purchase order _ and ask if they can recut and
ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the deal is linking up sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a character is wearing a Banana Republic, a J. Crew _ or
anyone who has a very strong e-commerce site _ we will link those
items. So we will confirm, for example, that Chandler from
`Friends' is wearing a Banana Republic shirt and we will also send
viewers to the point-of-sale area at Banana Republic to order that
shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the consumer accept this new way of buying apparel, or
will she feel that the TV show is being compromised?
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics are changing dramatically. People are coming
of age today. You'll find broad consumer acceptance of interactive
selling of many different forms,'' said Michael McLaughlin, partner
at Deloitte &AMP; Touche. ``Five to seven years from now, TV will be
history. What we'll see is a leading-edge viewing medium _ a
TV/Internet hybrid through a web application.'' &QL;

 By ANNE D'INNOCENZIO 
 c.1999 Fairchild Publications  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Critics have blamed Austin Powers for many things,
including an elusive sense of good taste. Now they can add one
more: That international man of mystery, now romping across the
nation's movie screens in one of the summer's blockbuster movies,
might singlehandedly be bringing psychedelia back to fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Groovy, baby.
</P>
<P>
   The way Lloyd Singer, president of ABS Allen Schwartz, sees it,
``Consumers needed the signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin Powers, he said, was that signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make the '60s Mod looks more mainstream,'' said
Singer, who increased offerings of psychedelic prints from 10 to 30
percent for fall/holiday selling, because of the movie's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ABS's other Austin Powers-inspired looks are aqua peasant
blouses and lace pants with bell flares.
</P>
<P>
   Singer isn't alone. Other fashion executives believe that
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' just might help raise
hemlines and further push hot pink and bright orange into pop
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion observers pointed out that the movie, which features
Heather Graham in such styles as HotPants, over-the-knee boots and
bright pink and orange micromini crocheted dresses, is a refreshing
departure after ``Elizabeth,'' ``Titanic'' and ``Shakespeare in
Love.'' Those films, said retailers, helped spur sales of romantic
styles, such as ruffled shirts, but the fashions were serious.
</P>
<P>
   The new Austin Powers movie is believed by Singer and others to
be much more of a fashion influence than the original film _
``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery'' _ which came out
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that movie was set in the '90s, and the parts that took
place in the '60s were handled differently than those in the
sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more in the world of pop art,'' said Deena Appel,
costume designer for both movies. ``There was a lot of vinyl.
Fashion was also doing a lot of vinyl.''
</P>
<P>
   Appel said she wanted the sequel to have an explosion of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can directly pluck everything out of the
film and wear it on the street, but we are becoming more
comfortable with color,'' Appel said. ``This is certainly the year
of pink.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail executives said they believe their consumers are relating
to the Austin Powers sequel _ at least as far as fashion is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about it is the optimism and the freshness that
people haven't seen in a while,'' said James Aguiar, fashion
director for women's ready-to-wear at Bergdorf Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't used to so much color. I think people won't be
as afraid of prints, and they won't be afraid of going around in
microminis. I went to the movie with a friend of mine, and she told
me it made her realize how boring we have become.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar said the movie has ``certainly helped'' push sales of
shift dresses by Girlfriend in Pucci-inspired prints and geometric
patterns. The dresses, which retail for $200, are ``blowing out,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar added that Voyage's brightly colored camisoles and
scarves, as well as its skirts, are also doing well. In addition,
he believes that the sequel could help push sales of crocheted
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the movie is definitely helping,'' said Ed Burstell,
general manager at Henri Bendel. ``It will push everything out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, attributed booming sales of Girlfriend's brightly
colored designs in part to the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will subliminally push the '60s and '70s trends,'' said
Kalman Ruttenstein, fashion director at Bloomingdale's, adding that
he liked the crochet dresses in the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short hemlines have been in the wind, and we are starting to
sell short right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, J.C. Penney's is working with several of its private
label suppliers to develop a junior line inspired by the film,
according to Robin Schuellein, the junior tops buyer. She said she
wants to develop a line of Hippie Chic clothing and plans to
promote it with images from the movie.

   NEW YORK _ Critics have blamed Austin Powers for many things,
including an elusive sense of good taste. Now they can add one
more: That international man of mystery, now romping across the
nation's movie screens in one of the summer's blockbuster movies,
might singlehandedly be bringing psychedelia back to fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Groovy, baby.
</P>
<P>
   The way Lloyd Singer, president of ABS Allen Schwartz, sees it,
``Consumers needed the signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin Powers, he said, was that signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make the '60s Mod looks more mainstream,'' said
Singer, who increased offerings of psychedelic prints from 10 to 30
percent for fall/holiday selling, because of the movie's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ABS's other Austin Powers-inspired looks are aqua peasant
blouses and lace pants with bell flares.
</P>
<P>
   Singer isn't alone. Other fashion executives believe that
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' just might help raise
hemlines and further push hot pink and bright orange into pop
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion observers pointed out that the movie, which features
Heather Graham in such styles as HotPants, over-the-knee boots and
bright pink and orange micromini crocheted dresses, is a refreshing
departure after ``Elizabeth,'' ``Titanic'' and ``Shakespeare in
Love.'' Those films, said retailers, helped spur sales of romantic
styles, such as ruffled shirts, but the fashions were serious.
</P>
<P>
   The new Austin Powers movie is believed by Singer and others to
be much more of a fashion influence than the original film _
``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery'' _ which came out
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that movie was set in the '90s, and the parts that took
place in the '60s were handled differently than those in the
sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more in the world of pop art,'' said Deena Appel,
costume designer for both movies. ``There was a lot of vinyl.
Fashion was also doing a lot of vinyl.''
</P>
<P>
   Appel said she wanted the sequel to have an explosion of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can directly pluck everything out of the
film and wear it on the street, but we are becoming more
comfortable with color,'' Appel said. ``This is certainly the year
of pink.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail executives said they believe their consumers are relating
to the Austin Powers sequel _ at least as far as fashion is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about it is the optimism and the freshness that
people haven't seen in a while,'' said James Aguiar, fashion
director for women's ready-to-wear at Bergdorf Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't used to so much color. I think people won't be
as afraid of prints, and they won't be afraid of going around in
microminis. I went to the movie with a friend of mine, and she told
me it made her realize how boring we have become.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar said the movie has ``certainly helped'' push sales of
shift dresses by Girlfriend in Pucci-inspired prints and geometric
patterns. The dresses, which retail for $200, are ``blowing out,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aguiar added that Voyage's brightly colored camisoles and
scarves, as well as its skirts, are also doing well. In addition,
he believes that the sequel could help push sales of crocheted
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the movie is definitely helping,'' said Ed Burstell,
general manager at Henri Bendel. ``It will push everything out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, attributed booming sales of Girlfriend's brightly
colored designs in part to the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will subliminally push the '60s and '70s trends,'' said
Kalman Ruttenstein, fashion director at Bloomingdale's, adding that
he liked the crochet dresses in the Austin Powers sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short hemlines have been in the wind, and we are starting to
sell short right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, J.C. Penney's is working with several of its private
label suppliers to develop a junior line inspired by the film,
according to Robin Schuellein, the junior tops buyer. She said she
wants to develop a line of Hippie Chic clothing and plans to
promote it with images from the movie.

<P>
   About two weeks after Frank Keeney was first connected to cable
modem service in Pasadena, Calif., he discovered that along with
the delights of a 24-hour connection and high-speed Internet access
came the potential for big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to log in and found that someone had compromised my
computer,'' he recalled. ``When you log into a Linux system, it
will normally show a short message stating the last time logged in
and from where. Since I had not logged in for a week or so, I knew
there was trouble. I checked to see if someone else was online and,
sure enough, he was on at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to kill his log-in session, but it was too late. He
had already issued the command to erase every file on the computer.
I watched while he erased everything on my hard drive.'`
</P>
<P>
   Keeney's experience is not isolated, several computer security
experts said. The shift from dial-up Internet connections to cable
modems and DSL (digital subscriber lines _ fast, constant links to
the Net that use telephone lines) are making home computer users
vulnerable to the types of attacks from hackers that in the past
were almost exclusively a worry for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people aren't thinking at this level yet,'' said
Christopher Klaus, chief technology officer for Internet Security
Systems, an Atlanta-based maker of complex security analysis
software used by large corporations. ``Service providers are
looking at trying to put as many people on the Internet as
possible. The more security isn't brought up as an issue, the
greater the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable modems and DSL lines are presenting two new problems for
ordinary residential users. The biggest source of trouble comes
simply because these lines mean that users are constantly connected
to the Net, so their computers are always potential targets of
hackers..
</P>
<P>
   The second problem has to do with the types of connections used
by faster lines. Communications between computers on the Internet
rely on a series of numbers known as IP, or Internet protocol,
addresses. For dial-up users, those addresses are constantly
shifting, making them their computers elusive targets. While it can
be a nuisance to dial in to reach the Net every time you want to
check your e-mail, the practice automatically provides its own
measure of security.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately the protection afforded by the dial-up shell game
largely or completely vanishes with cable modems or DSL lines.
Because their customers don't flit on and off the Net, many high
speed service operators give them fixed IP addresses.
</P>
<P>
   While they may not be publicizing their new services' security
problems with the vigor they bring to boasting about the more
desirable features, cable modem and DSL providers acknowledge that
their residential customers are facing new kinds of security woes _
even if personal computers, of course, are less likely to be the
targets of hackers than are corporate or government systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are today, from a consumer standpoint, is where
companies were back in the late '80s, when firewalls weren't a big
issue,'' said Kevin McElearney, vice president of network support
services at Road Runner, a cable modem partnership that includes
Time Warner Entertainment, the Mediaone Group, Microsoft, Compaq
and Advance/Newhouse. Residential customers using high-speed
services, he said, ``are in an environment where they have to
realize that there are security issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your risk is increased the longer you leave any computer
connected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning together in this new world of always being
online in the home,'' said Jeff Waldhuter, director of technology
and engineering at Bell Atlantic Science and Technology Center, the
research branch of the telephone company and DSL service provider.
``Now that we're getting on with these connections, we're learning
that we have to add more security. We're growing up. These networks
are going to be vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to the always-connected world seems to have come at a
somewhat inopportune time. Internet Security Systems has been
tracking a ``dramatic increase'' in the use of a hacking technique
known variously as probing, sniffing or scanning, Klaus said.
Probing software automatically scans computers connected to the
Internet and evaluates the level of their security protection,
looking for weak systems vulnerable to easy attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon to have someone twist the doorknob of your
home computer,'' McElearney said.
</P>
<P>
   For probers, a typical home computer running Apple's Mac OS or
Windows 95 or 98 without the maker's latest security updates or
additional security software is the closest thing to an unlocked
door they are likely to find.
</P>
<P>
   After his hard drive disaster, Keeney installed security
software on his computer in Pasedena that tracks and records
break-in attempts by probing software. He has found that unwanted
visitors test his computer's security about twice a day. ``Most
computers on cable modems will be probed,'' he said. ``If
weaknesses are found, someone will exploit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike people who create and spread viruses or worms, probers
don't need the computer's owner to advance their cause
inadvertently by, say, opening a tainted e-mail attachment. For
them, an insecure system offers seemingly endless potential.
Keeney's hard drive crash is an extreme example of what hackers can
do once inside a computer. But others can cause just as much harm
even though they come and go without leaving an immediate trace.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Sullivan said, once hackers gain entry they
can extract credit card numbers from stored files, read e-mail,
copy files, send e-mail over your name _ ``in short, just about
anything,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most cable and DSL modems also make it easier for hackers to go
after specific computers.
</P>
<P>
   In dial-up systems, the addresses belong to the service
provider's modems, rather than to its customers. When customers
dial in for a connection, each one gets an IP address of the modem
reached for that session; each modem is associated with a finite
number of IP addresses. The next time the computer may well connect
with another modem and get another address, particularly if the
customer has a large service provider operating huge banks of
modems. ``To some extent that's security through obscurity,''
McElearney said.
</P>
<P>
   For cable-modem and DSL customers, not only are their addresses
fixed, they are also often easy to learn. The addresses appear in
the headers (which usually aren't displayed) that travel with every
e-mail message or newsgroup posting customers send.
</P>
<P>
   Many service providers have begun to respond to the problem.
Some, including Road Runner, are introducing a system that
regularly rotates their customers' IP addresses. Addresses based on
this system, however, may not change for several days and will
still appear in the headers.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus is also distressed about one unintended side effect of the
steep decline in computer prices. Inexpensive PCs increasingly mean
that some families now own several computers, all of which can be
serviced by a single high-speed line. To take advantage of that,
some people are setting up mini-networks in their homes, with one
computer acting as the go-between to the Internet for all the
others.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy server software that makes that possible, however,
often has very flawed security measures, Klaus said. To obscure
their identities, sophisticated hackers will first log into a home
network software before launching an attack against their ultimate
target. Junk-mail spammers can resort to the same trick. In either
case, the result can be highly embarrassing for the unsuspecting
home network owner, who will appear to be the originator of the
hacking or spam.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there is not a straightforward answer to the question
of how to guarantee security while enjoying high-speed Internet
connections. For Larry Rogers, who tracks Internet security
problems at Carnegie Mellon University's CERT Coordination Center,
part of the solution is simply hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with these connections need to play systems
administrator,'' he said. ``It's a matter of vigilance.''
</P>
<P>
   That vigilance can include something as simple as having Windows
users make sure that Network Neighborhood _ a file-sharing system _
is turned off. Rogers also suggested steps like regularly
downloading software security patches from Microsoft's Web site or
modifying arcane portions of the operating system. Not
surprisingly, these are just the kind of housekeeping tasks that
many users somehow never get around to.
</P>
<P>
   Some software companies are offering their help. In May,
Sybergen Networks (www.sygate.com), which mostly makes corporate
security protection software, introduced a $29.95 software package
for home users called Syshield. Similar products include Conseal
Private Desktop by Signal 9 Solutions (www.signal9.com).
</P>
<P>
   Such software generally blocks the computer from receiving some
types of data, limiting the paths in for hacker. Syshield can also
be set up to in effect disconnect the computer from the Internet
late at night.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate protection is that now used by Keeney, who has
become a computer-security consultant since his 1997 attack. He has
copied, on a much smaller scale, the system used by most
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   All his Internet business now runs on a network with a single
computer operating as a firewall and using the Linux software
system. Because it is difficult for hackers to get past the
firewall computer in such set-ups, that computer acts as a
sacrificial lamb of sorts. Keeney freely admits, however, that most
home users are unlikely to adopt such a complex setup.
</P>
<P>
   If the speculation in the industry is correct, they may never
have to. Many believe that ``security appliances'' _ extremely
stripped-down computers with security software that sit between
another computer and its Internet connection _ may eventually hit
the consumer market. Such systems for business users are already
available.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, another answer would simply be to put up with the
slow speeds and petty annoyances of a dial-in modem. But for anyone
but the more basic e-mail user, Klaus does not think that is a
great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many benefits that outweigh the security risks,
provided you take precautions,'' he said. To prove his point, Klaus
added that he was now shopping for cable modem service for his
home.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ It is summertime in Russia, and the temperatures and
paranoia
</P>
<P>
   are rising.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is famous for surviving its long, frigid winters. Perhaps
there
</P>
<P>
   is something about the short, intense summers _ this one is
among the
</P>
<P>
   hottest on record, with highs in the 90's _ that nourishes
political
</P>
<P>
   dread and speculations of calamity.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Communist lawmakers have holed up in the Duma, the
lower
</P>
<P>
   house of parliament, daring not to take their summer vacations.
Parliament
</P>
<P>
   is in recess, but about 30 Communist deputies continue to work.
</P>
<P>
   They are convinced that the rumors swirling around Moscow in
recent
</P>
<P>
   weeks are true: President Boris Yeltsin has a secret plan to
declare
</P>
<P>
   himself president for life, abolish the Communist Party and
whisk the
</P>
<P>
   embalmed body of Vladimir Lenin out of his tomb on Red Square
and into a
</P>
<P>
   hole in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the ailing Yeltsin himself is on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists, who control the largest number of seats in the
Duma,
</P>
<P>
   are not taking any chances. They expect a ploy by Yeltsin to
attempt to keep them off the ballot in legislative elections
scheduled for December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is difficult,'' said Valentina Chistyoklina, a
</P>
<P>
   spokeswoman for party leader Gennady Zyuganov. ``And if it
becomes critical,
</P>
<P>
   they can (be here) and make decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   After all no one knows better than the Communists that August
has
</P>
<P>
   tended to be a month of action in Moscow in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   It was August 1991, in the twilight of the Soviet Union, when
</P>
<P>
   Communist hard-liners tried to oust Mikhail Gorbachev while he
was on a
</P>
<P>
   seaside holiday. And last August, a vacationing Yeltsin
unexpectedly sacked
</P>
<P>
   his prime minister and further inflamed the country's economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   'Tis the season of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moscow is filled with alarming rumors and expectations,'' said
Andrei
</P>
<P>
   Piontkovsky, a political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them may even be true.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly out of the blue, the Kremlin has begun pushing a plan
to
</P>
<P>
   create a union with neighboring Belarus, a former Soviet
republic to the
</P>
<P>
   west. Some analysts believe it is all part of a grand plan by
Yeltsin and
</P>
<P>
   his inner circle to rewrite the Constitution and find a way to
extend his
</P>
<P>
   rule to a third term.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent editorial, the English-language Moscow Times accused
Yeltsin
</P>
<P>
   of ``actively scheming to become dictator-for-life.''
</P>
<P>
   While the buzz has politicians quaking and pundits speculating,
the
</P>
<P>
   country remains, by and large, unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   Regular Muscovites are simply trying to beat the heat by
swimming in
</P>
<P>
   local ponds or sipping beer under shade trees. McDonald's
restaurants are
</P>
<P>
   packed with schoolkids on their summer break. MTV Russia is
highlighting
</P>
<P>
   how-to programs on water sports this month.
</P>
<P>
   But however different these Western touches make Russia look
compared
</P>
<P>
   to its Soviet past, politics in the capital remains shrouded in
intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin may call Russia a democracy, but most people believe
in due
</P>
<P>
   course that Yeltsin would find a way to remain in power if he
could.
</P>
<P>
   I recently had lunch with two officials of the Russian foreign
</P>
<P>
   ministry. I was trying to catch up with Russian affairs after
more than two
</P>
<P>
   months away covering the Kosovo war. I asked them who they
thought would
</P>
<P>
   win the presidential elections scheduled for July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean, IF there are elections,'' they replied in unison.
</P>
<P>
   No one is taking free elections for granted. Russians are
prepared for
</P>
<P>
   them not to happen.
</P>
<P>
   In a newspaper interview last week before he left for vacation,
Yeltsin
</P>
<P>
   denied any plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Communists have banned themselves on their own.
They have
</P>
<P>
   failed politically. They are losing chances of winning elections
and of
</P>
<P>
   course are in need of scandals and would like to provoke the
president into
</P>
<P>
   a fight,'' he told the daily Izvestia.
</P>
<P>
   But who is scared of whom?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin left last weekend on vacation, but not to the Karelia
forest on
</P>
<P>
   the border with Finland as he had planned. Rather, he went to
his country
</P>
<P>
   retreat at Rus, only about 50 miles from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin explained that the change of plans was due to
forecasts of
</P>
<P>
   colder than expected weather in the northern forest.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts speculate that Yeltsin's plans changed in
order to
</P>
<P>
   remain close to the capital, in case things get too hot in
Moscow.

</P>
<P>
   hole in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the ailing Yeltsin himself is on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists, who control the largest number of seats in the
Duma,
</P>
<P>
   are not taking any chances. They expect a ploy by Yeltsin to
attempt to keep them off the ballot in legislative elections
scheduled for December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is difficult,'' said Valentina Chistyoklina, a
</P>
<P>
   spokeswoman for party leader Gennady Zyuganov. ``And if it
becomes critical,
</P>
<P>
   they can (be here) and make decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   After all no one knows better than the Communists that August
has
</P>
<P>
   tended to be a month of action in Moscow in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   It was August 1991, in the twilight of the Soviet Union, when
</P>
<P>
   Communist hard-liners tried to oust Mikhail Gorbachev while he
was on a
</P>
<P>
   seaside holiday. And last August, a vacationing Yeltsin
unexpectedly sacked
</P>
<P>
   his prime minister and further inflamed the country's economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   'Tis the season of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moscow is filled with alarming rumors and expectations,'' said
Andrei
</P>
<P>
   Piontkovsky, a political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them may even be true.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly out of the blue, the Kremlin has begun pushing a plan
to
</P>
<P>
   create a union with neighboring Belarus, a former Soviet
republic to the
</P>
<P>
   west. Some analysts believe it is all part of a grand plan by
Yeltsin and
</P>
<P>
   his inner circle to rewrite the Constitution and find a way to
extend his
</P>
<P>
   rule to a third term.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent editorial, the English-language Moscow Times accused
Yeltsin
</P>
<P>
   of ``actively scheming to become dictator-for-life.''
</P>
<P>
   While the buzz has politicians quaking and pundits speculating,
the
</P>
<P>
   country remains, by and large, unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   Regular Muscovites are simply trying to beat the heat by
swimming in
</P>
<P>
   local ponds or sipping beer under shade trees. McDonald's
restaurants are
</P>
<P>
   packed with schoolkids on their summer break. MTV Russia is
highlighting
</P>
<P>
   how-to programs on water sports this month.
</P>
<P>
   But however different these Western touches make Russia look
compared
</P>
<P>
   to its Soviet past, politics in the capital remains shrouded in
intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin may call Russia a democracy, but most people believe
in due
</P>
<P>
   course that Yeltsin would find a way to remain in power if he
could.
</P>
<P>
   I recently had lunch with two officials of the Russian foreign
</P>
<P>
   ministry. I was trying to catch up with Russian affairs after
more than two
</P>
<P>
   months away covering the Kosovo war. I asked them who they
thought would
</P>
<P>
   win the presidential elections scheduled for July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean, IF there are elections,'' they replied in unison.
</P>
<P>
   No one is taking free elections for granted. Russians are
prepared for
</P>
<P>
   them not to happen.
</P>
<P>
   In a newspaper interview last week before he left for vacation,
Yeltsin
</P>
<P>
   denied any plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Communists have banned themselves on their own.
They have
</P>
<P>
   failed politically. They are losing chances of winning elections
and of
</P>
<P>
   course are in need of scandals and would like to provoke the
president into
</P>
<P>
   a fight,'' he told the daily Izvestia.
</P>
<P>
   But who is scared of whom?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin left last weekend on vacation, but not to the Karelia
forest on
</P>
<P>
   the border with Finland as he had planned. Rather, he went to
his country
</P>
<P>
   retreat at Rus, only about 50 miles from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin explained that the change of plans was due to
forecasts of
</P>
<P>
   colder than expected weather in the northern forest.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts speculate that Yeltsin's plans changed in
order to
</P>
<P>
   remain close to the capital, in case things get too hot in
Moscow.

UNDATED: payment deadlines.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And that delay brings up the question of the ``float'' and why
there's more of a float in electronic banking. In banking terms, a
float is the period between the time you issue a check and the time
it becomes available to the recipient. If you issue a check to an
out-of-state recipient, the money will not be credited to the
account of that company or person for up to five business days
after the check gets to the recipient's bank. A recipient in the
same state gets access to the money in up to three business days
after it is deposited, while someone with an account at the same
bank will get the money within one business day.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a regular checking account and issue a check, the
money won't be deducted until it is presented to your bank by the
recipient's bank for payment. But for many electronic accounts, the
bank automatically debits your online account soon after you hit
the button to instruct the bank to issue a check out of your
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The float is a big psychological issue for a lot of people,''
said Jim Bruene, editor of Online Banking Report, an industry
newsletter. ``The tighter someone's funds are, the more he or she
relies on it. None of this is very meaningful when you're making 2
percent interest on cash balances.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some organization _ sometimes a bank, sometimes a
check-processing company _ is able to hang onto your money for the
length of the float means that it can make money off your money, in
very short-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a payment is taken out of an online account right
away, that doesn't necessarily mean that the recipient of the money
is paid quickly. For example, Philip Goodman, a film and video
producer in Manhattan, paid a friend $25 out of his Chase Online
checking account. His checking account was debited quickly, but the
money did not show up in the recipient's account for three days,
Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's electronic, but it's not,'' he complained.
``They debit your account and then send a check. I can send a
check!''
</P>
<P>
   Most online banks use third-party check consolidators like
Checkfree to process the checks from online accounts, send them
along and disburse the money. In those cases, the bank pays
Checkfree the amount of the check, and Checkfree pays the company
or person receiving the check.
</P>
<P>
   If the check recipient is set up to receive payments
electronically, through a process known as electronic transfer, the
payments move through an automated clearing-house system within 24
hours, said Matthew Lewis, a senior vice president at Checkfree.
</P>
<P>
   But if the recipient is not set up to receive payments
electronically, Checkfree mails a check to the recipient's bank,
where it is processed in a transaction that can take up to five
business days if the payment crosses state lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is not sure about online banking's effect on
the float. ``We've tried to do what we can to manage float, but
whatever happens with the electronic technology is still an unknown
at this point,'' said Doug Tillet, a spokesman for the New York
Federal Reserve Bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Knowing that money is paid out of an account right away can help
online customers if they want to make last-minute electronic
payments, he added. If the recipient of a payment is set up to
receive electronic transfers, most online banking customers can
issue a payment at, say, 4:59 p.m. on the day the payment is due
and won't have to allow for mail delivery times.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bank Rate Monitor, an online service that tracks
interest rates for credit cards and personal loans offered by major
banks, at least 215 of the 350 largest Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.-insured banks in the country offer the ability to pay bills
electronically. But bill consolidators like Checkfree are also
providing electronic payment services to nontraditional banks on
the Internet, which means your choice of where on the Internet to
pay your bills is becoming a lot broader. Internet-only banks can
be a good choice for people who keep a lot of money in their
checking accounts because they generally pay higher interest, but
they also tend to charge higher fees for automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Personal and business financial software like Quicken and
Microsoft Money offer an electronic bill-paying option via
Checkfree. Customers can also use such software, which gives a user
an overall financial picture, with many types of online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bill payments, Checkfree and other consolidators,
like Transpoint and Cybercash, are also working with banks and
other financial sites to bring your bills and account information
to you online.
</P>
<P>
   With its E-card, First U.S.A., a leading credit card issuer,
offers customers online access to detailed information about their
credit card purchases as well as the ability to pay their bills
online. Many banks are finding ways to let customers see their
bills online as a way of offering better service than the
nontraditional banking competitors who are zeroing in on their
business.
</P>
<P>
   A type of bill-presentment service was recently announced by
Chase Manhattan Bank, First Union and Wells Fargo; they are forming
a new company that will enable people and businesses to both
receive and pay bills electronically. The company, called the
Exchange, will serve as an electronic hub that will allow companies
issuing bills to reach consumers through their financial
institutions. Consumers will be able to log on to their online
banking site and view lists of their outstanding bills, said Sharon
Osberg, executive vice president for financial services at Wells
Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   The three banks will have a customer base of 60 million and
almost 60,000 corporations, said Wendy Grover, a spokeswoman for
Wells Fargo. Ms. Osberg added that by the time the Exchange is
fully up and running next year, all electronic payments will be
settled on the day they are issued, effectively eliminating any
float.
</P>
<P>
   But whether an electronic overdue notice will be easier to
ignore than a piece of paper that says ``account past due'' in red
letters on it remains to be seen.

<P>
   Most cable and DSL modems also make it easier for hackers to go
after specific computers.
</P>
<P>
   In dial-up systems, the addresses belong to the service
provider's modems, rather than to its customers. When customers
dial in for a connection, each one gets an IP address of the modem
reached for that session; each modem is associated with a finite
number of IP addresses. The next time the computer may well connect
with another modem and get another address, particularly if the
customer has a large service provider operating huge banks of
modems. ``To some extent that's security through obscurity,''
McElearney said.
</P>
<P>
   For cable-modem and DSL customers, not only are their addresses
fixed, they are also often easy to learn. The addresses appear in
the headers (which usually aren't displayed) that travel with every
e-mail message or newsgroup posting customers send.
</P>
<P>
   Many service providers have begun to respond to the problem.
Some, including Road Runner, are introducing a system that
regularly rotates their customers' IP addresses. Addresses based on
this system, however, may not change for several days and will
still appear in the headers.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus is also distressed about one unintended side effect of the
steep decline in computer prices. Inexpensive PCs increasingly mean
that some families now own several computers, all of which can be
serviced by a single high-speed line. To take advantage of that,
some people are setting up mini-networks in their homes, with one
computer acting as the go-between to the Internet for all the
others.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy server software that makes that possible, however,
often has very flawed security measures, Klaus said. To obscure
their identities, sophisticated hackers will first log into a home
network software before launching an attack against their ultimate
target. Junk-mail spammers can resort to the same trick. In either
case, the result can be highly embarrassing for the unsuspecting
home network owner, who will appear to be the originator of the
hacking or spam.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there is not a straightforward answer to the question
of how to guarantee security while enjoying high-speed Internet
connections. For Larry Rogers, who tracks Internet security
problems at Carnegie Mellon University's CERT Coordination Center,
part of the solution is simply hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with these connections need to play systems
administrator,'' he said. ``It's a matter of vigilance.''
</P>
<P>
   That vigilance can include something as simple as having Windows
users make sure that Network Neighborhood _ a file-sharing system _
is turned off. Rogers also suggested steps like regularly
downloading software security patches from Microsoft's Web site or
modifying arcane portions of the operating system. Not
surprisingly, these are just the kind of housekeeping tasks that
many users somehow never get around to.
</P>
<P>
   Some software companies are offering their help. In May,
Sybergen Networks (www.sygate.com), which mostly makes corporate
security protection software, introduced a $29.95 software package
for home users called Syshield. Similar products include Conseal
Private Desktop by Signal 9 Solutions (www.signal9.com).
</P>
<P>
   Such software generally blocks the computer from receiving some
types of data, limiting the paths in for hacker. Syshield can also
be set up to in effect disconnect the computer from the Internet
late at night.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate protection is that now used by Keeney, who has
become a computer-security consultant since his 1997 attack. He has
copied, on a much smaller scale, the system used by most
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   All his Internet business now runs on a network with a single
computer operating as a firewall and using the Linux software
system. Because it is difficult for hackers to get past the
firewall computer in such set-ups, that computer acts as a
sacrificial lamb of sorts. Keeney freely admits, however, that most
home users are unlikely to adopt such a complex setup.
</P>
<P>
   If the speculation in the industry is correct, they may never
have to. Many believe that ``security appliances'' _ extremely
stripped-down computers with security software that sit between
another computer and its Internet connection _ may eventually hit
the consumer market. Such systems for business users are already
available.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, another answer would simply be to put up with the
slow speeds and petty annoyances of a dial-in modem. But for anyone
but the more basic e-mail user, Klaus does not think that is a
great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many benefits that outweigh the security risks,
provided you take precautions,'' he said. To prove his point, Klaus
added that he was now shopping for cable modem service for his
home.

   A type of bill-presentment service was recently announced by
Chase Manhattan Bank, First Union and Wells Fargo; they are forming
a new company that will enable people and businesses to both
receive and pay bills electronically. The company, called the
Exchange, will serve as an electronic hub that will allow companies
issuing bills to reach consumers through their financial
institutions. Consumers will be able to log on to their online
banking site and view lists of their outstanding bills, said Sharon
Osberg, executive vice president for financial services at Wells
Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   The three banks will have a customer base of 60 million and
almost 60,000 corporations, said Wendy Grover, a spokeswoman for
Wells Fargo. Ms. Osberg added that by the time the Exchange is
fully up and running next year, all electronic payments will be
settled on the day they are issued, effectively eliminating any
float.
</P>
<P>
   But whether an electronic overdue notice will be easier to
ignore than a piece of paper that says ``account past due'' in red
letters on it remains to be seen.

League Baseball a curve during All-Star Game voting last week. A
Boston hacker stuffed the virtual ballot box to seemingly swing the
vote to Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who was locked in a
tight race with New York Yankee Derek Jeter.
<P>
   But Chris Nandor's attempt to pull off a Chicago-style election
result with 25,000 online tallies struck out after MLB officials
detected irregularities and voided the votes.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that MLB's director of new media can't guarantee
someone won't eventually succeed in logging enough virtual votes to
nominate journeyman Paul Sorrento as a starter to the midsummer
classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people can crack a government computer, they can crack a
computer that keeps track of ballots,'' Alex Kam said. ``Computers
aren't impenetrable.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they insignificant in the digital age. The grand old
game of baseball is increasingly more dependent on cyber votes to
select All-Star players. About 13 percent of the more than 3
million votes for tomorrow night's 70th All-Star Game in Boston
were cast over the Internet, up from about 8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kam said MBL can only put ``reasonable limitations'' on
restricting the number of votes per online voter to 22. Like the
more traditional paper-balloting process conducted in baseball's 30
stadiums, MLB executives attempt to detect unusual voting patterns
_ such as the exact same votes coming from the same Internet
address _ over a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   It was that detective work that fingered Nandor, whose burst of
last-minute votes for Red Sox players caught the attention of Kam
and others. Nandor and other would-be manipulators will have to
take solace from the age-old baseball refrain, ``Wait till next
year.''

   Nandor, 25, of Carver, Mass., did not return phone calls.

   One of Silicon Valley's hottest startups lifts its kimono this

   The Mountain View, Calif., company _ stocked with hotshot

</P>
<P>
   MORE NET-ESCAPEES
</P>
<P>
   A team of 10 key engineers from Netscape also is working on a
secret startup. Last week, the first details of Geocast Network
Systems (www.geocast.com) began to surface.
</P>
<P>
   The Menlo Park, Calif., company is developing hardware and
software that would deliver full-screen video and CD-quality sound
to personal computers, according to Jon Mittelhauser, manager of
software products at Geocast.
</P>
<P>
   Geocast is expected to unveil its products next year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry buzz over Geocast is so high-pitched that VC rivals
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers and the Mayfield Fund have each
invested in the 50-person startup. (The company's chief operating
officer, Alan Nichols Jr., previously was an executive vice
president of The Chronicle Publishing Co.)
</P>
<P>
   GEEKS FOR HIRE
</P>
<P>
   Remember the ragtag group of nerdy mercenaries who anonymously
offered their services in an eBay listing in April?
</P>
<P>
   Starting at $3.14 million, the team of 16 engineers _ who called
themselves ispteam _ offered wired-for-hire expertise.
</P>
<P>
   And they got a couple of feelers from at least five companies
before bagging the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of the co-conspirators, John Kinsella, has decided to
give it another go. Only this time he isn't hiding behind a veil of
secrecy. Kinsella has opened a Web site, www.bid4geeks.com, that
auctions tech talent to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to advertise the talents of individuals or teams of
workers for startups and established companies,'' said Kinsella,
25, a former Unix systems engineer at Digex, an Internet service
provider in Cupertino, Calif. ``With such incredible demand for
tech talent, we think this is the ultimate in online classified ads
for nerds.''
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   The snazzy new iMac laptop we first reported on in December
could emerge next week at the Macworld Expo computer show in New
York. The $2,000 translucent portable is considered crucial to
extending the company's recent run of success, and fills out
Apple's PC line.
</P>
<P>
   Apple declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, E-Trade Group denied scuttlebutt that it is
relocating some facilities from its Menlo Park, Calif.,
headquarters to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, grumblings out of Mountain View, Calif., are that
America Online's payroll and commission system doesn't jibe with
Netscape's system, depriving Netscape sales representatives of
commission checks for the past four months. That's the rumor.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that an administrative switch resulted in a
two-week delay in commission checks, according to the company.
Netscape sales reps should be paid by the end of the month.

DISNEY TO EXPAND ONLINE OPERATIONS

By DAVE McNARY  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   BURBANK, Calif. _
Walt Disney Co. got serious about the Internet, pulling the trigger
on two major deals it has been pondering for the past five weeks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The entertainment giant announced Monday a major expansion of
its Internet business by agreeing to buy the 57 percent of Web
partner Infoseek Corp. that it does not already own for an
undisclosed price estimated to be about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Disney will then spin off its Internet assets, valued at $7
billion without Infoseek, and its catalog operations into a
publicly traded tracking stock called Go.com. That could enable
Disney, which did not disclose how much the public will own, to
receive a boost from the booming market for Web stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a great move from a strategic standpoint to buy
Infoseek and separate the assets,'' said Linda Bannister, an
analyst with Edward Jones. ``It will make it easier to attract
quality people and give them a currency for making acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   By making the announcement, Disney also underscored its strong
commitment to the concept of Go.com as a general-purpose portal to
the Internet. That indicates Disney will engage in what has turned
out to be an uphill battle with America Online, Yahoo! and
Microsoft in that market.
</P>
<P>
   Disney launched its Internet operations in 1995 and stepped up
as a major player a year ago by buying 43 percent of Infoseek, the
Web's fourth largest search directory. In a news conference Monday
in New York, Disney and Infoseek chief executives fleshed out
details of the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   --Disney will own 72 percent of Go.com, which will combine the
550 employees at Buena Vista Internet Group, 850 Infoseek employees
and 800 Disney catalog employees.
</P>
<P>
   --The deals should be completed by the end of this year.
Infoseek shareholders must approve the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   --The combined businesses should generate $350 million during
the current fiscal year, through Sept. 30, and could double that in
the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   --Go.com will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol GO, replacing shares of Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   --Infoseek's chief executive officer, Harry Motro, will depart
once the deal is concluded. Jake Winebaum left as Disney's Internet
chief last month, and there was no indication of who will head
Go.com.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came when Wall Street has been punishing
Disney's share price over disappointing earnings and a sagging
outlook in several key businesses. The announcement had little
impact as shares edged up 18.75 cents to $27.8125 after touching
their 1999 low on Friday, while Infoseek shares were off $5.5625 at
$45.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have predicted, however, that the Internet assets will
increase in value, particularly given the worth of such popular
sites as Disney.com, ESPN.com, ABCNews.com, Family.com and Disney
Stores Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combining Disney's Internet assets with Infoseek takes our
online strategy to the next level,'' said Disney Chairman Michael
Eisner. ``Go.com will unlock the value and potential of our
combined Internet assets and position them to ignite the
marketplace with new products and services.''
</P>
<P>
   But Disney trackers have complained that while the
Disney-Infoseek partnership may make sense, the alliance has
operated clumsily compared to Internet rivals and not delivered a
compelling product since Disney and Infoseek launched the Go.com
portal _ a hub for entering the Internet _ in January. Some
question the basic strategy of trying to compete as a portal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is going to wind up spending a ton of money to fight a
battle that's already been lost to AOL, Yahoo! and MSN,'' said
Joseph Butt Jr., an analyst with Forrester Research. ``This is not
a way to win friends and influence people.''
</P>
<P>
   David Card, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, said Disney
should not be dismissed. ``The whole Go.com strategy has been only
modestly successful, but what they've announced is a very logical
next step,'' he noted. ``You can't write them off in terms of power
of media properties and cross-promotion. They're still a contender
with strong cards to play.''

 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's trouble in Raccoon City.
</P>
<P>
   A virus has turned the inhabitants into flesh-hungry zombies.
And their posture is lousy. When a crowd of these lurching
subhumans breaks into a gun store, they feast on the proprietor
like pigs around a trough, throwing up a mist of blood in the air.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Joe D'Avanzo, 26, starts pumping them full of lead.
``It takes three shots to the head,'' he says, as the zombies drop
like sandbags. ``Or about six shots to the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the rules in ``Resident Evil 2,'' one of the gorier
video games available for Sony's PlayStation console. Later in the
game D'Avanzo's on-screen persona, Leon, can acquire a shotgun,
which does the job better.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shotgun blast will take their head clean off,'' D'Avanzo
says. ``But the problem with that is you have to wait until they're
real close.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Avanzo, manager of Software Etc., is a connoisseur of the
latest in violent video games, in which players blast, cut and
bludgeon opponents, leaving piles of bodies in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   Violent games have come under scrutiny this summer because the
teen-agers responsible for the bloodbath at suburban Denver's
Columbine High School were also dedicated fans of ``Doom,'' the
granddaddy of all violent games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doom'' was one of the earliest and most successful in a genre
called the ``first-person shooter.'' These games put a weapon in
the hands of the player and show the world from his point of view,
as he charges down passageways and wipes out an endless horde of
enemies. Killers Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris turned their own
high school into a scenario right out of ``Doom,'' littering the
hallways with very real corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine High killings have prompted lawsuits against the
makers of ``Doom'' and cries for a government crackdown on violent
video games. But most parents are probably unaware that ``Doom'' is
kid stuff compared with the games that are coming out now.
</P>
<P>
   This month Xatrix, maker of such genteel entertainments as
``Redneck Rampage,'' released ``Kingpin: Life of Crime,'' a
foulmouthed killing fest that will give mothers and fathers a new
reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Kingpin,'' the player is cast as a thug who works his way
up the underworld ladder by killing and stealing. Due to its
hyper-realistic gore and R-rated language, the game is being sold
with the strongest warnings ever placed on a computer game. Both
the soundtrack, by the rap group Cypress Hill, and the dialogue
employ liberal use of profanity.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage in ``Kingpin'' is also more convincing than the
cartoonish deaths in ``Doom'' and its follow-up, ``Quake.'' You can
actually have conversation with your human opponents before you
kill them, and their body parts can be blown off, one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   A participant identified as ``Menace'' gave ``Kingpin'' high
marks in an Internet discussion group, writing: ``It's plenty of
fun. I like setting (people) on fire then pulling out the shotgun
and blowing their flaming head off while they're running around
screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Kingpin'' is going to be like catnip to the
serious gamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the most vile and reprehensible games in the
history of mankind. And, put it this way, I'm going to buy it,''
says a chuckling D'Avanzo. Retailing for $54.98, the game is
already moving briskly at his store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kingpin'' is rated ``M'' for mature audiences, which means
that Daniel Beruvides, 17, is just old enough to buy it. A neatly
dressed, bespectacled high school student, he doesn't seem like
someone who'd be prone to violent, antisocial rage. He is a rising
senior, scored a 4.0 grade-point average last year, and is
college-bound in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Beruvides enjoys violent games such as ``Resident Evil.'' He
points out that even well-adjusted kids need outlets for anger.
``Have you ever wanted to kill anybody?'' he quipped. ``Well, this
lets you do it without getting arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Other game players concur that part of the attraction of violent
games is the opportunity to harmlessly blow off steam. ``If you're
looking for someone's (rear end) to beat cause you're (angry) with
the world, you can do it with a keyboard,'' says Patrick Ogletree,
22, a prep cook at an Athens brew house who enjoys multiplayer
games of ``Doom'' on the Internet. ``Everybody should have stress
relief like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Game designers are happy to oblige. Developers in the $6.5
billion video game industry know that explicit violence can pull
players into a game, just as a bloodthirsty killing can pull
viewers into a Quentin Tarantino movie. The racks of specialty
stores such as Software Etc., and electronics superstores such as
Best Buy are stacked with 31 flavors of mayhem, suitable for play
on video game consoles or on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   There are games with absurd violence, such as ``Redneck
Rampage,'' which offers a brand-new way to utilize a chicken and a
stick of dynamite. There are games that inject sex into the story
line, such as ``Duke Nukem,'' in which combatants pursue each other
through strip bars and porno movie houses.
</P>
<P>
   There are games with creepy violence, such as ``Parasite Eve,''
in which the lead character causes victims to spontaneously burst
into flames. There are strategy games, such as ``WarCraft'' and
``StarCraft''; hunt-and-shoot games, such as the James Bond-themed
``Goldeneye 007''; parody games, such as ``Deer Avenger,'' in which
deer give hunters their comeuppance; and sword-and-sorcery games,
such as the hugely popular ``Legend of Zelda'' series. All involve
killing, to a greater or lesser degree.
</P>
<P>
   The goriest games are usually on CD-ROM, for play on personal
computers, because they're produced by independent developers who
are not answerable to large companies like Sony or Nintendo. Yet
the games created for the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo consoles
also have a fair amount of carnage; ``Doom'' and ``Quake'' were
both released in console format, and PlayStation offers ``Resident
Evil'' and Nintendo has ``Duke Nukem.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are plenty of nonviolent video games, including
sports games, flight simulators and strategy games. But why do so
many games involve killing?
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to the nature of the device and the people drawn to
it, say gamers. Many of the earliest games, including such
``Paleolithic,'' 1970s games as ``Space Invaders'' and
``Asteroids,'' required the player to manipulate a weapon to shoot
down opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't consider `Space Invaders' a violent game,
but it is just as violent a game in concept as `Doom,' `Tomb
Raider' or `Quake,''' says Theodore Beale, 30, a game designer and
a reviewer of games for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ``There's
only so many game concepts out there, and games are largely
designed by guys who like to blow things up.''
</P>
<P>
   What has changed are the graphics. New technology, including 3-D
accelerator video cards, have taken on-screen violence from the
silly, one-pixel gunshots of ``Contra'' to the grotesque,
face-ripping transformations of ``Parasite Eve.'' Games with
built-in artificial intelligence, such as ``Half-Life,'' also can
provide characters with real human unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in video games entered the cultural radar in 1993, when
the fighting game ``Mortal Kombat'' moved from coin-op arcades into
home use on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis consoles.
</P>
<P>
   Combatants in that game could dispatch a victim by tearing off
his head (with spinal column still attached), or by ripping out his
heart. Parents were aghast and politicians thundered for video-game
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a ratings system firmly in place, ``Mortal Kombat''
looks like a quaint artifact, its 2-D characters disporting against
a flat background.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, today's 3-D games place the player inside a truly
realistic environment. Details make the scenes believable. In
``Parasite Eve,'' the Dolby Surround Sound allows the player to
hear, according to one afficionado, ``the flesh ripping from the
bones.'' In ``Kingpin,'' you can see the track marks on hookers'
arms. There is even a preference in ``Kingpin'' that the player can
set to determine how long splattered blood will stick to the walls.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other technical advances in video game
production, but the graphics are the most visible _ and the most
lucrative, says Johnny Wilson, editorial director at Computer
Gaming World magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullet wounds are more visible than artificial intelligence,''
says Wilson. ``Special effects are king in terms of sales, and the
bigger, the badder, the more extravagant, the more popular they're
going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, though a gaming enthusiast, decries the violence in
``Kingpin.'' In a column for his magazine, Wilson writes that the
game's wholly unredeemed characters are the ``worst thing that
could happen to the hobby'' of computer games, and suggests that
the developers and publishers share a responsibility for the
long-term effects that such violent entertainment has on the
national psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns are already being tested in the courts. The
families of the three victims in the 1997 Paducah, Ky., school
shootings have filed suit against video game giants Sony, Nintendo
and Sega, charging that the killer Michael Carneal was influenced
by their products. One lawsuit claims that Carneal was trained by
video games to become a better shooter, citing the fact that the
Marine Corps uses ``Doom'' to beef up marksmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The current climate has caused some sweaty palms at Interplay,
publisher of ``Kingpin'' and one of the 25 defendants named in the
Paducah lawsuit. After the Colorado massacre, the company tried
vainly to recall some of its provocative magazine ads for
``Kingpin,'' which scream in a huge typeface ``You're Gonna Die!''
according to product marketing manager Alison Quirion. ``The timing
couldn't be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Quirion points out that ``Kingpin'' is intended for adults, and
that those who object don't need to buy it. But video games,
advertised in comic books and sold in toy stores that cater to
kids, can easily slip into younger hands, says James Alan Fox, a
criminal justice professor at Northeastern University, and a critic
of the games. ``You put an `M' on the box, and then you put them in
a store that panders to a 12-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no consensus that the video games, for all their
gore, really are dangerous. In fact, when analyzing 27 different
studies on video games, Purdue University Assistant Professor John
Sherry found the immediate correlation between game play and
aggression to be small.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies of college undergraduates playing ``Mortal Kombat''
were particularly intriguing, says Sherry: The students who played
longer demonstrated less aggression than those who played for only
a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry adds, however, that the data is slim, and that there are
no studies on long-term effects. ``My guess is as good as yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Game players themselves aren't concerned. ``Usually video game
people are too busy playing video games to do anything,'' jokes
Wade Lorenzen, a 26-year-old tile setter.
</P>
<P>
   The grotesque fiends in ``Quake'' ``are meant to look twisted,''
says Roxanne Hanke, a 20-year-old student at Atlanta College of
Art. ``It's the same thing that people look for in movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of violent games is misdirected energy, she says.
``Don't they think they should work on schools, instead of video
games?'' says Hanke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some adults need to get a life,'' says Beruvides. ``These
characters are fictional. They're not real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence started well before video games,'' the teen-ager
concludes philosophically. ``If you try to get rid of violence,
you'll have to get rid of man.''

FTC RECOMMENDS CONGRESS HOLD OFF ON PRIVACY LEGISLATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While finding that the online industry has a long
way to go in protecting the privacy of consumers, the Federal Trade
Commission has approved a report recommending that Congress hold
off on legislation to regulate how companies can collect and use
consumer data.
</P>
<P>
   The report, approved 3-1 by the commission, was a victory for
industry groups that have been scrambling for the last year and
half to avert privacy legislation. They have made a case for
self-regulation, encouraging companies to declare policies that
allow consumers to choose and control the information collected
about them over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Varney, a former federal trade commissioner who is now
a legal counsel to the Online Privacy Alliance, a group of Internet
and technology companies that was formed a year ago when the
commission threatened to seek legislation, said, ``I think it does
reflect that the industry has done an enormous amount of work over
the last year and a half and we are on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates insist that the latest surveys of the
privacy practices of online marketers _ and the commission report
itself _ prove that self-regulation is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is plenty of evidence that self-regulation has
not worked,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, a civil liberties advocacy
group. ``What these privacy policies are telling people is how much
privacy they don't have. The consequence as a legal matter is
expectations of privacy in the online world continue to decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was not without criticism of the industry. Indeed, it
cites a survey this spring by Georgetown University showing that
while 66 percent of Web sites now post privacy policies _ up from
14 percent a year earlier _ only 10 percent also follow the
commission's criteria for protecting personal information, giving
consumers choice and control over such information and a form of
redress if it is misused.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The self-regulatory initiatives described above reflect
industry leaders' substantial effort and commitment to fair
information practices,'' the report states. But it goes on to say
that ``only a small minority of commercial Web sites have joined
these programs to date.''
</P>
<P>
   The report will be officially submitted on Tuesday at a hearing
of the House Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and
consumer protection, at which trade commission members and others
on both sides of the privacy issue are expected to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Edward Markey of
Massachusetts, says he intends to introduce an online privacy
``bill of rights'' to protect consumer control over personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the commission, denied that its
conclusions were in conflict. ``Responsible elements of the
Internet community have begun to do what they set out to do,'' he
said. ``On the other hand, just putting a notice on the Internet
about a privacy policy is not all the protection that consumers
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said the commission would continue to closely monitor
online privacy. And the report lays out an agenda for public
workshops and task forces of industry, privacy and consumer groups
to make sure the progress continues.
</P>
<P>
   It also promises another review of Web site privacy practices,
probably in another year, Pitofsky said, emphasizing not just the
adoption of policies but their substance, monitoring and
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes a year after the commission released the first
survey on Web site privacy practices and won approval of
legislation requiring Web sites that collect information from
children to get parents' permission. It also warned that it would
seek legislation regulating the use of personal information
collected from adults if substantial progress was not made.

HOW TO KEEP E-MAIL PRIVATE

(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  Q: I do a lot of e-mail
<TEXT>
correspondence that involves sensitive corporate information. Is
there any way to code my mail so that only the person I'm sending
it to can read it?
<P>
   A: What you need is PGP, a free encryption program that you can
download at www.pgpi.com. PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy. It
was created in 1991 by Phil Zimmerman, who went on to found a
company, PGP Inc., that was acquired by Network Associates in 1997.
PGP is pretty strong stuff (so strong that the U.S. government
investigated Zimmerman for three years on the premise that PGP
violated U.S. export restrictions for cryptographic software).
</P>
<P>
   PGP uses what's called public key system. Each user has two
software keys _ a public key that can be shared with anyone, and a
private key that only the user knows. Someone sends you a message
using your public key to encrypt it. Once encrypted, the message
looks like random gibberish. When you receive the message, you can
decrypt it using your private key.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, PGP isn't just for e-mail. You can use it to
scramble any file that you don't want other people to know about.
Just use your public key to encrypt it, and your private key to
decrypt it.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORD ON LINUX
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been reading a lot about Linux, and I was under the
impression that there would soon be versions of it that would be
easy to install and use on my PC. Is that true, and which versions
are the best?
</P>
<P>
   A: Linux has come a long way in the couple of years since it
burst into the spotlight. But truth to tell, it still is a long way
from being an adequate alternative to Windows or the Macintosh
operating system. The reason is that very little good software has
been written for Linux. For instance, the only mainstream word
processor that's been adapted to Linux is WordPerfect. Microsoft is
having no part of the upstart system, and we may never see Linux
versions of Word, Excel and Powerpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Linux itself is getting a lot easier to use, thanks to companies
that are packaging it with graphical, Windows-like desktop
interfaces and easy installation routines. Two good versions that
come to mind are Red Hat 6.0 ($79.95 list price) and Linux from
Macmillan Software ($49.95 for the Deluxe version, $29.95 for the
Complete version, although how it can be complete if there's a more
extensive version is beyond me). These products let you surf the
Web, exchange e-mail, create simple documents and manage your
files.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about Linux is that it works on older PCs, so if
you have a 386 or 486 system gathering dust in the basement, Linux
could give it new life.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOST POWERFUL
</P>
<P>
   Q: How powerful is the world's top supercomputer? I'm 13 and
would like to know.
</P>
<P>
   A: Over the past few years, Intel, IBM, SGI, Hitachi and NEC all
at one time or another have laid claim to having the world's most
powerful supercomputer. In every case, it's a computer that uses
hundreds or even thousands of conventional processors like Pentiums
to form a cyberbrain in which each processor does a small part of a
big job. The result is what's called massively parallel processing.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the top computer in the world, according to a list
published by the University of Mannheim, is the Intel ASCI Red,
which is installed at the Sandia National Laboratory in
Albuquerque, N.M. It uses 9,742 Pentiums and can perform 2.1
trillion operations per second. Second place belongs to SGI's ASCI
Blue Mountain at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M.
IBM is planning a version of its RS/6000 SP supercomputer _ to be
installed at the Lawrence Livermore Lab next year _ that will be
capable of 10 trillion calculations per second. That means it will
be able to do in one second what it would take you 10 million years
to do with a hand calculator.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frustrating things about notebook computers is
that sometimes the cursor can be hard to see on the screen. This is
particularly true when the lighting situation is bad, such as when
you're outdoors. To make the cursor easier to locate, do the
following: Click the Windows Start button, point to settings and
choose Control Panel. Double-click the Mouse icon and click the
Motion tab. Then check the box labeled ``Show pointer trails'' and
click Apply. This will give the cursor a fleeting comet tail when
you move it.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Built-in safeguards highlight of UGA research center
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ When the new Animal Health Research Center opens,
University of Georgia veterinarian Dr. Barry Harmon will no longer
have to collect in biocontainment bags and incinerate the
by-products of his research on E. coli O157:H7, the deadly bacteria
that sickened children at White Water Park.
</P>
<P>
   The $19 million facility has built-in safeguards designed to
capture, contain, decontaminate and sterilize everything coming out
of it, including the wastewater, air molecules and incinerator ash.
The building will allow researchers to study a variety of
contagious pathogens such as campylobacter, chlamydia psittaci and
Salmonella DT104, which infect humans as well as animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Australian government has already contacted us about
hiring vet school faculty to investigate Exotic New Castle Disease,
which doesn't exist in the U.S.,'' said Corrie Brown, head of the
College of Veterinary Medicine's pathology department. ``It's a
poultry disease that they didn't have in Australia until a little
while ago. They've have to slaughter 2 million chickens because of
it. In the new building we could study the disease safely.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years in the making, with federal and state
funding, the new research center is the only nongovernmental
facility in the country designed to accommodate a wide range of
animals, said Mike Mispagel, the facility manager and the quality
assurance manager for the entire university. With special features
like gates, tie-rings and high ceilings, the animal rooms are large
enough for horses, cows and pigs, as well as for rodents and birds.
</P>
<P>
   Mispagel expects scientists from agencies outside the
university, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to use the
AHRC for their projects in collaboration with UGA researchers. He
also plans to schedule research on noninfectious diseases for the
first six months the building is open ``to work out any bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when the idea of constructing a secure, safe
laboratory setting first surfaced among vet school officials, there
had been outbreaks of Legionnaires Disease, aflatoxin and various
avian diseases, all of which were studied ``under less than ideal
conditions,'' said Mispagel. UGA officials brought in a team from
the USDA who determined that there was a need for such a facility
in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building will provide an additional level of safety and
control,'' said Mispagel. ``The engineered design gives you more
scientific control. You can control the microorganism within a
confined space and avoid the possibility of contaminating other
animals. If you're trying to study an organism, you want to have as
much control as possible over all variables.''
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders will be invited to an Aug. 12 dedication, when
the building will be open for tours. Vet school experts have given
tours to Athens fire department personnel and have been working
with local public safety officials to devise a plan should a fire
occur in the facility. As the AHRC comes on line, the UGA Biosafety
Committee, which has also toured the facility, will be closely
involved in oversight responsibility, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The 70,000-square-foot, bunkerlike building has had its own
maintenance staff for the past six to nine months. An electrician,
a plumber and a systems engineer have been learning the building
inside and out, even as architects and construction crews ready it
for final tests and inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the building seems unremarkable, just a brightly
lit lobby, a reception area and a hallway of offices, one of which
will house a person to monitor the animals being used in research.
Without a key card providing access, visitors are restricted to the
lobby; with a key card, one can enter the locker rooms and showers
that lead to the laboratory areas. Everyone going into these areas
showers before leaving the building.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 16 animal research rooms, the labs for toxicology,
surgery and necropsy _ animal autopsy _ have special features to
minimize exposure to deadly organisms. With $5,000 in airtight
doors, the rooms are all depressurized, meaning that air flows only
into them _ the outgoing air circulates through a special filter
before being released. There are autoclavs that sterilize equipment
with high temperatures; biosafety cabinets, which are filled with
sterilized air; and downdraft tables that pull fumes away from the
room.
</P>
<P>
   The second floor of the building isn't finished yet, but
Mispagel said it will house the laboratories of the eminent scholar
in vaccinology the Georgia Research Alliance is planning to hire.
The air handling system for the building is on the top floor; the
incinerator, wastewater holding tanks and emergency generator are
in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much redundancy built into the system that this is
going to be the safest building on campus,'' Mispagel said. ``It's
going to really help give the university a leg up in research. It
will provide a resource for UGA to be able to investigate
microorganisms in a safe environment that otherwise wouldn't be
able to be investigated.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Jackson can't remember the last time he wrote a check and
hasn't spoken face to face with a bank teller in years. Jackson has
handled his personal banking online with Bank Boston since 1989,
and he expanded to online banking for his public relations business
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although he experienced two instances of bank errors that cost
him several hours on the phone with customer service, that has not
deterred him from banking online. ``I think I've had to deal with
the best and worst that it has to offer,'' Jackson said. ``It's
easy to set up and it can be incredibly convenient, but anyone who
has really bad financial habits may find that their problems will
be exacerbated when they go online. It's definitely not for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   One big difference with many online banking accounts is that as
soon as you direct the bank to send out a payment from your
account, that money's gone. You can't mail out a $50 check and
figure that you can get to the bank to deposit the money to cover
the check before it's presented by the recipient's bank for
payment. But one thing online customers gain is convenience _ the
bank's always open for business.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Jackson was unusual. Although some of the
largest banks in the country, including Wells Fargo, Citibank and
Chase Manhattan, have offered their customers online bill-payment
options for nearly a decade, only during the last couple of years
have customers really started to warm to the idea of clicking on
the Send button at an online banking site.
</P>
<P>
   According to IDC, a market research firm in Framingham, Mass.,
the number of people in the United States participating in at least
one online banking function (like viewing deposits, transferring
money between accounts and paying bills) rose to 12.4 million in
1999 from 1.4 million in 1996. IDC expects that number to rise to
18.7 million by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts cite the widespread availability of
modem-equipped computers as one reason for the increase in online
banking activity. They add that people are also finally starting to
get comfortable with the notion that entering bank account
information online is no riskier than giving a credit card number
over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online trading has really made people aware of how to bank
online,'' said Mitch Caplan, president of Telebank, a phone- and
Internet-based bank. ``The security issues aren't really there any
more.'' But while online trading offers discount services, many
banks charge more for online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It has become much more convenient to pay bills and transfer
money to other accounts via computer because many banks are moving
their entire online consumer banking areas onto the Internet and
off private networks, which required the customer to use
communications software and a modem to dial directly into a
company's computer system.
</P>
<P>
   To pay bills online with Chase in 1994, for example, a customer
had to call Chase's customer service and order software disks for
logging onto a private network. Since Chase moved its online
banking functions to the Internet last February, online customers
have been able to gain access to their accounts from any PC with an
Internet connection by going to the bank's Web site and punching in
an identifying name and password.
</P>
<P>
   So what should you expect if you wean yourself from your
checkbook? Setting up access to your bank account via the Internet
is relatively simple. After securing your bank accounts with a
customer ID and a password, you enter the account numbers and
addresses of each company or person you pay regularly. As long as
you can provide that information, you can send payments to large
companies (like your cable and credit card companies) as well as to
individuals, like your piano teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks charge a monthly fee, usually $5 to $15, for
unlimited bill payments, but many are providing Internet banking
access and bill payments at no extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience of online banking has won some fans, like Lisa
and Alex Giassa of Teaneck, N.J., who have had an online account
since August 1998. ``It's definitely a convenience thing for us,''
Ms. Giassa said. ``If I know I have a bill due in a few days, I can
go upstairs, pay it in a couple of minutes and not deal with any
envelopes.''
</P>
<P>
   But lest you think that the click of a Send button will
instantaneously send off your son's college tuition payment on the
day it is due, think again. Only about half of electronic payments
are actually transmitted to recipients electronically. Many utility
companies and merchants are not set up to receive electronic
payments. Such companies are sent checks via regular mail _ an
annoying lesson for those who don't make allowances for the delayed
delivery and miss payment deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   And that delay brings up the question of the ``float'' and why
there's more of a float in electronic banking. In banking terms, a
float is the period between the time you issue a check and the time
it becomes available to the recipient. If you issue a check to an
out-of-state recipient, the money will not be credited to the
account of that company or person for up to five business days
after the check gets to the recipient's bank. A recipient in the
same state gets access to the money in up to three business days
after it is deposited, while someone with an account at the same
bank will get the money within one business day.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a regular checking account and issue a check, the
money won't be deducted until it is presented to your bank by the
recipient's bank for payment. But for many electronic accounts, the
bank automatically debits your online account soon after you hit
the button to instruct the bank to issue a check out of your
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The float is a big psychological issue for a lot of people,''
said Jim Bruene, editor of Online Banking Report, an industry
newsletter. ``The tighter someone's funds are, the more he or she
relies on it. None of this is very meaningful when you're making 2
percent interest on cash balances.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some organization _ sometimes a bank, sometimes a
check-processing company _ is able to hang onto your money for the
length of the float means that it can make money off your money, in
very short-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a payment is taken out of an online account right
away, that doesn't necessarily mean that the recipient of the money
is paid quickly. For example, Philip Goodman, a film and video
producer in Manhattan, paid a friend $25 out of his Chase Online
checking account. His checking account was debited quickly, but the
money did not show up in the recipient's account for three days,
Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's electronic, but it's not,'' he complained.
``They debit your account and then send a check. I can send a
check!''
</P>
<P>
   Most online banks use third-party check consolidators like
Checkfree to process the checks from online accounts, send them
along and disburse the money. In those cases, the bank pays
Checkfree the amount of the check, and Checkfree pays the company
or person receiving the check.
</P>
<P>
   If the check recipient is set up to receive payments
electronically, through a process known as electronic transfer, the
payments move through an automated clearing-house system within 24
hours, said Matthew Lewis, a senior vice president at Checkfree.
</P>
<P>
   But if the recipient is not set up to receive payments
electronically, Checkfree mails a check to the recipient's bank,
where it is processed in a transaction that can take up to five
business days if the payment crosses state lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is not sure about online banking's effect on
the float. ``We've tried to do what we can to manage float, but
whatever happens with the electronic technology is still an unknown
at this point,'' said Doug Tillet, a spokesman for the New York
Federal Reserve Bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Knowing that money is paid out of an account right away can help
online customers if they want to make last-minute electronic
payments, he added. If the recipient of a payment is set up to
receive electronic transfers, most online banking customers can
issue a payment at, say, 4:59 p.m. on the day the payment is due
and won't have to allow for mail delivery times.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bank Rate Monitor, an online service that tracks
interest rates for credit cards and personal loans offered by major
banks, at least 215 of the 350 largest Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.-insured banks in the country offer the ability to pay bills
electronically. But bill consolidators like Checkfree are also
providing electronic payment services to nontraditional banks on
the Internet, which means your choice of where on the Internet to
pay your bills is becoming a lot broader. Internet-only banks can
be a good choice for people who keep a lot of money in their
checking accounts because they generally pay higher interest, but
they also tend to charge higher fees for automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Personal and business financial software like Quicken and
Microsoft Money offer an electronic bill-paying option via
Checkfree. Customers can also use such software, which gives a user
an overall financial picture, with many types of online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bill payments, Checkfree and other consolidators,
like Transpoint and Cybercash, are also working with banks and
other financial sites to bring your bills and account information
to you online.
</P>
<P>
   With its E-card, First U.S.A., a leading credit card issuer,
offers customers online access to detailed information about their
credit card purchases as well as the ability to pay their bills
online. Many banks are finding ways to let customers see their
bills online as a way of offering better service than the
nontraditional banking competitors who are zeroing in on their
business.
</P>
<P>
   A type of bill-presentment service was recently announced by
Chase Manhattan Bank, First Union and Wells Fargo; they are forming
a new company that will enable people and businesses to both
receive and pay bills electronically. The company, called the
Exchange, will serve as an electronic hub that will allow companies
issuing bills to reach consumers through their financial
institutions. Consumers will be able to log on to their online
banking site and view lists of their outstanding bills, said Sharon
Osberg, executive vice president for financial services at Wells
Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   The three banks will have a customer base of 60 million and
almost 60,000 corporations, said Wendy Grover, a spokeswoman for
Wells Fargo. Ms. Osberg added that by the time the Exchange is
fully up and running next year, all electronic payments will be
settled on the day they are issued, effectively eliminating any
float.
</P>
<P>
   But whether an electronic overdue notice will be easier to
ignore than a piece of paper that says ``account past due'' in red
letters on it remains to be seen.

STUDY SHOWS LOS ANGELES TRAILS ONLY THE SILICON VALLEY ON LIST OF
HIGH-TECH REGIONS

(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   The
entertainment industry helped make the Los Angeles metropolitan
area the nation's second-largest high-tech region last year,
trailing only the Silicon Valley, a study released Tuesday showed.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The report by the nonprofit Milken Institute said the Los
Angeles-Long Beach metro area accounted for 5.11 percent, or better
than $1 of every $20, of the nation's output in the high-tech
sector.
</P>
<P>
   The first-ever study asserted that Los Angeles' high ranking
resulted from growth in multimedia entertainment, including
special-effects companies serving the film industry, television,
video games and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles also ranked an impressive third among so-called
``Tech-Poles,'' the institute's name for areas with high
concentrations of and output from high-tech industries such as
computer services, drug manufacturing, motion picture production
and aerospace. Northern California's San Jose metro area, which
includes the Silicon Valley, also earned first place in that
category while Dallas ranked as the second-largest Tech-Pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really positive news, because we were really
lagging behind five or six years ago,'' Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan said of the study results. ``We've really come a long way
since then.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-area numbers are somewhat inflated because not
all motion picture production and services use advanced technology,
according to Ross DeVol, the institute's director of regional and
demographic studies and primary author of the report. But he noted
that the numbers boded well for the area's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the decline in aerospace work, he said, ``It's
remarkable how much high-tech activity remains in the Los Angeles
area.''
</P>
<P>
   A large part of that continued success, DeVol said, is the
proximity of top-flight universities and research institutions and
a pool of talented workers in high-tech service areas such as
computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   Motion picture production and services were included in the
rankings to reflect emerging technologies such as computer
animation and digital-audio sound effects. But even without the
motion picture segment _ which the report estimated at about 4
percent of the area's total economy _ Los Angeles-Long Beach would
rank seventh in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In its 123 pages of rankings, charts and economic analysis, the
Milken Institute study _ titled ``America's High-Tech Economy:
Growth, Development, and Risks for Metropolitan Areas'' _ argued
that high-tech industries have spearheaded the economic growth of
both the United States and its metro areas.
</P>
<P>
   The study claims that annual growth in high-tech products and
services averaged 20percent over the past three years, ``directly
elevating'' the overall U.S. Gross Domestic Product by 1.5percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The report also listed ways that government investment
contributes to, and can further support, the industry. Key areas
include lifelong learning programs, tax incentives, minimizing
regulations and the role of research institutions and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The information is particularly important to city governments,
DeVol said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't address these critical factors, their residents
risk being left behind in the new economy,'' DeVol said.``Their
standard of living is going to be directly related to how well they
do in these high-tech industries.''
</P>
<P>
   But the institute's report said the rising importance of the
high-tech industry will bring risks as well as benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the report simulated the effects of a ``1990-91 style
recession,'' concluding that ``high-tech manufacturing industries
would experience a substantially more severe decline than the
overall economy and could even exacerbate the overall decline in
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the high-tech industry, particularly the
computer and office-equipment segment, is reacting more in line
with changes in the overall business cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed that any embrace of the high-tech industry
should be a cautious one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants what the Silicon Valley has,'' said Tom
Lieser, executive director of the Anderson Forecast at the
University of California, Los Angeles. ``The question is, as the
industry becomes more mature and more cyclical, it poses a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing social tension is another risk.
</P>
<P>
   Besides an influx of immigrants and a dramatic economic shift,
the high-tech industry can contribute to income disparities and
tension, DeVol said, adding that the government needs to play a
problem-solving role in that area.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's leading metropolitan areas for technology output,
according to a Milken Institute study released Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   1. San Jose
</P>
<P>
   2. Los Angeles-Long Beach

 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swept up in the phenomenal rush of the global Internet that it
helped create, the personal computer industry is undergoing a
fundamental transformation.
</P>
<P>
   The PC has become inextricably linked to the Internet, causing
the two formerly distinct businesses to blend. Several PC makers
have begun offering free Internet access as an inducement to sell
more machines, while several Internet service providers have begun
giving away computers, or subsidizing their purchase, to entice
more customers to sign up for online services.
</P>
<P>
   Still another group of companies has started giving computers to
customers who agree to look at online advertising. The companies
hope that they can attract advertisers who are trying to reach a
population that is spending less time in front of the TV and more
time in front of the PC.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer, which gained popular acceptance in the
1980s for its ability to perform a wide variety of business and
scientific tasks, is increasingly being recognized in the late
1990s as primarily a communications device that enables anyone to
send and receive e-mail, participate in discussion groups and
browse for information on the Internet's World Wide Web. Marketing
surveys confirm that Internet access is the main reason people buy
a PC today.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the PC is following the model of the cellular phone,
which is often given away or sold at low cost to customers who sign
up for service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the largest Internet service providers, America
Online's Compuserve unit, the Microsoft Network and Prodigy
Internet, now offer $400 rebate programs that cover at least part
of the cost of a new PC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several of the largest PC makers, including Compaq,
Dell and Gateway, are driving the cost of their basic computers
well below $1,000 and experimenting with free Internet access to
get more customers.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy, CompUSA, Microcenter and Circuit City are among the
large national retailers that are offering similar deals in
conjunction with Internet service contracts, making the cost of a
PC comparable to the cost of, say, a video cassette recorder.
During test marketing at some stores, they have offered weekend
specials: a PC for $400, with a $400 instant rebate. Circuit City
offered a bundle of a monitor and printer for $99 extra.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as a free lunch, of course, and caveats
abound in these new schemes. There are no complete PC systems
available for $400, and the PC's that come closest are typically
bare-bones machines with minimal features, dubious warranties and
limited free technical support. The offers typically do not apply
to Apple Macintosh computers or PC companion devices like the Palm
Pilot. The Internet service contracts require payments of $700 or
more over three years, and if the customer gets frustrated by the
quality of the PC or the Internet service during that time, three
years is a very long time to stew.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is no doubt that these programs make
owning a PC and getting connected to the Internet much less
expensive than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a customer can buy a $399 Emachines PC with
Compuserve software already installed, sign up for a three-year
Compuserve account at $21.95 a month and get a $400 rebate check
from America Online. The Emachines computer does not come with a
monitor, which adds $100 or so. And while Compuserve is owned by
America Online, it lacks the strong lineup of family and
child-friendly features that have made AOL the world's most popular
online service.
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy, once the largest online service in America before it
fell on hard times, this month announced a rebate plan with the
Best Buy Co., the country's largest consumer PC retail chain. A
customer who signs a three-year contract for Prodigy Internet
access at $19.95 a month will get a $400 rebate that can be applied
to the cost of any desktop or portable PC at Best Buy. A two-year
contract will get a $250 rebate; a one-year plan, $100.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Network, or MSN, is testing a $400 rebate plan in
15 Microcenter computer stores, and last weekend it conducted a
limited ``free PC'' test with Staples office products stores. Like
the others, MSN requires a three-year commitment at $19.95 a month.
Microcenter has a $449 PC, but it does not include a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq offers free Internet access with its Presario line of
home computers, including one model that costs $599 with a monitor,
through a rapidly growing Internet service company called Net Zero.
Net Zero requires customers to reveal personal information and to
agree to watch advertisements geared to their interests. Compaq
also offers Internet access under its own Compaq.net service for
prices starting at $11.99 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway offers one year of free Internet access with any machine
priced over $1,000 and is said to be negotiating to buy Earthlink,
a major Internet service company.
</P>
<P>
   Global demand remains strong for powerful and expensive PC's
that can perform complex operations like managing large customer
accounts, designing software or playing the latest
three-dimensional computer games. But in the past year, consumers
have come to see PC's _ especially those that cost less than $1,000
_ mainly as the boxes that say ``You've Got Mail!'' and allow them
to buy books, trade stocks and participate in electronic garage
sales and auctions without leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   Although low-cost PC's are not suitable for designing rocket
ships or playing the latest 3-D games, most are more than adequate
for handling simple applications like e-mail, Web browsing and
online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, PC's appealed mainly to consumers who were
technologically adept or brave enough to put up with such a
notoriously complex, frustrating and expensive device. The
penetration of PC's into American homes reached about 40 percent,
then stayed there for several years, suggesting that most people
who wanted a PC already had one.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has changed the landscape. The superiority of
e-mail over postal mail for keeping in touch with friends and
family, coupled with the ubiquity of ``www'' Internet addresses on
television and in print advertisements, is piquing the interest of
many consumers who until now had resisted owning a computer. They
may still hate the idea of having a computer, but they love the
idea of being on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With their new ``free PC'' plans, the Internet companies are
hoping to reach many of the 45 million American households that
have lacked either the interest or the money to bring PC's into
their homes. The ``free Internet'' schemes of the PC makers are
heading toward the same goal from the opposite route.
</P>
<P>
   If the most optimistic forecasts come true, computers may soon
become as ubiquitous as telephones or television sets. For that to
happen, PC's are going to have to be as easy to use as telephones
and television sets, which is definitely not the case today.
</P>
<P>
   But the price is right, finally.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About two weeks after Frank Keeney was first connected to cable
modem service in Pasadena, Calif., he discovered that along with
the delights of a 24-hour connection and high-speed Internet access
came the potential for big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to log in and found that someone had compromised my
computer,'' he recalled. ``When you log into a Linux system, it
will normally show a short message stating the last time logged in
and from where. Since I had not logged in for a week or so, I knew
there was trouble. I checked to see if someone else was online and,
sure enough, he was on at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to kill his log-in session, but it was too late. He
had already issued the command to erase every file on the computer.
I watched while he erased everything on my hard drive.'`
</P>
<P>
   Keeney's experience is not isolated, several computer security
experts said. The shift from dial-up Internet connections to cable
modems and DSL (digital subscriber lines _ fast, constant links to
the Net that use telephone lines) are making home computer users
vulnerable to the types of attacks from hackers that in the past
were almost exclusively a worry for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people aren't thinking at this level yet,'' said
Christopher Klaus, chief technology officer for Internet Security
Systems, an Atlanta-based maker of complex security analysis
software used by large corporations. ``Service providers are
looking at trying to put as many people on the Internet as
possible. The more security isn't brought up as an issue, the
greater the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable modems and DSL lines are presenting two new problems for
ordinary residential users. The biggest source of trouble comes
simply because these lines mean that users are constantly connected
to the Net, so their computers are always potential targets of
hackers..
</P>
<P>
   The second problem has to do with the types of connections used
by faster lines. Communications between computers on the Internet
rely on a series of numbers known as IP, or Internet protocol,
addresses. For dial-up users, those addresses are constantly
shifting, making them their computers elusive targets. While it can
be a nuisance to dial in to reach the Net every time you want to
check your e-mail, the practice automatically provides its own
measure of security.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately the protection afforded by the dial-up shell game
largely or completely vanishes with cable modems or DSL lines.
Because their customers don't flit on and off the Net, many high
speed service operators give them fixed IP addresses.
</P>
<P>
   While they may not be publicizing their new services' security
problems with the vigor they bring to boasting about the more
desirable features, cable modem and DSL providers acknowledge that
their residential customers are facing new kinds of security woes _
even if personal computers, of course, are less likely to be the
targets of hackers than are corporate or government systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are today, from a consumer standpoint, is where
companies were back in the late '80s, when firewalls weren't a big
issue,'' said Kevin McElearney, vice president of network support
services at Road Runner, a cable modem partnership that includes
Time Warner Entertainment, the Mediaone Group, Microsoft, Compaq
and Advance/Newhouse. Residential customers using high-speed
services, he said, ``are in an environment where they have to
realize that there are security issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your risk is increased the longer you leave any computer
connected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning together in this new world of always being
online in the home,'' said Jeff Waldhuter, director of technology
and engineering at Bell Atlantic Science and Technology Center, the
research branch of the telephone company and DSL service provider.
``Now that we're getting on with these connections, we're learning
that we have to add more security. We're growing up. These networks
are going to be vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to the always-connected world seems to have come at a
somewhat inopportune time. Internet Security Systems has been
tracking a ``dramatic increase'' in the use of a hacking technique
known variously as probing, sniffing or scanning, Klaus said.
Probing software automatically scans computers connected to the
Internet and evaluates the level of their security protection,
looking for weak systems vulnerable to easy attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon to have someone twist the doorknob of your
home computer,'' McElearney said.
</P>
<P>
   For probers, a typical home computer running Apple's Mac OS or
Windows 95 or 98 without the maker's latest security updates or
additional security software is the closest thing to an unlocked
door they are likely to find.
</P>
<P>
   After his hard drive disaster, Keeney installed security
software on his computer in Pasedena that tracks and records
break-in attempts by probing software. He has found that unwanted
visitors test his computer's security about twice a day. ``Most
computers on cable modems will be probed,'' he said. ``If
weaknesses are found, someone will exploit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike people who create and spread viruses or worms, probers
don't need the computer's owner to advance their cause
inadvertently by, say, opening a tainted e-mail attachment. For
them, an insecure system offers seemingly endless potential.
Keeney's hard drive crash is an extreme example of what hackers can
do once inside a computer. But others can cause just as much harm
even though they come and go without leaving an immediate trace.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Sullivan said, once hackers gain entry they
can extract credit card numbers from stored files, read e-mail,
copy files, send e-mail over your name _ ``in short, just about
anything,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most cable and DSL modems also make it easier for hackers to go
after specific computers.
</P>
<P>
   In dial-up systems, the addresses belong to the service
provider's modems, rather than to its customers. When customers
dial in for a connection, each one gets an IP address of the modem
reached for that session; each modem is associated with a finite
number of IP addresses. The next time the computer may well connect
with another modem and get another address, particularly if the
customer has a large service provider operating huge banks of
modems. ``To some extent that's security through obscurity,''
McElearney said.
</P>
<P>
   For cable-modem and DSL customers, not only are their addresses
fixed, they are also often easy to learn. The addresses appear in
the headers (which usually aren't displayed) that travel with every
e-mail message or newsgroup posting customers send.
</P>
<P>
   Many service providers have begun to respond to the problem.
Some, including Road Runner, are introducing a system that
regularly rotates their customers' IP addresses. Addresses based on
this system, however, may not change for several days and will
still appear in the headers.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus is also distressed about one unintended side effect of the
steep decline in computer prices. Inexpensive PCs increasingly mean
that some families now own several computers, all of which can be
serviced by a single high-speed line. To take advantage of that,
some people are setting up mini-networks in their homes, with one
computer acting as the go-between to the Internet for all the
others.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy server software that makes that possible, however,
often has very flawed security measures, Klaus said. To obscure
their identities, sophisticated hackers will first log into a home
network software before launching an attack against their ultimate
target. Junk-mail spammers can resort to the same trick. In either
case, the result can be highly embarrassing for the unsuspecting
home network owner, who will appear to be the originator of the
hacking or spam.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there is not a straightforward answer to the question
of how to guarantee security while enjoying high-speed Internet
connections. For Larry Rogers, who tracks Internet security
problems at Carnegie Mellon University's CERT Coordination Center,
part of the solution is simply hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with these connections need to play systems
administrator,'' he said. ``It's a matter of vigilance.''
</P>
<P>
   That vigilance can include something as simple as having Windows
users make sure that Network Neighborhood _ a file-sharing system _
is turned off. Rogers also suggested steps like regularly
downloading software security patches from Microsoft's Web site or
modifying arcane portions of the operating system. Not
surprisingly, these are just the kind of housekeeping tasks that
many users somehow never get around to.
</P>
<P>
   Some software companies are offering their help. In May,
Sybergen Networks (www.sygate.com), which mostly makes corporate
security protection software, introduced a $29.95 software package
for home users called Syshield. Similar products include Conseal
Private Desktop by Signal 9 Solutions (www.signal9.com).
</P>
<P>
   Such software generally blocks the computer from receiving some
types of data, limiting the paths in for hacker. Syshield can also
be set up to in effect disconnect the computer from the Internet
late at night.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate protection is that now used by Keeney, who has
become a computer-security consultant since his 1997 attack. He has
copied, on a much smaller scale, the system used by most
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   All his Internet business now runs on a network with a single
computer operating as a firewall and using the Linux software
system. Because it is difficult for hackers to get past the
firewall computer in such set-ups, that computer acts as a
sacrificial lamb of sorts. Keeney freely admits, however, that most
home users are unlikely to adopt such a complex setup.
</P>
<P>
   If the speculation in the industry is correct, they may never
have to. Many believe that ``security appliances'' _ extremely
stripped-down computers with security software that sit between
another computer and its Internet connection _ may eventually hit
the consumer market. Such systems for business users are already
available.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, another answer would simply be to put up with the
slow speeds and petty annoyances of a dial-in modem. But for anyone
but the more basic e-mail user, Klaus does not think that is a
great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many benefits that outweigh the security risks,
provided you take precautions,'' he said. To prove his point, Klaus
added that he was now shopping for cable modem service for his
home.

 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last April I wrote a column about Bell Atlantic's new high-speed
DSL (Digital Subscriber Loop) service. In that column, I criticized
the speed of the connection from Bell Atlantic's ISP
(www.bellatlantic.net) to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Using my cable modem in Cambridge, I wrote, I routinely
see round-trip times between Media One and MIT of 2 to 4
milliseconds. But using Bell Atlantic's DSL service, I was seeing
times of 100 to 200 milliseconds.
</P>
<P>
   The day the article was published, a reader sent me a terse
e-mail from his WebTV account. ``Found it astonishing that you
found differences in thousands of seconds not only worth
mentioning, but actually significant! Gosh! How many actual human
users will (care) if one connection takes a smaller fraction of a
second to access the Web? Please!''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the difference between the two connections _
roughly 1/10 of a second _ can be quite noticeable. That's because
delays on the Internet frequently cascade. A few thousandths of a
second here and a few thousandths of a second there can often add
up to delays of a dozen seconds or more. The reason for this
seemingly nonsensical addition has to do with the fact that
information is sent over the Internet in little packets of data,
and that sometimes these packets get lost.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to visualize a packet on the Internet, think of a
postcard moving through the US Postal Service. Each packet has the
address of the person (or computer) that sent it, its destination,
and a little bit of data. Typically packets have between 100 and
500 characters. It might take 100 or more packets to send even a
small photograph across the Internet. I tried downloading the
entire boston.com home page Sunday night; that took 255 packets.
</P>
<P>
   Because packets sometimes get lost, the data sent in each packet
has to be acknowledged after it is received. The time between when
a packet is sent and the acknowledgement is received is the
round-trip time, or latency, that I wrote about in my April column.
And naturally, if a packet is lost, it needs to be sent again.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, designers of the Internet protocol came up with
some clever tricks so each packet doesn't have to be acknowledged
before the next one is sent. Nevertheless, the round-trip time and
the packet loss between your computer and a Web server is usually a
good indication of just how snappy theserver will feel when you are
browsing its pages. When delays are less than 50 milliseconds and
packet loss is less than 2 percent, Web pages seem to come up in an
instant. Delays of more than 500 milliseconds or packet losses of
more than 10 percent generally make you feel like you are surfing
through molasses.
</P>
<P>
   You can measure the latency and packet loss of your own Internet
connections using a program called ``ping,'' which is built into
Windows 95. Just open an MS-DOS Prompt window and type ``ping''
followed by the name of another computer on the Internet, such as
``ping web.mit.edu.'' If you use a Macintosh, two programs that you
can use are Finger and MacPing. Be aware that some Web servers,
including boston.com, block ``ping'' packets.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, programs like ``ping'' only let you look at one
path over the Internet at a time. To get an overall feeling for the
system as a whole you might want to look at one of the growing
number of Internet Weather Reports. These services look at Internet
traffic the way a helicopter might report on the Central Artery.
The University of California at Los Angeles runs a particularly
informative Internet weather service at
http://www.noc.ucla.edu/networking/weather.html. For a nationwide
overview, check out the MIDS weather report at
http://www.internetweather.com/. There is also the Internet Traffic
Report, at http://www.internettraffic.com/, run by Andover.NET in
Acton.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that all of these traffic and weather services are
really looking at the popular Internet ``backbone'' connections in
a given metropolitan area _ they don't necessarily look at the
particular Internet links that your packets will be traveling.
Boston might be having a bad Internet traffic day, for example, but
if your ISP has private links to New York, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C., or San Jose, you might never see a blip.
</P>
<P>
   So that's why in April I was concerned about the differences of
a few thousandths of a second between the Internet connections
offered by Media One and by Bell Atlantic. It may not seem like
much, but there are times when a few thousandths of a second can
make all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   For the record
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when I wrote about Connected Online Backup
(http://www.connected.com/), I should have mentioned that Connected
is just one of several on-line backup systems. If you are
considering an on-line backup system, you should also look at
(at)Backup ($99/year for 100MB of storage, http://www.backup.com);
Atrieva ($14.99/month for 1,000MB of storage,
http://www.i-filezone.com/); and Safeguard Interactive ($9.95 month
for unlimited storage; http://www.sgii.com). Each company offers
slightly different services and pricing models, so if you are
seriously shopping, it pays to look around.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a few weeks ago I wrote about Power Quest's new Lost and
Found data-recovery tool. I said that one of its advantages was
that you could purchase it after your computer suffered a hard disk
crash, since Lost and Found runs off floppy disks. Programs such as
Norton Utilities, I wrote, need to be purchased and installed
before you need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not entirely true,'' says Sherri Walkenhorst, from
Norton's public relations firm. ``Norton Utilities 4.0 has an
emergency floppy disk and bootable CD feature that allows users to
run some of the utilities `after the fact' _ i.e., you can go down
to the store and buy a copy of NU after you've accidentally deleted
a file and still be able to recover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although I still prefer Lost and Found for serious data recovery
tasks, Walkenhorst is right and I stand corrected.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the World Wide Web expands at a staggering rate, search
engines are failing to keep up, according to a study released
Wednesday by two New Jersey researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers estimate that the Web more than doubled in size
between December 1997 and February 1999, but major search engines _
services that probe the Web and provide links to sites matching key
words _ combine to cover less than half of the available cyber
information.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 11 major Internet search engines covers even
one-sixth of the Web's estimated 800 million publicly accessible
pages, according to the study in the journal Nature by Steve
Lawrence and C. Lee Giles of NEC Research Institute in Princeton.
That figure is down from about one-third just 14 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search engines are finding the Web very difficult to
manage,'' Giles said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted in February, found Cambridge-based Northern
Light to be the most expansive engine and Waltham-based Lycos and
Euroseek the least. About 85 percent of Web browsers use search
engines to locate information, they wrote. The study also found
that it may take months for new pages to be recognized by search
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Rajive Mathur, Lycos's director of search services, said his
company's database is five times as large as represented in the
study. Some of the growth has come since the study was completed,
spokesman Brian Payea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``February 1999 is a long time ago in the Internet world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers entered 1,050 queries and analyzed the responses
of search engines. They found the return rates of the engines and
compared them to Northern Light, which said it had indexed 128
million _ or 16 percent _ of the estimated 800 million pages.
</P>
<P>
   Giles said his research indicates that ``catch-all'' search
engines are becoming increasingly inadequate for the sophisticated
Web user. Those users are looking for more specialized information
_ such as science studies _ than Joe Internet, who is logging on
for a cyber test drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't all drive the same kind of car,'' Giles said. The
all-inclusive search may go the way of the Model T, he said. The
concept will last, he said, but there is a growing market for
services that find specialized information, such as the lowest
price for a book.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Web's expansion, Giles said, can be traced to
electronic commerce. He was startled to find that 83 percent of
servers _ which house hundreds of Web sites _ have commercial
content.
</P>
<P>
   New pages are being added to the Web at a clip of 3 million a
day, but the study found that, on average, it took more than six
months for a major search engine to find new documents matching a
given query.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers specifically cited updating scientific
information as an area that would greatly improve the lagging
search engines. Research articles are often available on the Web
much sooner than in traditional databases, they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``An index of all scientific information on the Web would be
feasible and very valuable,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence and Giles conducted a similar study in December 1997
using six search engines. During that study, they estimated the
size of the Web at only 320 million pages. The Web will continue to
grow, but the pace will likely slow, Giles said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 study, the researchers found HotBot covered 34
percent of the pages and the engines combined covered about 60
percent of the Web. Lycos purchased HotBot last year, but continues
to run it as an independent search engine.
</P>
<P>
   The new study found the overlap between engines remains
relatively low, and the major engines combine to cover 42 percent
of the Web, they wrote. Search sites such as MetaCrawler that
combine the results of multiple engines provide a great deal more
coverage, they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Next after Northern Light were Snap and AltaVista, which covered
15.5 percent of the Web. HotBot covered 11.3 percent; Microsoft,
8.5 percent; Infoseek, 8 percent; Google, 7.8 percent; Yahoo, 7.4
percent; Excite, 5.6 percent; Lycos, 2.5 percent, and Euroseek, 2.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   He said the widely used search engines are not indexing more
because it does not help them make more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true for a lot of companies,'' said Marc Krellenstein,
Northern Light's chief technical officer. ``But it's not our
feeling. We've had a goal from the beginning to have a
comprehensive database.''

   Commercekey, an Internet start-up, has come up with a business
plan with a new wrinkle in the crowded electronic commerce market.
In addition to peddling software and transaction services to help
businesses set up shop on the Web, the company, with roots in the
Greek shipping industry, has its own world-class fleet of cargo
vessels standing by to deliver customers' merchandise around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in New York and plans to announce
itself later this week, is a joint venture between two Greek
industrial giants, Vardinoyannis Group of Cos. and Leventis Group.
Together, the two companies give Commercekey access to a huge fleet
of freighters along with a network of climate-controlled warehouses
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Owning its own fleet of vessels could help Commercekey clear one
of the big hurdles in electronic commerce: distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come from a tradition of merchants and bottlers,'' said
Alkiviades David, president and chief executive of Commercekey,
whose family has a major stake in Leventis.
</P>
<P>
   Vardinoyannis owns the biggest oil refinery in Greece, Motor Oil
Hellas, along with numerous television stations, newspapers and
Internet service providers. Leventis, meanwhile, is Greece's
primary Coca-Cola distributor and also owns an Internet
telecommunications network in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   David and Demosthenes Vardinoyannis, Commercekey's chairman, met
while they were in high school in Switzerland many years ago. The
idea for Commercekey grew, in part, out of a video conferencing
venture David had started years ago; that technology has become a

   High Technology for Money Management
</P>
<P>
   You may not be a Silicon Valley gazillionaire, but here is your
chance to manage your money like one.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Clark, the entrepreneurial engineer behind Silicon
Graphics, Netscape and, most recently, Healtheon, has quietly
embarked on his fourth start-up. It's a company focused on
simplifying the financial affairs of wealthy individuals _ or
anybody else willing to pay for the service.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, called MyCFO, grew out of Clark's own need for a
personal chief financial officer to handle his affairs and track
his investments. ``It was totally out of control,'' said Clark,
whose net worth is an estimated $500 million. (Tax time was
particularly difficult, he said.)
</P>
<P>
   So about two years ago, Clark hired Harvey Armstrong, a former
KPMG manager, who came up with a Web-based system that supplies
Clark and his various financial consultants with access to all of
Clark's financial records. Late last year they decided to found a
company on the concept.
</P>
<P>
   MyCFO (www.mycfo.com), whose clients include John Chambers,
chief executive of Cisco Systems, already has some 20 employees,
including four financial managers, and offices across the street
from the Silicon Graphics headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With all his recent successes, including the recent $5.5 billion
merger of Healtheon with another online health information service,
WebMD, Clark appears to have had no trouble finding investors. The
list includes Chambers, the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins
Caufield &AMP; Byers, and Thomas Jermoluk, chairman and chief executive
of Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is acting chief executive and chairman of the company,
while Armstrong is acting president, although Clark hopes to hire
an outsider to be chief executive and president by the fall. At
that point, Armstrong would become the lead financial consultant
for MyCFO.

   Wrestling Games Trounce All Comers on Video
</P>
<P>
   Can the professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin trounce
those intergalactic ``Star Wars'' heroes wielding light sabers? Yes
_ at least in the world of video games.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of wrestling-related video games from January through May
increased by 23 percent, to $60 million, over the comparable period
last year, according to NPD Group, a Port Washington, N.Y.,
research group. That increase outpaced the growth of video-game
sales generally, which grew 14 percent, to $1.9 billion during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the launch of `Star Wars' in May, wrestling-related
merchandise will likely be among the industry's best sellers when
final numbers are released at year end,'' said Ed Roth, president
of NPD Leisure Activities, a Glen Cove, N.Y., research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Bell, a publicist for THQ Inc., said wrestling-related video
games ``have been frighteningly successful.'' THQ publishes three
of this year's best-selling titles: ``WCW/NWO Thunder'' for Sony's
Playstation, the top wrestling title; ``WCW/NWO Revenge'' for
Nintendo 64; and ``WCW Nitro'' for Nintendo, Playstation and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is the featured character in ``WWF War Zone'' by Acclaim,
one of the year's best-selling titles.
</P>
<P>
   If the strong pace of sales keeps up, few wrestlers may be
tempted to follow the path of their former colleague Jesse ``the
Body'' Ventura into the political arena. Who needs the governor's
mansion, when there's a shot at becoming a lead character in a
Playstation title?

   High Technology for Money Management
</P>
<P>
   You may not be a Silicon Valley gazillionaire, but here is your
chance to manage your money like one.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Clark, the entrepreneurial engineer behind Silicon
Graphics, Netscape and, most recently, Healtheon, has quietly
embarked on his fourth start-up. It's a company focused on
simplifying the financial affairs of wealthy individuals _ or
anybody else willing to pay for the service.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, called MyCFO, grew out of Clark's own need for a
personal chief financial officer to handle his affairs and track
his investments. ``It was totally out of control,'' said Clark,
whose net worth is an estimated $500 million. (Tax time was
particularly difficult, he said.)
</P>
<P>
   So about two years ago, Clark hired Harvey Armstrong, a former
KPMG manager, who came up with a Web-based system that supplies
Clark and his various financial consultants with access to all of
Clark's financial records. Late last year they decided to found a
company on the concept.
</P>
<P>
   MyCFO (www.mycfo.com), whose clients include John Chambers,
chief executive of Cisco Systems, already has some 20 employees,
including four financial managers, and offices across the street
from the Silicon Graphics headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With all his recent successes, including the recent $5.5 billion
merger of Healtheon with another online health information service,
WebMD, Clark appears to have had no trouble finding investors. The
list includes Chambers, the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins
Caufield &AMP; Byers, and Thomas Jermoluk, chairman and chief executive
of Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is acting chief executive and chairman of the company,
while Armstrong is acting president, although Clark hopes to hire
an outsider to be chief executive and president by the fall. At
that point, Armstrong would become the lead financial consultant
for MyCFO.

   Wrestling Games Trounce All Comers on Video
</P>
<P>
   Can the professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin trounce
those intergalactic ``Star Wars'' heroes wielding light sabers? Yes
_ at least in the world of video games.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of wrestling-related video games from January through May
increased by 23 percent, to $60 million, over the comparable period
last year, according to NPD Group, a Port Washington, N.Y.,
research group. That increase outpaced the growth of video-game
sales generally, which grew 14 percent, to $1.9 billion during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the launch of `Star Wars' in May, wrestling-related
merchandise will likely be among the industry's best sellers when
final numbers are released at year end,'' said Ed Roth, president
of NPD Leisure Activities, a Glen Cove, N.Y., research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Bell, a publicist for THQ Inc., said wrestling-related video
games ``have been frighteningly successful.'' THQ publishes three
of this year's best-selling titles: ``WCW/NWO Thunder'' for Sony's
Playstation, the top wrestling title; ``WCW/NWO Revenge'' for
Nintendo 64; and ``WCW Nitro'' for Nintendo, Playstation and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is the featured character in ``WWF War Zone'' by Acclaim,
one of the year's best-selling titles.
</P>
<P>
   If the strong pace of sales keeps up, few wrestlers may be
tempted to follow the path of their former colleague Jesse ``the
Body'' Ventura into the political arena. Who needs the governor's
mansion, when there's a shot at becoming a lead character in a
Playstation title?

<P>
   As the World Wide Web expands at a staggering rate, search
engines are failing to keep up, according to a study released
Wednesday by two New Jersey researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers estimate that the Web more than doubled in size
between December 1997 and February 1999, but major search engines _
services that probe the Web and provide links to sites matching key
words _ combine to cover less than half of the available cyber
information.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 11 major Internet search engines covers even
one-sixth of the Web's estimated 800 million publicly accessible
pages, according to the study in the journal Nature by Steve
Lawrence and C. Lee Giles of NEC Research Institute in Princeton.
That figure is down from about one-third just 14 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search engines are finding the Web very difficult to
manage,'' Giles said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted in February, found Cambridge-based Northern
Light to be the most expansive engine and Waltham-based Lycos and
Euroseek the least. About 85 percent of Web browsers use search
engines to locate information, they wrote. The study also found
that it may take months for new pages to be recognized by search
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Rajive Mathur, Lycos's director of search services, said his
company's database is five times as large as represented in the
study. Some of the growth has come since the study was completed,
spokesman Brian Payea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``February 1999 is a long time ago in the Internet world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers entered 1,050 queries and analyzed the responses
of search engines. They found the return rates of the engines and
compared them to Northern Light, which said it had indexed 128
million _ or 16 percent _ of the estimated 800 million pages.
</P>
<P>
   Giles said his research indicates that ``catch-all'' search
engines are becoming increasingly inadequate for the sophisticated
Web user. Those users are looking for more specialized information
_ such as science studies _ than Joe Internet, who is logging on
for a cyber test drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't all drive the same kind of car,'' Giles said. The
all-inclusive search may go the way of the Model T, he said. The
concept will last, he said, but there is a growing market for
services that find specialized information, such as the lowest
price for a book.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Web's expansion, Giles said, can be traced to
electronic commerce. He was startled to find that 83 percent of
servers _ which house hundreds of Web sites _ have commercial
content.
</P>
<P>
   New pages are being added to the Web at a clip of 3 million a
day, but the study found that, on average, it took more than six
months for a major search engine to find new documents matching a
given query.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers specifically cited updating scientific
information as an area that would greatly improve the lagging
search engines. Research articles are often available on the Web
much sooner than in traditional databases, they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``An index of all scientific information on the Web would be
feasible and very valuable,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence and Giles conducted a similar study in December 1997
using six search engines. During that study, they estimated the
size of the Web at only 320 million pages. The Web will continue to
grow, but the pace will likely slow, Giles said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 study, the researchers found HotBot covered 34
percent of the pages and the engines combined covered about 60
percent of the Web. Lycos purchased HotBot last year, but continues
to run it as an independent search engine.
</P>
<P>
   The new study found the overlap between engines remains
relatively low, and the major engines combine to cover 42 percent
of the Web, they wrote. Search sites such as MetaCrawler that
combine the results of multiple engines provide a great deal more
coverage, they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Next after Northern Light were Snap and AltaVista, which covered
15.5 percent of the Web. HotBot covered 11.3 percent; Microsoft,
8.5 percent; Infoseek, 8 percent; Google, 7.8 percent; Yahoo, 7.4
percent; Excite, 5.6 percent; Lycos, 2.5 percent, and Euroseek, 2.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   He said the widely used search engines are not indexing more
because it does not help them make more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true for a lot of companies,'' said Marc Krellenstein,
Northern Light's chief technical officer. ``But it's not our
feeling. We've had a goal from the beginning to have a
comprehensive database.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last April I wrote a column about Bell Atlantic's new high-speed
DSL (Digital Subscriber Loop) service. In that column, I criticized
the speed of the connection from Bell Atlantic's ISP
(www.bellatlantic.net) to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Using my cable modem in Cambridge, I wrote, I routinely
see round-trip times between Media One and MIT of 2 to 4
milliseconds. But using Bell Atlantic's DSL service, I was seeing
times of 100 to 200 milliseconds.
</P>
<P>
   The day the article was published, a reader sent me a terse
e-mail from his WebTV account. ``Found it astonishing that you
found differences in thousands of seconds not only worth
mentioning, but actually significant! Gosh! How many actual human
users will (care) if one connection takes a smaller fraction of a
second to access the Web? Please!''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the difference between the two connections _
roughly 1/10 of a second _ can be quite noticeable. That's because
delays on the Internet frequently cascade. A few thousandths of a
second here and a few thousandths of a second there can often add
up to delays of a dozen seconds or more. The reason for this
seemingly nonsensical addition has to do with the fact that
information is sent over the Internet in little packets of data,
and that sometimes these packets get lost.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to visualize a packet on the Internet, think of a
postcard moving through the US Postal Service. Each packet has the
address of the person (or computer) that sent it, its destination,
and a little bit of data. Typically packets have between 100 and
500 characters. It might take 100 or more packets to send even a
small photograph across the Internet. I tried downloading the
entire boston.com home page Sunday night; that took 255 packets.
</P>
<P>
   Because packets sometimes get lost, the data sent in each packet
has to be acknowledged after it is received. The time between when
a packet is sent and the acknowledgement is received is the
round-trip time, or latency, that I wrote about in my April column.
And naturally, if a packet is lost, it needs to be sent again.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, designers of the Internet protocol came up with
some clever tricks so each packet doesn't have to be acknowledged
before the next one is sent. Nevertheless, the round-trip time and
the packet loss between your computer and a Web server is usually a
good indication of just how snappy theserver will feel when you are
browsing its pages. When delays are less than 50 milliseconds and
packet loss is less than 2 percent, Web pages seem to come up in an
instant. Delays of more than 500 milliseconds or packet losses of
more than 10 percent generally make you feel like you are surfing
through molasses.
</P>
<P>
   You can measure the latency and packet loss of your own Internet
connections using a program called ``ping,'' which is built into
Windows 95. Just open an MS-DOS Prompt window and type ``ping''
followed by the name of another computer on the Internet, such as
``ping web.mit.edu.'' If you use a Macintosh, two programs that you
can use are Finger and MacPing. Be aware that some Web servers,
including boston.com, block ``ping'' packets.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, programs like ``ping'' only let you look at one
path over the Internet at a time. To get an overall feeling for the
system as a whole you might want to look at one of the growing
number of Internet Weather Reports. These services look at Internet
traffic the way a helicopter might report on the Central Artery.
The University of California at Los Angeles runs a particularly
informative Internet weather service at
http://www.noc.ucla.edu/networking/weather.html. For a nationwide
overview, check out the MIDS weather report at
http://www.internetweather.com/. There is also the Internet Traffic
Report, at http://www.internettraffic.com/, run by Andover.NET in
Acton.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that all of these traffic and weather services are
really looking at the popular Internet ``backbone'' connections in
a given metropolitan area _ they don't necessarily look at the
particular Internet links that your packets will be traveling.
Boston might be having a bad Internet traffic day, for example, but
if your ISP has private links to New York, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C., or San Jose, you might never see a blip.
</P>
<P>
   So that's why in April I was concerned about the differences of
a few thousandths of a second between the Internet connections
offered by Media One and by Bell Atlantic. It may not seem like
much, but there are times when a few thousandths of a second can
make all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   For the record
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when I wrote about Connected Online Backup
(http://www.connected.com/), I should have mentioned that Connected
is just one of several on-line backup systems. If you are
considering an on-line backup system, you should also look at
(at)Backup ($99/year for 100MB of storage, http://www.backup.com);
Atrieva ($14.99/month for 1,000MB of storage,
http://www.i-filezone.com/); and Safeguard Interactive ($9.95 month
for unlimited storage; http://www.sgii.com). Each company offers
slightly different services and pricing models, so if you are
seriously shopping, it pays to look around.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a few weeks ago I wrote about Power Quest's new Lost and
Found data-recovery tool. I said that one of its advantages was
that you could purchase it after your computer suffered a hard disk
crash, since Lost and Found runs off floppy disks. Programs such as
Norton Utilities, I wrote, need to be purchased and installed
before you need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not entirely true,'' says Sherri Walkenhorst, from
Norton's public relations firm. ``Norton Utilities 4.0 has an
emergency floppy disk and bootable CD feature that allows users to
run some of the utilities `after the fact' _ i.e., you can go down
to the store and buy a copy of NU after you've accidentally deleted
a file and still be able to recover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although I still prefer Lost and Found for serious data recovery
tasks, Walkenhorst is right and I stand corrected.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About two weeks after Frank Keeney was first connected to cable
modem service in Pasadena, Calif., he discovered that along with
the delights of a 24-hour connection and high-speed Internet access
came the potential for big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to log in and found that someone had compromised my
computer,'' he recalled. ``When you log into a Linux system, it
will normally show a short message stating the last time logged in
and from where. Since I had not logged in for a week or so, I knew
there was trouble. I checked to see if someone else was online and,
sure enough, he was on at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to kill his log-in session, but it was too late. He
had already issued the command to erase every file on the computer.
I watched while he erased everything on my hard drive.'`
</P>
<P>
   Keeney's experience is not isolated, several computer security
experts said. The shift from dial-up Internet connections to cable
modems and DSL (digital subscriber lines _ fast, constant links to
the Net that use telephone lines) are making home computer users
vulnerable to the types of attacks from hackers that in the past
were almost exclusively a worry for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people aren't thinking at this level yet,'' said
Christopher Klaus, chief technology officer for Internet Security
Systems, an Atlanta-based maker of complex security analysis
software used by large corporations. ``Service providers are
looking at trying to put as many people on the Internet as
possible. The more security isn't brought up as an issue, the
greater the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable modems and DSL lines are presenting two new problems for
ordinary residential users. The biggest source of trouble comes
simply because these lines mean that users are constantly connected
to the Net, so their computers are always potential targets of
hackers..
</P>
<P>
   The second problem has to do with the types of connections used
by faster lines. Communications between computers on the Internet
rely on a series of numbers known as IP, or Internet protocol,
addresses. For dial-up users, those addresses are constantly
shifting, making them their computers elusive targets. While it can
be a nuisance to dial in to reach the Net every time you want to
check your e-mail, the practice automatically provides its own
measure of security.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately the protection afforded by the dial-up shell game
largely or completely vanishes with cable modems or DSL lines.
Because their customers don't flit on and off the Net, many high
speed service operators give them fixed IP addresses.
</P>
<P>
   While they may not be publicizing their new services' security
problems with the vigor they bring to boasting about the more
desirable features, cable modem and DSL providers acknowledge that
their residential customers are facing new kinds of security woes _
even if personal computers, of course, are less likely to be the
targets of hackers than are corporate or government systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are today, from a consumer standpoint, is where
companies were back in the late '80s, when firewalls weren't a big
issue,'' said Kevin McElearney, vice president of network support
services at Road Runner, a cable modem partnership that includes
Time Warner Entertainment, the Mediaone Group, Microsoft, Compaq
and Advance/Newhouse. Residential customers using high-speed
services, he said, ``are in an environment where they have to
realize that there are security issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your risk is increased the longer you leave any computer
connected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning together in this new world of always being
online in the home,'' said Jeff Waldhuter, director of technology
and engineering at Bell Atlantic Science and Technology Center, the
research branch of the telephone company and DSL service provider.
``Now that we're getting on with these connections, we're learning
that we have to add more security. We're growing up. These networks
are going to be vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to the always-connected world seems to have come at a
somewhat inopportune time. Internet Security Systems has been
tracking a ``dramatic increase'' in the use of a hacking technique
known variously as probing, sniffing or scanning, Klaus said.
Probing software automatically scans computers connected to the
Internet and evaluates the level of their security protection,
looking for weak systems vulnerable to easy attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon to have someone twist the doorknob of your
home computer,'' McElearney said.
</P>
<P>
   For probers, a typical home computer running Apple's Mac OS or
Windows 95 or 98 without the maker's latest security updates or
additional security software is the closest thing to an unlocked
door they are likely to find.
</P>
<P>
   After his hard drive disaster, Keeney installed security
software on his computer in Pasedena that tracks and records
break-in attempts by probing software. He has found that unwanted
visitors test his computer's security about twice a day. ``Most
computers on cable modems will be probed,'' he said. ``If
weaknesses are found, someone will exploit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike people who create and spread viruses or worms, probers
don't need the computer's owner to advance their cause
inadvertently by, say, opening a tainted e-mail attachment. For
them, an insecure system offers seemingly endless potential.
Keeney's hard drive crash is an extreme example of what hackers can
do once inside a computer. But others can cause just as much harm
even though they come and go without leaving an immediate trace.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Sullivan said, once hackers gain entry they
can extract credit card numbers from stored files, read e-mail,
copy files, send e-mail over your name _ ``in short, just about
anything,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most cable and DSL modems also make it easier for hackers to go
after specific computers.
</P>
<P>
   In dial-up systems, the addresses belong to the service
provider's modems, rather than to its customers. When customers
dial in for a connection, each one gets an IP address of the modem
reached for that session; each modem is associated with a finite
number of IP addresses. The next time the computer may well connect
with another modem and get another address, particularly if the
customer has a large service provider operating huge banks of
modems. ``To some extent that's security through obscurity,''
McElearney said.
</P>
<P>
   For cable-modem and DSL customers, not only are their addresses
fixed, they are also often easy to learn. The addresses appear in
the headers (which usually aren't displayed) that travel with every
e-mail message or newsgroup posting customers send.
</P>
<P>
   Many service providers have begun to respond to the problem.
Some, including Road Runner, are introducing a system that
regularly rotates their customers' IP addresses. Addresses based on
this system, however, may not change for several days and will
still appear in the headers.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus is also distressed about one unintended side effect of the
steep decline in computer prices. Inexpensive PCs increasingly mean
that some families now own several computers, all of which can be
serviced by a single high-speed line. To take advantage of that,
some people are setting up mini-networks in their homes, with one
computer acting as the go-between to the Internet for all the
others.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy server software that makes that possible, however,
often has very flawed security measures, Klaus said. To obscure
their identities, sophisticated hackers will first log into a home
network software before launching an attack against their ultimate
target. Junk-mail spammers can resort to the same trick. In either
case, the result can be highly embarrassing for the unsuspecting
home network owner, who will appear to be the originator of the
hacking or spam.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there is not a straightforward answer to the question
of how to guarantee security while enjoying high-speed Internet
connections. For Larry Rogers, who tracks Internet security
problems at Carnegie Mellon University's CERT Coordination Center,
part of the solution is simply hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with these connections need to play systems
administrator,'' he said. ``It's a matter of vigilance.''
</P>
<P>
   That vigilance can include something as simple as having Windows
users make sure that Network Neighborhood _ a file-sharing system _
is turned off. Rogers also suggested steps like regularly
downloading software security patches from Microsoft's Web site or
modifying arcane portions of the operating system. Not
surprisingly, these are just the kind of housekeeping tasks that
many users somehow never get around to.
</P>
<P>
   Some software companies are offering their help. In May,
Sybergen Networks (www.sygate.com), which mostly makes corporate
security protection software, introduced a $29.95 software package
for home users called Syshield. Similar products include Conseal
Private Desktop by Signal 9 Solutions (www.signal9.com).
</P>
<P>
   Such software generally blocks the computer from receiving some
types of data, limiting the paths in for hacker. Syshield can also
be set up to in effect disconnect the computer from the Internet
late at night.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate protection is that now used by Keeney, who has
become a computer-security consultant since his 1997 attack. He has
copied, on a much smaller scale, the system used by most
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   All his Internet business now runs on a network with a single
computer operating as a firewall and using the Linux software
system. Because it is difficult for hackers to get past the
firewall computer in such set-ups, that computer acts as a
sacrificial lamb of sorts. Keeney freely admits, however, that most
home users are unlikely to adopt such a complex setup.
</P>
<P>
   If the speculation in the industry is correct, they may never
have to. Many believe that ``security appliances'' _ extremely
stripped-down computers with security software that sit between
another computer and its Internet connection _ may eventually hit
the consumer market. Such systems for business users are already
available.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, another answer would simply be to put up with the
slow speeds and petty annoyances of a dial-in modem. But for anyone
but the more basic e-mail user, Klaus does not think that is a
great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many benefits that outweigh the security risks,
provided you take precautions,'' he said. To prove his point, Klaus
added that he was now shopping for cable modem service for his
home.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swept up in the phenomenal rush of the global Internet that it
helped create, the personal computer industry is undergoing a
fundamental transformation.
</P>
<P>
   The PC has become inextricably linked to the Internet, causing
the two formerly distinct businesses to blend. Several PC makers
have begun offering free Internet access as an inducement to sell
more machines, while several Internet service providers have begun
giving away computers, or subsidizing their purchase, to entice
more customers to sign up for online services.
</P>
<P>
   Still another group of companies has started giving computers to
customers who agree to look at online advertising. The companies
hope that they can attract advertisers who are trying to reach a
population that is spending less time in front of the TV and more
time in front of the PC.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer, which gained popular acceptance in the
1980s for its ability to perform a wide variety of business and
scientific tasks, is increasingly being recognized in the late
1990s as primarily a communications device that enables anyone to
send and receive e-mail, participate in discussion groups and
browse for information on the Internet's World Wide Web. Marketing
surveys confirm that Internet access is the main reason people buy
a PC today.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the PC is following the model of the cellular phone,
which is often given away or sold at low cost to customers who sign
up for service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the largest Internet service providers, America
Online's Compuserve unit, the Microsoft Network and Prodigy
Internet, now offer $400 rebate programs that cover at least part
of the cost of a new PC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several of the largest PC makers, including Compaq,
Dell and Gateway, are driving the cost of their basic computers
well below $1,000 and experimenting with free Internet access to
get more customers.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy, CompUSA, Microcenter and Circuit City are among the
large national retailers that are offering similar deals in
conjunction with Internet service contracts, making the cost of a
PC comparable to the cost of, say, a video cassette recorder.
During test marketing at some stores, they have offered weekend
specials: a PC for $400, with a $400 instant rebate. Circuit City
offered a bundle of a monitor and printer for $99 extra.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as a free lunch, of course, and caveats
abound in these new schemes. There are no complete PC systems
available for $400, and the PC's that come closest are typically
bare-bones machines with minimal features, dubious warranties and
limited free technical support. The offers typically do not apply
to Apple Macintosh computers or PC companion devices like the Palm
Pilot. The Internet service contracts require payments of $700 or
more over three years, and if the customer gets frustrated by the
quality of the PC or the Internet service during that time, three
years is a very long time to stew.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is no doubt that these programs make
owning a PC and getting connected to the Internet much less
expensive than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a customer can buy a $399 Emachines PC with
Compuserve software already installed, sign up for a three-year
Compuserve account at $21.95 a month and get a $400 rebate check
from America Online. The Emachines computer does not come with a
monitor, which adds $100 or so. And while Compuserve is owned by
America Online, it lacks the strong lineup of family and
child-friendly features that have made AOL the world's most popular
online service.
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy, once the largest online service in America before it
fell on hard times, this month announced a rebate plan with the
Best Buy Co., the country's largest consumer PC retail chain. A
customer who signs a three-year contract for Prodigy Internet
access at $19.95 a month will get a $400 rebate that can be applied
to the cost of any desktop or portable PC at Best Buy. A two-year
contract will get a $250 rebate; a one-year plan, $100.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Network, or MSN, is testing a $400 rebate plan in
15 Microcenter computer stores, and last weekend it conducted a
limited ``free PC'' test with Staples office products stores. Like
the others, MSN requires a three-year commitment at $19.95 a month.
Microcenter has a $449 PC, but it does not include a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq offers free Internet access with its Presario line of
home computers, including one model that costs $599 with a monitor,
through a rapidly growing Internet service company called Net Zero.
Net Zero requires customers to reveal personal information and to
agree to watch advertisements geared to their interests. Compaq
also offers Internet access under its own Compaq.net service for
prices starting at $11.99 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway offers one year of free Internet access with any machine
priced over $1,000 and is said to be negotiating to buy Earthlink,
a major Internet service company.
</P>
<P>
   Global demand remains strong for powerful and expensive PC's
that can perform complex operations like managing large customer
accounts, designing software or playing the latest
three-dimensional computer games. But in the past year, consumers
have come to see PC's _ especially those that cost less than $1,000
_ mainly as the boxes that say ``You've Got Mail!'' and allow them
to buy books, trade stocks and participate in electronic garage
sales and auctions without leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   Although low-cost PC's are not suitable for designing rocket
ships or playing the latest 3-D games, most are more than adequate
for handling simple applications like e-mail, Web browsing and
online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, PC's appealed mainly to consumers who were
technologically adept or brave enough to put up with such a
notoriously complex, frustrating and expensive device. The
penetration of PC's into American homes reached about 40 percent,
then stayed there for several years, suggesting that most people
who wanted a PC already had one.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has changed the landscape. The superiority of
e-mail over postal mail for keeping in touch with friends and
family, coupled with the ubiquity of ``www'' Internet addresses on
television and in print advertisements, is piquing the interest of
many consumers who until now had resisted owning a computer. They
may still hate the idea of having a computer, but they love the
idea of being on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With their new ``free PC'' plans, the Internet companies are
hoping to reach many of the 45 million American households that
have lacked either the interest or the money to bring PC's into
their homes. The ``free Internet'' schemes of the PC makers are
heading toward the same goal from the opposite route.
</P>
<P>
   If the most optimistic forecasts come true, computers may soon
become as ubiquitous as telephones or television sets. For that to
happen, PC's are going to have to be as easy to use as telephones
and television sets, which is definitely not the case today.
</P>
<P>
   But the price is right, finally.

STUDY SHOWS LOS ANGELES TRAILS ONLY THE SILICON VALLEY ON LIST OF
HIGH-TECH REGIONS

(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   The
entertainment industry helped make the Los Angeles metropolitan
area the nation's second-largest high-tech region last year,
trailing only the Silicon Valley, a study released Tuesday showed.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The report by the nonprofit Milken Institute said the Los
Angeles-Long Beach metro area accounted for 5.11 percent, or better
than $1 of every $20, of the nation's output in the high-tech
sector.
</P>
<P>
   The first-ever study asserted that Los Angeles' high ranking
resulted from growth in multimedia entertainment, including
special-effects companies serving the film industry, television,
video games and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles also ranked an impressive third among so-called
``Tech-Poles,'' the institute's name for areas with high
concentrations of and output from high-tech industries such as
computer services, drug manufacturing, motion picture production
and aerospace. Northern California's San Jose metro area, which
includes the Silicon Valley, also earned first place in that
category while Dallas ranked as the second-largest Tech-Pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really positive news, because we were really
lagging behind five or six years ago,'' Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan said of the study results. ``We've really come a long way
since then.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-area numbers are somewhat inflated because not
all motion picture production and services use advanced technology,
according to Ross DeVol, the institute's director of regional and
demographic studies and primary author of the report. But he noted
that the numbers boded well for the area's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the decline in aerospace work, he said, ``It's
remarkable how much high-tech activity remains in the Los Angeles
area.''
</P>
<P>
   A large part of that continued success, DeVol said, is the
proximity of top-flight universities and research institutions and
a pool of talented workers in high-tech service areas such as
computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   Motion picture production and services were included in the
rankings to reflect emerging technologies such as computer
animation and digital-audio sound effects. But even without the
motion picture segment _ which the report estimated at about 4
percent of the area's total economy _ Los Angeles-Long Beach would
rank seventh in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In its 123 pages of rankings, charts and economic analysis, the
Milken Institute study _ titled ``America's High-Tech Economy:
Growth, Development, and Risks for Metropolitan Areas'' _ argued
that high-tech industries have spearheaded the economic growth of
both the United States and its metro areas.
</P>
<P>
   The study claims that annual growth in high-tech products and
services averaged 20percent over the past three years, ``directly
elevating'' the overall U.S. Gross Domestic Product by 1.5percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The report also listed ways that government investment
contributes to, and can further support, the industry. Key areas
include lifelong learning programs, tax incentives, minimizing
regulations and the role of research institutions and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The information is particularly important to city governments,
DeVol said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't address these critical factors, their residents
risk being left behind in the new economy,'' DeVol said.``Their
standard of living is going to be directly related to how well they
do in these high-tech industries.''
</P>
<P>
   But the institute's report said the rising importance of the
high-tech industry will bring risks as well as benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the report simulated the effects of a ``1990-91 style
recession,'' concluding that ``high-tech manufacturing industries
would experience a substantially more severe decline than the
overall economy and could even exacerbate the overall decline in
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the high-tech industry, particularly the
computer and office-equipment segment, is reacting more in line
with changes in the overall business cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed that any embrace of the high-tech industry
should be a cautious one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants what the Silicon Valley has,'' said Tom
Lieser, executive director of the Anderson Forecast at the
University of California, Los Angeles. ``The question is, as the
industry becomes more mature and more cyclical, it poses a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing social tension is another risk.
</P>
<P>
   Besides an influx of immigrants and a dramatic economic shift,
the high-tech industry can contribute to income disparities and
tension, DeVol said, adding that the government needs to play a
problem-solving role in that area.
</P>
<P>

according to a Milken Institute study released Tuesday:
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Jackson can't remember the last time he wrote a check and
hasn't spoken face to face with a bank teller in years. Jackson has
handled his personal banking online with Bank Boston since 1989,
and he expanded to online banking for his public relations business
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although he experienced two instances of bank errors that cost
him several hours on the phone with customer service, that has not
deterred him from banking online. ``I think I've had to deal with
the best and worst that it has to offer,'' Jackson said. ``It's
easy to set up and it can be incredibly convenient, but anyone who
has really bad financial habits may find that their problems will
be exacerbated when they go online. It's definitely not for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   One big difference with many online banking accounts is that as
soon as you direct the bank to send out a payment from your
account, that money's gone. You can't mail out a $50 check and
figure that you can get to the bank to deposit the money to cover
the check before it's presented by the recipient's bank for
payment. But one thing online customers gain is convenience _ the
bank's always open for business.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Jackson was unusual. Although some of the
largest banks in the country, including Wells Fargo, Citibank and
Chase Manhattan, have offered their customers online bill-payment
options for nearly a decade, only during the last couple of years
have customers really started to warm to the idea of clicking on
the Send button at an online banking site.
</P>
<P>
   According to IDC, a market research firm in Framingham, Mass.,
the number of people in the United States participating in at least
one online banking function (like viewing deposits, transferring
money between accounts and paying bills) rose to 12.4 million in
1999 from 1.4 million in 1996. IDC expects that number to rise to
18.7 million by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts cite the widespread availability of
modem-equipped computers as one reason for the increase in online
banking activity. They add that people are also finally starting to
get comfortable with the notion that entering bank account
information online is no riskier than giving a credit card number
over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online trading has really made people aware of how to bank
online,'' said Mitch Caplan, president of Telebank, a phone- and
Internet-based bank. ``The security issues aren't really there any
more.'' But while online trading offers discount services, many
banks charge more for online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It has become much more convenient to pay bills and transfer
money to other accounts via computer because many banks are moving
their entire online consumer banking areas onto the Internet and
off private networks, which required the customer to use
communications software and a modem to dial directly into a
company's computer system.
</P>
<P>
   To pay bills online with Chase in 1994, for example, a customer
had to call Chase's customer service and order software disks for
logging onto a private network. Since Chase moved its online
banking functions to the Internet last February, online customers
have been able to gain access to their accounts from any PC with an
Internet connection by going to the bank's Web site and punching in
an identifying name and password.
</P>
<P>
   So what should you expect if you wean yourself from your
checkbook? Setting up access to your bank account via the Internet
is relatively simple. After securing your bank accounts with a
customer ID and a password, you enter the account numbers and
addresses of each company or person you pay regularly. As long as
you can provide that information, you can send payments to large
companies (like your cable and credit card companies) as well as to
individuals, like your piano teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks charge a monthly fee, usually $5 to $15, for
unlimited bill payments, but many are providing Internet banking
access and bill payments at no extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience of online banking has won some fans, like Lisa
and Alex Giassa of Teaneck, N.J., who have had an online account
since August 1998. ``It's definitely a convenience thing for us,''
Ms. Giassa said. ``If I know I have a bill due in a few days, I can
go upstairs, pay it in a couple of minutes and not deal with any
envelopes.''
</P>
<P>
   But lest you think that the click of a Send button will
instantaneously send off your son's college tuition payment on the
day it is due, think again. Only about half of electronic payments
are actually transmitted to recipients electronically. Many utility
companies and merchants are not set up to receive electronic
payments. Such companies are sent checks via regular mail _ an
annoying lesson for those who don't make allowances for the delayed
delivery and miss payment deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   And that delay brings up the question of the ``float'' and why
there's more of a float in electronic banking. In banking terms, a
float is the period between the time you issue a check and the time
it becomes available to the recipient. If you issue a check to an
out-of-state recipient, the money will not be credited to the
account of that company or person for up to five business days
after the check gets to the recipient's bank. A recipient in the
same state gets access to the money in up to three business days
after it is deposited, while someone with an account at the same
bank will get the money within one business day.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a regular checking account and issue a check, the
money won't be deducted until it is presented to your bank by the
recipient's bank for payment. But for many electronic accounts, the
bank automatically debits your online account soon after you hit
the button to instruct the bank to issue a check out of your
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The float is a big psychological issue for a lot of people,''
said Jim Bruene, editor of Online Banking Report, an industry
newsletter. ``The tighter someone's funds are, the more he or she
relies on it. None of this is very meaningful when you're making 2
percent interest on cash balances.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some organization _ sometimes a bank, sometimes a
check-processing company _ is able to hang onto your money for the
length of the float means that it can make money off your money, in
very short-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a payment is taken out of an online account right
away, that doesn't necessarily mean that the recipient of the money
is paid quickly. For example, Philip Goodman, a film and video
producer in Manhattan, paid a friend $25 out of his Chase Online
checking account. His checking account was debited quickly, but the
money did not show up in the recipient's account for three days,
Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's electronic, but it's not,'' he complained.
``They debit your account and then send a check. I can send a
check!''
</P>
<P>
   Most online banks use third-party check consolidators like
Checkfree to process the checks from online accounts, send them
along and disburse the money. In those cases, the bank pays
Checkfree the amount of the check, and Checkfree pays the company
or person receiving the check.
</P>
<P>
   If the check recipient is set up to receive payments
electronically, through a process known as electronic transfer, the
payments move through an automated clearing-house system within 24
hours, said Matthew Lewis, a senior vice president at Checkfree.
</P>
<P>
   But if the recipient is not set up to receive payments
electronically, Checkfree mails a check to the recipient's bank,
where it is processed in a transaction that can take up to five
business days if the payment crosses state lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is not sure about online banking's effect on
the float. ``We've tried to do what we can to manage float, but
whatever happens with the electronic technology is still an unknown
at this point,'' said Doug Tillet, a spokesman for the New York
Federal Reserve Bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Knowing that money is paid out of an account right away can help
online customers if they want to make last-minute electronic
payments, he added. If the recipient of a payment is set up to
receive electronic transfers, most online banking customers can
issue a payment at, say, 4:59 p.m. on the day the payment is due
and won't have to allow for mail delivery times.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bank Rate Monitor, an online service that tracks
interest rates for credit cards and personal loans offered by major
banks, at least 215 of the 350 largest Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.-insured banks in the country offer the ability to pay bills
electronically. But bill consolidators like Checkfree are also
providing electronic payment services to nontraditional banks on
the Internet, which means your choice of where on the Internet to
pay your bills is becoming a lot broader. Internet-only banks can
be a good choice for people who keep a lot of money in their
checking accounts because they generally pay higher interest, but
they also tend to charge higher fees for automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Personal and business financial software like Quicken and
Microsoft Money offer an electronic bill-paying option via
Checkfree. Customers can also use such software, which gives a user
an overall financial picture, with many types of online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bill payments, Checkfree and other consolidators,
like Transpoint and Cybercash, are also working with banks and
other financial sites to bring your bills and account information
to you online.
</P>
<P>
   With its E-card, First U.S.A., a leading credit card issuer,
offers customers online access to detailed information about their
credit card purchases as well as the ability to pay their bills
online. Many banks are finding ways to let customers see their
bills online as a way of offering better service than the
nontraditional banking competitors who are zeroing in on their
business.
</P>
<P>
   A type of bill-presentment service was recently announced by
Chase Manhattan Bank, First Union and Wells Fargo; they are forming
a new company that will enable people and businesses to both
receive and pay bills electronically. The company, called the
Exchange, will serve as an electronic hub that will allow companies
issuing bills to reach consumers through their financial
institutions. Consumers will be able to log on to their online
banking site and view lists of their outstanding bills, said Sharon
Osberg, executive vice president for financial services at Wells
Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   The three banks will have a customer base of 60 million and
almost 60,000 corporations, said Wendy Grover, a spokeswoman for
Wells Fargo. Ms. Osberg added that by the time the Exchange is
fully up and running next year, all electronic payments will be
settled on the day they are issued, effectively eliminating any
float.
</P>
<P>
   But whether an electronic overdue notice will be easier to
ignore than a piece of paper that says ``account past due'' in red
letters on it remains to be seen.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ When the new Animal Health Research Center opens,
University of Georgia veterinarian Dr. Barry Harmon will no longer
have to collect in biocontainment bags and incinerate the
by-products of his research on E. coli O157:H7, the deadly bacteria
that sickened children at White Water Park.
</P>
<P>
   The $19 million facility has built-in safeguards designed to
capture, contain, decontaminate and sterilize everything coming out
of it, including the wastewater, air molecules and incinerator ash.
The building will allow researchers to study a variety of
contagious pathogens such as campylobacter, chlamydia psittaci and
Salmonella DT104, which infect humans as well as animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Australian government has already contacted us about
hiring vet school faculty to investigate Exotic New Castle Disease,
which doesn't exist in the U.S.,'' said Corrie Brown, head of the
College of Veterinary Medicine's pathology department. ``It's a
poultry disease that they didn't have in Australia until a little
while ago. They've have to slaughter 2 million chickens because of
it. In the new building we could study the disease safely.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years in the making, with federal and state
funding, the new research center is the only nongovernmental
facility in the country designed to accommodate a wide range of
animals, said Mike Mispagel, the facility manager and the quality
assurance manager for the entire university. With special features
like gates, tie-rings and high ceilings, the animal rooms are large
enough for horses, cows and pigs, as well as for rodents and birds.
</P>
<P>
   Mispagel expects scientists from agencies outside the
university, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to use the
AHRC for their projects in collaboration with UGA researchers. He
also plans to schedule research on noninfectious diseases for the
first six months the building is open ``to work out any bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when the idea of constructing a secure, safe
laboratory setting first surfaced among vet school officials, there
had been outbreaks of Legionnaires Disease, aflatoxin and various
avian diseases, all of which were studied ``under less than ideal
conditions,'' said Mispagel. UGA officials brought in a team from
the USDA who determined that there was a need for such a facility
in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building will provide an additional level of safety and
control,'' said Mispagel. ``The engineered design gives you more
scientific control. You can control the microorganism within a
confined space and avoid the possibility of contaminating other
animals. If you're trying to study an organism, you want to have as
much control as possible over all variables.''
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders will be invited to an Aug. 12 dedication, when
the building will be open for tours. Vet school experts have given
tours to Athens fire department personnel and have been working
with local public safety officials to devise a plan should a fire
occur in the facility. As the AHRC comes on line, the UGA Biosafety
Committee, which has also toured the facility, will be closely
involved in oversight responsibility, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The 70,000-square-foot, bunkerlike building has had its own
maintenance staff for the past six to nine months. An electrician,
a plumber and a systems engineer have been learning the building
inside and out, even as architects and construction crews ready it
for final tests and inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the building seems unremarkable, just a brightly
lit lobby, a reception area and a hallway of offices, one of which
will house a person to monitor the animals being used in research.
Without a key card providing access, visitors are restricted to the
lobby; with a key card, one can enter the locker rooms and showers
that lead to the laboratory areas. Everyone going into these areas
showers before leaving the building.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 16 animal research rooms, the labs for toxicology,
surgery and necropsy _ animal autopsy _ have special features to
minimize exposure to deadly organisms. With $5,000 in airtight
doors, the rooms are all depressurized, meaning that air flows only
into them _ the outgoing air circulates through a special filter
before being released. There are autoclavs that sterilize equipment
with high temperatures; biosafety cabinets, which are filled with
sterilized air; and downdraft tables that pull fumes away from the
room.
</P>
<P>
   The second floor of the building isn't finished yet, but
Mispagel said it will house the laboratories of the eminent scholar
in vaccinology the Georgia Research Alliance is planning to hire.
The air handling system for the building is on the top floor; the
incinerator, wastewater holding tanks and emergency generator are
in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much redundancy built into the system that this is
going to be the safest building on campus,'' Mispagel said. ``It's
going to really help give the university a leg up in research. It
will provide a resource for UGA to be able to investigate
microorganisms in a safe environment that otherwise wouldn't be
able to be investigated.''

HOW TO KEEP E-MAIL PRIVATE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  Q: I do a lot of e-mail
<TEXT>
correspondence that involves sensitive corporate information. Is
there any way to code my mail so that only the person I'm sending
it to can read it?
<P>
   A: What you need is PGP, a free encryption program that you can
download at www.pgpi.com. PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy. It
was created in 1991 by Phil Zimmerman, who went on to found a
company, PGP Inc., that was acquired by Network Associates in 1997.
PGP is pretty strong stuff (so strong that the U.S. government
investigated Zimmerman for three years on the premise that PGP
violated U.S. export restrictions for cryptographic software).
</P>
<P>
   PGP uses what's called public key system. Each user has two
software keys _ a public key that can be shared with anyone, and a
private key that only the user knows. Someone sends you a message
using your public key to encrypt it. Once encrypted, the message
looks like random gibberish. When you receive the message, you can
decrypt it using your private key.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, PGP isn't just for e-mail. You can use it to
scramble any file that you don't want other people to know about.
Just use your public key to encrypt it, and your private key to
decrypt it.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORD ON LINUX
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been reading a lot about Linux, and I was under the
impression that there would soon be versions of it that would be
easy to install and use on my PC. Is that true, and which versions
are the best?
</P>
<P>
   A: Linux has come a long way in the couple of years since it
burst into the spotlight. But truth to tell, it still is a long way
from being an adequate alternative to Windows or the Macintosh
operating system. The reason is that very little good software has
been written for Linux. For instance, the only mainstream word
processor that's been adapted to Linux is WordPerfect. Microsoft is
having no part of the upstart system, and we may never see Linux
versions of Word, Excel and Powerpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Linux itself is getting a lot easier to use, thanks to companies
that are packaging it with graphical, Windows-like desktop
interfaces and easy installation routines. Two good versions that
come to mind are Red Hat 6.0 ($79.95 list price) and Linux from
Macmillan Software ($49.95 for the Deluxe version, $29.95 for the
Complete version, although how it can be complete if there's a more
extensive version is beyond me). These products let you surf the
Web, exchange e-mail, create simple documents and manage your
files.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about Linux is that it works on older PCs, so if
you have a 386 or 486 system gathering dust in the basement, Linux
could give it new life.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOST POWERFUL
</P>
<P>
   Q: How powerful is the world's top supercomputer? I'm 13 and
would like to know.
</P>
<P>
   A: Over the past few years, Intel, IBM, SGI, Hitachi and NEC all
at one time or another have laid claim to having the world's most
powerful supercomputer. In every case, it's a computer that uses
hundreds or even thousands of conventional processors like Pentiums
to form a cyberbrain in which each processor does a small part of a
big job. The result is what's called massively parallel processing.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the top computer in the world, according to a list
published by the University of Mannheim, is the Intel ASCI Red,
which is installed at the Sandia National Laboratory in
Albuquerque, N.M. It uses 9,742 Pentiums and can perform 2.1
trillion operations per second. Second place belongs to SGI's ASCI
Blue Mountain at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M.
IBM is planning a version of its RS/6000 SP supercomputer _ to be
installed at the Lawrence Livermore Lab next year _ that will be
capable of 10 trillion calculations per second. That means it will
be able to do in one second what it would take you 10 million years
to do with a hand calculator.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frustrating things about notebook computers is
that sometimes the cursor can be hard to see on the screen. This is
particularly true when the lighting situation is bad, such as when
you're outdoors. To make the cursor easier to locate, do the
following: Click the Windows Start button, point to settings and
choose Control Panel. Double-click the Mouse icon and click the
Motion tab. Then check the box labeled ``Show pointer trails'' and
click Apply. This will give the cursor a fleeting comet tail when
you move it.

   FACTS ABOUT LEATHERBACKS
</P>
<P>
   - The largest leatherback was caught off the coast of Wales. It
was 9 feet long and weighed more than a ton.
</P>
<P>
   - Male leatherbacks can't be counted because they never come
ashore and are rarely observed in the open sea.
</P>
<P>
   - Scientists don't know how leatherbacks find their way to
feeding grounds or back to their favorite nesting beaches.
</P>
<P>
   - Leatherbacks can dive to more than 3,000 feet below sea level.
</P>
<P>
   - Leatherbacks travel as far north as Canada and Alaska and as
far south as the Cape of Good Hope in Africa and southern New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   FACTS ABOUT OTHER SEA TURTLES
</P>
<P>
   - In 1973, leatherback and hawksbill turtles were protected
under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   - In 1978, the green turtle was listed as a threatened species.
</P>
<P>
   - Six of the seven sea turtle species are listed as endangered
or threatened: green, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley, hawksbill,
loggerhead and leatherback. Only one species, the flatback sea
turtle, is not considered threatened with extinction at this time.
</P>
<P>
   - Sea turtles do not have teeth; instead, they use their
powerful jaws to tear and crush their food. Each species prefers
certain foods.

<P>
   FREDERIKSTED, St. Croix _ If nothing else, leatherback turtles
are very good at being leatherback turtles. Having roamed the seas
for perhaps 100 million years or longer, they've outlived the Ice
Age and the dinosaur. All the while, they've kept their age-old
secrets _ like where they go and how they get there _ to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Four to 8 feet long and 700 to 2,000 pounds, the leatherback has
had little trouble protecting itself against most lethal predators,
save humans. These gentle giants have been on the road to
extinction for years, threatened by poachers, waterfront
development and even plastic bags that the reptiles may mistake for
appetizing jellyfish, their main food source.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's good news for the world's largest and
most-elusive sea turtle, which is listed as an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The leatherbacks are leaving a record number of nests this year
on the beaches of St. Croix, their biggest nesting site in the
United States, and on the shores of Florida, where threatened
loggerhead and endangered green turtles also nest.
</P>
<P>
   By early July, weeks away from the end of the egg-laying season,
more than 100 leatherbacks were counted at Sandy Point National
Wildlife Refuge on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. They left
more than 600 nests.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the beaches at the refuge are closed this time of year
to protect the leatherbacks' habitat.
</P>
<P>
   A record 118 leatherbacks nested at Sandy Point in 1997, more
than twice the previous record of 55 in 1994. The turtles dotted
the beaches with 720 nests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having a really good year, and so we are definitely on
track to break the previous record,'' said Michael Evans, who
manages Sandy Point for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``This
is one of only two or three nesting sites globally where the
population is stable or growing.''
</P>
<P>
   In North America, more than 90 percent of all sea-turtle nesting
takes place in Florida. The state is poised this year to break a
record set in 1997, when 400 leatherback nests were counted.
Scientists have reported record numbers of leatherback nests this
year from Fort Pierce to Jupiter Island. More than 120 leatherback
nests have been found on Hutchinson Island, surpassing the previous
record by at least 30.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, nesting is mostly concentrated in Martin and Palm
Beach counties, although nests have been found as far north as
Georgia. Nesting on Florida beaches begins in earnest in April and
ends in late July, while nesting on St. Croix continues through
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing leatherback nests where we've never seen nests
before, like in Brevard County, where we've counted about 30 nests
so far this year,'' said Blair Witherington, an official with the
Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   All this bodes well for a worldwide leatherback population that
has plummeted from 115,000 to 35,000 in the past 20 years mostly
because of poaching and the loss of habitat to beachfront
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely encouraged by the record numbers this year,
although we're not quite sure what to make of them,'' said Erik
Martin, scientific director of Ecological Associates in Jensen
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Laws passed in 1973 that provided expanded protection for sea
turtles could finally be paying off, Martin said. Previously,
turtle-egg poachers were a common sight on U.S. beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the increased nesting also could mean there's been a
shifting from other areas to areas in Florida and the Caribbean,''
Martin said. ``Beaches in the Pacific have seen their number of
nests decline, so the turtles could simply be moving to other
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the reasons for the upswing will remain as mysterious as
the leatherbacks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, leatherbacks stand out from other sea turtles, which
include the loggerheads, greens, hawksbills, and ridleys. The
leatherbacks unique shells are a mosaic of small bones covered by
firm, rubbery skin with seven longitudinal ridges, or keels.
</P>
<P>
   The Kemp's ridley turtle, the smallest, rarest, and most
endangered of all sea turtles, reaches only 2 to 2 1/2 feet in
length and weighs 80 to 100 pounds. It has an oval shell that is
usually olive-gray in color.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike other sea turtles, leatherbacks are warm-blooded. But
that doesn't stop them from migrating farther and into colder
temperatures than most other creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say leatherbacks regularly dive more than 3,000 feet
in search of food or to escape the rare predator such as the killer
whale. Yet scientists are still baffled as to where the
leatherbacks spend their developmental years and how fast they
grow. They believe the loveseat-sized behemoths reach reproductive
age in a mere 7 to 14 years and that they return to their favorite
nesting sites every two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the creation of a leatherback nest is one of the
most unique spectacles in nature. The turtles use their
paddle-shaped limbs, or flippers, to clamber onto the beach, a
struggle made under the cover of night _ when the sand is cooler _
that can last more than three hours. They then use their rear
flippers to sculpt a hole, or nest, about 10 to 12 feet from the
water. They deposit an average of 80 to 85 moist, white eggs the
size of billiard balls into the nest before dragging themselves
back to the safety of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Within 60 days or so, the 2-ounce hatchlings embark on their
first precarious journey to sea in what could optimistically be an
80-year life span, although no one knows for certain how long
leatherbacks live.
</P>
<P>
   The beaches at Sandy Point, a 380-acre refuge on the southwest
tip of St. Croix, are ideal for leatherbacks. Sandy Point boasts
deep water close to shore, and a wide swath of sandy beach that's
almost completely free of brush, rocks and other tangles.
</P>
<P>
   More leatherbacks nest on two miles of beach here than they do
on the entire Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. The
beach, dotted by depressions, or nests, almost resembles a
moonscape.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service bought Sandy Point for $2.5
million in 1984, so it could be preserved as a sea-turtle nesting
area. But the turtles do face a growing threat here: Economically
strapped locals are increasingly selling leatherback eggs,
considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac. Evans, who manages Sandy
Point, said a clutch of eggs fetch $60 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upper-class people, like doctors and lawyers, buy the eggs
because it's a status thing,'' Evans said. ``People here generally
have lots of children, and the eggs are said to increase the
libido.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen also have been known to harpoon the turtles for food
or for the thick, yellow oil contained in their flesh, which is
said to work miracles on everything from chest colds to poor sex
lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, the major threat to leatherbacks is development and
beach lighting, which tends to disorient newly hatched turtles.
Instead of heading for the sea, the turtles are lured inland by the
light. There they perish.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, despite the popularity of the leatherback, few
people get to see its nesting process up close because most beaches
at Sandy Point are closed to protect the turtle's habitat. The only
way to see the turtles is to pay $1,800 or so to work for 10 days
as a volunteer researcher with a U.S.-based environmental group
like Earthwatch.
</P>
<P>
   And people are more than willing to pay because the leatherback
is a very popular animal, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there are few animals that weigh 1,000 or more pounds
that are as harmless as a leatherback turtle,'' he explained.
``Even a Galapagos turtle will nip at you, but not the leatherback.
It's as gentle as they come.''

Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Laws passed in 1973 that provided expanded protection for sea
turtles could finally be paying off, Martin said. Previously,
turtle-egg poachers were a common sight on U.S. beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the increased nesting also could mean there's been a
shifting from other areas to areas in Florida and the Caribbean,''
Martin said. ``Beaches in the Pacific have seen their number of
nests decline, so the turtles could simply be moving to other
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the reasons for the upswing will remain as mysterious as
the leatherbacks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, leatherbacks stand out from other sea turtles, which
include the loggerheads, greens, hawksbills, and ridleys. The
leatherbacks unique shells are a mosaic of small bones covered by
firm, rubbery skin with seven longitudinal ridges, or keels.
</P>
<P>
   The Kemp's ridley turtle, the smallest, rarest, and most
endangered of all sea turtles, reaches only 2 to 2 1/2 feet in
length and weighs 80 to 100 pounds. It has an oval shell that is
usually olive-gray in color.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike other sea turtles, leatherbacks are warm-blooded. But
that doesn't stop them from migrating farther and into colder
temperatures than most other creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say leatherbacks regularly dive more than 3,000 feet
in search of food or to escape the rare predator such as the killer
whale. Yet scientists are still baffled as to where the
leatherbacks spend their developmental years and how fast they
grow. They believe the loveseat-sized behemoths reach reproductive
age in a mere 7 to 14 years and that they return to their favorite
nesting sites every two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the creation of a leatherback nest is one of the
most unique spectacles in nature. The turtles use their
paddle-shaped limbs, or flippers, to clamber onto the beach, a
struggle made under the cover of night _ when the sand is cooler _
that can last more than three hours. They then use their rear
flippers to sculpt a hole, or nest, about 10 to 12 feet from the
water. They deposit an average of 80 to 85 moist, white eggs the
size of billiard balls into the nest before dragging themselves
back to the safety of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Within 60 days or so, the 2-ounce hatchlings embark on their
first precarious journey to sea in what could optimistically be an
80-year life span, although no one knows for certain how long
leatherbacks live.
</P>
<P>
   The beaches at Sandy Point, a 380-acre refuge on the southwest
tip of St. Croix, are ideal for leatherbacks. Sandy Point boasts
deep water close to shore, and a wide swath of sandy beach that's
almost completely free of brush, rocks and other tangles.
</P>
<P>
   More leatherbacks nest on two miles of beach here than they do
on the entire Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. The
beach, dotted by depressions, or nests, almost resembles a
moonscape.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service bought Sandy Point for $2.5
million in 1984, so it could be preserved as a sea-turtle nesting
area. But the turtles do face a growing threat here: Economically
strapped locals are increasingly selling leatherback eggs,
considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac. Evans, who manages Sandy
Point, said a clutch of eggs fetch $60 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upper-class people, like doctors and lawyers, buy the eggs
because it's a status thing,'' Evans said. ``People here generally
have lots of children, and the eggs are said to increase the
libido.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen also have been known to harpoon the turtles for food
or for the thick, yellow oil contained in their flesh, which is
said to work miracles on everything from chest colds to poor sex
lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, the major threat to leatherbacks is development and
beach lighting, which tends to disorient newly hatched turtles.
Instead of heading for the sea, the turtles are lured inland by the
light. There they perish.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, despite the popularity of the leatherback, few
people get to see its nesting process up close because most beaches
at Sandy Point are closed to protect the turtle's habitat. The only
way to see the turtles is to pay $1,800 or so to work for 10 days
as a volunteer researcher with a U.S.-based environmental group
like Earthwatch.
</P>
<P>
   And people are more than willing to pay because the leatherback
is a very popular animal, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there are few animals that weigh 1,000 or more pounds
that are as harmless as a leatherback turtle,'' he explained.
``Even a Galapagos turtle will nip at you, but not the leatherback.
It's as gentle as they come.''

FTC RECOMMENDS CONGRESS HOLD OFF ON PRIVACY LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (lh) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While finding that the online industry has a long
way to go in protecting the privacy of consumers, the Federal Trade
Commission has approved a report recommending that Congress hold
off on legislation to regulate how companies can collect and use
consumer data.
</P>
<P>
   The report, approved 3-1 by the commission, was a victory for
industry groups that have been scrambling for the last year and
half to avert privacy legislation. They have made a case for
self-regulation, encouraging companies to declare policies that
allow consumers to choose and control the information collected
about them over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Varney, a former federal trade commissioner who is now
a legal counsel to the Online Privacy Alliance, a group of Internet
and technology companies that was formed a year ago when the
commission threatened to seek legislation, said, ``I think it does
reflect that the industry has done an enormous amount of work over
the last year and a half and we are on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates insist that the latest surveys of the
privacy practices of online marketers _ and the commission report
itself _ prove that self-regulation is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is plenty of evidence that self-regulation has
not worked,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, a civil liberties advocacy
group. ``What these privacy policies are telling people is how much
privacy they don't have. The consequence as a legal matter is
expectations of privacy in the online world continue to decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was not without criticism of the industry. Indeed, it
cites a survey this spring by Georgetown University showing that
while 66 percent of Web sites now post privacy policies _ up from
14 percent a year earlier _ only 10 percent also follow the
commission's criteria for protecting personal information, giving
consumers choice and control over such information and a form of
redress if it is misused.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The self-regulatory initiatives described above reflect
industry leaders' substantial effort and commitment to fair
information practices,'' the report states. But it goes on to say
that ``only a small minority of commercial Web sites have joined
these programs to date.''
</P>
<P>
   The report will be officially submitted on Tuesday at a hearing
of the House Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and
consumer protection, at which trade commission members and others
on both sides of the privacy issue are expected to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Edward Markey of
Massachusetts, says he intends to introduce an online privacy
``bill of rights'' to protect consumer control over personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the commission, denied that its
conclusions were in conflict. ``Responsible elements of the
Internet community have begun to do what they set out to do,'' he
said. ``On the other hand, just putting a notice on the Internet
about a privacy policy is not all the protection that consumers
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said the commission would continue to closely monitor
online privacy. And the report lays out an agenda for public
workshops and task forces of industry, privacy and consumer groups
to make sure the progress continues.
</P>
<P>
   It also promises another review of Web site privacy practices,
probably in another year, Pitofsky said, emphasizing not just the
adoption of policies but their substance, monitoring and
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes a year after the commission released the first
survey on Web site privacy practices and won approval of
legislation requiring Web sites that collect information from
children to get parents' permission. It also warned that it would
seek legislation regulating the use of personal information
collected from adults if substantial progress was not made.

   FACTS ABOUT LEATHERBACKS
</P>
<P>
   - The largest leatherback was caught off the coast of Wales. It
was 9 feet long and weighed more than a ton.
</P>
<P>
   - Male leatherbacks can't be counted because they never come
ashore and are rarely observed in the open sea.
</P>
<P>
   - Scientists don't know how leatherbacks find their way to
feeding grounds or back to their favorite nesting beaches.
</P>
<P>
   - Leatherbacks can dive to more than 3,000 feet below sea level.
</P>
<P>
   - Leatherbacks travel as far north as Canada and Alaska and as
far south as the Cape of Good Hope in Africa and southern New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   FACTS ABOUT OTHER SEA TURTLES
</P>
<P>
   - In 1973, leatherback and hawksbill turtles were protected
under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   - In 1978, the green turtle was listed as a threatened species.
</P>
<P>
   - Six of the seven sea turtle species are listed as endangered
or threatened: green, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley, hawksbill,
loggerhead and leatherback. Only one species, the flatback sea
turtle, is not considered threatened with extinction at this time.
</P>
<P>
   - Sea turtles do not have teeth; instead, they use their
powerful jaws to tear and crush their food. Each species prefers
certain foods.

FEINSTEIN PREDICTS PATIENTS' RIGHTS WILL BE A TOP CAMPAIGN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Wednesday
that the Democrats will have a strong campaign issue in the coming
election as a result of Republicans scuttling her party's proposals
to boost patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think a patients' bill of rights becomes a major campaign
issue,'' said Feinstein, who is running for reelection next year.
And, she said, ``I think it will be part of the presidential
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Her comments at a breakfast meeting with reporters came in the
wake of the Senate defeat Tuesday of Democratic proposals including
one by Feinstein that would have ensured that doctors, not health
plans, would decide if a treatment is medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Her comments were echoed by other Capitol Hill Democrats who
contend they are forcing Republicans to take politically unpopular
stances on the Senate floor opposing patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   In votes Tuesday, Senate Republicans also beat back popular
Democratic amendments that would have let women in health
maintenance organizations pick an obstetrician-gynecologist as
their primary doctor and ensure that doctors and patients have the
final say on how long women can stay in the hospital after surgery
for breast cancer. Another Democratic initiative would have
guaranteed patients insured access to emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to approve their own narrower bill on
Thursday on how to regulate managed care providers. But aides to
President Clinton have said they will recommend that he veto the
GOP version.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the Democratic proposals would lead to
escalating medical costs, increased insurance premiums and more
uninsured people.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein told reporters that the issue of reining in managed
care organizations is especially important in California. There,
she said, doctors are filing for bankruptcy and hospitals are
closing at alarming rates, but managed care providers continue to
take in large profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, there are real problems,'' she said. ``I just
saw a list of new hospitals that will close shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Republicans offered their own managed care
proposals, including one designed to help women who are recovering
from breast cancer surgery. A measure by Sen. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine, would require that decisions on length of stay following a
mastectomy be determined by the patient and her own physician. Her
plan is similar to the Democratic proposal, but Republicans said
that measure was too vague. Republicans also planned to offer their
own measure regarding access to emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein predicted that Democrats will win at the polls next
year by blaming Republicans, not only for rejecting Democratic
patients' rights proposals, but also for killing legislation that
would have regulated tobacco companies and tightened rules on gun
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   She accused the Republicans of having a ``pro-tobacco and
anti-health care reform kind of vision'' and said, ``I think the
dominant share of Americans are on the other side of these
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   She said gun control will loom large in the campaign because of
evidence that juveniles are able to get firearms easily and bring
them into schools.
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear need, she said, for ``targeted, prudent
regulation of firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also said her own campaign fund-raising efforts for
2000 will yield about $2 million by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about speculation that she could be a vice presidential
candidate on the Democratic ticket, Feinstein downplayed the idea.
But she said, ``I think the time is right'' for a woman on the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have established that women are taking an
historically unprecedented role in politics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the speculation about her ``makes me
uncomfortable,'' because ``it builds up an expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to be U.S. senator,'' Feinstein said. ``I intend to
serve another term. ... I can't see into the future ... but I want
to be a U.S. senator from California. The probability is very
strong that I will be a U.S. senator.''

AMERICAN PIE WITH A SCOOP OF LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Let me see if I have this right. You dash toward
the mayor with a couple of your friends and squish pies in his
face, but a bodyguard wrestles you to the ground and fractures your
clavicle, so you sue.
</P>
<P>
   Rakula Janowski is bringing November's idiotic pie incident full
circle by suing San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and one of his
bodyguards for battery and civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Lady, you were lucky you weren't shot dead on the spot, loaded
pie in hand. Bodyguards get jumpy sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   It gets weirder. Janowski, part of the self-promoting and
sanctimonious ``Biotic Baking Brigade,'' claims her civil rights
were violated because the bodyguard thought she was a man and
applied more force than was necessary for a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that she was wearing guerrilla baking garb, making it
was hard to tell she was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Also, this is the age of liberation. What does she want? She was
treated with the equality due those Americans who choose to rush
public officials at podiums.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing the mayor wasn't holding a hot cup of coffee,
or he might have been sued for scalding someone over dessert.
</P>
<P>
   I know Janowski is mad because the mayor didn't laugh off the
attack and she and her pie pals did a few months in the county
jail.
</P>
<P>
   That was a bit harsh.
</P>
<P>
   I think their just deserts would have been a sentence just to
bake desserts for the homeless whose plight they used as an excuse
for their self-aggrandizing stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   Please, just say you're stuffing a pie in someone's face, not
that you're doing it for the homeless. That shows your essential
humorlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it was just a joke, they now say. ``She playfully tossed a
pie in the air,'' her lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   And it landed on her clavicle.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the videotape. There was nothing playful about it. At
least one pie was jammed directly into the mayor's face, and this
is a man whose vision is not the best. The mayor fought back, to
his credit.
</P>
<P>
   You or I would have reacted immediately by popping an attacker
in the snoot, the way any red-blooded American would after being
humiliated. And we'd find ourselves sued.
</P>
<P>
   Now I have to admit that I'm hardly the one to criticize
pie-throwers. I've hit the mayor with metaphorical pies on
occasion, and some I wish I had left half- baked on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Life is too short to be short, small and petty. There is a big
difference between criticizing or satirizing someone and being mean
or hurtful.
</P>
<P>
   I regret the times I've been mean to Brown. It's unnecessary and
uncivilized, and it's so much more entertaining to poke him in the
ego than to hit him in the face with a verbal mud pie.
</P>
<P>
   I'm certainly not going to sue him for violating my civil rights
if he fights back with words, something he has done often with his
great verbal street-fighting skills. It's his right as a human
being.
</P>
<P>
   He's a mayor who pulls no punches. You throw slings, arrows,
darts or pies, and you take the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   This most beautiful of cities is often startlingly uncivilized
in its rhetoric and politics, and as we enter the political hot
season, we all should take a look at ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Columnists savage politicians and rival journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians undercut their enemies, sometimes using their own
attack-lapdog journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Young white people attack slightly older white people in the
name of ``yuppie eradication,'' when it's really a matter of who is
hipper and more youthful than thou.
</P>
<P>
   Bicyclists hate drivers, and pedestrians fear both. If you go a
day without being given the finger, you haven't been in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has something scurrilous to say about almost everyone
else, and it goes over best if it provides a vicious, knowing
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   So we have to thank the Biotic Baking Brigade for at least one
thing, even though they've pretty much ruined the American joke of
a pie in the face. They've shown us that things passed off as jokes
sometimes are just crummy things to do.
</P>
<P>
   In spatters of cherry and tofu cream, they've laid out some
boundaries separating civility from incivility.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of them has provided us with another unfunny joke, a
lawsuit that's as American as apple pie. It's the kind of pie that
goes with a good, hot McDonald's cup of coffee in the lap.

MUPPETS GET LOST IN SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time before hip-hop caught up to the
Muppets' random acts of variety-show name-dropping and stripped
them of their ``most sensational, inspirational, celebrational,
Muppetational'' crown.
</P>
<P>
   Now after the ``Muppets Treasure Island'' in 1996 and a fetching
prime-time comeback that a pre-desperate ABC saw fit to trash,
Kermit and Co. want to be the bomb again with ``Muppets From
Space,'' a movie that sports more cameos than a ``HeeHaw'' marathon
but not much else.
</P>
<P>
   Touched off by Gonzo's ongoing identity crisis and his turn to
alien life forms for an answer, ``Space'' is so determined to be
down that it goes so far as to make Gonzo's torturer a Muppet, a
diabolical screwball surgeon who bears a more than passing
resemblance to everybody's favorite sexually ambiguous,
over-the-top, ever-troubled body-comic Andy Dick. His name? Dr. Van
Neuter.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Miss Piggy plays Celebrity Death Match with ``Sports
Night'' anchor Josh Charles, then goes on to deliver a cathartic
beatdown to Andie McDowell, a woman who seems perfectly at ease
trading body blows with a stuffed animal.
</P>
<P>
   David Arquette shows up as his rabid freak show self, only this
time he's in a lab coat instead of that Call-ATT dial pad.
</P>
<P>
   But man-addled ``Suddenly Susan'' stand-up Kathy Griffin's
slipping Animal the tongue is all but a speed-dialed cry o' help
for ``Love-line'' counseling.
</P>
<P>
   While the special-guest-star traffic jam is as humorous as it
can be dull, ``Muppets From Space'' doesn't take all its cues from
the pop reservoir from which it's drinking in order to make a
pre-millennial play for its troupe of shaggy, wise-cracking
critters to step into the space age.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``Space,'' directed by Tim Hill and written
by Jerry Juhl, Joseph Mazzarino and Ken Kaufman, is one-note. Where
the previous extravaganzas gave most of the characters some action,
sundry members of the gang look like they're just trying to get in
the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Fozzie is practically begging for something to do. And
forget Waldo; where's Scooter in this often listless and strangely
dated mini-opus? Jeffrey Tambor, as the alien-obsessed dastard
who's lured Gonzo to his government compound, is an early-'80s

Earth, Wind and Fire overshadows Miss Piggy's oinking on her Nokia.

FROM THE INTERNET TO YOUR TABLE, THE ULTIMATE TV DINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DEBBY MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It comes in a brown cardboard box. The
components are hermetically sealed and labeled A, B, C. There's
even a standard operating procedure for assembly _ and for serving.
</P>
<P>
   It's food, but it's no Army rations.
</P>
<P>
   Cook Express, a new San Francisco-based company, is selling
gourmet dinners over the Internet at www.cookexpress.com. This
isn't an ordinary TV dinner. It's a pay-per-view dinner, a World
Wide Web dinner. Make a selection, place an order on line, and a
superstar chef-designed feast is delivered to your door. All the
ingredients are included, even the side dishes. Quantities have
been precisely measured. Seasonings are exactly to specifications.
So if the steak comes out too done, you have only yourself to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   And though there are other on-line meal-ordering services, the
difference here is that the ingredients arrive raw _ refrigerated
and stamped with a use-by date. We're talking fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The concept hardly is half-baked, though, according to Cook
Express founder and chief executive Darby Williams, who toiled,
tested and tinkered for two years before launching the service in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``This concept is non-trivial,'' he says, explaining why it took
so long to get from idea to dinner plate. ``We're bringing
different cultures together: development, production, delivery,
food, technology.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Williams assembled a team of specialists from each
of those fields. Williams himself is a marketing and business
management ace and Microsoft alumnus. Barbara Lyon, the vice
president of distribution, comes from 12 years at Federal Express.
Meredith Taylor, the chief operating officers, was a honcho at
Stuart Anderson's Black Angus Restaurants. Gaines Dobbins, the
executive chef, earned his stripes as chef de cuisine at San
Francisco's Boulevard restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Bradley Ogden, the owner-chef of the Lark Creek Inn
and One Market restaurant in San Francisco. He's also a Cook
Express founding board member as well as adviser, muse and
cheerleader. He lends star power and his recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the complexities that make this concept work, Ogden
says, ``You've got food _ that's the easy part.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you've got to get it to the consumer three hours later _
that's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason it works is the culinary practice of having all the
ingredients chopped, measured and seasoned, ready to assemble and
cook in less than 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cook Express' commissary is a small commercial kitchen in
Burlingame, staffed by a team of cooks and supplied with impeccable
ingredients (produce from the San Francisco Produce Market, meat
from to-the-trade-only Golden Gate Meat Co.).
</P>
<P>
   There are monthly specials, such as fillet mignon and guest-chef
creations. New recipes are being developed all the time.
</P>
<P>
   So let's open a box. Picture two hunky slabs of perfect fillet
mignon. This is meat you can't buy at the market. Then there's a
bag of pristine, uniform spinach leaves, washed and trimmed. A tiny
container of minced garlic. There's a little cup of red
wine-rosemary demi-glace, slightly gelled. A tub of roast
shallot-kalamata olive relish. And there's a mound of horseradish
mashed potatoes, already cooked and seasoned.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a little booklet. It tells you what additional
ingredients you'll need to finish the meal _ in this case, a
tablespoon of olive oil and salt and pepper. Then you follow the
step-by-step directions.
</P>
<P>
   All we needed was a bowl, three pans and dinner plates. We fired
up the oven and set the relish in a bowl on the stove-top to warm
up.
</P>
<P>
   The potatoes went into a saucepan. Dry and crumbly looking, they
seemed to need a splash of buttermilk or a dollop of butter, but
was I allowed to meddle? Never fear, they metamorphosed into moist
snowdrifts over low heat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the beef was seared for two or three minutes on both
sides. Too thick to have cooked through with that brief searing,
the meat was finished in the oven, saute pan and all, four to five
minutes for medium rare. Neat trick! Next, we slid the demi-glace
into a saucepan to melt. When the meat came out of the oven, we
wrapped it in foil and cooked the spinach with garlic for one to
two minutes, right in the fillet's pan juices. What a concept.
Working as a team of two was easy, but one person could handle it
just as well.
</P>
<P>
   Then we followed the directions for assembling the stuff in an
appealing way. The potatoes went into the center of the plates,
topped by the spinach. One fillet was perched on each pile,
sprinkled with a spoonful of relish.
</P>
<P>
   Then the demi-glace was spooned onto the plates, around the
meat-'n'-potatoes stack. Everything worked! Modular food.
Cook-by-number. It looked great. It tasted great, and the beef was
perfectly pink throughout.
</P>
<P>
   I think I know my way around a kitchen, but I was blown away. We
felt like pros.
</P>
<P>
   For now, same-day delivery is available only in San Francisco
and the Palo Alto-Menlo Park-Atherton areas, but Marin County will
get lucky in about three months, San Jose soon, and other cities
(including Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, Boston, Chicago)
eventually will get their own regional commissaries.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight delivery is available to the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The meals might seem a bit costly _ around $22 to $30 for two,
plus $4.95 for local delivery ($12.95 and up for overnight shipping
_ overnight kits come in insulated boxes with cold packs). But
that's half what they'd cost in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   And it's cheaper than going shopping, Ogden says. ``Usually when
you shop, you buy extra. You're hungry. And you spend time, gas.
... Of course, if you don't shop, you're missing the fun.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ogden says that cooks with less experience can play it safe and
straight. Cooks with more experience may noodle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the most accomplished home gourmet chef loves the
concept,'' Williams says. ``I thought that would be
counter-intuitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The results are reproducible, too, because the recipes are
tested and retested. Foolproof, no-brainer cooking. ``Our motto is
`Zero Defect,''' Williams insists.
</P>
<P>
   Cook Express' customer base, in the mid-20s to mid-50s with a
household income of $40,000 and more, is in the thousands, having
tripled in five months, Williams says. Buyers are about half men,
half women, largely because although more women make food
decisions, more men use the Internet.

WOODS SAYS BEING A PRO HAS TOUGHENED HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Tiger Woods has aged gracefully,
combining his enhanced golf skills with a fresher outlook and more
mature appreciation of the game. ``It's tougher,'' he said on the
eve of the 128th British Open that begins Thursday over the rugged
links of Carnoustie. ``You played junior golf and you had the US
Juniors. You played amateur golf and you had the US Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had one per year you had to win, and other than that who
really cares? Now as a professional you have to peak at four
different times. It's difficult to do. You need to look at your
calendar and see where you need to play and when and, basically,
arrange enough practice time and down time. But also not play too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to a major championship, you need a lot of
energy. I believe what I've done over the last couple of years has
been very successful and I think my record is starting to show
that. I think the key to having your game peak at the right times
is scheduling. You want to get your mind fresh when you do come
back. You're ready and not overplaying coming into a major
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who burst on the professional scene when he turned pro
following his third straight win in the US Amateur in 1996 at the
age of 20, ignited the golfing world when he won the Masters the
following spring by a record 12 shots. He lost his privacy, rose to
No. 1 in the world rankings, and has held the top spot for 67 weeks
in his young career.
</P>
<P>
   Even though David Duval soared to the top spot after his four
wins leading into the Masters, Woods has replaced him following his
third PGA Tour triumph of the year two weeks ago at the Western
Open. He had won at San Diego and The Memorial and preceded that
win with a victory in the Deutsche Bank SAP Open in Germany. He has
been top 10 in 14 starts on the Tour and hasn't missed a cut.
</P>
<P>
   Woods spent time in Ireland en route to this course, located on
the shores of the North Sea on the east coast, in the company of US
Open champion Payne Stewart, his predecessor Lee Janzen, defending
British Open champion Mark O'Meara, Australian Stuart Appleby, and
Duval. They played Waterville, the new course at Old Head in County
Cork, and Portmarnoch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think David was playing the best,'' said Woods. ``The
hardest course we played was Old Head. You couldn't see more than a
hundred yards in the fog. The cliffs are 300 yards above the water
and it's not too hard to walk right off a cliff. David was playing
great. He was hitting a lot of good, solid shots, controlling his
trajectory really, really well. We definitely didn't let the golf
get in the way of our fishing. We caught a lot of brown trout.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who played in the Scottish Open twice when he was 19 and
20, has grown into links golf and loves Carnoustie up here in the
Angus section of the country. The last time the British Open was
here was in 1974, when Tom Watson won the first of his five claret
jugs. The previous four times it was contested at a course many
have said is the most testing on the planet it was won by Tommy
Armour (1931), Henry Cotton (1937), Ben Hogan (1953) in a historic
appearance, and Gary Player (1968).
</P>
<P>
   There are few more gruesome finishes than the four closing
holes, the 472-yard par 4 15th, the 250-yard par 3 16th, the
459-yard par 4 17th, and 487-yard par 4 18th on a course that will
play to a par 71 and 7,361 yards. Woods, who encountered problems
on a few holes at Royal Troon (a quadruple bogey and a couple of
triples) two years ago, played well in the championship a year ago
at Royal Birkdale and in the Dunhill Cup at St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt length and familiarity will be in his favor
after he saw his rush at a possible US Open championship dashed by
a bogey/par finish on Pinehurst No. 2 in June. ``I think anybody
who has played here has an advantage,'' he said, ``because they
have seen it under different conditions. They have not seen it the
way it is prepared now, but that is the only difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be difficult. Once you get to the green, (they
are) very simple to read but it is just getting to them that's
going to be the difficult part. The rough is high around the
greens, which is unusual for a links course. You usually have a
little more chipping room. This time they've given you chipping
areas, but everything is short so you have to bump it up and you
can't miss it on the sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difficulty lies in the winds. ``We just had a
5-mile-per-hour breeze on 18. I hit a driver, then smoked a 4 iron
in there. If it turns into a 30 m.p.h. wind, it could be difficult.
I've played it here when I've hit a 6 iron into 16. I've played it
when I've hit a 3 wood on that hole. I've played it when I've hit a
5 iron on 17 on a nice day. Then the next day I hit driver and
smoked another driver to the front edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked the course. I think it's one of the best,
and one of the fairest courses. There's only one blind shot, on the
par 5 14th. Everything else is right in front of you. I'm playing
solid right now. I'm very happy and very pleased. I think this is a
championship that everybody wants to win because I think it has the
best field in the world. I like it the best of all the majors
because of the fact the conditions change so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember last year hitting the driver in a practice round on
the first hole, and then hitting a 4 iron off that tee. You know
that's just two completely different winds and that's the beauty of
it. I like having to adapt my game to the conditions at hand, and
they can change pretty rapidly. I've played more golf under these
conditions, more links golf. If you ask me 10 years from now, I
will says I have more experience then.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes on, I will get better playing links golf under
these conditions because you need experience. You need experiences
to call back on. I was able to use my experiences under the extreme
conditions we played last year at Birkdale to be successful at St.
Andrews for the Dunhill Cup. I shot 14 under for three deays under
some pretty tough conditions. If I hadn't played well at Birkdale
and hadn't learned from mistakes, there is no way I could have
played that well at St. Andrews.''
</P>
<P>
   So Woods will enter the Open Championship as it is simply
referred to on this side of the pond as one of the favorites,
searching for the elusive second major. ``Am I getting impatient?''
he said. ``No. It's just whenever it happens, it happens. You can't
force the situation. You've got to go out there and put yourself in
a position to win. Fortunately I was able to do it at the US Open.
I gave myself a chance. This time it was Payne's turn to win by
making those great putts. You need to get a few good breaks at the
right time and see what happens.''

AUSTRALIAN YOUNGSTER HEWITT IS GETTING UP FOR THE CUP

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. -- The climb has come so fast and has been so
steady that often, time for retrospection is scarce, and even the
jitters struggle to keep pace. At age 13, Lleyton Hewitt gave up
Australian Rules Football to pursue a career in tennis. Two years
later, he became the youngest qualifier in the history of the
Australian Open (15 years, 11 months).
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the Adelaide, Australia, resident defeated Jason
Stoltenberg in the finals of an event in his hometown to become the
lowest-ranked singles player to win an ATP event (550th in the
world) and the third-youngest in the Open era (16 years, 10 months)
to win a title.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt entered the meet as a wild card, and in succession he
beat Scott Draper, Todd Woodforde, Vincent Spadea, Andre Agassi,
and Stoltenberg. They held a combined 1,108-0 edge in Tour
victories over him entering the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   That was the highlight of a meteoric rise from being the 722d
player in the world in 1997, to the 113th last year, to a current
ranking of No. 31. Another major step forward could come this
weekend; the 18-year-old Hewitt is a member of the Australian Davis
Cup team, for which he served as a practice partner less than two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The young player has had little time to reflect on his rise in
the rankings. ``It all happened pretty quick,'' said Hewitt, whose
Aussies face the United States in the 100th Davis Cup starting
Friday at Longwood Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 700 in the world one week. The next week I was in center
court playing Agassi in a semifinal (in Adelaide). I supposed it
happened so quick for me to realize I had dropped 600 spots.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still uncertainty about whom he will play in singles.
Although it is doubtful he will meet late US entry Pete Sampras, it
would make for a compelling match. Hewitt is 0-2 lifetime against
Sampras, but Sampras's victories weren't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sampras beat Hewitt, 6-1, 7-6, at the Pilot Pen
International hardcourt event in New Haven. This year, Sampras beat
him, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6, in a Wimbledon tuneup, the Stella Artois grass
tourney in England. Hewitt said taking Sampras to three sets did
wonders for his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Hewitt spoke of entering his first Davis Cup match with
nervousness regardless of what the matchup is. That was a feeling
he didn't experience in tennis at 16.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before he became a recognizable face on the sports
scene, before Serena Williams asked to be his mixed-doubles parter
at the 1998 Australian Open (he obliged), and before he defeated
No. 13 Cedric Pioline in straight sets in the first round of this
year's Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about being 16. You don't know what nerves
are all about. You do what comes naturally rather than what you're
supposed to do,'' said Hewitt, who earned the spot on the Davis Cup
team after Mark Philippoussis suffered a knee injury at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I didn't start getting nervous until I had to go back
the next year to defend my title in Adelaide,'' he said. ``Up to
then, I had really nothing to lose and everything to gain. I
started getting nervous because I wanted to defend that title, and
I had high expectations going into that because it was my
hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt's progress reminds many of that of Boris Becker, who beat
him in the third round at center court at Wimbledon, 6-1, 6-4, 7-6.
But when Australian coach Tony Roche was asked to compare Hewitt to
another player who has risen as fast, he struggled to come up with
a name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one I can think of is John McEnroe,'' said Roche.
``He had to qualify at Wimbledon, then he reached the semis at
17.''
</P>
<P>
   But Australian captain John Newcombe said Australians are hardly
surprised with Hewitt's progress. ``We've had him in Davis Cup
squads since he was 15,'' said Newcombe, ``and he had been
earmarked as someone special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was his first year in Open company. He chose not to
play the juniors and instead play the Open events, and it was a bit
of a struggle last year. But he learned from everything, and this
year he's gone out and proved he can match it with everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt is regarded as a quick player who works for every point.
This season, his first full stint on the Tour, he is 27-12. He won
his second career title this season at Delray Beach and was a
finalist in Adelaide and Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very quick, very solid off the ground with his forehand
and backhand,'' said Newcombe. ``He's pretty good around the net.
He has a good serve, not a great serve, but good. He enjoys
competing, and he's not afraid to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe is among many who believe Hewitt represents the future
of Australian tennis, along with two-time US Open champ Patrick
Rafter (No. 2 in the world) and Philippoussis (No. 7). The country
has won 26 titles, second only to the United States' 31, but has
not won a Davis Cup championship since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of Australian tennis looks pretty good,'' said
Newcombe. ``With Pat and Philippoussis coming along, it raises the
bar. Five years ago, if you were a quarterfinalist in a Grand Slam,
you were doing the best for the Australians. Now, you go to win a
Grand Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who called playing in the Davis Cup, ``a bit of a
daydream,'' enters as arguably the player with the least amount of
pressure on him. It is his first Cup, and with the fanfare
surrounding the 100th edition of the tournament, it would not
surprise anyone if Hewitt struggled.
</P>
<P>
   However, a victory would only increase his growing popularity.
``I suppose the biggest thing has been that in the second year, I
haven't fallen down yet,'' said Hewitt, whose father, Glynn, a
former Australian Rules Football player and state manager for home
loans, left his job to travel with his son (he is not expected to
attend the Davis Cup, however).
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great first half of the year, and hopefully it
continues in the second half,'' Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Practice partners are referred to as orange boys _ a term coined
by the Australians because among their duties, they once were
required to squeeze oranges for team members. By being placed on
the Davis Cup team, Hewitt has put those days behind him, and
players say they don't require him to carry bags or do chores.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the older players don't poke fun at him.
Particuarly Rafter, who Tuesday made light of the fact that Hewitt
included the phrase ``you know'' in most of his responses. Rafter
began poking Hewitt under the table with a knee each time he
uttered the phrase. ``I think I'm handling things pretty well at
the moment, apart from the media stuff,'' said Hewitt.

NOT EVEN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire set out Tuesday to find a new
party, but what he's really lost is his old state.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on the floor of the US Senate, the two-term
Republican confirmed that he is bolting the Grand Old Party to run
for president as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   It is amazing enough that a man who barely survived a
re-election challenge two years ago sees himself as presidential
timber. But it is positively astounding that he thinks he can
succeed by abandoning the party that helped him hang onto his seat
by his fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Where in the New Hampshire woods are these independents that
Smith imagines will embrace an agenda that he describes with Pat
Buchanan-like fervor as ``pro-life,'' ``pro-Second Amendment,''
``pro-military,'' and ``pro-sovereignty?'' (What is that last item
exactly, an appeal to the monarchists among us? An odd position for
a presidential candidate.)
</P>
<P>
   File this doomed candidacy under: Mr. Smith goes to Washington
and misses the changes taking place back home.
</P>
<P>
   The Granite State's motto is still ``Live Free or Die,'' but gun
control, abortion, and taxes are as divisive in New Hampshire as
they are in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire of hard-line conservatives, homogeneous small
towns and Republican domination has gone the way of the textile and
shoe industries.
</P>
<P>
   The number of registered Independents (271,715 to 272,115
Republicans in 1998) is growing as fast as the number of high tech
workers (84 of every 1,000 residents, according to the American
Electronics Association.) Newcomers outnumber natives. The state's
southern tier looks less like a bucolic Currier &AMP; Ives scene than
the Route 128 belt around Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In matters political as well as economic the line between New
Hampshire and Massachusetts is growing ever more blurry. Senator
Edward M. Kennedy might be the image of politically liberal
Massachusetts, but Governor William Weld was the more recent
reality. New Hampshire Governor Mel Thomson was certainly a classic
conservative, but the incumbent is not only a woman and a
progressive, she's a Democrat who is able to say the words
``broad-based tax'' without flinching.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that fewer than 8,000 of the state's 1.1 million
residents are black, but a more liberal social climate is evidenced
by the decision of lawmakers in May to make New Hampshire the last
state in the union to finally recognize the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday as a state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire even offers children the chance to attend public
kindergarden now.
</P>
<P>
   If Smith is counting on the fact that Buchanan won the New
Hamshire primary in 1996, he would do well to remember that the
former Nixon speechwriter and syndicated columnist garnered only 27
percent of the vote. He won those votes primarily on the strength
of workers' fears that free trade would cost them their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A robust economy has quieted those fears. A secure workforce is
less susceptible to the jingoism of a Pat Buchanan or a Bob Smith,
a man who has distinguished himself on the Senate floor by waving
color photographs of aborted fetuses in the faces of his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   It says everything about Smith that he signaled his interest
Tuesday in carrying the banner of the US Taxpayers Party into this
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxpayers Party was founded seven years ago by right-wing
zealot Howard Phillips to inject ``Christian values'' into national
politics. Phillips was the party's presidential nominee in 1992 and
again in 1996, when his name was on the ballot in 39 states.
</P>
<P>
   The party's platform endorses a repeal of the federal income
tax, the abolition of welfare, the recognition of the legal
personhood of a fetus from the moment of conception and recognition
of ``the Lord God as Creator, Preserver and Ruler of the Universe
and of this Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   If the US Taxpayers Party embodies his ideals, maybe what
Senator Smith really means by sovereignty is theocracy.
State-sponsored religion is bound to be a tough sell anywhere in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere more so than in New Hampshire, a state that has
changed in almost every way but not in its storied independence.

IN THE OTHER BIG SHOW, PRESIDENTIAL ALL STARS WARM UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Welcome
to Fenway Park and the 1999 All Star game for presidential
candidates of both leagues. Joe?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ned, the old park is packed for a display of the top talent
from all of presidential politics. Let's do the lineups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Batting leadoff for the Republicans is the scrappy little
rookie, Gary Bauer. Like all of the Republicans in this year's
lineup, Gary bats right, throws right, leans right, thinks right,
and dresses right. He's never been in the Big Show before this, so
we'll be watching for signs of rookie stage fright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right behind Bauer is the veteran Tennesseean, Lamar
Alexander, in the plaid uniform. Lamar was up for a cup of coffee
in the previous contest, but was sent down in the middle of primary
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting third is the Beltway Basher, Pat Buchanan. Pat's
struggled a bit this season compared with his strong early showing
last time, winning the New Hampshire primary. But he came down with
a recurrence of that pesky knee injury which kept him out of the
military during Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Batting cleanup in the GOP order is the hottest hitter in
campaign fund-raising, George W. Bush of the Texas ballclub. In the
cash-lifting contest featuring all the All Stars, George lifted
$36.4 million, three times as much as his nearest competitor. That
was a new record, Joe, and marks young Geroge as the man to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You said it, Ned. But young George has never faced the kind of
pitching he's going to see this time around. We know he can hit the
fast ball. But can he hit the curveball?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we pause for the singing of the National Anthem by
Elizabeth Dole. She's doing one of her patented walk-arounds out in
the bleachers. Oops, it looks like one of the fans has stolen her
microphone. I see several of Boston's finest chasing a man carrying
a microphone down the right field stairwell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While we wait for a new microphone, let's mention that this
broadcast is authorized by the owner of major league baseball,
Steve Forbes, whom all of us here in radioland call `Boss.' Mr.
Forbes purchased the rights to the national pastime, which he
describes as a fall-back position in case his bid to purchase the
presidency falls through again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to the batting order. Bush in clean-up is followed by
John McCain, the classy Arizonan who missed several seasons when he
was called away to military service. Despite some injuries suffered
when his Navy jet was shot down, McCain recuperated after a long
convalescence and his now back stroking the ball with more
authority than anyone in the game right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ned, McCain seems to be seeing the ball real well, because no
matter what they throw at him _ Kosovo, the tobacco thing,
telecommunications reform, you name it _ McCain just keeps knocking
that old horsehide right outa the park.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't agree more, Joe. When it comes to keeping his eye
on the ball, McCain is the class of his league. But at this level,
the pitches are not always straight, and the press corps can just
murder a guy who makes a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You said it, Ned. And the press box today is
standing-room-only. Ever since the Clinton case, there's been a
pack of reporters just hanging around trying to dig up dirt on
everybody in the game today. Who's up after McCain?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Batting sixth is Dan Quayle, the Indiana potato-masher. Dan
had a so-so year after four years in the vice presidency. He says
he's worked on his swing and hopes he's ready to face some major
league pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next up is John Kasich, a rookie from Ohio. He's the one
wearing that funny-looking necktie over his baseball shirt. John
plays a very safe-and-sound game of economics, figuring the angles,
and making sure he hits the cut-off man with throws from deep in
the outfield. But his offense is a question-mark. So far this year,
he's not had a single homer. And his RBI number makes him a little
suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In No. 8 is Alan Keyes, a former radio broadcaster. Not much
is known about Alan's game, but they say he comes to play, even
though he doesn't get many at-bats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Batting ninth is a latecomer to the squad, who just names
himself the other day. That would be the lanky outfielder from
Utah, Orrin Hatch. He's not been in the news much this season, but
they say that in committee, he's murder on left-handed hitting
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ned, who's that big fella sitting on the GOP bench, with his
cap on backwards?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That'd be Bob Smith, the spare catcher, like his idol Carleton
Fisk a Granite Stater who donned the tools of ignorance and tried
to make it as a backstop. Bob is threatening to bolt the Republican
club and try to start his own league. But we understand now he's
having second thoughts because he couldn't find anyone to bolt with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the opposition? How come the Democrats have only
two players dressed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe, the Democrats decided not to field a full team. They've
got Al Gore pitching, catching, and playing the infield, with Big
Bill Bradley, the old New York Knick, playing all three outfield
spots. That gives new a whole new meaning to the term `running for
president.' ''

HOW TO SCORE WINNING GOALS ON THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You have to have goals, of course. Be a team
player. Hustle. Use your head. And be careful: Wandering hands can
get you in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few career lessons you could have learned from
watching the Women's World Cup soccer tournament, where
goal-setting was only the beginning. Here are some other things to
kick around:
</P>
<P>
   _ The clock keeps ticking, even when you're tired.
</P>
<P>
   Except for halftime, soccer doesn't have any timeouts or
built-in rest periods. That means you have to be in shape, of
course, but you also have to figure out when to use your energy and
when to coast.
</P>
<P>
   If you run at full speed all the time, you won't last the whole
game. If you coast too often, you'll get pulled out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Misdirected energy is just as dangerous in soccer as it is in a
9-to-5 job. People will complain about how overwhelming their
workload is, yet they won't stop to analyze how they could manage
their time better.
</P>
<P>
   They'll spend hours trying to come up with a creative idea in a
cubicle when they might have been better off going home, then
brainstorming after they'd had a chance to relax.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest energy-wasters at work is getting too
theatrical when things go wrong. If next week is going to be tough,
it doesn't do you any good to spend the weekend grousing to your
spouse or friends. If you get an extra half-hour of work dumped on
you, don't spend an hour dwelling on it. You're cutting into
valuable coasting time.
</P>
<P>
   Things go wrong all the time, from unfair workloads to getting
passed over for promotions. Not every call will go in your favor.
</P>
<P>
   And if you just lie there clutching your shins, you won't get
the next call, either.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leadership has to be shared.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer coaches don't have the play-by-play influence that their
colleagues do in football, basketball or baseball. Several players
in soccer have to be leaders; the field is just too big and the
action moves too quickly for any one person to be in charge.
</P>
<P>
   That's the trend in corporate leadership as well. Successful
companies are the ones moving away from the command-and-control
style and spreading the decision-making. Global competition and
fast-paced technological improvements make it just about impossible
for any one person to run the show.
</P>
<P>
   Smart companies do this even with things like customer service.
</P>
<P>
   They know that if the first person you talk with is able to
resolve your complaint, you'll walk away much happier than if you
have to repeat your story to two or three managers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sometimes it pays to be a Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   Just because you're a team player doesn't mean you can't be a
star.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team played great soccer, but part of its popularity
came because individual players appeared on David Letterman's show
and in several television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Those appearances drew attention to players like Mia Hamm and
Brandi Chastain and Briana Scurry, but they also offered fans more
humor and humanity than they would have gotten through a bunch of
boring post-game interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When you do something well at work, people ought to notice your
individual contributions as well as your team's. If they don't,
bring it to their attention _ preferably with some cleverness.
</P>
<P>
   _ Once in a while, you aim at the wrong goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarterfinal game against Germany, Chastain thought she
was kicking the ball back to Scurry, the goalie, but it ended up
going in her own net.
</P>
<P>
   In soccer and in life, it's a lot easier to hit the wrong goal
than the right one. Your rivals won't stop you because you're
helping them, and your friends are naive enough to think that you
actually know what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   If you foul up, do what Chastain did: Hold your head up, point
yourself in the right direction and keep working. Later in the same
game, she knocked in another goal _ into the right net this time.
</P>
<P>
   In the championship game against China, she kicked another ball
into the right net. You may have heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain's teammates didn't turn their backs on her after the
mistake. They're professional enough to know that mistakes and
losses are rarely as devastating as they appear at first.

US TEAM SETS GOLD STANDARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a tournament marking the US National Team return of Dot
Richardson and the international debut of Danielle Henderson, USA
Gold did just what its name implies: brought home the top hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Led by one-hit pitching by Lisa Fernandez in the final, the US
shut out Australia, 1-0, to finish undefeated in the Canada Cup,
which featured the top five seeds _ US, Australia, China, Japan,
and Canada _ for the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good challenge for us,'' said Fernandez, who won a
gold medal with the 1996 Olympic squad and made an impressive bid
for the 2000 team with an ERA of 0.00 in 20.2 innings of the Cup.
``There wasn't a game that was to be taken lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Olympic team is expected to be chosen in September.
``This was a big tournament for us,'' said Fernandez. ``An Olympic
berth for all of the members of the team was on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Henderson's ERA in 14 innings was the highest on the
team at 1.50, the newcomer made an impression. In one game, an 8-0
mercy-rule win, she struck out 14 of the 16 batters she faced; in
another, against Japan, she entered the game in the bottom of the
sixth, struck out the batter with two outs and the bases loaded,
and picked up the win.
</P>
<P>
   An All-American out of the University of Massachusetts,
Henderson posted a won-loss record there of 108-35 before
graduating last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a good experience for her,'' said Fernandez.
``She'll have a bright future.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, the US will attempt to defend its gold medal from the
1996 Games. But first, it will travel to Texas and Oklahoma for
several more tuneup games before beginning play in the Pan American
Games on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   In her comeback, Richardson batted .355 with four home runs,
moving over to second base from her Olympic position of shortstop.
The 37-year-old Richardson took the last several years off from
top-level softball to complete her residency as an orthopedic
surgeon at the USC Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Canada Cup final was nearly an all-US matchup, as a second
American team, USA Blue, would have faced the Gold had it not lost
to Australia in the seminfinal. Blue finished third with a record
of 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jones to Portland?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A familiar name has surfaced as a candidate to coach the
expansion WNBA franchise in Portland, Maine that will begin play
next year: K.C. Jones. Whether he's interested is unknown; the
former coach of the Boston Celtics and New England Blizzard could
not be reached Tuesday . . . Speaking of basketball, an exhibit
looking at the history of the women's professional game from its
origins in the US in 1978 to the present is going on now at the
Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass. Called ``Heart &AMP;
Soul, A Celebration of Women's Professional Basketball,''
memorabilia includes Nancy Lieberman-Cline's jersey from the
Springfield Flame and Lynette Woodard's Harlem Globetrotters warmup
jacket. Call 413-781-6500 for information . . . In Maine, Joan
Benoit Samuelson is getting ready for her second-annual Peoples
Beach to Beacon 10K, which will begin at 8 a.m. on Aug. 7 along a
scenic course in her hometown of Cape Elizabeth. Call 888-480-6940
for information or entry forms.

QUESTION OF PRO SOCCER LEAGUE WILL REMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the US women's soccer team is stopping traffic in midtown
Manhattan by breaking into a chorus of ``We Are The Champions,''
the public is swamping General Mills begging to see their
now-familiar faces on a Wheaties box.
</P>
<P>
   As the potential commercial bonanza of Brandi Chastain's sports
bra is debated in the news pages, the morning talk shows squabble
over who gets which player at what time. Even as the US Soccer
Federation is planning trips to Egypt, South Africa, and Australia,
a players' representative is organizing a lucrative US tour of
indoor arenas to begin in November.
</P>
<P>
   For women's sports, it doesn't get any bigger than this. At
least it never has before.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the flurry of attention and the current flood of
oratorical endorphins (``seminal moment'' and ``cultural shift''
come to mind), it's not even clear how _ or if _ the euphoria of
the 1999 Women's World Cup will translate into the nuts-and-bolts
of a professional league.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened Saturday almost transcends sports, and you
almost can't project what that would mean for a league,'' said Mark
Mandel, spokesman for ABC, which televised the final.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Logan, commissioner of Major League Soccer, agreed.
``There's a large distinction between being able to spend two years
marketing a three-week event and what I call the heavy lifting week
in and week out of trying to sell games.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Alan I. Rothenberg, chairman of the World Cup board of
directors. ``A sober look would say a week-in, week-out, year-in,
year-out league has a different attraction than a one-time, big
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the heavy lifting has already begun. During the World
Cup, US Soccer announced its involvement in developing a business
plan to explore the feasibility of a US league to start after the
2000 Olympics. Most observers agree that such a move is essential
both for sharpening the skills of US players as the rest of the
world catches up and for keeping the sport in the limelight during
the long stretches between the Olympic and World Cup spotlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know about TV ratings, sponsorship, everything, there
has to be predictable exposure,'' said Donna Lopiano, executive
director of the Women's Sports Foundation. ``Nothing short of a pro
league is going to be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though some observers, led by Lopiano, believe US Soccer
dropped the ball by not supporting an attempt to start a league in
the wake of the 1996 Olympics, others say the World Cup's
phenomenal success, which far exceeded the expectations of even its
organizers, may provide a bigger boost than Olympic gold alone
could ever have.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, organizers will be able to wave TV
ratings better than those for the NBA Finals at potential
advertisers and sponsors. At the Summer Games in Atlanta, the
gold-medal match was not televised, which Logan still calls a
travesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will make all the difference in the world,'' he
said of the documented ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good TV ratings are a very good sign for an advertiser,
because lots of people watching means lots of people probably
buying,'' said Nova Lanktree, president of Lanktree Sports
Celebrity Network in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the TV ratings with sellout crowds for almost every US
game, said Peter Roby, Reebok's vice president of marketing for
North America, and the appeal will be difficult to ignore. ``It
takes one more reason away for companies to say no,'' he said.
``There is now a proven success story on a global basis on what
women's sports can represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Right on, says forward Tiffeny Milbrett: ``The legacy that I
want to leave and that I hope is left is that you can no longer
take women's athletics lightly,'' she said soon after the emotional
final game. ``There's no more excuses for people to say we're not
going to draw. There's no more excuses for people to say we're not
marketable. There's no more excuses to say we're not going to put
fans in the stands.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, say marketers and others connected to the sport,
the players need to stay in the public eye so the team's attraction
to sponsors and advertisers doesn't diminish before the 2000
Olympic juggernaut begins. Their next scheduled tournament isn't
until October, and the parade from Disneyland to Letterman to
Newsweek will begin to trail off in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's work,'' said Kim Parsons, assistant director of athletic
marketing for Woolf Associates, who represents US ice hockey
Olympic gold medalists Katie King and Tricia Dunn. ``It's got to be
something that's thought out and strategized by their agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Danger, some say, lurks in expecting too much of the recent
tournament, as glorious as it was. A lag between the memory of a
packed Rose Bowl and the league opener might be an intangible
advantage. After all, there aren't many games of any type,
anywhere, that attract more than 90,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough time for the euphoria to pass away and reach a
more realistic level of expectations,'' said George Taylor,
president of Sports Mondial, a sports marketing company in New
York. ``You have to be realistic in your goals, because you are
going to be measured against those goals after one or two
seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   This wouldn't be the first time America proclaimed an event a
turning point, a breakthrough, a seminal moment, only to be brought
back to earth by the realities of the marketplace. Remember the
1996 Summer Games, with gold medals for women's soccer, softball,
gymnastics, and basketball? Since then, the American Basketball
League has come and gone, the six-team Women's Pro Softball League
plays barely noticed outside of its home cities, and a women's ice
hockey league failed to get off the ground. Only the WNBA has seen
widespread success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1996 Olympics were a real benchmark, and the Women's World
Cup is another benchmark, a layer,'' said Sharon Barbano, president
of the Women's Sports Marketing Group in Marblehead. ``The 2000
Olympics will be yet another layer. We need to keep layering. The
work isn't done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean King couldn't agree more. ``What the women's soccer
team is facing is very similar to when my generation of tennis
players were getting organized,'' said the legendary tennis star
and women's rights advocate in a statement. ``They need a vehicle
for growth, whether it's a professional league, prize money, or
some revenue stream. We started our own tennis tour in 1970. At the
time, there were probably two players on our tour _ me and Margaret
Court _ who made good money. It's probably no different today in
women's soccer. Now, almost 30 years later, more than 100 women are
making a solid living on the WTA tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly, said Lanktree, many women on the World Cup team
may not be looking for more than that. ``The women may not even be
pursuing things the way men in the sports business do,'' she said.
``These women seem very gratified that they are serving the
community of the world in terms of being role models. They're
ringing very true to me. I'm not sensing falseness there at all.
Maybe the women are defining success differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lanktree agreed that none of this necessarily promises
success for a league. Her
</P>
<P>
   assessment? ``What has happened, ultimately, is that nothing
negative has come out of this event, and that's a very good
start.''

RUSH TO ADD `BANDWIDTH' MAY HAVE LEFT GLUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Mark Bruneau is right, tens of billions of dollars worth of
stock market investment in information-highway communcations
networks runs the risk of going up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   As the high-flying US telecommunications industry races to add
exponentially more ``bandwidth'' carrying capacity for data, video
and voice, Bruneau, head of business strategy at the Boston
consulting group Renaissance Worldwide, is warning that the
industry is on the brink of being severely overbuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry analysts also are skeptical that all of the
billions of dollars worth of fiber optic cable being laid and
upgraded around the world will ever get enough use to prove
economical.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruneau's more extreme view compares the situation to wiring
a home for 20 times more electricity than it will ever use. He
predicts that within two years, the United States will have 400
times more telecommunications capacity than it had in 1998 _ demand
for space on networks to carry computer traffic, video and voice
calls will grow only 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that the builders and investors supporting more
and more bandwidth into the backbone are collectively
hallucinating,'' Bruneau said in a recent interview. ``It's
definitely a controversial point of view, but the huge increase in
supply is undeniably there.''
</P>
<P>
   With one company alone, Qwest Communications International Inc.,
now building network capacity that could move the the entire
contents of the Library of Congress coast-to-coast in 20 seconds, a
number of other analysts agree there is reason to question the need
for the the half-dozen more like it that are also under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry officials and other analysts, however, find
Bruneau's predictions of imbalance and looming financial disaster
misleading and far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard these predictions over and over again in my
career, going back 20 years, but what none of these predictions
ever account for is the unpredictable,'' said Michael J. Zak of
Charles River Ventures, a Waltham, Mass. early-state venture
capital firm active in telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Each wave of new capacity, Zak and others note, has produced its
own explosion in new demand for formerly costly services, from
long-distance calling and faxing in the 1980s to data transmission
in the early 1990s and, today, Web surfing and zapping video clips
and huge files over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   However, Peter Sevcik of Northeast Consulting Resources in
Boston, warned earlier this year that ``the easy converts to the
Internet have been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in Business Communications Review, a trade magazine,
Sevcik said that to meet some of the most bullish recent
predictions about Net growth, within two years every American
Internet user would have to spend 24 hours a day logged on.
</P>
<P>
   Sevcik said the history of Internet usage is a cycle of boom
times followed by slack periods _ suggesting that demand will catch
up with the growth of the technology, but not as soon as investors
might hope. ``The danger is that actual demand won't support the
infrastructure being proposed,'' Sevcik wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bruneau, however, fears that just as in industries that sell
physical goods for which demand is slow to develop, the mismatch
between bandwidth supply and demand will lead to a discounting war
that would pummel the stocks of companies building the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these have been stock-market darlings in the late 1990s,
including equipment makers and big cable-system builders such as
Global Crossing, Qwest, and Teleglobe, as well as MediaOne and
other cable television giants that are rebuilding their systems to
grab Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   These companies find Bruneau's thesis preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put in 40 times as much capacity and twiddle
my thumbs and say, `Anybody want to use my capacity?' '' said Dan
Sheinbein, vice president for network architecture and development
with AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T now has 41,000 route-miles of intercity backbone fiber
crisscrossing the nation, one of the biggest US networks. ``We're
deploying it as fast as we can, and we're chewing it up as fast as
we can,'' Sheinbein said.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne Group Inc. is spending $7 billion nationwide _ $1.3
billion of that in Massachusetts and New Hampshire _ to upgrade its
cable television lines to carry high-speed Internet and local
telephone traffic. Kevin Casey, senior vice president for
MediaOne's Massachusetts-New Hampshire division, says: ``I find it
hard at my vantage point to think we've got this glut of idle
capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Already more than 70,000 of 1 million eligible customers have
signed up for MediaOne's RoadRunner fast Internet access in the
region. In some communities MediaOne claims 20 percent penetration,
Casey said, as people move from slow dial-up modems move to cable
connections that are up to 50 times faster.
</P>
<P>
   While Bruneau's prediction that bandwidth capacity will outstrip
supply by a factor of 20 is daunting, that situation in practical
terms is far less irrational than, say, building a 20-lane highway
to serve two dozen new homes.
</P>
<P>
   First, says Mark Wegleitner, chief technology officer at Bell
Atlantic Corp., much of the increased capacity over the next two
years will come not from new wires but by adding multiplexing
devices and faster switches that can ``relatively inexpensively''
increase carrying capacity of existing fiber cable by a factor of
20 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Casey at MediaOne said much of the 400-fold capacity increase
Bruneau cites involves redundancy being built as backup in case a
wire gets sliced or fails, or ``dark fibers'' that are not being
turned on immediately but are cheaper to install now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you run 100 miles of fiber, the major cost is digging up
the street. Whether you put in one fiber or 100 gets lost in the
rounding; the backhoe cost is the real cost,'' Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Leichtman, director of media and entertainment strategies
at the Yankee Group in Boston, a consulting firm, predicts that by
2002, 60 percent of Americans will have access to high-speed cable
modems and Digital Subscriber Lines that could mop up much excess
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But for the momment, Leichtman asks, ``What is the content or
service that will push (usage) to the next level? Right now, there
is no killer application that is out there.''

MANAGERS BEST MARKET INDEXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's something we usually can't say with a straight face:
There is a good chance your mutual fund manager is beating the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, stock fund investors have become accustomed to
hearing about how an extraordinary number of active managers
trailed their benchmark market indexes, like the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500. The S&AMP;P 500 often beat 80 percent of the active managers who
compare their results with the index, sometimes even more.
</P>
<P>
   But the tables have been turned, at least for a brief but
important recent period. Relative fund performance beginning Oct. 8
last year, when the stock market hit a bottom, and last week has
been practically bullish.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time they're looking good, and they haven't
for a long time,'' said Reuben Brewer, mutual fund research
director at Value Line Mutual Fund Survey. The bad news: he doesn't
expect it to last forever and neither do some others.
</P>
<P>
   If there was ever a time to capture the returns of the stock
market, it would be hard to find a better period. The S&AMP;P 500
soared 47.7 percent and the Russell 2000, which tracks small
stocks, advanced by 49.2 percent during those nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of all growth mutual funds that invest in large
stocks _ 43.3 percent _ beat the S&AMP;P 500 rally during that period,
according to Morningstar Inc. , the fund data company based in
Chicago that analyzed the time period for us.
</P>
<P>
   The average growth fund return was a whopping 54.9 percent over
that span, according to Lipper Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The last year big-stock fund managers have done so well stacked
up against the S&AMP;P 500? It was 1993, when 54 percent of managers
beat the index, their best relative performance in a decade,
according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   No one debates why large-stock funds have done better. A few
so-called mega-cap stocks like Coca-Cola Co. that once accounted
for the majority of the S&AMP;P 500's returns no longer dominate the
index.
</P>
<P>
   Diversified funds, which typically own 100 or more different
stocks, found it difficult to compete against a benchmark driven by
just a handful of names. At their lowest point, in 1997, a mere
10.7 percent of large-company stock funds could beat their index
bogey.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that fund managers have changed so much. The market has
changed. ``One by one they fell out of the infallible category,
Coke and Gillette, and there have been others,'' said Syl
Marquardt, research director at John Hancock Funds.
</P>
<P>
   Even more small-stock funds have outpaced the Russell 2000 since
last October. Morningstar reported that 48.4 percent of
small-capitalization funds beat the index. The average small-stock
fund also returned 54.9 percent, according to Lipper.
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of relative performance isn't nearly as good as it
seems. Unlike their big-stock counterparts, mutual funds that buy
shares of smaller companies often outpace their index benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Most small-stock funds outperformed the Russell 2000 in seven
years over the last decade, typically winning in the best and worst
of times. Four of even five small-stock funds beat the index when
it lost the most money, in 1991, and a thin majority beat the
Russell 2000 when it soared the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Managers who invest in small stocks have several advantages over
their benchmark. They are working in a less efficient part of the
stock market, where an overlooked gem is more likely to appear, and
tend to hold onto big winners that are so successful they grow too
big to remain in the index.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the advantage to a stockpicker and a lot of leeway to
choose good companies from a larger number of stocks,'' said
William Dougherty of Kanon, Bloch Carre, a Boston mutual fund
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Those small-stock managers may continue to do pretty well
against the Russell 2000's performance. But the efficiency of the
market for large stocks, where so many people invest that it's hard
to get a sustained leg up on the competition, makes it tougher for
other managers to stay close to the S&AMP;P 500. ``In the more
efficient parts of the market, it's likely that the S&AMP;P advantage
will continue,'' said Marc O'Brien of O'Brien Management, a
Cambridge investment advisory firm.

   BOSTON -- Kate Spade giggles when she talks about money.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, she was earning $14,500 a year as an accessories
editor at Mademoiselle. Fed up with limited choices in handbags,
Spade started making her own. Undaunted by her lack of design
experience, she got out the Scotch tape and drawing paper and made
prototypes in a rainbow of colors and fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew? What began as a small company six years ago in her
apartment generated $28 million in sales in 1998. And nobody could
have predicted that Neiman Marcus would buy 56 percent of the New
York designer's company this year for a cool $33.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't even make sense,'' she says, giggling, during a
recent visit to her Newbury Street store.
</P>
<P>
   This is what it takes to make it in the fashion industry: good
instincts, an outsider's perspective and get-up-and-go.
</P>
<P>
   Spade, a Mademoiselle editor from 1986 to 1993, had access to
up-to-the-moment handbag designs from around the world. What bag
did she carry? Not Prada. Not Chanel. A simple no-name wicker bag
with no flaps or zippers to enclose it. ``It was rectangular and
completely open,'' she says. ``I'd take a scarf in the winter to
cover the top in case it snowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Spade's reasoning _ pretty radical in an industry obsessed with
the latest designer anything _ was that brand-name handbags weren't
any fun. ``I was looking for something that could be less serious.
More personal,'' she says. ``I also wanted timelessness.'' Like
many women, Spade balked at having to choose between functional and
fashionable purses. ``Handbags should be both. That's what
designers were forgetting,'' she says. ``So many bags can hold a
kitchen sink but they're just big black bags.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so Spade's designs. Picture a square straw purse with large
colorful flowers woven onto it. Or a silk tote adorned with bright
pink and red alternating stripes. How about a red silk-satin
evening clutch? Spade, whose philosophy is ``bags should assume the
personality of the wearer, not the reverse,'' specializes in
classic shapes (totes and clutches, mostly) that are modernized
with fashionable colors (including pink, red, and black) and
materials (silk, canvas, nylon, and leather). Her prices range from
$130 to $500. And women love them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an innovative look. The bags I carry are pretty
versatile. I can wear them to work. I can wear them out,'' says
Carolyn O'Keefe, a 28-year-old furniture-leasing sales associate.
O'Keefe, who lives in Charlestown, visits the Boston store every
few weeks and owns three Spade creations. ``Nine West and Kenneth
Cole, they're more bland than Kate. . . . I don't like Dooney &AMP;
Bourke. It's too dowdy. Coach is kinda dowdy too. Prada I'd like to
afford. . . . Kate has cute styles. They're very simple. They go
with everything I have. And she's part of the current fashion
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Spade, a 36-year-old native of Kansas City, Mo., never dreamed
of becoming a style maven. The daughter of a housewife and
construction company owner, her idea of fashion was wearing denim
overalls around the house with her five siblings and spending time
sifting through her mother's jewelry drawer. She says, ``When I was
a kid, I didn't even know Chanel. I would have called it Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as Kate Brosnahan back then, she majored in journalism at
Arizona State University in the early 1980s. She met her future
husband and business partner, Andy Spade (a fellow student whose
brother is actor and comedian David Spade), when they were both
working at a men's clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation in 1985, the duo moved to New York. Andy, now
37, took copywriting jobs at ad agencies like Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi and
TBWA/Chiat/Day. Kate landed at Mademoiselle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Andy and Kate, were visiting friends in Provincetown
when they agreed on a company name combining her first name and his
last name. ``Andy kept saying `Kate Spade. Kate Spade.' I loved
Olive for some reason. But Kate Spade wasn't frilly. It was just
straightforward. It wasn't a fashion-y name,'' she says. (And no,
it wasn't Andy's way of proposing, she says. The couple married in
1995.)
</P>
<P>
   She left Mademoiselle and used her entire $6,000 401(k) to buy
fabric, have patterns made, and manufacture samples. Andy, who
continued working in advertising until 1996, when he became company
creative director, paid additional bills as needed. ``Our initial
investment was about $35,000,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense would say that Spade used her industry connections
to find a manufacturer and distributor. But the former editor says,
``I was nervous about calling people. Since I had seen so many
collections in advance, I thought people would be afraid I'd copy
them.'' Instead, she used the Yellow Pages and the library at the
Fashion Institute of Technology to find a manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   When enough samples arrived, Andy and Kate signed up to attend a
trade show in New York. But the night before the event, something
about the bags nagged at her. ``There was something missing. We
needed something for the eye to go to,'' she says. So she stayed up
all night switching her black ``Kate Spade New York'' labels from
the inside of her bags to the outside. ``You can imagine pushing
through all that cardboard with a needle,'' says the designer,
whose fingers grew puffy from the effort.
</P>
<P>
   It was worth it. Barneys New York and Charivari placed $500 in
orders that next day. It didn't cover the trade show expenses, but
it was a start. Even better, Vogue noticed the company and included
it in an accessories column three months later. ``We were on the
same page with Chanel, Prada, and Gucci,'' she recalls. ``I was
like, `I'm going to faint!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, and
Bloomingdale's were carrying the line. Then Spade opened her own
freestanding stores in New York, Los Angeles, and Japan in 1996 to
1998. In January, Neiman Marcus bought a stake in the company as a
partner with no day-to-day involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Now her accessory lines include an eclectic mix of colorful
wallets, day planners, stationery, and trench coats. In November,
she's unveiling shoes that _ like her bags _ will come in a few
shapes and many fabrics and trims.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company is also introducing a new men's line that
features luggage, duffel bags, messenger bags, and trench coats.
Called Jack Spade, the line will be designed by Andy and sold in
separate Jack Spade stores. ``It will be very masculine and
utility-driven,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that Kate Spade's personal style is a lot like
her bags: classic, fun, feminine. Her chummy demeanor is
reminiscent of a best friend from grade school. During her recent
trip to Boston, the bubbly 5-foot-2 brunette wore a pink 1950s
style swing dress, strappy black sandals, and hair coiffed in an
upswept do.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling down Newbury Street in a lighthearted mood, she
explained why she decided on Boston for her third US store. ``I
think there's a sensibility here that's simple. I think women have
a great sense of style but fashion is not their main priority. . .
. That customer makes sense for us,'' she says. ``This is not a
terribly trendy city and that works for us because we don't want to
be trendy either. We hope to be around for a while,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' she said, gesturing toward a woman walking down the
street dressed in a striking silver suit with a shiny floral
pattern. ``There's a woman with a Kate Spade bag. You know what I
love? She's a professional. She's in a smart suit. But she's an
individual. She doesn't have a hysteria about fashion. That's how I
like to approach fashion too. You have to be comfortable in it.
Fashion can't feel like a costume.''

ALL THE NEWS THAT WON'T HAPPEN TO YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a recent extra-cubicular activity, I spent part of a morning
ogling Al Neuharth's traveling ``Newseum,'' which is parked down in
Charlestown next to Old Ironsides. Neuharth is the boosterish
publisher of USA Today, probably the most underrated newspaper in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The peripatetic Newseum, dubbed ``NewsCapade,'' is one of many
sillinesses that help Neuharth while away his old age. He makes
much of visiting the country via ``BusCapade,'' and he has explored
foreign lands in a well-covered (by USA Today, that is)
``JetCapade.'' The Newseum is a modest yet wholesome venture,
purporting to inform Ma and Pa Kettle how we journalists ply our
mysterious trade.
</P>
<P>
   There is a amusing sideshow in which journalists like Ted Koppel
and Sam Donaldson rationalize the heinous errors we all commit from
time to time. And there is a participatory feature called ``Be a TV
News Reporter,'' which does not include hairspray but does provide
a script written by a literate outsider, the sine qua non of
television ``journalism.'' And a portentous film poses the Big
Question: What is News?
</P>
<P>
   Neuharth says ``news'' consists of stories about War, Peace,
Love, Death, Freedom, etc. For years, I have had my own, admittedly
idiosyncratic, definition of news: News is something that will
never happen to you.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unlikely, thank heavens, that you will ever be in a
plane crash, but plane crashes are the staple of Page One news. The
odds are formidable against your winning the lottery, yet lottery
winners are front page evergreens. It is almost impossible to
imagine that a tragedy such as occurred to Winchester High School
graduate Joe Murphy could happen to you _ that you could die from
eating a pistachio nut. But it is a compelling story to read.
</P>
<P>
   The best-selling, and most specious, news consists of random
events shaped into a threatening bolus by people like me.
``Tainted'' Pepsi; dangerous deli foods; remember the
``flesh-eating bacteria''? Spike Lee does a neat job of chronicling
David Berkowitz's random killings in his new movie, ``Summer of
Sam.'' Let's see, eight million New Yorkers, six victims. Those are
pretty good odds that you'll survive the Son of Sam. But the New
York press sold millions of extra newspapers pumping the paranoia
that every young man or woman was a potential member of Sam's Club.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign news almost by definition will never happen to you. With
very few exceptions _ the downfall of the Soviet Union, the Persian
Gulf war _ most major foreign news stories are completely
irrelevant. Japan has been in and out of a recession; did it matter
to you? The astonishing transition in South Africa; has it changed
your life? Your local planning board has had twice as much impact
on your existence as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. But
chances are a newspaper will have the Pulitzer Prize-winning
reporter covering South Africa, not the Planning Board.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, newspapers faced with declining circulation have
been trying for almost two decades to print news that is more
relevant to readers. Suburban ``coping'' stories abound: How to get
the necessary roughage into the kids' lunchboxes? How can I tell if
my spouse is depressed? Does my HMO stack up? Now, more ghoulishly,
newspapers shower readers with stories of diseases they might
actually contract: breast cancer, prostate cancer, asthma. For
20-somethings, the daily paper must have all the appeal of
Prevention magazine.
</P>
<P>
   What news do you really need? Sports news is essential. It's
completely frivolous, but necessary. I can't explain why; it just
is. The stock tables, if you're in the market. The weather and
traffic reports, to be sure. (Our transportation column, ``Starts
and Stops,'' may be the most interesting feature in the paper.) The
obituaries have a certain allure, precisely because they haven't
happened to you. And when it comes time for your obituary, that's
one story you won't have to read.

WYNONNA'S NEW GIG: SINGLE, WORKING MOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wynonna is back on the road with what she proudly calls ``The
Working Mama Tour.'' It's a blend of the musical and the domestic _
and it's working out just fine, thank you, the singer says during a
brief stop at her Nashville home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, I'm a mama by day and a red-headed singer by
night. I'm living the best of both worlds,'' she says. ``It's kind
of like we're on a family vacation and, `Oh, by the way, mama has a
show tonight.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Wynonna's mother, Naomi Judd, jumps on the line to
describe her daughter as ``Xena with an electric guitar.'' That's
an apt phrase, because these days Wynonna is having fun and kicking
butt at the same time with her adrenalized mix of
rhythm-and-blues-spiced country and rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 35 _ and I feel like I'm moving on to the next part of my
life. . . . I believe all things are possible right now,'' says
Wynonna, alias ``Hurricane Wynonna.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a working single parent raising two children _ and mama
wants to work,'' says Wynonna, who has two children, Elijah, 5, and
Grace, 3, by Arch Kelly III, whom she recently divorced.
</P>
<P>
   While on the topic of all things being possible, she says she's
making a new album with the help of the Tower of Power horn section
and is about to call Joni Mitchell to ask her to sing backup on a
cover of Mitchell's ``Help Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of my heroes,'' Wynonna says of Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   In big news for country fans, Wynonna also will join Naomi to
resurrect the Judds _ the mother-and-daughter duo that ruled the
country airwaves during the '80s. They're planning a one-time-only
New Year's Eve show in Phoenix, though speculation is rife that
more dates may lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not planning anything beyond this show,'' says Wynonna,
countering the rumors. ``And I really want to do it right. It's
like planning a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also very clear that this will celebrate her healing,''
adds Wynonna, referring to how Naomi, who quit the road in 1991
because of hepatitis C, has since conquered the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi, who has had a TV show, a radio show, and written an
autobiography and a children's book in the intervening years, jumps
on the phone again to mention how excited, but also how nervous,
she is to rejoin her daughter for the concert. But when Wynonna
exclaims that ``Mom, I want my own bus!,'' Naomi fires back, ``I
want my own bus because yours looks like a day-care center!''
</P>
<P>
   Wynonna went solo in 1992 with the album ``Wynonna,'' which sold
5 million copies to become the top-selling female country album
ever at that point. The record has since been broken by LeAnn Rimes
and Shania Twain, but Wynonna is not fazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To thine own self be true,'' she says. ``I want to be true to
myself and what I believe. I don't have to worry about being No. 1
anymore. What I have to do is just keep singing my butt off.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' Wynonna is also very accepting of her legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tammy Wynette paved the road for me _ and I paved it for LeAnn
and Shania. They're the next generation,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the widespread success of women in country music, Wynonna
adds, ``God's timing is always right on time. And my philosophy is
that a rising tide lifts all boats. . . . It's a really good time
for women, and if I can jump in line, I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   And, while some artists have taken chippy potshots at Shania's
success, Wynonna says, ``I like her,'' though she admits that
``women either love or hate her, and men covet her success.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynonna is not about to envy anyone, because as she gets older,
she feels more empowered about her own abilities. She just
finished, for example, a confidence-boosting, six-day, 60-mile hike
at the Ashram, a spiritual center in Calabassus, Calif., (where
Oprah Winfrey has been) and was pleased to lose 13 pounds in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed my perspective on life,'' says Wynonna, who
attended at the suggestion of her sister, actress Ashley Judd. ``I
would get halfway through the hike each day and start crying. I was
the last one on the hike every day, but I still did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynonna says she's also learned to be alone _ another vital step
on what she perceives as her ongoing spiritual journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm a hurricane blast, but I'm also realizing how
introverted I am,'' says Wynonna. ``I'm just learning more and more
about myself. And I feel sorry for the next guy who comes along,
because I'll be so aware!''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true working mama.

AT HARVARD LAW, NEXT CASE STUDY IS IN STUDENT MORALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Harvard Law students are notoriously
miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the fictional Professor Kingsfield of ``The Paper
Chase'' who hazed students with his brand of Socratic water
torture? Or this from Scott Turow's ``One L,'' his account of
first-year life at Harvard Law: ``The feeling was something near to
panic, a ferocious, grasping sense of uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after decades of student complaints and bad press _ classes
are too big, the faculty too aloof, the atmosphere too cutthroat _
the law school finally appears to be getting the message.
</P>
<P>
   Something must be done.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for a study.
</P>
<P>
   The law school has commissioned a major study by the nation's
brainiest management consulting firm, McKinsey &AMP; Co., to find out
why its students are so blue.
</P>
<P>
   Law school officials say the study, which has not yet been
completed, is just one element of the school's long-term strategic
planning process _ a venture undertaken to ``maximize achievement
of its core mission,'' in the words of Dean Robert Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the study has nothing to do with the fact that the
school has been ranked second for the past two years behind
archrival Yale in US News and World Report's ranking of the
nation's top law schools. They also insist it has nothing to do
with Harvard's performance in a 1994 survey of 18,000 law students
by National Jurist and Princeton Review, in which Harvard Law
placed 154th out of 165 law schools in overall student
satisfaction. Harvard, with roughly 1,800 students, is one of the
nation's biggest law schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the middle of strategic planning,'' said Elizabeth
Warren, a Harvard Law professor and the chairwoman of the committee
that prompted the study. ``If you really want to talk about
changing things, I think it's very important to be very clear on
what our students think about the process and not do it based on
rumor and the loudest students who complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, horror stories persist. Alumni, most speaking
anonymously, complained to the Globe about the ``ugly atmosphere''
at the law school and their lack of contact with their professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to tell people who were applying to law school this,''
said a graduate, John Kaufmann. ``If you want to be a US attorney,
go to the Universty of Chicago. If you want to be a judge or law
professor, go to Yale. But if you want to work on Wall Street, go
to Harvard. That teaches you to deal with difficult people.''
</P>
<P>
   To gather data, McKinsey, which had never perfomed such work at
a university before, sent an ``engagement team'' to Harvard. The
team surveyed students and set up focus group sessions with
different student cohorts, including Harvard Law Review members,
women, African Americans, latinos, and gays. They also conducted
one-on-one interviews with professors.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-page questionaires were sent to alumni from six
classes. The letters came in an envelope that read: ``Not a
donation request _ we need your help.''
</P>
<P>
   So far _ the final report will be issued later this summer _
this is what McKinsey has been able to glean: Class sizes are too
big; access to professors is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle we found is that students want more intellectual
engagement with the faculty,'' said Warren. ``They want more
feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is hardly news, and many wonder why Harvard needed a
pricey management consultant to spell out the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are better uses for the money,'' said Bruce
Goldberger, an alumnus and a tax associate at a New York law firm.
``I'd just be shocked if McKinsey tells them anything that couldn't
be gleaned from talking to students directly.``
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law professor, said an outsider might
be able to get students to open up in ways that a Harvard-run
survey would not. ``Students,'' he said, ``may be more comfortable
whining to an outside firm than whining to us.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dershowitz said Harvard Law School is not the cutthroat
environment it once was. Students are much more cooperative than in
years past, he said, and faculty members are no longer so ruthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a faculty member tried to put down a student today, he'd be
booed,'' Dershowitz said. ``Twenty-five years ago he would have
been cheered.''

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ On July 14, 1789, a prison in Paris was
stormed, an aristocrat was beheaded and 98 people died. By
twilight, one of the most glorious events in history _ the French
Revolution _ was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The French Revolution has always been controversial. Indeed, no
other event in Europe inspires as much debate (or employs as many
historians) as Bastille Day and the tumultuous era that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Often praised for bringing democracy to the people, the
Revolution just as often is damned, either for bringing too much
democracy or not bringing enough. Some even claim there was no
revolution _ just rioting, violence and a touch of genocide. But
there was a revolution, all right. France, after Bastille Day,
changed profoundly. So did an uneasy world.
</P>
<P>
   France was already in an uneasy state by July 1789. Recent grim
grain harvests, combined with the realization his government was
bankrupt, had early in May forced King Louis XVI to summon the
Estates General to Paris for consultations. But relations between
the three ``estates'' (the clergy, the aristocracy, and the ``Third
Estate,'' which was everyone else) had soured since they'd last met
175 years before; the Third Estate no longer bowed to its one-time
superiors. Instead, fearing it wouldn't get sufficient power, the
Third Estate _ peasants, the urban poor, and the middle class _
declared itself the true people's voice and demanded (on June 20) a
constitutional monarchy. Louis refused.
</P>
<P>
   But he did more than refuse. As bread prices rose and famine
loomed and the Parisian streets filled with people demanding
action, Louis ordered up extra troops as a precaution in case of
riot. Rumors spread that these troops had orders to shoot the
citizenry, who were unarmed; people began searching for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, doubly desperate _ no arms, no bread _ crowds converged at
the customs barriers and grain depots. And at the Bastille.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of the Bastille _ that it was attacked because it was a
political prison where innocent victims suffered unspeakable
torture _ is just that, myth: The Bastille was a prison, but it was
also a fort housing cannons and gunpowder. It was these weapons,
not the Bastille's prisoners, the Parisians were after.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there only were seven prisoners in the Bastille when it
fell: four counterfeiters, two lunatics and one debauche _ speaking
of which, the Marquis de Sade had been transferred out one week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   When de Launay, the Bastille's commandant, noticed the crowd
gathered outside the gates, he offered, quite calmly, to negotiate.
But as the crowd pushed into the inner courtyard, somebody
panicked. Musketry erupted: Men, women, and hungry children fell to
the ground. The Revolution had its first martyrs. And soon the
Counterrevolution had its first martyr too.
</P>
<P>
   De Launay was marched through the streets and beheaded.
</P>
<P>
   News of the Bastille soon spread through the countryside, where
after a month of peasant violence and a string of gutted chateaux
(and gutted aristocrats), even Louis knew something momentous was
happening. On Aug. 27 the Declaration of the Rights of Man was
adopted _ a document clearly pro-Third Estate, though not clear
about much else. Two years later, in 1791, a constitutional
monarchy was installed. The Revolution appeared finished.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. The following August, as France embarked upon a
series of bloody wars, Louis' continued existence became unbearably
irksome to the Revolutionary leaders, who were growing more radical
hour by hour; he was deposed, and a new set of leaders ordered his
death. Soon these new leaders were ordering everyone's death,
including their own; by July 1794, only five years after Bastille
Day, the Reign of Terror had managed to guillotine not only 35,000
citizens of the new republic, but all its own leaders as well.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile France, still at war, began winning battle after
battle. People heard, for the first time, the name ``Napoleon.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1804, Napoleon was being hailed as Emperor, a title far
greater than king, and with powers comparable to any Louis had lost
on Bastille Day.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 210 years later, the French Revolution remains
controversial. Good? Bad? A real revolution, or simply a new
variation on an old tyranny? From this tangle of questions, three
lessons emerge.
</P>
<P>
   First, people acting together have the power to change the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Second, when the people do act, their leaders had better listen,
or risk losing their power (and sometimes their lives).
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, true change takes more than good intentions and
well-crafted phrases. As the Revolution shows: Change the world
carelessly, and you wind up exchanging a king for an emperor.

SYNERGISTIC SILLINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &UR;  &LR; _ In corporate mergers, synergy is often a
synonym for sellout, but even master manipulators can stumble in
the rush to the cash register. The victorious US women's soccer
team captivated 40 million viewers on one day, but ABC could not
fully exploit this opportunity because advertisers do not yet
control the sport of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the team arrived at Disneyland, showering free
publicity on the theme park owned by the Walt Disney Co., which
also owns ABC. Mickey Mouse, after a much-photographed embrace with
soccer star Mia Hamm, had synergy as an excuse, explaining to
Minnie how there's more than one way to skin a commercial cat.
</P>
<P>
   The splendid amateurs who celebrated in Pasadena may want to
turn pro, but they might entertain doubts. Until soccer allows
two-minute warnings or other television timeouts, the game will lag
in the affections of the entertainment conglomerates that now
invest in sports. Moguls prefer slower, tidier sports, with
ad-friendly quarters or innings.
</P>
<P>
   Media conglomerates have cornered baseball's second-largest
market, Southern California, but their logo-bearing, underachieving
subsidiaries are better loss leaders than content providers. Disney
owns the Anaheim Angels, known as the California Angels when they
were owned by the late singing cowboy, Gene Autry. Disney changed
the team's dateline, but not its luck.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels inhabit the Hades of the American League's
western division, but do their job, advertising Anaheim's major
theme park. Mo Vaughn, the former Red Sox first baseman acquired at
a hefty price, was photographed enjoying the Mad Teacup ride,
Disneyland's homage to Alice in Wonderland, a character with whom
the restless slugger may identify.
</P>
<P>
   The Angel uniforms look as though the Mad Hatter designed them.
In the cartoon world of Orange County, Mo may earn his cash,
laboring where the literary inspirations are Lewis Carroll and A.
A. Milne rather than Nathaniel Hawthorne and Ralph Waldo Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   At the season's start, The Sporting News and most others picked
the Angels to win the division, but injuries have made the roster
look like an orthopedic ward. Perhaps some Disney vice president
will dispatch the wounded to Geppetto's workshop.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers enjoyed a wider consensus among
preseason prophets. ``Dodgers look destined to win west,'' ran the
April headline in the San Francisco Chronicle, adding, ``Lineup
makes it hard to for L.A. to go wrong.'' At the All-Star break, the
Dodgers are in the cellar, with no medical excuses _ or none that
would impress their new owner, the international media baron,
Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, more than 40 years after Walter O'Malley moved the team
west, Brooklyn has its revenge. These Dodgers really are Dem Bums,
leading the league only in big salaries and all-star griping. Their
National League western division rivals, the San Francisco Giants,
are in first place with a smaller payroll, fewer complaints, and no
big-media godfather.
</P>
<P>
   Synergy is a team sport. Those tough, sarcastic guys on the Fox
Sports Network discuss the Dodgers in the soothing tones of an
assistant trainer, more gently than one would expect from an
enterprise owned by Murdoch, a proponent of right-wing rugged
individualism.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, when The Tribune Company acquired the Chicago Cubs,
the franchise has not enjoyed immunity from criticism in the Trib.
ESPN, owned by Disney, doesn't coddle the Disney-owned Angels,
either. The lads from Fox must play Australian-rules synergy.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Brandi Chastain, Shannon MacMillan, Michelle Aikers,
and Briana Scurry want to become professional and enter a world of
synergistic silliness? They should know that many men won't take
women's soccer seriously until a few team members act like real
pros and get arrested in a barroom brawl.

OPEN `EYES'; CELEBRIFYING; MILKEN'S TANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First there was ``The Phantom Menace,'' then ``Austin Powers,''
and now ``Eyes Wide Shut'': each a movie of the moment that
magazine covers can't get enough of. Stanley Kubrick's film doesn't
open until Friday, but already there's been a blizzard of publicity
that can hold its own in the klieg lights alongside the ``Star
Wars'' gang and Mike Myers and Heather Graham. The stars of
``Eyes,'' Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, have been seen aclutch on
the covers of this month's US and last week's Time. Nicole, solo,
adorns the current Rolling Stone and Esquire. Tom, equally solo,
stares out from the cover of the July Harper's Bazaar. Who can
resist movie stars squared? Neither celebrity, nor matrimony, gets
any better than this, PR-wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes'' has something else working for it. Besides being a
Kubrick film, only the 13th from an undisputed master of the
medium, it's the last Kubrick film. The director's death in March
meant that a big-ticket release would be a posthumous big-ticket
release, as well, a combination that has proven irresistible to
editors. Frederic Raphael, who collaborated with Kubrick on the
``Eyes'' screenplay, had a rather thin memoir of working on the
film in The New Yorker in June. Peter Bogdanovich put together a
somewhat limp Kubrick oral history for the July 4 New York Times
Magazine. Now comes Michael Herr's memoir of his friend and
sometime collaborator (Herr co-wrote the screenplay to ``Full Metal
Jacket'') in the August Vanity Fair. It's so good it almost
justifies all the other ``Eyes'' hype. In fact, Herr's piece is as
long as any four other ``Eyes'' pieces put together, but it more
than justifies its length. The man Herr writes of with such great
affection and insight was brilliant, funny (in both senses of the
word), manipulative, caring, controlling, unpredictable, and
absolutely one of a kind. ``You know, Michael,'' Herr recalls
Kubrick remarking once, ``it's not absolutely true in every case
that nobody likes a smartass.'' Not in his case, anyway, and Herr
shows us why.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick gets best-in-show for this VF. Any other issue, though,
and the prize would be going to Marjorie Williams's profile of
Patricia Duff. Duff is a dream VF subject. Surely no other person
has so effortlessly triangulated the three great American power
axes _ Washington, LA, and Manhattan _ as has Duff, she of the
to-die-for looks and ongoing to-die-from custody battle with fourth
husband Ronald Perelman. The temptation is great to go on, but
Marjorie is a friend of mine, so it would be unseemly _ not that VF
is any stranger to unseemliness _ to sing her article's praises at
greater length. Suffice it to say that this is dish of a very high
order, right down to two cameo appearances by Warren Beatty.

   The cross-pollination of fashion and celebrity on newstands
isn't slowing down any. There was a time when only models appeared
on the cover of fashion magazines, and only Hollywood types on the
cover of celebrity magazines. This month, besides the Harper's
Bazaar with Cruise (not just a Hollywood type but a male Hollywood
type, to boot _ Diana Vreeland must be turning over in her
well-appointed grave), Winona Ryder's on the cover of Marie-Claire
and Michelle Pfeiffer's on the cover of Mirabella. Conversely,
Cindy Crawford's on the cover of People (July 19). The appeal of
movie stars on fashion covers is obvious: They sell more copies and
broaden the readership. What models bring to celebrity covers is a
kind of glamour that Hollywood once monopolized but has now largely
abandoned. ``Supermodel'' is a term more commonly used nowadays
than ``superstar,'' and readers are on a first-name basis with the
likes of ``Cindy'' and ``Naomi'' and ``Christy'' (or, for that
matter, ``Christie'') as they no longer are with movie stars (does
``Tom'' signify Cruise, Hanks, or maybe even Selleck?).
</P>
<P>
   The celebrification of fashion extends even to editors. Vogue's
Anna Wintour gets the kind of coverage from the New York tabs that
Princess Diana used to (well, OK, less of it, but far more
awe-struck). And even as recently as five years ago, it's
unthinkable that a leading fashion magazine editor could have
inspired the kind of editorial tribute the late Liz Tilberis gets
in Harper's Bazaar. Tilberis, who died of cancer in April, is
praised here by everyone from Hillary Rodham Clinton to Meg Ryan.
Unfortunately, Ryan's tribute sounds like a business memo from
Queen Victoria (``We optioned Liz's memoir . . . because we were so
moved by her candor and her optimistic approach to the experiences
of her life''). Considerably more memorable is the 63-page ``White
Album'' of fashion photographs. Tilberis was known in the fashion
world as ``La Blanche,'' thanks to her striking head of
close-cropped white hair. All the fashions here _ not just dresses
but also a mouse, a Borzoi wearing a Christian Lacroix collar, and
even a White House cornice _ are white, too, and nearly all of the
photos are spectacular. At once stylish and moving, it's a reminder
of an even older cross-fertilization in magazines, that between
fashion and art.

   Remember the '80s? Michael Milken hopes you don't. Now that his
insider-trading days are behind him, the junk-bond king is busy
devoting some small portion of his master-of-the-universe millions
to restoring his reputation. The Milken Institute (no, they don't
teach dairy farming there) is one beneficiary of those efforts.
It's an economic think tank that lately has taken to publishing The
Milken Institute Review. ``We are going to make the hard stuff
readable _ and maybe even fun,'' editor Peter Passell writes in the
spring issue. Surely, this is the first quarterly to run a
crossword puzzle _ or, for that matter, to have Milken moderating a
roundtable with four Nobel laureates in economics. The former,
oddly enough, is the more stimulating.

   The Paris Review (Spring) celebrates its 45th anniversary with,
what else, various literary memoirs of Paris, especially Paris in
the '50s. In addition, all three Writers at Work interviewees _
Peter Matthiessen, William Styron, and, best of all, Ned Rorem _
have strong connections to the city. There's other stuff, too.
Robert Phillips, for example, has a very amusing poem (if you're a
middle-aged or older male) called ``In Praise of My Prostate.''
``Everywhere men are chanting,'' he writes, ``saying a mantra for
you, the Grand Gland.'' But things Parisian predominate, as in the
anecdote from George Plimpton, the magazine's editor, about his
friend Max. Max was an American ``who hated the French and took it
out on them in extraordinary ways.'' He liked to go to cafes and
order ``un Coca-Cola chaud.'' Plimpton, shocked by the sight of
glasses of Coke brought steaming from espresso machines, finally
got up the nerve to ask if Max actually liked his Coke hot.``No,''
he replied, ``but my great hope is that if I say this in enough
restaurants and cafes, the French, who copy anything American, will
begin drinking ``Coca-Cola chauds!'' Perhaps Max went to a lot of
Jerry Lewis movies back then, too?

TOWN FEELS CONNECTION TO LOCAL PHONE COMPANY

<P>
   RICHMOND, Mass. _ It's been Ethel Hanson's telephone company
since the Roosevelt administration, when the phone was
hand-cranked, hooked up to a party line, and controlled by a
switchboard operator named Dolly, who knew everybody's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody keeps calling to ask me to sign up with a new phone
company,'' said Hanson, 81. ``But I keep telling them I'm satisfied
with my own company right here. Why would I want to switch now?''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson's allegiance is with the 96-year-old Richmond Telephone
Co., which has been making connections in this former mining town
of 1,700 on the New York border since the turn of the century _ one
of the few small operations that Ma Bell never bothered to swallow
up.
</P>
<P>
   As the old Bell Telephone system splintered, morphing into
today's faceless billion-dollar telephone systems with slick
advertising campaigns, complex access codes, and indecipherable
billing options, Richmond has been dial-tone steady on its familiar
698 exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Its phone book is 11 pages from A to Z. Its basic monthly rate
is $12.50. And its repairman is a guy named Maurice who prides
himself on nearly instant action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the customers,'' said Maurice Garofoli, Richmond's
outside plant supervisor, one of the phone company's seven
employees. ``You know who you can joke with, and who you can't.
These people are my neighbors. If somebody calls me at 11:30 and
asks for caller ID, I can have it in by 1. Our response is usually
an hour or less as opposed to `by 5 o'clock tomorrow' that you get
with the larger companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond Telephone Co., one of only three independent telephone
companies in Massachusetts, is a rare outpost from the Bell
Atlantic system, which barely knows it exists and has no plans to
gobble it up.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just fine at the little telephone company, which
looks more like a cottage on Route 41 and was organized by 22 local
citizens who paid $70 each for their share of stock in 1903 and set
up the first switchboard at the railroad station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richmond had no village street with houses close enough for
over-the-fence gossiping,'' a local history notes. ``Farm women,
especially, were isolated for days on end. If they now indulged in
lengthy chatting or even in `listening in' now and then, who could
blame them?''
</P>
<P>
   The town, whose now-abandoned mines supplied metal plating for
the Monitor, the fabled Civil War ironclad, still has no village
center. But its tiny telephone company, like scores of similar
firms largely established in the first third of the century by
rural Midwestern farmers, has endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T was not interested in the rural areas,'' explained
Lorinda Ackley-Mazur, the company president, saying the local
telephone company was never seriously wooed by the mega-telephone
company that strung lines across America and was almost solely
responsible for local telephone service for 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ackley-Mazur's father bought the company in 1961 and invested
$165,000 to help inaugurate its first dial service in 1964. ``What
we offer here is faster customer service. If someone's phone is
out, Maurice is right there. We live in the town. They can call me
at my house. They call Maurice. They can't do that with other
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ivan Seidenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of
the $31.5 billion Bell Atlantic system, fields few phone calls like
some that come through Ackley-Mazur's line at her $1 million
company where complaints about busy signals or dead lines get top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the information age,'' said Ackley-Mazur, whose
company now uses digital switches and fiber-optic cable and has
shipped its old magneto switchboards to a Springfield science
museum. ``We like our homespun image, but we also want people to
know that we can compete in a competitive market. We're really not
this rinky-dink company. We're small. But watch out.''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond Telephone customers say that if there is a singular
advantage to being served by a company housed in a two-story
white-clapboard building, it's that with a firm this small there's
no customer service run-around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone line is critical to my work,'' said Joseph Peppe, a
regional vice president for a firm that trims trees near utility
poles and responds to severe weather-related outages. ``Their
service is refreshing. I recently needed a third line installed and
I've worked with other services where that would have taken almost
an act of God to get accomplished. But not here. I know their names
and they know mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Sutherland, who works for a California-based book
distributor and moved here two months ago, said she got three phone
lines and a dedicated computer line hooked up more smoothly than
she would have expected in a big city. ``It's nice knowing
everybody you're dealing with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a major complaint about the company, it is that calls
outside its 5-square-mile service area, with the exception of those
to Pittsfield, are toll calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really the only drawback,'' said Pam Manzolini, who was
born and raised here. ``But it's only pennies. The rates are good
and the service is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackley-Mazur said her company, which already is providing
Internet service to some residents, is looking to capitalize on a
market pried open by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which set
the ground rules for competition against the former local phone
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go anywhere we want,'' the company president said. ``We
can grow in the US. We can grow globally. We can expand. I think
what I would really like to see is to go back to the image and the
great service and the low rates that we have had here in Richmond.
And to continue that image into the growth markets that we're
looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   If those visions bear fruit, it will happen in addition to the
little telephone company with 1,168 customers _ not at the expense
of it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a joy to work for a smaller company,'' said
Christine Blass, the company's customer service representative.
``It just slows things down a bit. It feels nice to be able to take
time with the customers, to talk to them and offer them what you
think they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not just numbers in a book.''

vessel. For the bathroom, you can choose a futuristic toilet with a
remote-controlled bidet spray, a seat warmer and a powerful,
low-flow flushing system.
</P>
<P>
   By early 2000, you may never have to mow your lawn again; a
robotic mower will do it for you.
</P>
<P>
   You could be using some of these high-tech gadgets around the
home right now, but many remain in the prototype stage, awaiting
manufacturers willing to bring them to market. The creators of some
appliances are trying to gauge consumer interest; others are
attempting to form partnerships that will bring down the retail
prices. Still others are reluctant to sell sophisticated products
until they have trained enough people to repair them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Batmobile Mower &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The AutoMower by the Swedish company Husqvarna Forest &AMP; Garden
Co. is available in some parts of Europe and will be introduced in
the United States in early 2000. It is priced between $1,500 and
$1,800.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks a little like a Batmobile with fins on the side _
futuristic and very cool,'' says Sherri Oosterhouse, U.S.
spokesperson for Husqvarna.
</P>
<P>
   While you catch an extra hour of sleep on Saturday morning, the
AutoMower meanders around your lawn, cutting the grass within an
invisible fence that operates like an electronic dog fence. When
the mower lightly touches anything larger than a stone, it stops,
backs up and finds a new route.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Robot Vacuum &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Eureka Co. has developed a robotic vacuum cleaner that cleans
low-pile carpets, hard-surface floors and even baseboards _ all by
itself. The battery-operated Robot Vac, which will be priced under
$1,000, has a microprocessor ``brain'' and sonar ``eyes.'' It
measures 15 inches in diameter and is 6 inches high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really cute,'' says Kathy Luedke, director of public
relations for Eureka in Bloomington, Ill. ``First, it makes little
R2-D2 sounds (like the ``Star Wars'' robot). You set it on the
floor, and it heads for a wall and works its way around the room,
then goes in a random pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find yourself trying to guess where it's going to go next.
It takes on human features. You find yourself talking to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the AutoMower, the Robot Vac stops and changes courses when
it senses obstacles. Of course, it can't move furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The Robot Vac's release date has not yet  &LR; been set. Eureka is
taking the prototype on a full-year road tour to gauge interest.
</P>
<P>
   Six months into the tour, Luedke says, ``People have been
delighted with it. Single guys think it would be a great idea. Some
of them ask if we can modify it so it can bring a beer from the
refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kitchen Prototypes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A talking apron and a calorie-counting scale are just two of
dozens of products that Philips Design of the Netherlands has
developed as part of its Culinary Art project.
</P>
<P>
   The company displayed prototypes of the futuristic products in
February at a trade show in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there's a wooden breakfast tray that uses magnets
to keep cups and plates from sliding around. The magnetic contacts
also provide power to the dishes, keeping coffee and croissants
warm, and orange juice cool. A screen on the tray allows you to
read newspapers or check e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Philips also has designed:
</P>
<P>
   _ A glass teakettle that lets you see when the water inside
boils.
</P>
<P>
   _ A glass toaster that shows toast browning. When the it senses
the toast may be burning, it turns itself off.
</P>
<P>
   _ A micro-climate container that keeps food warm _ and in
perfect condition _ on the table.
</P>
<P>
   _ An intelligent apron that allows hands-free operation of
kitchen appliances. It is voice-activated, so you can tell it to
turn down a hot plate, call up a recipe on a computer screen or
summon the family to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   _ A two-way communicator that you set on the dinner table so you
can talk with your guests while you're in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   _ A portable stove that can be used for cordless cooking at the
table.
</P>
<P>
   _ A food analyzer that weighs food and also tells how many
calories, carbohydrates and vitamins it contains.
</P>
<P>
   _ A wine conditioner container that reads a bar code on a wine
bottle to maintain the wine at the perfect storage temperature.
After the wine is poured, ``smart'' wine glasses keep the wine at
the ideal drinking temperature.
</P>
<P>
   _ A health monitor that flashes a red light when it detects
allergens in food. The wand comes in a carrying case so you can
take it to restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Which of these products will make it to the marketplace? That
will be up to companies willing to produce them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only confirm that the technology is now available for
the realization of the proposed concepts,'' explains Laura Traldi
of Philips Design in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Microwave Bank &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Most people like their microwave ovens. Now, NCR's Knowledge Lab
in London has added features that could make the ovens the center
of kitchen activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Microwave Bank not only cooks food, but it also provides
bank balances, pays bills, creates shopping lists and helps you
stay on a diet. It can be activated by a touch screen or voice
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Its bar-code reader helps keep track of items that need to be
replaced. Swipe an empty container across the reader, and it places
the item on a shopping list. If the Microwave Bank notices a change
in your shopping preferences _ say, a switch from regular to nonfat
yogurt _ it may suggest that you try skimmed milk, too. And when
your vacation's coming, the Microwave Bank may ask if you need to
buy sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   The Microwave Bank will not be available for sale until NCR
works out agreements with banking and grocery firms.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Far-Out Fridge &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ScreenFridge is a smart refrigerator with technology by ICL, a
British technology firm that developed the prototype in partnership
with Frigidaire, headquartered in Martinez, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The high-tech refrigerator has many features of the Microwave
Bank: a touch screen and a bar-code scanner that let consumers pay
bills and create shopping lists. It also lets you watch TV and send
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the appliance and the date it will go on the market
have not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sinking Feeling &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A new sink-stove and a fast-cooking oven are two more options
for the high-tech kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler Co.'s Pro CookCenter, which will available next month &LR; 
August &LR; , pairs a regular kitchen sink with a small basin containing
a nine-quart cooking vessel. You can wash your dishes on one side
and cook pasta on the other.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric's Advantium Oven uses ``Speedcook'' technology
to cook food four times faster than a conventional oven. For
example, the oven cooks a 4-pound chicken in 20 minutes and a large
pan of lasagna in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The oven, which cooks with halogen light rather than radiant
heat, ``cooks more evenly and more thoroughly,'' Reilly says.
</P>
<P>
   If you're remodeling or building a new home, you can order the
oven now through your builder. It will be available January 1 in
retail stores. The estimated retail price is $1,300 to $1,400.
</P>
<P>
   And if you put off your construction project for a year or two,
who knows? Perhaps the house will build itself.

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; New in the U.S.: A Toilet With Flair &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Terry Nagel &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Compared to Japan, the United States is in the
Dark Ages in bathroom technology. Visitors to Japan marvel at
remote-controlled toilets that wash and dry the user, cover up
noises with the sound of rushing water, eliminate odors and conduct
a urinalysis. Stories abound of foreigners who push the wrong
button and emerge dripping from Tokyo bathroom stalls.
</P>
<P>
   Americans aren't privy to toilets with all those functions, but
high-tech options exist. For example, Toto Ltd. of Japan has
introduced Zoe, an ergonomic toilet seat, to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The $599 seat has a bidet jet spray for cleansing that's
operated by remote control and an odor-absorbing fan activated by
sitting on the seat. A seat warmer costs $100 more. The seat fits
most American two-piece and many one-piece toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Toto plans to upgrade the Zoe seat to fit more
American toilets and offer additional features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has a very, very advanced toilet culture,'' says Newbold
Warden, marketing communication manager of Toto USA. He explains
that many Japanese are hooked on being washed during every bathroom
trip.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of TECHHOME (84551 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  In a recent survey, Toto found that 27 percent of Japanese
households are equipped with washlets _ toilets with cleansing
sprayers.
</P>
<P>
   A portable washlet is also quite popular. ``It's like a
Walkman,'' Warden says. ``You take it with you.'' The portable
unit, which has a nozzle, spray unit and pump, is available in the
U.S. for $199.
</P>
<P>
   Toto's Japanese catalog of bathroom products is 900 pages thick.
In its research laboratories, the company also has developed
antibacterial roof tiles and siding for homes, and an antistaining
coating that can be applied inside toilet bowls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; The Kitchen of the Future &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
When Martha Stewart visited the Media Laboratory at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a laser machine etched her
picture onto an eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   This was a whimsical demonstration of a technology that can also
print cooking instructions on food and cut a bagel straight enough
to satisfy an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   The laser is just one project from the Media Lab's
CounterIntelligence group, which is working to bring technology to
the kitchen of the future. The project is ``not supposed to take
out the creativity. It's supposed to automate some of the mundane
things,'' spokesperson Alexandra Kahn says.
</P>
<P>
   Among the group's other developments and plans:
</P>
<P>
   _Mr. Java, an espresso machine that reads a bar code on your
coffee cup to dispense a latte mixed exactly the way you like it _
while playing music of your choice. Eventually, it will be linked
to a computer that could display stock quotes or your preferred
online newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   _A talking oven mitt that gauges the temperature of pans you
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   _A counter that measures ingredients for recipes.
</P>
<P>
   _A ``sniffer,'' adapted from a device used for finding illegal
drugs, that can tell whether food needs spice or has gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers envision a kitchen that will be part of a totally
wired home.
</P>
<P>
   When you put away your groceries, the cupboards and refrigerator
will know they are there; when you use two cups of flour, the
central inventory system will deduct them from the total amount of
flour on hand; when you throw out an empty can of peaches, the
computer will put them on a shopping list _ and perhaps call a
store to order them.
</P>
<P>
   Your intelligent counter will have a built-in scale. When you
put a mixing bowl on it, the computer will tell you the order in
which to add flour, sugar and other ingredients. You won't need
measuring cups; as you pour each ingredient in the bowl, the scale
will tell you when you have added enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you take the bowl over to the mixer, which is also linked
to the computer, and it knows what mixer setting to use and how
long to mix it,'' says spokesperson Jeff Seidman. ``When you put
the brownies in the oven, the oven knows the right temperature
setting and how long to cook them.''
</P>
<P>
   The result: perfect brownies barely touched by a human hand.
</P>
<P>
   When will this futuristic kitchen be available? Not tomorrow,
although the technology is available today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like so many of the basics in life (food, health care,
education), most of the world _ most of the U.S. _ gets by with
1930s-era systems,'' says Michael Hawley, associate professor at
the Media Lab.

 Editors note: Psst! Read the latest? If not, you haven't
read  HotStuff, the San Francisco Chronicle's weekly roundup of
great 
 new home-and-garden items and places to visit.   HIGH IMPACT: Home Office Furniture Sports a European Look  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  If you want to set up a high-style home office
that will take you into the next millennium, stop by  Contemporary 
 Technologies Inc.  in the San Francisco Design Center, where you'll
find furnishings with European flair.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Owner Sergey Kholevinski imports chairs, desks and modular
systems from 19 manufacturers in Spain, France, Belgium, Sweden,
Finland, Germany and Denmark _ all with an edgy style that is hard
to find in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The selection includes a ``Flying Object'' desk from France,
pictured, which looks like it could fly into outer space. Made of
artificial gray granite and black leather, it costs $16,800. It is
shown with a matching pedestal compartment, $7,300, and the
``Squara'' chair, $4,100.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary Technologies also sells lamps designed by Dali,
pure wool rugs with three-dimensional patterns and a chair with a
heart-shaped back designed by Gaudi.
</P>
<P>
   Kholevinski, a native of St. Petersburg, Russia, first came to
California as part of a nonprofit program designed to support new
businesses in his native country. He spent a month here in 1993
learning about office furnishings and vowed to return one day.
</P>
<P>
   After running a contemporary furniture store in his homeland, he
came back to San Francisco and opened Contemporary Technologies
last November. ``Now I see my dream come true,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Contemporary Technologies Inc. is open from 9 a.m. to 5 &LR;   &LR; p.m.
Monday through Friday at the San Francisco Design Center, &LR;

 &UR; GROOVY, MAN: Retro Book Celebrates '60s Designs &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  With the Austin Powers movie going wild at the box
office and the '60s retro movement so strong (yes, get out your
rake _ shag carpeting is back), now's the perfect time to think
back with a new book by Cara Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Op to Pop: Furniture of the 1960s''  &LR; will bring it  &LR; all &LR; 
back, whether you liked it or not. It's here in hundreds of
photographs, from the bright red love seat shaped like Marilyn
Monroe's lips to space-age Plexiglas armchairs that look so
incredibly uncomfortable, it's a wonder anyone would buy one.
</P>
<P>
   But buy we did _ plus a lot more. For most of the '60s, the
nation was in an uproar. And, as author Greenberg points out in her
introduction, ``even if you stayed home and listened to Jefferson
Airplane, there was still a palpable sense of making history.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who grew up in the '60s, this book is a wonderful read
and will bring back memories. Remember watching a space launch from
the comfort of your bean bag chair?
</P>
<P>
   For the younger generation, this retro book will show you just
what you missed, and, baby, you missed &LR;  a lot &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Op to Pop: Furniture of the 1960s'' (Little, Brown &AMP; Co.) &LR; 
 &LR; is available at most bookstores; suggested retail price is $40. &LR; 
 &LR; You can also buy it online at www.amazon.com ($32), &LR;

 &UR; WRIGHT REVISITED: Fabric Collection Honors Architectural Giant &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Frank Lloyd Wright's passions were almost as grand
as his buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century architectural icon loved Japanese art in a big
way, collecting wood-block prints, sculpture, textiles, screens,
decorative paper and more.
</P>
<P>
   He particularly admired the natural patterns found in
 &LR; katagami &LR; , the paper stencils used to make printed fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   This year, four decades after Wright's death, those
nature-inspired patterns are resurfacing in a new line of fabrics,
wallpapers and a carpet. Schumacher's  &UR; ``1999 Frank Lloyd &LR; 
 &UR; Wright Collection'' &LR;  draws on themes from the architect's personal
collection of Japanese art, as well as some of his stained-glass
interiors.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 fabric and 15 wallpaper designs in the line reflect a
natural palette, from taupe to mossy green to charcoal brown. The
fabric patterns pictured here, from left, are a prairie foliage in
a stylized geometric motif; a waterfall stripe; and an
interpretation of one of Wright's windows. Fabric and wallpaper
prices range from $40 to $80 a yard; a custom 6-by-9-foot carpet
costs $4,300.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Schumacher's ``1999 Frank Lloyd Wright Collection'' is &LR; 
 &LR; available through interior designers. For more information, &LR;   &LR; call

LAWYERS BRINGING BAD MANNERS TO THE BAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it incivility, unprofessional conduct or just plain
rudeness. From courthouse fistfights to abusive phone calls laced
with obscenities, the veneer of decorum that once draped the legal
profession is cracking.
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers still gallantly refer to their compatriots of the
bar as brothers and sisters _ and only the most rebellious or
reckless are ill-mannered when addressing the judge _ bad behavior
between lawyers has become so common that US Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor made a plea for civility in a speech to law
school graduates this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Bar Association says civility is the number
one issue its members want addressed. In May, the Flaschner
Judicial Institute hosted a seminar on how judges can promote
civility in their courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   And a just-released study of ethnic and gender bias in the
federal courts of Massachusetts and three New England states found
that racism and sexism aren't big problems, but ``incivility'' is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible, it's not getting better,'' said Susan Koniak, a
Boston University Law School professor who served on a Boston Bar
Association task force that developed civility standards for local
lawyers. ``Why would it? It's macho, and it's the definition of a
tough litigator these days.''
</P>
<P>
   The horror stories abound, though in an odd bit of irony, many
lawyers appear loath to bad-mouth each other on the record. But
cloaked in anonymity, they eagerly speak of the subtle jabs, like
unreturned phone calls, meetings purposely scheduled at
inconvenient times, and frivolous motions meant to delay an
opponent and drain his client's wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Boston divorce attorney Monroe Inker knows of a lawyer who was
punched in the mouth by an opposing attorney during a deposition.
Attorney Gary Owen Todd has seen lawyers throw books at one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Leonard E. Kesten is currently embroiled in flap with
Marblehead attorney Elaine Whitfield Sharp. Kesten says Whitfield
Sharp hit his hand in the courtroom; Whitfield Sharp accuses Kesten
of intimidation, sexism and invading her ``personal space.''
</P>
<P>
   And consider this exchange between Kesten and Joseph E. Mizhir
in Mizhir's Bedford law office three years ago:
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kesten: You smirked.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mizhir: I have not smirked.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kesten: Well, I wish we had a videotape of it, you would
have seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mizhir: Yes, maybe you should.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kesten: There's two or three occasions today where you had
the little grin on your face.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mizhir: That is not true. That is lie.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kesten: That's nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mizhir: That is a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kesten: That's nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mizhir: A lie.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kesten: I'm sitting here watching you.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mizhir: And I'm telling you it's a lie. You are lying, Mr.
Kesten.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kesten: And now you're getting _ what are you going to do,
jump over the table at me?
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mizhir: I will not do anything such as that. I am not here
to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kesten: You sure look like you're losing it right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incivility really is a problem in the court system, and it is
not being satisfactorily addressed,'' said federal Appeals Court
Judge Bruce M. Selya, who coordinated a study examining gender,
race and ethnic bias in First Circuit federal courts, which
includes Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   That study, released last month, found that while sexism and
racism may have diminished, ``garden variety incivility'' had taken
root in the legal profession, Selya said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of lawyers in Massachusetts has exploded in recent
years, from fewer than 25,000 in the early 1980s to nearly 42,000
today. Those burgeoning ranks create a loss of community and breed
a sense of anonymity in the legal profession, many lawyers say,
leading to an erosion of manners.
</P>
<P>
   Some attorneys believe the bad conduct is a manifestation of the
growing competitive pressures lawyers face every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many people competing against each other for client
dollars and client business that it creates more pressure to be
more competitive,'' said attorney Ronald F. Kehoe, ``and sometimes
that translates into inappropriate means of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Others attribute a decline in manners in the legal profession to
a general societal decay in gentility and courtesy, although
several attorneys said lawyers are often among the biggest
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a profession where we're paid to fight,'' said Joseph
F. Savage Jr., a former federal prosecutor now in private practice,
``but some people take the ordinary stress and strain of being a
combatant to a systematic level of tactical rudeness.''
</P>
<P>
   And rudeness costs. Incivility, many lawyers say, ratchets up
the time and cost of litigation, causing legal proceedings to
become increasingly expensive and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past decade, more than 125 civility codes have been
adopted by bar associations nationwide, according to the American
Bar Association. And across the country, many lawyers are joining
so-called ``inns of court,'' modeled after English establishments
where lawyers eat and fraternize in an effort to promote
collegiality in the profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once lawyers have been out there for a while they realize that
the rudeness and abruptness is a lot of wasted energy and a lot of
wasted time,'' said Paul V. Kelly, a former federal prosecutor now
in private practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, at the end of the day, all those exchanges do is
put everybody in a bad mood.''

CELEBRATE BASTILLE DAY WITH THE CUISINE OF GRANDMERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Parisians carry cell phones and hardly cook anymore. Like us,
they're harried and eat dinner out or bring takeout home. But when
they do cook, when several generations of a family gather around
the table, the menu is strictly grandmere, as if nothing in the
country had changed for decades. And what a relief to find lamb,
potatoes, salad, and profiteroles in a happy array on the
celebration table. To honor Bastille Day (July 14) French and
Francophiles alike rise to the occasion, slip on an apron, hum ``La
Marseillaise,'' and do their grandmeres proud.
</P>

 &QL; 
FRISEE SALAD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frisee is curly endive, a mildly bitter green with dark outside
leaves and pale yellow inside leaves. Salads made with frisee are
often tossed with a poached egg and bacon, a rich combination. Or
you can substitute another green, such as bibb or Boston lettuce
mixed with a little mesclun. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 thick strips slab bacon, cut into dice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 head frisee, rinsed and dried &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a dry skillet over medium heat, render the bacon until it is
crisp and golden brown. Transfer the bacon to a double thickness of
paper towels and set it aside to cool slightly.
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, whisk together the vinegar, mustard, salt, and
pepper. Gradually whisk in the oil, 1 tablespoon at a time, until
the dressing emulsifies. Taste it for seasoning _ it should be
quite vinegary. Add more salt or vinegar, if you like.
</P>
<P>
   Tear the frisee into pieces and transfer them to a bowl. Drizzle
them with a couple of spoonfuls of the dressing and toss the
frisee. Add more dressing, a little at a time, until the leaves are
coated all over but not soaked. Sprinkle the greens with the bacon,
add more black pepper to taste, and serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6. &QL;

ROAST TOMATOES PROVENCAL &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6 medium tomatoes, cored and halved horizontally
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Small handful of fresh rosemary leaves, fresh thyme leaves, and
fresh parsley, finely chopped &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Set the oven at 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the tomatoes, cut sides up, in a baking dish large
enough to hold them in one layer (or use 2 dishes).
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle the tomatoes with the oil and scatter the garlic on
top. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and the herb mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Roast the tomatoes for 30 minutes or until they are very soft
but still hold their shape. Serve at once.

</P>
<P>
   Butter, for dish
</P>
<P>
   2 cups whole or 2 percent milk
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 large russet potatoes (such as Idaho), peeled and left in bowl
of cold water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound imported Gruyere cheese, grated
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Set the oven at 375 degrees. Have on hand a 12-inch baking dish.
Butter it generously.
</P>
<P>
   In a large saucepan that will hold all the potatoes when sliced,
combine the milk, 2 cups of water, and a large pinch of salt.
</P>
<P>
   Using a chef's knife or a slicing machine, cut the potatoes
thinly and transfer them to the milk-water mixture. Bring to a
boil, then lower the heat and cook the potatoes for 5 minutes or
until they are no longer raw but not yet cooked through. (If the
water takes a long time to boil, be careful that the potatoes don't
overcook and break up.)
</P>
<P>
   With a slotted spoon, transfer half the potatoes to the baking
dish. (Save 1 cup of the potato cooking water.) Sprinkle with the
cheese and drizzle with the cream. Add salt and pepper. Make
another layer of potatoes. Add the potato cooking water, then the
cheese, cream, salt, and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the dish to the oven and bake for 1 hour or until the
top is golden brown and a skewer inserted into the potatoes shows
they are tender. Serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6. &QL;

GRILLED LAMB CHOPS &QL;

</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, cut into slivers
</P>
<P>
   12 lamb rib chops at least 1/2 inch thick (if they're thinner,
buy 18 chops)
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil, for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Handful of fresh rosemary, finely chopped &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Light a charcoal grill or heat the broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Insert slivers of the garlic into the rounded fatty side of the
lamb chops. Sprinkle the chops with oil, then add salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the chops over the grill or under the broiler, turning
often. Allow about 8 minutes total cooking time or cook until the
chops are very pink inside. Arrange them overlapping on a platter,
sprinkle with the rosemary, and serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6. &QL; 
 &QL;

 &QL; 
PROFITEROLES WITH ICE CREAM &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut up
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 pint vanilla or chocolate ice cream &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sift the flour into a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In a large saucepan, combine 2/3 cup of water, salt, and butter.
Bring the mixture to a boil and immediately remove it from the
heat. Work quickly. Add all the flour and stir vigorously with a
wooden spoon until the mixture forms a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Return the dough to the burner and stir it over low heat for a
few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, beat 3 of the eggs. Add the eggs to the dough a
little at a time, beating well after each addition. The dough will
turn quite shiny and your arm will have a workout. (You can do this
part with a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle _ not the whisk
or beaters.)
</P>
<P>
   Beat the 4th egg in the bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of it to the dough,
then another teaspoon if necessary. The dough should fall off the
spoon and make thick ribbons on the rest of the batter. If it is
too thin, you won't be able to form round cream puffs.
</P>
<P>
   Set the oven at 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Use 2 soupspoons to form 1-inch mounds of dough on the parchment
paper, leaving a couple of inches between each mound.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake the mounds for 20
minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees and continue
baking for 5 minutes or until the mounds have puffed and are golden
brown.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, cut the profiteroles in half horizontally.
Add some ice cream to each hollow and reshape with the tops.
Arrange 2 profiteroles on each of 6 dessert plates, drizzle with
caramel sauce (see below), and serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
CARAMEL SAUCE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cold water
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze of lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup hot water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup heavy cream &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a heavy-based saucepan, combine the sugar, 1/2 cup of cold
water, and lemon juice. Set the mixture over low heat and cook,
stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the sugar
dissolves.
</P>
<P>
   Turn up the heat and let the syrup bubble steadily, without
stirring, until it turns a rich, dark color. You'll smell the
caramel near the end of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Cover your hand with an oven mitt. Remove the pan from the heat
(take care that you set it down on a heatproof surface, since the
pan and the caramel are both very hot). Avert your eyes and pour in
the 1/2 cup of hot water. Let the mixture sizzle, then return the
pan to low heat and stir with a wooden spoon to dissolve the
caramel.
</P>
<P>
   Add the cream and continue stirring over low heat until it mixes
into the caramel and forms a sauce. Transfer the sauce to a bowl
for drizzling.

INTERNET DICTATES A NEW WORLD OF RETAILING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Angela Fertig purchased a golf bag recently, she didn't
just find a bargain _ she helped create one, for herself and other
shoppers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Where did she buy it? At Mercata, a new Internet shopping site.
Simply by agreeing to buy the bag for $59, Fertig knocked down the
price. ``Because of our buy, it went down two dollars,'' she says.
And when other shoppers made purchases at the new price of $57, the
bag got even cheaper, falling to $55. In the end, that's what
Fertig and every other customer paid for a bag she saw at a local
retailer for $100.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fertig and her husband, Chad, of East Haven, Conn.,
wouldn't think of making a major purchase without visiting Mercata
first. ``We check it every single day,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. Not only did she pay less than retail; she paid even
less than she'd offered to, thanks to the power of collective
buying. It's an old idea: Round up a bunch of people who promise to
buy an item and then go to the manufacturer or distributor and work
out a volume discount.
</P>
<P>
   But add the Internet, with millions of potential customers and
the ability to modify prices every second, and you've got the
makings of a dramatic transformation in retailing.
</P>
<P>
   Collective buying firms such as Mercata and Accompany Inc. of
San Francisco could be the latest on-line ventures to strike fear
into the hearts of traditional businesses. Amazon.com shocked
booksellers by selling thousands of cut-rate books and CDs over the
Net, and eBay is terrorizing the newspaper business with on-line
auctions that threaten classified advertising revenues. Neither is
an original business concept. But the Internet enabled both Amazon
and eBay to quickly acquire vast numbers of customers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Now the on-line collective buying firms hope to do the same,
slashing retail profit margins and saving consumers billions of
dollars as they look to establish themselves as the next great
Internet merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal,'' says Tom Van Horn, president of Seattle-based
Mercata Inc., ``is to essentially be a multibillion dollar retailer
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get better buying power when you aggregate,'' he says.
``The Internet is the best way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe for consumers, but not necessarily for manufacturers and
traditional retailers. Jack Staff, chief economist of Zona Research
Inc. in Redwood City, Calif., says if Internet collective buying
services catch on, some rival businesses won't survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great thing for consumers, but it's a situation that
puts even more downward pressure on prices,'' Staff says. ``The
Internet is already a low- to zero-margin game. . . eventually,
when those margins become so slim that we start having companies go
out of business, then we may have problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Firms such as Mercata are practicing a bold variation on the
concept of ``buyers clubs'' made popular by BJ's Wholesale, Costco,
and Wal-Mart's Sam's Warehouse Clubs, which buy products in bulk
and sell them at a discount to club members.
</P>
<P>
   But adding the Internet introduces a new level of power and
flexibility to the concept. While traditional buyers clubs offer
lower prices, those prices are still firmly fixed. Even if Sam's
Club wanted to lower prices from minute to minute, it would be too
difficult and costly to do so in a real-world store.
</P>
<P>
   But not on the Internet. Accompany and Mercata sell items
ranging from home appliances to sporting goods, charging below
standard list prices. Mercata deals directly with about 100
manufacturers of housewares, electronics, and sporting goods.
Accompany, on the other hand, mainly deals with existing Internet
retailers, such as golf-supply site chipshot.com.
</P>
<P>
   The collective buying site works out a deal with the supplier
for each item shown on the site. The supplier will vary the
per-unit price of each item based on the total number sold. So, if
Accompany can deliver just five customers for a product, it might
cost $50. But if 10 buyers sign up, the price could fall to $40.
Products are posted on the site for a certain number of days; a
clock counts down the time left to place a bid.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata doesn't reveal details of its volume-discount system on
its site, www.mercata.com. But at www.accompany.com, the
information is displayed next to each item. The visitor sees how
many items have been sold, and how many more must be sold to
generate another discount. This gives visitors an incentive to
contact friends and relatives, urging them to buy and keep the
price cuts coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are basically our best salespeople,'' says Jim Rose,
co-founder of Accompany.
</P>
<P>
   In that same spirit, both sites feature a point-and-click e-mail
feature that makes it easy to contact a friend and tell him about a
particularly juicy bargain _ one that only gets juicier if the
friend also buys.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of relationship marketing has worked before, most
notably for MCI Telecommunications Inc. and its wildly successful
Friends and Family program. People who referred relatives and
friends to sign up for MCI long-distance phone service got
discounts on their calls to these people. MCI gained millions of
customers this way. Accompany and Mercata hope to duplicate that
feat.
</P>
<P>
   As with an eBay auction, a customer at a collective buying site
can lock in the price he or she is willing to pay. At both Mercata
and Accompany, all bids are final. The customer must buy the item
at the final price, since placing a bid automatically authorizes
use of his credit card. At Mercata, the customer may bid, say, $5
below the current price. If the price falls to that level, the
customer must buy the item; if the price doesn't fall far enough,
the bid is discarded. At Accompany, a customer can simply ask for
an e-mail notification when the price falls to a certain point. The
notification doesn't obligate the customer to buy at that price;
he's just offered the chance to get in on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   To buyers such as Angela Fertig, it's a great chance to save
money. Meanwhile, for sellers, it's a low-cost way to emulate the
direct-marketing approach of successful companies such as Dell
Computer Corp., which bypasses the costly retail distribution
channel and sells directly to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every manufacturer out there wants to be like Mike,'' says
Mercata's Van Horn. ``Not Michael Jordan _ Michael Dell.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the manufacturer sells its product at a sharply lower
price, says Van Horn, he can still make out better than he would by
selling at retail.
</P>
<P>
   Accompany sees another benefit to the collective buying system.
Accompany shares customer data with suppliers. As a result, the
suppliers build up a database of buyers, their names and addresses,
needs and desires. It's the basis for establishing a long-term
relationship that can lead to more sales down the road. Firms spend
millions of dollars to acquire customers by dribs and drabs;
Accompany plans to deliver new customers by the hundred every day.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the plan. Accompany and Mercata are only just
getting started. They haven't yet launched their all-out marketing
campaigns and have so far attracted only a handful of customers by
word of mouth. Angela Fertig heard of Mercata when Van Horn
appeared on Oprah Winfrey's talk show to make a donation to
Winfrey's charitable organization, the Angel Network. A third
company, DealTime.com Ltd., is also going into collective buying,
but its site is not yet open for business.
</P>
<P>
   There are challenges ahead. For instance, Mercata's business
model requires dealing directly with manufacturers who must also
satisfy the concerns of their traditional retailers. Every sale
through Mercata is money out of a retailer's pocket. Mercata has
already had trouble negotiating deals with some manufacturers who
don't want to alienate their retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Internet collective buying model lacks the instant
gratification provided by most Internet merchants. Buyers must wait
until bidding is closed before the item is shipped, and that could
add days of delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who shop on the Internet today shop because it's
convenient,'' says Seema Williams, consumer e-commerce analyst for
Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``This is not particularly
convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams acknowledges that collective buying probably will work.
But she warns that if it does, companies such as Accompany and
Mercata face one of the chief perils of Internet success _
copycats. She points out that since eBay demonstrated the validity
of on-line auctions, dozens of rival firms have sprung up. The same
will happen with collective buying. And some of the potential
copycats could be giant retailers with deep pockets who could crush
today's collective buying startups.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news, perhaps, for Accompany and Mercata _ but maybe not for
consumers, who may soon find dozens of companies cheerfully
charging them less whenever they join forces to buy more.

   ISRAEL-BARAK _ JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
visit today (Thursday) to Washington offers his eager American
hosts the prospects of an easier role in Middle East peacemaking
and, possibly, a place in history. It is just 10 days since he took
office, but the stocky ex-commando comes ready to talk about an end
to the decades of fighting between Israelis and Arabs. Like Bill
Clinton, who is facing just 18 months more in office, Barak says he
wants quick solutions to the land dispute with the Palestinians,
the 17-year-old war in Lebanon and the cold war with Syria.

   RUSSIA-JOURNAL _ MOSCOW _ Summertime in Russia, and the
temperature and paranoia are rising. Moscow is notorious for its
long, frigid winters. Perhaps there is something about the short,
intense summer that nourishes political dread and speculations of
calamity. A group of Communist lawmakers have holed up in the Duma,
daring not to take their summer holidays. They are convinced that
the rumors swirling around Moscow in recent weeks are true:
President Boris Yeltsin has a secret plan to declare himself
president for life, abolish the Communist Party and whisk Lenin out
of his tomb on Red Square and into a hole in the ground. (Holmes,

   KOSOVO-NOTES _ ATLANTA _ At least 1,500 journalists from around
the world have tried to marshal the facts about the Balkans and
present them in a way that makes sense to readers, viewers and
listeners back home. But do the stories really convey the intensity
of the times in this place with its tortured history? The complete
picture is complex, not simple; chaotic, not neat. And even in
Kosovo life is a mosaic, where mundane moments mingle with powerful
ones and laughter is mixed with tears.Here are gleanings from a
reporter's notebook. Mere pieces of a Balkan puzzle, they are
nonetheless slices of the experiences that you, too, might have
found if you had traveled among the people of Kosovo and
neighboring countries in recent weeks. (Graham, Atlanta

races, and just how hard teams like the Mets and Indians will be
looking to bolster their pitching staffs before the July 31 trading
deadline. By Murray Chass.

one of the most popular uses of the Internet has little to do with
electronic commerce or real-time stock quotes. Jokes are often the
first E-mail new Internet subscribers receive and, in time, the
most common. That's in part because they are so easy to tell.
Forget the setup and timing _ just click on the Forward button on
your e-mail program and you're a regular comedian. But as the
audience for on-line comedy expands, Internet joke-telling is
developing as an art unto itself, with its own customs, critics and

   HISPANIC-NATIVE-ART (Santa Fe, N.M.) _ Like summer lightning
across the mesas, history seems intimately close here. As Ramon
Jose Lopez, an artist, stands in the family chapel of his home, the
light filtering through windows made of rock crystal onto his
hand-adzed altarpieces, it doesn't seem that long ago when the
foothills here were marked by orchards and cornfields, rather than
condominiums, and farmers exchanged their corn and grain for his
grandfather's hand-carved images of saints, or santos. Lopez and
his family have filled their homemade chapel with their art _
santos, silver reliquaries, exquisite prayer books made from
buffalo hide, altarpieces painted with yellow ocre he gathers from
caves in the Sandia mountains. By Patricia Leigh Brown.

HOME-GROWN BUSINESS THRIVES ON PAINS IN THE NECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Armed with a $25 sewing machine, no capital, a
wealth of chutzpah and one therapeutic, buckwheat-filled pillow,
Titania Numa strode bravely into the business world back in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Her product was a traditional Japanese pillow that had a
somewhat tubular shape in order to fit under a geisha's neck to
preserve elaborate hairstyles. Numa was living in an 18th-floor
condominium apartment in Honolulu at the time and had discovered
such a pillow at a friend's house on the Big Island.
</P>
<P>
   She subsequently discovered that the pillow, given to making
scrunchy, squooshy sounds when one lies on it, relieved her
boyfriend's chronic headaches.
</P>
<P>
   From her own observations as well as those of chiropractors who
subsequently studied the pillows, she later learned that it
relieved his headaches because it alleviated tension in his neck
muscles and realigned his spine.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed by the pillow's efficacy, her boyfriend suggested that
she go into the business of making pillows.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she didn't have packaging or a label, ``I just knew
this would work,'' said Numa, who founded Sobagara Enterprises in
Hawaii and eventually moved the company to Healdsburg, Calif. The
name comes from the Japanese words for buckwheat (soba) and hulls
(gara).
</P>
<P>
   To get things going, she took the neck pillow to Shirokiya, a
department store in Honolulu's popular Ala Moana Shopping Center.
</P>
<P>
   As she showed it to a buyer, a customer spotted the pillow and
wanted to buy it, or at least order several.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buyer thought I put her up to it'' and told her to come
back when she had proper samples with labels and packaging, Numa
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Hawaiian physical therapists used the neck pillows,
Numa decided to market her pillow to Oahu's chiropractors, who
persuaded her to refine the traditional design to better fit the
cervical curve of the neck. In turn, she persuaded the doctors to
pony up 50 percent down for their orders.
</P>
<P>
   Although her condominium association banned home businesses,
Numa ordered more than a dozen 28-pound bags of buckwheat hulls
from a mill in upstate New York that offered her 30 days to pay.
</P>
<P>
   After the delivery man had smuggled the bags upstairs to her
apartment, Numa sat on her floor in a little cloud of buckwheat
dust.
</P>
<P>
   Cupful, by cupful, by cupful, she hand-filled the pillow sacks
she'd sewn on her single-needle machine.
</P>
<P>
   Shirokiya ordered 50 pillows, sold them and bought more.
</P>
<P>
   Healing professionals bought them. Honolulu's Asia-oriented
consumers bought them. Tourists bought them.
</P>
<P>
   They sold like the proverbial hotcakes, but it took two years _
cupful, by cupful, by cupful _ before Numa could afford to hire an
outside contractor to sew the pillowcases, which were refined with
zippers, rather than tie closings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked pretty hard at the beginning,'' said Numa, who edited
the word ``therapeutic'' from her label after a run-in with the
Food and Drug Administration. Subsequently, however, she registered
the cervical pillow with the agency as a medical device.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a happy time. I didn't anticipate anything. I just
kept going and going, taking little baby steps,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Numa, who had majored in art and education at the University of
Miami, took advantage of seminars offered for start-ups by retired
executives in Honolulu, where she learned ``how to organize the
business, to put things on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   She also took accounting and computer classes, but she had no
business plan. ``I still don't, to this day. I have tremendous
grace in my life, magic that comes out of doorjambs. I don't know
how far or how much I can go, but I'm still on track,'' she said.
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS. &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By 1988, Numa's third year in business, she had moved into a
larger space outside her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Numa ramped up production and found a Canadian supplier of
organic buckwheat hulls. She expanded her line, offering larger and
smaller pillows in assorted colors and patterns of organic cotton
for different needs.
</P>
<P>
   She tapped into the aromatherapy market by adding lavender and
eucalyptus oils to a buckwheat-filled, flannel-covered, 2-foot-long
oblong that can be heated in the microwave or cooled in the freezer
before draping over and around a sore shoulder or neck.
</P>
<P>
   She introduced eye pillows filled with flax, intended to relieve
sinus congestion and headaches. There's even a buckwheat hull pet
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing it didn't make sense to ship buckwheat to Hawaii just
to ship pillows back to the mainland, she moved to the wine country
of Sonoma County in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Although the business now has 10 employees and $250,000 in
annual sales, the move didn't make life easier for the
indefatigable Numa. She faced a bruising attack by a competitor
calling itself Sobakawa that flooded the market with an imitation
of her pillow. According to Numa, that outfit went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the pillow field is vast and rife with competition.
Numa's primary competitor is PillowCompany, based in Scottsdale,
Ariz., which also specializes in organic buckwheat hull pillows
retailing for $26 to $60, according to Birgit Ressler, the
company's marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   Numa displays her line at a wide variety of trade shows, often
two a month. She estimates that 35 percent of her sales come from
trade shows such as the annual Futon and Sleep Accessories Show, 25
percent from natural products catalogs such as Real Goods and Soft
Surroundings, and the rest from repeat business.

trade shows such as the annual Futon and Sleep Accessories Show, 25
percent from natural products catalogs such as Real Goods and Soft
Surroundings, and the rest from repeat business.

   CIR-JOKES (Undated) _ As anyone with an e-mail address knows,
one of the most popular uses of the Internet has little to do with
electronic commerce or real-time stock quotes. Jokes are often the
first E-mail new Internet subscribers receive and, in time, the
most common. That's in part because they are so easy to tell.
Forget the setup and timing _ just click on the Forward button on
your e-mail program and you're a regular comedian. But as the
audience for on-line comedy expands, Internet joke-telling is
developing as an art unto itself, with its own customs, critics and
avant-garde. By Amy Harmon.

STUFFING THE ONLINE BALLOT BOX
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  &HT;     By JON SWARZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   The Internet threw Major
<TEXT>
League Baseball a curve during All-Star Game voting last week. A
Boston hacker stuffed the virtual ballot box to seemingly swing the
vote to Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who was locked in a
tight race with New York Yankee Derek Jeter.
<P>
   But Chris Nandor's attempt to pull off a Chicago-style election
result with 25,000 online tallies struck out after MLB officials
detected irregularities and voided the votes.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that MLB's director of new media can't guarantee
someone won't eventually succeed in logging enough virtual votes to
nominate journeyman Paul Sorrento as a starter to the midsummer
classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people can crack a government computer, they can crack a
computer that keeps track of ballots,'' Alex Kam said. ``Computers
aren't impenetrable.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they insignificant in the digital age. The grand old
game of baseball is increasingly more dependent on cyber votes to
select All-Star players. About 13 percent of the more than 3
million votes for tomorrow night's 70th All-Star Game in Boston
were cast over the Internet, up from about 8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kam said MBL can only put ``reasonable limitations'' on
restricting the number of votes per online voter to 22. Like the
more traditional paper-balloting process conducted in baseball's 30
stadiums, MLB executives attempt to detect unusual voting patterns
_ such as the exact same votes coming from the same Internet
address _ over a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   It was that detective work that fingered Nandor, whose burst of
last-minute votes for Red Sox players caught the attention of Kam
and others. Nandor and other would-be manipulators will have to
take solace from the age-old baseball refrain, ``Wait till next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nandor, 25, of Carver, Mass., did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   THE EBAY OF IDEAS
</P>
<P>
   One of Silicon Valley's hottest startups lifts its kimono this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Epinions.com (www.epinions.com), formerly known as Round-One,
will announce an online consumer guide that relies exclusively on
the opinions of Joe Public about products ranging from sports
utility vehicles to Sony Walkmans. Epinions is banking on ad
revenues as its main source of income.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focused on helping consumers make better buying
decisions,'' said Naval Ravikant, company co-founder and chief
executive officer. ``And we believe there are plenty of experts out
there who are passionate about specific subject matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain View, Calif., company _ stocked with hotshot
employees from America Online, Yahoo, AtHome, Apple Computer,
Netscape Communications and Hot Wired _ has raised the interest and
eyebrows of venture capitalists. Benchmark Capital and August
Capital just funneled $8 million into the 30-person company.
</P>
<P>
   MORE NET-ESCAPEES
</P>
<P>
   A team of 10 key engineers from Netscape also is working on a
secret startup. Last week, the first details of Geocast Network
Systems (www.geocast.com) began to surface.
</P>
<P>
   The Menlo Park, Calif., company is developing hardware and
software that would deliver full-screen video and CD-quality sound
to personal computers, according to Jon Mittelhauser, manager of
software products at Geocast.
</P>
<P>
   Geocast is expected to unveil its products next year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry buzz over Geocast is so high-pitched that VC rivals
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers and the Mayfield Fund have each
invested in the 50-person startup. (The company's chief operating
officer, Alan Nichols Jr., previously was an executive vice
president of The Chronicle Publishing Co.)
</P>
<P>
   GEEKS FOR HIRE
</P>
<P>
   Remember the ragtag group of nerdy mercenaries who anonymously
offered their services in an eBay listing in April?
</P>
<P>
   Starting at $3.14 million, the team of 16 engineers _ who called
themselves ispteam _ offered wired-for-hire expertise.
</P>
<P>
   And they got a couple of feelers from at least five companies
before bagging the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of the co-conspirators, John Kinsella, has decided to
give it another go. Only this time he isn't hiding behind a veil of
secrecy. Kinsella has opened a Web site, www.bid4geeks.com, that
auctions tech talent to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to advertise the talents of individuals or teams of
workers for startups and established companies,'' said Kinsella,
25, a former Unix systems engineer at Digex, an Internet service
provider in Cupertino, Calif. ``With such incredible demand for
tech talent, we think this is the ultimate in online classified ads
for nerds.''
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   The snazzy new iMac laptop we first reported on in December
could emerge next week at the Macworld Expo computer show in New
York. The $2,000 translucent portable is considered crucial to
extending the company's recent run of success, and fills out
Apple's PC line.
</P>
<P>
   Apple declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, E-Trade Group denied scuttlebutt that it is
relocating some facilities from its Menlo Park, Calif.,
headquarters to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, grumblings out of Mountain View, Calif., are that
America Online's payroll and commission system doesn't jibe with
Netscape's system, depriving Netscape sales representatives of
commission checks for the past four months. That's the rumor.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that an administrative switch resulted in a
two-week delay in commission checks, according to the company.
Netscape sales reps should be paid by the end of the month.
</P>

STUDY SAYS `CONCRETE CEILING' HURTS MINORITY BUSINESSWOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS entire text)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE and VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Asian-American, black and Hispanic women
managers in business face significant barriers to advancement,
including absence of strong leaders and limited access to
influential colleagues, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   The barriers are described by the authors of the study as
perhaps more daunting than the ``glass ceiling'' _ an upper limit
to professional advancement that is not openly acknowledged in
corporate boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The barriers noted in the study form the ``concrete ceiling,''
which excludes female managers from circles of power, desirable
assignments and the chance for their voices to be heard in
business, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women of Color in Corporate Management,'' part of a three-year
examination by the nonprofit Catalyst organization, found that
minority women in large numbers lack access to influential
colleagues and thus miss opportunities to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is the `concrete ceiling' reported to be more
difficult to penetrate, women of color say they cannot see through
it to glimpse the corner office,'' said Sheila Wellington,
president of the New York-based organization and a specialist on
women's advancement into private-sector leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Findings of the survey of 1,735 managers _ all minority women
and employed by 30 major U.S. companies _ show:
</P>
<P>
   _ 47 percent find barriers in not having an influential mentor
or sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   _ 40 percent cite the lack of informal networking with
influential colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   _ 29 percent note the lack of company role models who are
members of their racial or ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   _ 28 percent are frustrated by the lack of high-visibility
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Rice Oliver, the founder, president and chief executive
of Integrated Business Solutions in San Ramon, offers this advice
to those encountering obstacles: ``You make it happen. No one is
going to make it happen for you. You have to be bold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's taking calculated risks, stepping out of the box
and not being afraid to say what I believe to be true,'' said
Oliver, who is black. ``Sometimes I speak up because it comes from
my instinct, which I trust, and my life experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Boddie Lewis, who is senior vice president for housing
and economic development at Union Bank of California in San
Francisco, said having good mentors his important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you show a desire to want to learn and to
contribute, invariably you will find people who will stop viewing
you as a woman or they will stop considering you because of your
race and they see you as a person who they want to help become a
better team member,'' said Lewis, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   The Catalyst study's examination of corporate diversity programs
reveals that initiatives aimed at women and minorities are not as
effective as they could be.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five percent of those surveyed said they were aware of
training in their corporation to address race and gender issues,
but only 22 percent said their managers received adequate training
in managing a diverse work force.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three percent said they feel their companies' diversity
programs are ineffective in dealing with issues of subtle racism;
26 percent said career development is an important part of their
companies' diversity program; and only 17 percent said they believe
their managers are held accountable for advancing women of their
racial or ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   Many women, particularly black women, say stereotypes are
pervasive in their work environments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a theme underlying the barriers that women of color
face: a lack of access to influential others,'' said Wellington, a
former vice president of Yale University who heads Catalyst's
efforts in identifying barriers and opportunities for women in
business.
</P>
<P>
   The research director, Katherine Giscombe, said she found that
many diversity programs target people of color ``as if they are a
monolithic group'' and missed key distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly in the past a lot of such programs focused on white
women,'' Giscombe said. ``We felt that women of color were falling
through the cracks, that they clearly had unique needs, issues,
concerns, backgrounds that needed to be addressed,'' Giscombe said
Tuesday from New York.

DISNEY TO EXPAND ONLINE OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DAVE McNARY   c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   BURBANK, Calif. _
Walt Disney Co. got serious about the Internet, pulling the trigger
on two major deals it has been pondering for the past five weeks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The entertainment giant announced Monday a major expansion of
its Internet business by agreeing to buy the 57 percent of Web
partner Infoseek Corp. that it does not already own for an
undisclosed price estimated to be about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Disney will then spin off its Internet assets, valued at $7
billion without Infoseek, and its catalog operations into a
publicly traded tracking stock called Go.com. That could enable
Disney, which did not disclose how much the public will own, to
receive a boost from the booming market for Web stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a great move from a strategic standpoint to buy
Infoseek and separate the assets,'' said Linda Bannister, an
analyst with Edward Jones. ``It will make it easier to attract
quality people and give them a currency for making acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   By making the announcement, Disney also underscored its strong
commitment to the concept of Go.com as a general-purpose portal to
the Internet. That indicates Disney will engage in what has turned
out to be an uphill battle with America Online, Yahoo! and
Microsoft in that market.
</P>
<P>
   Disney launched its Internet operations in 1995 and stepped up
as a major player a year ago by buying 43 percent of Infoseek, the
Web's fourth largest search directory. In a news conference Monday
in New York, Disney and Infoseek chief executives fleshed out
details of the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   --Disney will own 72 percent of Go.com, which will combine the
550 employees at Buena Vista Internet Group, 850 Infoseek employees
and 800 Disney catalog employees.
</P>
<P>
   --The deals should be completed by the end of this year.
Infoseek shareholders must approve the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   --The combined businesses should generate $350 million during
the current fiscal year, through Sept. 30, and could double that in
the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   --Go.com will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol GO, replacing shares of Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   --Infoseek's chief executive officer, Harry Motro, will depart
once the deal is concluded. Jake Winebaum left as Disney's Internet
chief last month, and there was no indication of who will head
Go.com.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came when Wall Street has been punishing
Disney's share price over disappointing earnings and a sagging
outlook in several key businesses. The announcement had little
impact as shares edged up 18.75 cents to $27.8125 after touching
their 1999 low on Friday, while Infoseek shares were off $5.5625 at
$45.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have predicted, however, that the Internet assets will
increase in value, particularly given the worth of such popular
sites as Disney.com, ESPN.com, ABCNews.com, Family.com and Disney
Stores Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combining Disney's Internet assets with Infoseek takes our
online strategy to the next level,'' said Disney Chairman Michael
Eisner. ``Go.com will unlock the value and potential of our
combined Internet assets and position them to ignite the
marketplace with new products and services.''
</P>
<P>
   But Disney trackers have complained that while the
Disney-Infoseek partnership may make sense, the alliance has
operated clumsily compared to Internet rivals and not delivered a
compelling product since Disney and Infoseek launched the Go.com
portal _ a hub for entering the Internet _ in January. Some
question the basic strategy of trying to compete as a portal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is going to wind up spending a ton of money to fight a
battle that's already been lost to AOL, Yahoo! and MSN,'' said
Joseph Butt Jr., an analyst with Forrester Research. ``This is not
a way to win friends and influence people.''
</P>
<P>
   David Card, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, said Disney
should not be dismissed. ``The whole Go.com strategy has been only
modestly successful, but what they've announced is a very logical
next step,'' he noted. ``You can't write them off in terms of power
of media properties and cross-promotion. They're still a contender
with strong cards to play.''

 &HT;    Modern video games feature more graphic violence, gore
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's trouble in Raccoon City.
</P>
<P>
   A virus has turned the inhabitants into flesh-hungry zombies.
And their posture is lousy. When a crowd of these lurching
subhumans breaks into a gun store, they feast on the proprietor
like pigs around a trough, throwing up a mist of blood in the air.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Joe D'Avanzo, 26, starts pumping them full of lead.
``It takes three shots to the head,'' he says, as the zombies drop
like sandbags. ``Or about six shots to the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the rules in ``Resident Evil 2,'' one of the gorier
video games available for Sony's PlayStation console. Later in the
game D'Avanzo's on-screen persona, Leon, can acquire a shotgun,
which does the job better.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shotgun blast will take their head clean off,'' D'Avanzo
says. ``But the problem with that is you have to wait until they're
real close.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Avanzo, manager of Software Etc., is a connoisseur of the
latest in violent video games, in which players blast, cut and
bludgeon opponents, leaving piles of bodies in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   Violent games have come under scrutiny this summer because the
teen-agers responsible for the bloodbath at suburban Denver's
Columbine High School were also dedicated fans of ``Doom,'' the
granddaddy of all violent games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doom'' was one of the earliest and most successful in a genre
called the ``first-person shooter.'' These games put a weapon in
the hands of the player and show the world from his point of view,
as he charges down passageways and wipes out an endless horde of
enemies. Killers Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris turned their own
high school into a scenario right out of ``Doom,'' littering the
hallways with very real corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine High killings have prompted lawsuits against the
makers of ``Doom'' and cries for a government crackdown on violent
video games. But most parents are probably unaware that ``Doom'' is
kid stuff compared with the games that are coming out now.
</P>
<P>
   This month Xatrix, maker of such genteel entertainments as
``Redneck Rampage,'' released ``Kingpin: Life of Crime,'' a
foulmouthed killing fest that will give mothers and fathers a new
reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Kingpin,'' the player is cast as a thug who works his way
up the underworld ladder by killing and stealing. Due to its
hyper-realistic gore and R-rated language, the game is being sold
with the strongest warnings ever placed on a computer game. Both
the soundtrack, by the rap group Cypress Hill, and the dialogue
employ liberal use of profanity.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage in ``Kingpin'' is also more convincing than the
cartoonish deaths in ``Doom'' and its follow-up, ``Quake.'' You can
actually have conversation with your human opponents before you
kill them, and their body parts can be blown off, one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   A participant identified as ``Menace'' gave ``Kingpin'' high
marks in an Internet discussion group, writing: ``It's plenty of
fun. I like setting (people) on fire then pulling out the shotgun
and blowing their flaming head off while they're running around
screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Kingpin'' is going to be like catnip to the
serious gamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the most vile and reprehensible games in the
history of mankind. And, put it this way, I'm going to buy it,''
says a chuckling D'Avanzo. Retailing for $54.98, the game is
already moving briskly at his store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kingpin'' is rated ``M'' for mature audiences, which means
that Daniel Beruvides, 17, is just old enough to buy it. A neatly
dressed, bespectacled high school student, he doesn't seem like
someone who'd be prone to violent, antisocial rage. He is a rising
senior, scored a 4.0 grade-point average last year, and is
college-bound in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Beruvides enjoys violent games such as ``Resident Evil.'' He
points out that even well-adjusted kids need outlets for anger.
``Have you ever wanted to kill anybody?'' he quipped. ``Well, this
lets you do it without getting arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Other game players concur that part of the attraction of violent
games is the opportunity to harmlessly blow off steam. ``If you're
looking for someone's (rear end) to beat cause you're (angry) with
the world, you can do it with a keyboard,'' says Patrick Ogletree,
22, a prep cook at an Athens brew house who enjoys multiplayer
games of ``Doom'' on the Internet. ``Everybody should have stress
relief like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Game designers are happy to oblige. Developers in the $6.5
billion video game industry know that explicit violence can pull
players into a game, just as a bloodthirsty killing can pull
viewers into a Quentin Tarantino movie. The racks of specialty
stores such as Software Etc., and electronics superstores such as
Best Buy are stacked with 31 flavors of mayhem, suitable for play
on video game consoles or on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   There are games with absurd violence, such as ``Redneck
Rampage,'' which offers a brand-new way to utilize a chicken and a
stick of dynamite. There are games that inject sex into the story
line, such as ``Duke Nukem,'' in which combatants pursue each other
through strip bars and porno movie houses.
</P>
<P>
   There are games with creepy violence, such as ``Parasite Eve,''
in which the lead character causes victims to spontaneously burst
into flames. There are strategy games, such as ``WarCraft'' and
``StarCraft''; hunt-and-shoot games, such as the James Bond-themed
``Goldeneye 007''; parody games, such as ``Deer Avenger,'' in which
deer give hunters their comeuppance; and sword-and-sorcery games,
such as the hugely popular ``Legend of Zelda'' series. All involve
killing, to a greater or lesser degree.
</P>
<P>
   The goriest games are usually on CD-ROM, for play on personal
computers, because they're produced by independent developers who
are not answerable to large companies like Sony or Nintendo. Yet
the games created for the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo consoles
also have a fair amount of carnage; ``Doom'' and ``Quake'' were
both released in console format, and PlayStation offers ``Resident
Evil'' and Nintendo has ``Duke Nukem.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are plenty of nonviolent video games, including
sports games, flight simulators and strategy games. But why do so
many games involve killing?
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to the nature of the device and the people drawn to
it, say gamers. Many of the earliest games, including such
``Paleolithic,'' 1970s games as ``Space Invaders'' and
``Asteroids,'' required the player to manipulate a weapon to shoot
down opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't consider `Space Invaders' a violent game,
but it is just as violent a game in concept as `Doom,' `Tomb
Raider' or `Quake,''' says Theodore Beale, 30, a game designer and
a reviewer of games for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ``There's
only so many game concepts out there, and games are largely
designed by guys who like to blow things up.''
</P>
<P>
   What has changed are the graphics. New technology, including 3-D
accelerator video cards, have taken on-screen violence from the
silly, one-pixel gunshots of ``Contra'' to the grotesque,
face-ripping transformations of ``Parasite Eve.'' Games with
built-in artificial intelligence, such as ``Half-Life,'' also can
provide characters with real human unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in video games entered the cultural radar in 1993, when
the fighting game ``Mortal Kombat'' moved from coin-op arcades into
home use on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis consoles.
</P>
<P>
   Combatants in that game could dispatch a victim by tearing off
his head (with spinal column still attached), or by ripping out his
heart. Parents were aghast and politicians thundered for video-game
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a ratings system firmly in place, ``Mortal Kombat''
looks like a quaint artifact, its 2-D characters disporting against
a flat background.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, today's 3-D games place the player inside a truly
realistic environment. Details make the scenes believable. In
``Parasite Eve,'' the Dolby Surround Sound allows the player to
hear, according to one afficionado, ``the flesh ripping from the
bones.'' In ``Kingpin,'' you can see the track marks on hookers'
arms. There is even a preference in ``Kingpin'' that the player can
set to determine how long splattered blood will stick to the walls.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other technical advances in video game
production, but the graphics are the most visible _ and the most
lucrative, says Johnny Wilson, editorial director at Computer
Gaming World magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullet wounds are more visible than artificial intelligence,''
says Wilson. ``Special effects are king in terms of sales, and the
bigger, the badder, the more extravagant, the more popular they're
going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, though a gaming enthusiast, decries the violence in
``Kingpin.'' In a column for his magazine, Wilson writes that the
game's wholly unredeemed characters are the ``worst thing that
could happen to the hobby'' of computer games, and suggests that
the developers and publishers share a responsibility for the
long-term effects that such violent entertainment has on the
national psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns are already being tested in the courts. The
families of the three victims in the 1997 Paducah, Ky., school
shootings have filed suit against video game giants Sony, Nintendo
and Sega, charging that the killer Michael Carneal was influenced
by their products. One lawsuit claims that Carneal was trained by
video games to become a better shooter, citing the fact that the
Marine Corps uses ``Doom'' to beef up marksmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The current climate has caused some sweaty palms at Interplay,
publisher of ``Kingpin'' and one of the 25 defendants named in the
Paducah lawsuit. After the Colorado massacre, the company tried
vainly to recall some of its provocative magazine ads for
``Kingpin,'' which scream in a huge typeface ``You're Gonna Die!''
according to product marketing manager Alison Quirion. ``The timing
couldn't be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Quirion points out that ``Kingpin'' is intended for adults, and
that those who object don't need to buy it. But video games,
advertised in comic books and sold in toy stores that cater to
kids, can easily slip into younger hands, says James Alan Fox, a
criminal justice professor at Northeastern University, and a critic
of the games. ``You put an `M' on the box, and then you put them in
a store that panders to a 12-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no consensus that the video games, for all their
gore, really are dangerous. In fact, when analyzing 27 different
studies on video games, Purdue University Assistant Professor John
Sherry found the immediate correlation between game play and
aggression to be small.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies of college undergraduates playing ``Mortal Kombat''
were particularly intriguing, says Sherry: The students who played
longer demonstrated less aggression than those who played for only
a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry adds, however, that the data is slim, and that there are
no studies on long-term effects. ``My guess is as good as yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Game players themselves aren't concerned. ``Usually video game
people are too busy playing video games to do anything,'' jokes
Wade Lorenzen, a 26-year-old tile setter.
</P>
<P>
   The grotesque fiends in ``Quake'' ``are meant to look twisted,''
says Roxanne Hanke, a 20-year-old student at Atlanta College of
Art. ``It's the same thing that people look for in movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of violent games is misdirected energy, she says.
``Don't they think they should work on schools, instead of video
games?'' says Hanke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some adults need to get a life,'' says Beruvides. ``These
characters are fictional. They're not real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence started well before video games,'' the teen-ager
concludes philosophically. ``If you try to get rid of violence,
you'll have to get rid of man.''

 &HT;    Berry interesting: Facts, figures and fixings
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now is the time to think about berries. At the height of the
season, when the sun is hottest and the days are the longest, these
bright jewels of summer are ripe for the picking. To wade into a
berry patch replete with fruit on a hot summer day, to fill a
basket and bring home your bounty to enjoy while it is still warm
from the sun, is to partake of an ageless summer delight.
</P>
<P>
   Those little containers of berries covered with cellophane that
have crisscrossed the country before they land on your supermarket
shelf may do for the rest of the year, but to experience the
berries of summer at their juiciest and at the peak of their
delicate sweet/tart flavor, you must find those closest to home.
</P>
<P>
   How lucky you are if you still have a secret berry patch that
hasn't been replaced by a subdivision or mini-mall. Berries are
very perishable and even those picked in your back yard lose a lot
of ``berry-ness'' sitting around for just a day or two. If you lack
the luxury of your own berry patch, good sources are area farmers
markets, roadside stands or pick-your-own farms.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular berries we have in the South are blueberries,
strawberries and blackberries, and the classic way to eat them, in
a bowl with sugar and cream, of course, needs no recipe. But there
are hundreds of creative ways to use those berries, in desserts,
breads, salads, sauces, even wines. Visit the following sites for a
plethora of berry recipes, berry facts, handling and growing tips,
nutritional info and most importantly. ...
</P>
<P>
   Where to get them
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Farm Bureau has an Internet site that should be of
interest to anyone who is not only looking for fresh summer berries
but all summer produce. Dial up www.gfb.org for all things to do
with Georgia agriculture. Click ``farm mkts'' on the left, scroll
down to the map of Georgia, click on where you live and you will be
treated to a list of farmers markets and pick-your-own farms, their
products and specialties and directions to get there. This is
definitely a site you will want to bookmark when looking for fresh
summer fruit and vegetables grown close to home.

won't you be glad to know that strawberries likely were named more
than 1,000 years ago for the runners that spread (in Anglo Saxon
it's ``strew'') outward from the plant? Or that blueberries, once
called ``star berries,'' were noted by explorers Lewis and Clark,
who found that Indians in the Northwest Territory smoked wild
blueberries (in a smoker, not a pipe) to preserve them for the
winter? One of the first meals the two shared with the Indians was
venison that had wild blueberries pounded into the meat and then
was smoked and dried.

 &HT;    When life gives you lemons, make . . .
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After cutting and squeezing half a dozen or more lemons for a
batch of homemade lemonade, you want to know there's a recipe
standing by that's worthy of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   As I worked my way through many basics and blends, alcoholic
versions and non-, I found it impossible to beat Old Fashioned
Lemonade. This is one you may remember _ boil sugar, water and
lemon zest. Let the syrup cool, stir in freshly squeezed lemon
juice and refrigerate until someone shows up thirsty. Then just mix
the syrup with cold water for an ``instant'' glass.
</P>
<P>
   The best-tasting plain lemonades start with such a sugar syrup,
preferably using natural cane sugar. Blends using other fruits like
watermelon and strawberries stir up just fine without the extra
step of syrup boiling and no matter what kind of sweetener.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember, it will take some time to squeeze the lemons.
Figure about 10 minutes per cup of juice. We haven't included that
in the preparation times for these recipes, but you can squeeze off
a few minutes, and yield more juice, using one of these tips:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Roll lemons on a countertop, pressing down firmly with your
palm.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hold lemons under hot water for a minute or two.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Place lemons in a microwave and warm for 30 seconds.

   Cooking time: 5 minutes
</P>

   Use the best ingredients you can find for this unbeatable basic.
We found the taste is enriched by natural cane sugar, which also
imparts a pleasant golden color. Keep the syrup in the
refrigerator, ready to make a glass whenever you work up a thirst.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups water

</P>
<P>
   Thin slices of lemon and fresh mint sprigs for garnish
</P>
<P>
   In a small saucepan, stir together sugar, water and lemon zest.
Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil 5 minutes, stirring
often. Remove pan from heat and let syrup cool. When cool, stir in
lemon juice. Transfer to a jar; cover and refrigerate for up to 3
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to mix a glass, place 2 ice cubes in a tall glass.

   A highlight of Sunday brunch that started last month at the

lemonade is so popular in the South because the acid in the lemon
juice is a natural thirst quencher, a necessity in times of high
humidity.

   Shandy is a British idea pairing beer and lemonade _ two
beverages known for their thirst-quenching abilities. Doubly good
when the sun's shining, the proportions here were recommended last
summer in Cook's Illustrated magazine. We liked it using Frozen
Honey Lemonade (see recipe).

ale, well-chilled
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup lemonade, well-chilled

 &HT;    Nothing beats the pucker-perfect tang of lemonade
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lemonade's big secret is a balancing act between its
three essential ingredients: lemons, water and sweetener.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple, but striking the perfect spot between syrupy
sweet and startlingly tart may take a bit of hunting. One taste,
though, and you'll know: This is the one that will make you pucker
up just the right amount, and no more.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of talk to send Midge Baxley right out of a
Tallapoosa Historical Society committee meeting and back into her
own kitchen to whip up a batch of lemonade and memories of simpler
times.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers church picnics. The girls were inside cutting and
juicing lemons, stirring in sugar and water, and tasting until the
mixture filling a No. 2 zinc washtub was just right. Then the boys
helped haul the tub outside, where 15 gallons of pre-Kool-Aid
refreshment were ladled up quickly on a hot summer's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it makes me thirsty right now. Man, that was the best
lemonade,'' Baxley says.
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Mary Tolleson adds that the best lemonade is made
with sugar dissolved in boiling water. But perfection, she insists,
is unattainable unless a sprig of fresh mint is added.
</P>
<P>
   At the less nostalgic end of lemonade's spectrum of devotees are
lunchtime diners seeking more style _ lemonade enriched with
blackberries or cherries, served from silver pitchers at City Grill
in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just flat-out refreshing,'' says pastry chef Bill
Lipscomb, who creates the flavored lemonades in this landmark
restaurant where even the South's unofficial beverage of choice _
iced tea _ eats lemonade's dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did blackberry for a long time and I got tired of it. I'm
young and looked for hip flavors, so I changed,'' Lipscomb, 28,
said.
</P>
<P>
   So far he's featured peach, blackberry and cherry lemonades, and
this month he introduced strawberry. The day of its debut, Lipscomb
said he sold 10 gallons, compared to only about 3 gallons of iced
tea. On a big day, he'll mix up 20 gallons and it, too, will
disappear, either to customers or staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love it, they dig it,'' Lipscomb said of the
nonalcoholic drink.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sundays, winding-down brunchgoers at the Buckhead Diner
are taking in plenty of executive chef Thomas Lee's BHD Sunday
Lemonade, a blend of lemon juice, gin, triple sec, sweet-and-sour
mix and a splash of grenadine, poured over crushed ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lemonade is very popular in the South,'' Lee says, ``the way
it's so humid and people get so thirsty.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you've tasted a few and found that balance, you can kick
back and let lemonade work its second magic act: helping to put
your life back in balance, too.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what better excuse to plop down in a comfy chair and
put your feet up with a tall, ice-cold glass of the ultimate
thirst-quencher than as a reward for squeezing those lemons?
</P>
<P>
   TO SQUEEZE, OR NOT TO SQUEEZE?
</P>
<P>
   Still not convinced making lemonade from scratch is worth the
effort? If you don't believe us, consider these expert opinions:
</P>
<P>
   For the July-August 1998 issue of Cook's Illustrated magazine,
the staff tasted 13 products in three categories: prepared, frozen
concentrate and powdered. All, they found, were overly sweet and
lacking in lemon flavor and some were medicinal- and
chemical-tasting. Even so, Minute Maid Premium All Natural Frozen
Concentrate, ``far from perfect,'' emerged as best for having ``at
least a little pulp,'' ''good color'' and ``decent lemon
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Washington Post food staff conducted a similar
taste test and reported being ``surprised at how many fell flat or
had little lemon flavor.'' Their top pick? They, too, chose Minute
Maid, which, incidentally, celebrates its 50th anniversary this
year.

 &HT;    BARAK, CLINTON, SEEK TO REBUILD FRIENDLY TIES AND MIDEAST PEACE
PROCESS
 &HT;    1123. Moving in (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Both men dabble in music, admire slain peacemaker
Yitzhak Rabin and are in a hurry for a comprehensive peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of struggles with a hard line Israeli
government, U.S. President Bill Clinton gets to host new Prime
Israeli Minister Ehud Barak today amid the fresh air of
reconciliation and hopes of making history together.
</P>
<P>
   Barak took office just 10 days ago, but the stocky ex-commando
is ready, as was Rabin, to talk about nothing less than an end to
the decades of fighting between Israelis and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, drew his support from
Israelis opposed to peace deals with the Arabs. But, Barak trounced
Netanyahu by promising quick solutions to the land dispute with the
Palestinians, the 17-year-old war in Lebanon and the cold war with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, sees the clock ticking on the last 18 months
of his presidency. He was consistently frustrated by Netanyahu.
Though massive U.S. aid to Israel kept flowing during the last
three years, relations were so chilly that Clinton once refused to
see Netanyahu on a visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton plans two dinners and two long meetings with Barak.
If they are lacking for conversation, they can always chat about
political svengali James Carville, who they both relied on for
their electoral success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak is a pianist. Clinton is a saxophonist,'' said David
Clayman, director of the Israel office of the American Jewish
Congress. ``Even if they don't actually play together, I'm sure
they will make music together.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit is part of Barak's exploratory peace tour, which has
been true to form for the meticulous 57-year-old with the master's
degree in systems engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He has met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat and Jordanian King Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, he will be asking Clinton how much the United
States will back various Israeli bargaining positions, and Clinton
will be listening to see how much land Israel is ready to give to
make peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now busy trying to draw a road map that will take us in
the Middle East to the ultimate goal, which will be a stable and
lasting peace agreement,'' Barak spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs U.S. support to win deals from Arab neighbors that
fearful Israelis will find secure and fair. He also wants Clinton
to reduce the heavy-handed U.S. role in the peace talks, something
U.S. officials are eager to do.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton needs Barak to restore comfortable relations with
Israel. Netanyahu regularly consorted with Clinton's Republican
rivals. His anti-Arab rhetoric and tough stands embarrassed the
United States before Arab allies like Egypt and Saudi Arabia and
made the administration appear ineffective in the important Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a comprehensive peace in the region began to seem like a
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with Syria had been terminated despite extensive
shuttle diplomacy by former Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
In the peace process with the Palestinians, U.S. officials went
from mediators to referees. They toiled in excruciating detail to
keep the process limping along.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats trudged into Palestinian prisons to confirm for
Israel that terrorists were really behind bars. They engaged in
crisis diplomacy to diffuse guns-drawn standoffs between Israeli
soldiers and Palestinian police. Clinton flew to the Gaza Strip to
push the peace process along last December.
</P>
<P>
   Barak promises to reopen direct communication with his Arab
counterparts. That gives the United States a chance to fall back
into its traditional peace-making role sending money, maybe troops
to the border with Syria, and just occasionally having to break a
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate concern is the implementation of the Wye River
Memorandum, a peace deal brokered by Clinton in October that has
been stalled for several months. That deal required unprecedented
U.S. involvement in the details of peacemaking. It also cemented
Palestinian gains in relations with the United States, which
Palestinians now fear they could lose.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was welcomed at the White House while Netanyahu was not.
CIA monitors vouched for Palestinian actions against terrorism,
shielding Arafat from Netanyahu's accusations that he was doing
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have the Americans in the room,'' said Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, ``was protecting our interests, protecting
where we stand.''
</P>
<P>
   By playing off the combative Netanyahu, Palestinian leaders at
least were able to tell their people that they were improving
relations with the superpower United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they say American credibility is at stake in ensuring that
Barak goes ahead with the long-delayed provisions of Wye. They
include more land transfers, allowing the construction of a port in
Gaza, which is expected to provide thousands of jobs for
Palestinians, and allowing ``safe passage'' for Palestinians to
travel through Israel between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a bundle of U.S. cash for the region has been on
hold. The White House is requesting that Israel get a one-time aid
bonus of $1.2 billion _ in addition to the nearly $3 billion it
gets every year to move troops out of land turned over to the
Palestinians. The Palestinians would get $400 million in economic
aid. But the money will only be sent if the Wye agreement is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Money and U.S. troops would likely be involved in ending the war
in Lebanon and resolving stalled talks with Syria. Syrian leaders
want the return of the Golan Heights, which Israel has occupied
since 1967 and is now home to 15,000 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which controls Lebanon, has encouraged Hezbollah in
fighting against Israeli troops that also occupy part of that
country. Barak promised to remove Israeli troops from Lebanon
within a year. That would likely require a return of the Golan
Heights to Syria and an agreement with Syria to prevent Hezbollah
attacks into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. forces would be instrumental in enforcing the peace in the
Golan Heights and convincing Israelis they are safe.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Syrian President Hafez Assad have exchanged
surprisingly warm compliments in recent days. Again, there seems to
be a new urgency. Assad is said to be ailing and eager to restore
the Golan Heights to Syrian control.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is already planning
to visit Israel and Syria in August, and predicts, fitting for
today's high hopes, a resolution of the issues within a year.

AUTHORITIES STAGE FIRES IN ARANSAS REFUGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RALPH WININGHAM  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ More than 11,000 acres of the Aransas National
Wildlife Refuge will be put to the torch in controlled burns this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The largest brush-burning effort ever conducted at the
70,550-acre wildlife habitat is designed to help return the area to
its original prairie savanna ecosystem and to enhance the winter
home for endangered whooping cranes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We conduct burns every winter, but nothing of this size,''
said Jim Halpin, acting refuge manager at the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service refuge on the Gulf Coast northeast of Corpus
Christi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be burning brush 12-feet-tall and under, with the
fully mature live oak mottes to be protected. The burns will be
conducted at 10 different parcels over about 10 days, depending
upon the weather and wind,'' he said. A motte is a small grove of
trees.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 miles of firebreaks have been carved throughout the
refuge by employees using bulldozers and other heavy equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Halpin explained that rather than using a wall of fire, as is
common in some areas of the country, a helicopter will drop about
25,000 fuel containers resembling table tennis balls.
</P>
<P>
   A chemical reaction in the containers causes them to burst into
flame when they fall to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending upon the saturation, you normally have a series of
little fires that burn into each other,'' Halpin said. ``This will
allow for escape routes for animals, and there are plenty of water
holes for creatures to hide in.''
</P>
<P>
   To help with the effort, about 40 interagency firefighters will
participate in the burns, and all activities will be coordinated
with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and the
Texas Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   Halpin said burning the brush at this time of year will greatly
reduce the number of smaller oak trees, while allowing the regrowth
of native grasses that once covered the area.
</P>
<P>
   The refuge attracts thousands of visitors each year to observe
the whooping cranes at their winter home. The birds travel about
2,400 miles from Canada, arriving in mid-October and leaving in
April.

IT'S TIME FOR A TAX CUT BECAUSE WE'VE OVERPAID FEDERAL TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By J.T. YOUNG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Washington estimators recently released their
latest budget calculations. Their encouraging news underscores the
health of our economy and the fact that a major tax cut is fiscally
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the
non-Social Security budget surplus will occur a year earlier than
projected in April _ reaching $14 billion in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It will amount to $294 billion over the next five years and $996
billion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   What do these numbers mean? Simply, that there is even more
reason for Washington to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The budget passed by Congress calls for a $778 billion tax cut
over the next ten years. Like CBO's new $996 billion estimated
surplus, none of this proposed tax cut comes from Social Security
money.
</P>
<P>
   The most important factor to keep in mind is that all these
additional surplus amounts were generated by non-payroll tax
sources. All of Social Security's surplus is included in a separate
$1.9 trillion pot.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the non-Social Security surplus is basically the product of
personal income tax payments _ income and capital gains taxes. This
effective income tax overpayment should be returned to those who
earned it.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of CBO's improved surplus projection comes once again
from the economy. Congressional estimators anticipate the economy's
real growth (minus inflation) will be 4 percent this year _ a
dramatic increase from its earlier prediction of 2.3 percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Similar growth is anticipated for 2000 and 2001 _ CBO increased
its estimate from 1.7 percent to 2.4 percent and from 2.2 percent
to 2.4 percent in 2000 and 2001 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation and unemployment outlooks have also improved.
Inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index) is expected to
rise just 2.2 percent in 1999. What's more, it is expected to stay
at the historically low rate of 2.5 percent for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment estimate has shown even greater and more
prolonged improvement. This year's rate is estimated to remain at
4.2 percent _ a 29-year-low. Unemployment is not expected to break
the 5-percent level _ which not long ago was assumed to be its
natural floor _ until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress' new estimates do not differ dramatically from
the Clinton administration's, their responses to the shared
optimism could not be starker.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Congress' $778 billion tax cut figure look even
more feasible, it starts to look small in comparison to the
resources at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' tax cut is just 80 percent of the non-Social Security
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, $2.1 trillion is left over for Social Security
reform and public debt reduction _ the public debt would be cut 60
percent to just $1.5 trillion in 2009 under the congressional tax
cut scenario.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, President Clinton's February budget called for more
taxes on top of the estimated $996 billion overpayment over the
next ten years. According to congressional estimators' earlier
analysis, Clinton wants to increase the surplus by another 10
percent by raising an additional $96 billion in new taxes over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's latest estimates show that there will be even more
of a non-Social Security surplus than was originally projected.
</P>
<P>
   Washington cannot pretend to treat this money like it has found
a lost wallet with no ID. It is patently obvious whose money this
is and to whom it should be returned. It is the product of an
overpayment of personal income taxes from millions and millions of
hard-working Americans and their families.
</P>
<P>
   It is $1 trillion more money than is needed to run the entire
federal government and it is completely separate from every penny
of revenue _ payroll tax receipts and interest earned on its trust
fund balance _ of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   It's time and it's possible to return America's wallet.

THERE'S A KNACK TO MAKING MEAT PIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We certainly have a lot of Louisianians in our midst.
</P>
<P>
   We received many versions of the recipe for Natchitoches (say
NACK-uh-tush) meat pies. Popular since the Civil War in this
central Louisiana town, these pies are found in restaurants such as
Lasyone's Meat Pie Kitchen and Restaurants and also in area homes.
You'll also see them sold on the streets during the town's annual
Christmas Festival of Lights, which is celebrated on the first
Saturday in December.
</P>
<P>
   This version of the recipe, sent in by many readers, is from
``Cane River Cuisine,'' a cookbook printed in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   NATCHITOCHES MEAT PIES
</P>
<P>
   Yields 26-28
</P>
<P>
   Meat filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds ground pork
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds ground beef
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped green onion, tops and bottoms
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon coarsely ground red pepper (or crushed red pepper
flakes)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Combine beef, pork, onions and seasonings in large Dutch oven.
Cook over medium heat, stirring often until meat loses its red
color. Don't overcook meat. Sift flour over meat mixture, stirring
often, until well-combined. Remove from heat and cool to room
temperature. Place meat in large colander to drain off excess
grease and juice.
</P>
<P>
   Crust:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups self-rising flour
</P>
<P>
   1/3 heaping cup solid shortening
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Sift flour and cut shortening into flour. Add egg and milk. Form
dough into a ball. Roll about 1/3 of dough at a time onto a lightly
floured board or pastry cloth. Cut dough into 5- to 5 1/2-inch
circles, using an inverted plate as a guide. Stack rounds on a
cookie sheet, separated by waxed paper.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: Place a heaping tablespoon of filling on one side
of the pastry round. Dampen edge of half of pie containing meat
with fingertips, fold top over meat and crimp with fork dipped in
water. Prick with fork twice on top.
</P>
<P>
   To fry: Fry in deep-fat fryer at 350 degrees until golden brown.
Or, freeze the uncooked meat patties in sandwich bags. Don't thaw
before frying.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritional analysis per pies: 210 calories, 14 grams fat, 8
grams carbohydrates, 11 grams protein, 44 milligrams cholesterol,
401 milligrams sodium, 61 percent of calories from fat.

STUFFING THE ONLINE BALLOT BOX
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  &HT;     By JON SWARZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet threw Major League Baseball a curve during All-Star
Game voting last week. A Boston hacker stuffed the virtual ballot
box to seemingly swing the vote to Red Sox shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra, who was locked in a tight race with New York Yankee
Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Nandor's attempt to pull off a Chicago-style election
result with 25,000 online tallies struck out after MLB officials
detected irregularities and voided the votes.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that MLB's director of new media can't guarantee
someone won't eventually succeed in logging enough virtual votes to
nominate journeyman Paul Sorrento as a starter to the midsummer
classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people can crack a government computer, they can crack a
computer that keeps track of ballots,'' Alex Kam said. ``Computers
aren't impenetrable.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they insignificant in the digital age. The grand old
game of baseball is increasingly more dependent on cyber votes to
select All-Star players. About 13 percent of the more than 3
million votes for tomorrow night's 70th All-Star Game in Boston
were cast over the Internet, up from about 8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kam said MBL can only put ``reasonable limitations'' on
restricting the number of votes per online voter to 22. Like the
more traditional paper-balloting process conducted in baseball's 30
stadiums, MLB executives attempt to detect unusual voting patterns
_ such as the exact same votes coming from the same Internet
address _ over a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   It was that detective work that fingered Nandor, whose burst of
last-minute votes for Red Sox players caught the attention of Kam
and others. Nandor and other would-be manipulators will have to
take solace from the age-old baseball refrain, ``Wait till next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nandor, 25, of Carver, Mass., did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   THE EBAY OF IDEAS
</P>
<P>
   One of Silicon Valley's hottest startups lifts its kimono this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Epinions.com (www.epinions.com), formerly known as Round-One,
will announce an online consumer guide that relies exclusively on
the opinions of Joe Public about products ranging from sports
utility vehicles to Sony Walkmans. Epinions is banking on ad
revenues as its main source of income.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focused on helping consumers make better buying
decisions,'' said Naval Ravikant, company co-founder and chief
executive officer. ``And we believe there are plenty of experts out
there who are passionate about specific subject matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain View, Calif., company _ stocked with hotshot
employees from America Online, Yahoo, AtHome, Apple Computer,
Netscape Communications and Hot Wired _ has raised the interest and
eyebrows of venture capitalists. Benchmark Capital and August
Capital just funneled $8 million into the 30-person company.
</P>
<P>
   MORE NET-ESCAPEES
</P>
<P>
   A team of 10 key engineers from Netscape also is working on a
secret startup. Last week, the first details of Geocast Network
Systems (www.geocast.com) began to surface.
</P>
<P>
   The Menlo Park, Calif., company is developing hardware and
software that would deliver full-screen video and CD-quality sound
to personal computers, according to Jon Mittelhauser, manager of
software products at Geocast.
</P>
<P>
   Geocast is expected to unveil its products next year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry buzz over Geocast is so high-pitched that VC rivals
Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers and the Mayfield Fund have each
invested in the 50-person startup. (The company's chief operating
officer, Alan Nichols Jr., previously was an executive vice
president of The Chronicle Publishing Co.)
</P>
<P>
   GEEKS FOR HIRE
</P>
<P>
   Remember the ragtag group of nerdy mercenaries who anonymously
offered their services in an eBay listing in April?
</P>
<P>
   Starting at $3.14 million, the team of 16 engineers _ who called
themselves ispteam _ offered wired-for-hire expertise.
</P>
<P>
   And they got a couple of feelers from at least five companies
before bagging the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of the co-conspirators, John Kinsella, has decided to
give it another go. Only this time he isn't hiding behind a veil of
secrecy. Kinsella has opened a Web site, www.bid4geeks.com, that
auctions tech talent to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to advertise the talents of individuals or teams of
workers for startups and established companies,'' said Kinsella,
25, a former Unix systems engineer at Digex, an Internet service
provider in Cupertino, Calif. ``With such incredible demand for
tech talent, we think this is the ultimate in online classified ads
for nerds.''
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   The snazzy new iMac laptop we first reported on in December
could emerge next week at the Macworld Expo computer show in New
York. The $2,000 translucent portable is considered crucial to
extending the company's recent run of success, and fills out
Apple's PC line.
</P>
<P>
   Apple declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, E-Trade Group denied scuttlebutt that it is
relocating some facilities from its Menlo Park, Calif.,
headquarters to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, grumblings out of Mountain View, Calif., are that
America Online's payroll and commission system doesn't jibe with
Netscape's system, depriving Netscape sales representatives of
commission checks for the past four months. That's the rumor.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that an administrative switch resulted in a
two-week delay in commission checks, according to the company.
Netscape sales reps should be paid by the end of the month.
</P>

FTC RECOMMENDS CONGRESS HOLD OFF ON PRIVACY LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (lh) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   WASHINGTON _
While finding that the online industry has a long way to go in
protecting the privacy of consumers, the Federal Trade Commission
has approved a report recommending that Congress hold off on
legislation to regulate how companies can collect and use consumer
data.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The report, approved 3-1 by the commission, was a victory for
industry groups that have been scrambling for the last year and
half to avert privacy legislation. They have made a case for
self-regulation, encouraging companies to declare policies that
allow consumers to choose and control the information collected
about them over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Varney, a former federal trade commissioner who is now
a legal counsel to the Online Privacy Alliance, a group of Internet
and technology companies that was formed a year ago when the
commission threatened to seek legislation, said, ``I think it does
reflect that the industry has done an enormous amount of work over
the last year and a half and we are on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates insist that the latest surveys of the
privacy practices of online marketers _ and the commission report
itself _ prove that self-regulation is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is plenty of evidence that self-regulation has
not worked,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, a civil liberties advocacy
group. ``What these privacy policies are telling people is how much
privacy they don't have. The consequence as a legal matter is
expectations of privacy in the online world continue to decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was not without criticism of the industry. Indeed, it
cites a survey this spring by Georgetown University showing that
while 66 percent of Web sites now post privacy policies _ up from
14 percent a year earlier _ only 10 percent also follow the
commission's criteria for protecting personal information, giving
consumers choice and control over such information and a form of
redress if it is misused.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The self-regulatory initiatives described above reflect
industry leaders' substantial effort and commitment to fair
information practices,'' the report states. But it goes on to say
that ``only a small minority of commercial Web sites have joined
these programs to date.''
</P>
<P>
   The report will be officially submitted on Tuesday at a hearing
of the House Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and
consumer protection, at which trade commission members and others
on both sides of the privacy issue are expected to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Edward Markey of
Massachusetts, says he intends to introduce an online privacy
``bill of rights'' to protect consumer control over personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the commission, denied that its
conclusions were in conflict. ``Responsible elements of the
Internet community have begun to do what they set out to do,'' he
said. ``On the other hand, just putting a notice on the Internet
about a privacy policy is not all the protection that consumers
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said the commission would continue to closely monitor
online privacy. And the report lays out an agenda for public
workshops and task forces of industry, privacy and consumer groups
to make sure the progress continues.
</P>
<P>
   It also promises another review of Web site privacy practices,
probably in another year, Pitofsky said, emphasizing not just the
adoption of policies but their substance, monitoring and
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes a year after the commission released the first
survey on Web site privacy practices and won approval of
legislation requiring Web sites that collect information from
children to get parents' permission. It also warned that it would
seek legislation regulating the use of personal information
collected from adults if substantial progress was not made.

HOW TO KEEP E-MAIL PRIVATE
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I do a lot of e-mail correspondence that involves sensitive
corporate information. Is there any way to code my mail so that
only the person I'm sending it to can read it?
</P>
<P>
   A: What you need is PGP, a free encryption program that you can
download at www.pgpi.com. PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy. It
was created in 1991 by Phil Zimmerman, who went on to found a
company, PGP Inc., that was acquired by Network Associates in 1997.
PGP is pretty strong stuff (so strong that the U.S. government
investigated Zimmerman for three years on the premise that PGP
violated U.S. export restrictions for cryptographic software).
</P>
<P>
   PGP uses what's called public key system. Each user has two
software keys _ a public key that can be shared with anyone, and a
private key that only the user knows. Someone sends you a message
using your public key to encrypt it. Once encrypted, the message
looks like random gibberish. When you receive the message, you can
decrypt it using your private key.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, PGP isn't just for e-mail. You can use it to
scramble any file that you don't want other people to know about.
Just use your public key to encrypt it, and your private key to
decrypt it.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORD ON LINUX
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been reading a lot about Linux, and I was under the
impression that there would soon be versions of it that would be
easy to install and use on my PC. Is that true, and which versions
are the best?
</P>
<P>
   A: Linux has come a long way in the couple of years since it
burst into the spotlight. But truth to tell, it still is a long way
from being an adequate alternative to Windows or the Macintosh
operating system. The reason is that very little good software has
been written for Linux. For instance, the only mainstream word
processor that's been adapted to Linux is WordPerfect. Microsoft is
having no part of the upstart system, and we may never see Linux
versions of Word, Excel and Powerpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Linux itself is getting a lot easier to use, thanks to companies
that are packaging it with graphical, Windows-like desktop
interfaces and easy installation routines. Two good versions that
come to mind are Red Hat 6.0 ($79.95 list price) and Linux from
Macmillan Software ($49.95 for the Deluxe version, $29.95 for the
Complete version, although how it can be complete if there's a more
extensive version is beyond me). These products let you surf the
Web, exchange e-mail, create simple documents and manage your
files.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about Linux is that it works on older PCs, so if
you have a 386 or 486 system gathering dust in the basement, Linux
could give it new life.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOST POWERFUL
</P>
<P>
   Q: How powerful is the world's top supercomputer? I'm 13 and
would like to know.
</P>
<P>
   A: Over the past few years, Intel, IBM, SGI, Hitachi and NEC all
at one time or another have laid claim to having the world's most
powerful supercomputer. In every case, it's a computer that uses
hundreds or even thousands of conventional processors like Pentiums
to form a cyberbrain in which each processor does a small part of a
big job. The result is what's called massively parallel processing.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the top computer in the world, according to a list
published by the University of Mannheim, is the Intel ASCI Red,
which is installed at the Sandia National Laboratory in
Albuquerque, N.M. It uses 9,742 Pentiums and can perform 2.1
trillion operations per second. Second place belongs to SGI's ASCI
Blue Mountain at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M.
IBM is planning a version of its RS/6000 SP supercomputer _ to be
installed at the Lawrence Livermore Lab next year _ that will be
capable of 10 trillion calculations per second. That means it will
be able to do in one second what it would take you 10 million years
to do with a hand calculator.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frustrating things about notebook computers is
that sometimes the cursor can be hard to see on the screen. This is
particularly true when the lighting situation is bad, such as when
you're outdoors. To make the cursor easier to locate, do the
following: Click the Windows Start button, point to settings and
choose Control Panel. Double-click the Mouse icon and click the
Motion tab. Then check the box labeled ``Show pointer trails'' and
click Apply. This will give the cursor a fleeting comet tail when
you move it.

 By CATHERINE GREENMAN c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   Jack Jackson
can't remember the last time he wrote a check and hasn't spoken
face to face with a bank teller in years. Jackson has handled his
personal banking online with Bank Boston since 1989, and he
expanded to online banking for his public relations business three
years ago.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although he experienced two instances of bank errors that cost
him several hours on the phone with customer service, that has not
deterred him from banking online. ``I think I've had to deal with
the best and worst that it has to offer,'' Jackson said. ``It's
easy to set up and it can be incredibly convenient, but anyone who
has really bad financial habits may find that their problems will
be exacerbated when they go online. It's definitely not for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   One big difference with many online banking accounts is that as
soon as you direct the bank to send out a payment from your
account, that money's gone. You can't mail out a $50 check and
figure that you can get to the bank to deposit the money to cover
the check before it's presented by the recipient's bank for
payment. But one thing online customers gain is convenience _ the
bank's always open for business.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Jackson was unusual. Although some of the
largest banks in the country, including Wells Fargo, Citibank and
Chase Manhattan, have offered their customers online bill-payment
options for nearly a decade, only during the last couple of years
have customers really started to warm to the idea of clicking on
the Send button at an online banking site.
</P>
<P>
   According to IDC, a market research firm in Framingham, Mass.,
the number of people in the United States participating in at least
one online banking function (like viewing deposits, transferring
money between accounts and paying bills) rose to 12.4 million in
1999 from 1.4 million in 1996. IDC expects that number to rise to
18.7 million by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts cite the widespread availability of
modem-equipped computers as one reason for the increase in online
banking activity. They add that people are also finally starting to
get comfortable with the notion that entering bank account
information online is no riskier than giving a credit card number
over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online trading has really made people aware of how to bank
online,'' said Mitch Caplan, president of Telebank, a phone- and
Internet-based bank. ``The security issues aren't really there any
more.'' But while online trading offers discount services, many
banks charge more for online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It has become much more convenient to pay bills and transfer
money to other accounts via computer because many banks are moving
their entire online consumer banking areas onto the Internet and
off private networks, which required the customer to use
communications software and a modem to dial directly into a
company's computer system.
</P>
<P>
   To pay bills online with Chase in 1994, for example, a customer
had to call Chase's customer service and order software disks for
logging onto a private network. Since Chase moved its online
banking functions to the Internet last February, online customers
have been able to gain access to their accounts from any PC with an
Internet connection by going to the bank's Web site and punching in
an identifying name and password.
</P>
<P>
   So what should you expect if you wean yourself from your
checkbook? Setting up access to your bank account via the Internet
is relatively simple. After securing your bank accounts with a
customer ID and a password, you enter the account numbers and
addresses of each company or person you pay regularly. As long as
you can provide that information, you can send payments to large
companies (like your cable and credit card companies) as well as to
individuals, like your piano teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks charge a monthly fee, usually $5 to $15, for
unlimited bill payments, but many are providing Internet banking
access and bill payments at no extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience of online banking has won some fans, like Lisa
and Alex Giassa of Teaneck, N.J., who have had an online account
since August 1998. ``It's definitely a convenience thing for us,''
Ms. Giassa said. ``If I know I have a bill due in a few days, I can
go upstairs, pay it in a couple of minutes and not deal with any
envelopes.''
</P>
<P>
   But lest you think that the click of a Send button will
instantaneously send off your son's college tuition payment on the
day it is due, think again. Only about half of electronic payments
are actually transmitted to recipients electronically. Many utility
companies and merchants are not set up to receive electronic
payments. Such companies are sent checks via regular mail _ an
annoying lesson for those who don't make allowances for the delayed
delivery and miss payment deadlines.

STUDY SHOWS LOS ANGELES TRAILS ONLY THE SILICON VALLEY ON LIST OF
HIGH-TECH REGIONS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   The
entertainment industry helped make the Los Angeles metropolitan
area the nation's second-largest high-tech region last year,
trailing only the Silicon Valley, a study released Tuesday showed.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The report by the nonprofit Milken Institute said the Los
Angeles-Long Beach metro area accounted for 5.11 percent, or better
than $1 of every $20, of the nation's output in the high-tech
sector.
</P>
<P>
   The first-ever study asserted that Los Angeles' high ranking
resulted from growth in multimedia entertainment, including
special-effects companies serving the film industry, television,
video games and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles also ranked an impressive third among so-called
``Tech-Poles,'' the institute's name for areas with high
concentrations of and output from high-tech industries such as
computer services, drug manufacturing, motion picture production
and aerospace. Northern California's San Jose metro area, which
includes the Silicon Valley, also earned first place in that
category while Dallas ranked as the second-largest Tech-Pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really positive news, because we were really
lagging behind five or six years ago,'' Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan said of the study results. ``We've really come a long way
since then.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-area numbers are somewhat inflated because not
all motion picture production and services use advanced technology,
according to Ross DeVol, the institute's director of regional and
demographic studies and primary author of the report. But he noted
that the numbers boded well for the area's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the decline in aerospace work, he said, ``It's
remarkable how much high-tech activity remains in the Los Angeles
area.''
</P>
<P>
   A large part of that continued success, DeVol said, is the
proximity of top-flight universities and research institutions and
a pool of talented workers in high-tech service areas such as
computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   Motion picture production and services were included in the
rankings to reflect emerging technologies such as computer
animation and digital-audio sound effects. But even without the
motion picture segment _ which the report estimated at about 4
percent of the area's total economy _ Los Angeles-Long Beach would
rank seventh in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In its 123 pages of rankings, charts and economic analysis, the
Milken Institute study _ titled ``America's High-Tech Economy:
Growth, Development, and Risks for Metropolitan Areas'' _ argued
that high-tech industries have spearheaded the economic growth of
both the United States and its metro areas.
</P>
<P>
   The study claims that annual growth in high-tech products and
services averaged 20percent over the past three years, ``directly
elevating'' the overall U.S. Gross Domestic Product by 1.5percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The report also listed ways that government investment
contributes to, and can further support, the industry. Key areas
include lifelong learning programs, tax incentives, minimizing
regulations and the role of research institutions and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The information is particularly important to city governments,
DeVol said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't address these critical factors, their residents
risk being left behind in the new economy,'' DeVol said.``Their
standard of living is going to be directly related to how well they
do in these high-tech industries.''
</P>
<P>
   But the institute's report said the rising importance of the
high-tech industry will bring risks as well as benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the report simulated the effects of a ``1990-91 style
recession,'' concluding that ``high-tech manufacturing industries
would experience a substantially more severe decline than the
overall economy and could even exacerbate the overall decline in
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the high-tech industry, particularly the
computer and office-equipment segment, is reacting more in line
with changes in the overall business cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed that any embrace of the high-tech industry
should be a cautious one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants what the Silicon Valley has,'' said Tom
Lieser, executive director of the Anderson Forecast at the
University of California, Los Angeles. ``The question is, as the
industry becomes more mature and more cyclical, it poses a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing social tension is another risk.
</P>
<P>
   Besides an influx of immigrants and a dramatic economic shift,
the high-tech industry can contribute to income disparities and
tension, DeVol said, adding that the government needs to play a
problem-solving role in that area.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's leading metropolitan areas for technology output,
according to a Milken Institute study released Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   1. San Jose
</P>
<P>
   2. Los Angeles-Long Beach
</P>
<P>

HIGHER-SPEED LINES LEAVE DOOR AJAR FOR HACKERS

 (bl)  
 By IAN AUSTEN   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   About two weeks
after Frank Keeney was first connected to cable modem service in
Pasadena, Calif., he discovered that along with the delights of a
24-hour connection and high-speed Internet access came the
potential for big trouble.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I went to log in and found that someone had compromised my
computer,'' he recalled. ``When you log into a Linux system, it
will normally show a short message stating the last time logged in
and from where. Since I had not logged in for a week or so, I knew
there was trouble. I checked to see if someone else was online and,
sure enough, he was on at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to kill his log-in session, but it was too late. He
had already issued the command to erase every file on the computer.
I watched while he erased everything on my hard drive.'`
</P>
<P>
   Keeney's experience is not isolated, several computer security
experts said. The shift from dial-up Internet connections to cable
modems and DSL (digital subscriber lines _ fast, constant links to
the Net that use telephone lines) are making home computer users
vulnerable to the types of attacks from hackers that in the past
were almost exclusively a worry for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people aren't thinking at this level yet,'' said
Christopher Klaus, chief technology officer for Internet Security
Systems, an Atlanta-based maker of complex security analysis
software used by large corporations. ``Service providers are
looking at trying to put as many people on the Internet as
possible. The more security isn't brought up as an issue, the
greater the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable modems and DSL lines are presenting two new problems for
ordinary residential users. The biggest source of trouble comes
simply because these lines mean that users are constantly connected
to the Net, so their computers are always potential targets of
hackers..
</P>
<P>
   The second problem has to do with the types of connections used
by faster lines. Communications between computers on the Internet
rely on a series of numbers known as IP, or Internet protocol,
addresses. For dial-up users, those addresses are constantly
shifting, making them their computers elusive targets. While it can
be a nuisance to dial in to reach the Net every time you want to
check your e-mail, the practice automatically provides its own
measure of security.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately the protection afforded by the dial-up shell game
largely or completely vanishes with cable modems or DSL lines.
Because their customers don't flit on and off the Net, many high
speed service operators give them fixed IP addresses.
</P>
<P>
   While they may not be publicizing their new services' security
problems with the vigor they bring to boasting about the more
desirable features, cable modem and DSL providers acknowledge that
their residential customers are facing new kinds of security woes _
even if personal computers, of course, are less likely to be the
targets of hackers than are corporate or government systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are today, from a consumer standpoint, is where
companies were back in the late '80s, when firewalls weren't a big
issue,'' said Kevin McElearney, vice president of network support
services at Road Runner, a cable modem partnership that includes
Time Warner Entertainment, the Mediaone Group, Microsoft, Compaq
and Advance/Newhouse. Residential customers using high-speed
services, he said, ``are in an environment where they have to
realize that there are security issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your risk is increased the longer you leave any computer
connected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning together in this new world of always being
online in the home,'' said Jeff Waldhuter, director of technology
and engineering at Bell Atlantic Science and Technology Center, the
research branch of the telephone company and DSL service provider.
``Now that we're getting on with these connections, we're learning
that we have to add more security. We're growing up. These networks
are going to be vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to the always-connected world seems to have come at a
somewhat inopportune time. Internet Security Systems has been
tracking a ``dramatic increase'' in the use of a hacking technique
known variously as probing, sniffing or scanning, Klaus said.
Probing software automatically scans computers connected to the
Internet and evaluates the level of their security protection,
looking for weak systems vulnerable to easy attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon to have someone twist the doorknob of your
home computer,'' McElearney said.
</P>
<P>
   For probers, a typical home computer running Apple's Mac OS or
Windows 95 or 98 without the maker's latest security updates or
additional security software is the closest thing to an unlocked
door they are likely to find.
</P>
<P>
   After his hard drive disaster, Keeney installed security
software on his computer in Pasedena that tracks and records
break-in attempts by probing software. He has found that unwanted
visitors test his computer's security about twice a day. ``Most
computers on cable modems will be probed,'' he said. ``If
weaknesses are found, someone will exploit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike people who create and spread viruses or worms, probers
don't need the computer's owner to advance their cause
inadvertently by, say, opening a tainted e-mail attachment. For
them, an insecure system offers seemingly endless potential.
Keeney's hard drive crash is an extreme example of what hackers can
do once inside a computer. But others can cause just as much harm
even though they come and go without leaving an immediate trace.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Sullivan said, once hackers gain entry they
can extract credit card numbers from stored files, read e-mail,
copy files, send e-mail over your name _ ``in short, just about
anything,'' he added.

IT'S THE LAND OF THE FREE (COMPUTER) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
uaxx  (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   Swept up in
the phenomenal rush of the global Internet that it helped create,
the personal computer industry is undergoing a fundamental
transformation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The PC has become inextricably linked to the Internet, causing
the two formerly distinct businesses to blend. Several PC makers
have begun offering free Internet access as an inducement to sell
more machines, while several Internet service providers have begun
giving away computers, or subsidizing their purchase, to entice
more customers to sign up for online services.
</P>
<P>
   Still another group of companies has started giving computers to
customers who agree to look at online advertising. The companies
hope that they can attract advertisers who are trying to reach a
population that is spending less time in front of the TV and more
time in front of the PC.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer, which gained popular acceptance in the
1980s for its ability to perform a wide variety of business and
scientific tasks, is increasingly being recognized in the late
1990s as primarily a communications device that enables anyone to
send and receive e-mail, participate in discussion groups and
browse for information on the Internet's World Wide Web. Marketing
surveys confirm that Internet access is the main reason people buy
a PC today.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the PC is following the model of the cellular phone,
which is often given away or sold at low cost to customers who sign
up for service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the largest Internet service providers, America
Online's Compuserve unit, the Microsoft Network and Prodigy
Internet, now offer $400 rebate programs that cover at least part
of the cost of a new PC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several of the largest PC makers, including Compaq,
Dell and Gateway, are driving the cost of their basic computers
well below $1,000 and experimenting with free Internet access to
get more customers.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy, CompUSA, Microcenter and Circuit City are among the
large national retailers that are offering similar deals in
conjunction with Internet service contracts, making the cost of a
PC comparable to the cost of, say, a video cassette recorder.
During test marketing at some stores, they have offered weekend
specials: a PC for $400, with a $400 instant rebate. Circuit City
offered a bundle of a monitor and printer for $99 extra.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as a free lunch, of course, and caveats
abound in these new schemes. There are no complete PC systems
available for $400, and the PC's that come closest are typically
bare-bones machines with minimal features, dubious warranties and
limited free technical support. The offers typically do not apply
to Apple Macintosh computers or PC companion devices like the Palm
Pilot. The Internet service contracts require payments of $700 or
more over three years, and if the customer gets frustrated by the
quality of the PC or the Internet service during that time, three
years is a very long time to stew.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is no doubt that these programs make
owning a PC and getting connected to the Internet much less
expensive than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a customer can buy a $399 Emachines PC with
Compuserve software already installed, sign up for a three-year
Compuserve account at $21.95 a month and get a $400 rebate check
from America Online. The Emachines computer does not come with a
monitor, which adds $100 or so. And while Compuserve is owned by
America Online, it lacks the strong lineup of family and
child-friendly features that have made AOL the world's most popular
online service.
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy, once the largest online service in America before it
fell on hard times, this month announced a rebate plan with the
Best Buy Co., the country's largest consumer PC retail chain. A
customer who signs a three-year contract for Prodigy Internet
access at $19.95 a month will get a $400 rebate that can be applied
to the cost of any desktop or portable PC at Best Buy. A two-year
contract will get a $250 rebate; a one-year plan, $100.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Network, or MSN, is testing a $400 rebate plan in
15 Microcenter computer stores, and last weekend it conducted a
limited ``free PC'' test with Staples office products stores. Like
the others, MSN requires a three-year commitment at $19.95 a month.
Microcenter has a $449 PC, but it does not include a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq offers free Internet access with its Presario line of
home computers, including one model that costs $599 with a monitor,
through a rapidly growing Internet service company called Net Zero.
Net Zero requires customers to reveal personal information and to
agree to watch advertisements geared to their interests. Compaq
also offers Internet access under its own Compaq.net service for
prices starting at $11.99 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway offers one year of free Internet access with any machine
priced over $1,000 and is said to be negotiating to buy Earthlink,
a major Internet service company.
</P>
<P>
   Global demand remains strong for powerful and expensive PC's
that can perform complex operations like managing large customer
accounts, designing software or playing the latest
three-dimensional computer games. But in the past year, consumers
have come to see PC's _ especially those that cost less than $1,000
_ mainly as the boxes that say ``You've Got Mail!'' and allow them
to buy books, trade stocks and participate in electronic garage
sales and auctions without leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   Although low-cost PC's are not suitable for designing rocket
ships or playing the latest 3-D games, most are more than adequate
for handling simple applications like e-mail, Web browsing and
online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, PC's appealed mainly to consumers who were
technologically adept or brave enough to put up with such a
notoriously complex, frustrating and expensive device. The
penetration of PC's into American homes reached about 40 percent,
then stayed there for several years, suggesting that most people
who wanted a PC already had one.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has changed the landscape. The superiority of
e-mail over postal mail for keeping in touch with friends and
family, coupled with the ubiquity of ``www'' Internet addresses on
television and in print advertisements, is piquing the interest of
many consumers who until now had resisted owning a computer. They
may still hate the idea of having a computer, but they love the
idea of being on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With their new ``free PC'' plans, the Internet companies are
hoping to reach many of the 45 million American households that
have lacked either the interest or the money to bring PC's into
their homes. The ``free Internet'' schemes of the PC makers are
heading toward the same goal from the opposite route.
</P>
<P>
   If the most optimistic forecasts come true, computers may soon
become as ubiquitous as telephones or television sets. For that to
happen, PC's are going to have to be as easy to use as telephones
and television sets, which is definitely not the case today.
</P>
<P>
   But the price is right, finally.

and a barbecue grill in a suburban back yard, will make its debut
at the Texas Motor Speedway Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a wild idea became a reality eight years ago.
Today, the U.S. Lawn Mower Racing Association (USLMRA), has a
21-race season, a TV network deal, financial backing from Sta-Bil _
manufacturers of a gasoline additive _ and a sweetheart deal with
lawn-mower manufacturer Snapper.
</P>
<P>
   There are 500 registered members of the USLMRA, lured into the
fold by Bruce Kaufman, who actually gets paid a salary to promote
lawn-mower racing with promises of dinky trophies and no monetary
reward for winners. Bragging rights are a big enticement, Kaufman
says, giving the first hint that perhaps lawn-mower racers are
slightly askew.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there was that moment when Kaufman answered the phone with
an explosive, ``Rock and mow; Turf's up!''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman is a walking warning that the lawn-mower racing world is
slightly silly. Racers use precious vacation time and drive
thousands of miles, traveling state to state to follow the racing
season.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman equates racers with Deadheads. One of his most loyal
competitors is Bob Frennesson of Katy, Texas, former president of
the Lone Star Lawn Mower Racing Association. ``Bob will travel days
to find a race. He considers anything less than 2,500 miles a
commute,'' Kaufman says.
</P>
<P>
   Frennesson's commitment to the sport is legendary. He logged
more than 14,000 miles last year, says current Lone Star President
Garrett Gray of Duncanville. Frennesson, who is large, races a
mower that is small, with a top speed of 17 miles per hour in a
class in which most machines can reach 30 miles per hour. ``He
usually pops a chain; he hardly ever finishes a race,'' says
Kaufman, ``but that does not dampen his mow-tivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hideous puns and a compulsion to use the word ``mow'' are very
popular with this group. They name their racing machines
Turfinator, Sodzilla, Lawn Ranger and Ace of Blades. There are four
classes of race mowers: Stock (10 mph), IMOW Therefore I Am (25
mph), Prepared (35 mph) and Factory Experimental (50 mph). Gray's
personal machine is called Geronimow. He takes it to the races in
the back of his minivan, named the Quasi-Mow-Tow.
</P>
<P>
   It was this Three Stooges-type humor that initially appealed to
Gray. When he saw lawn-mower racing on TNN and discovered that he
could don a helmet and tear across a grass track on his Murray
rear-engine machine, ``I realized these were my people,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Now he logs thousands of miles each summer in search of races.
Gray and the Lone Star team will be at the Invitational Mow Down
Aug. 5. This is the first lawn-mower race at the new speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn-mower racing may sound exclusive, but it's not. If there
are any people out there who believe this may be their calling,
they can contact Gray at his Web site, www.h-a-y-u.com. He'll coach
them through the safety rules, such as removing the lawn mower
blades, and help rookies through some practice sessions. The Web
site for the national group is www.letsmow.com.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is a big moment in Texas racing, don't look for
Kaufman at the Lone Star Invitational. He's off to England that
weekend for the grand prix of lawn-mower racing, the 12-hour
endurance race, won several years ago by legendary automobile race
driver Sterling Moss. Hard to believe the Brits have been doing
this lawn-mower race thing longer and to greater extremes, but
there it is.

JUDGE ORDERS NEW HEARING FOR ACTOR'S FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARO ROBBINS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Charles Harrelson, the convicted killer who is the
father of actor Woody Harrelson, will again take the witness stand
in his bid for freedom, a federal judge in San Antonio has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling released Monday, U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia
ordered a hearing, tentatively set for September, to focus on
Harrelson's defense after he was charged with the 1979
assassination in San Antonio of U.S. District Judge John H. Wood
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson's lawyers aim, in part, to show his original defense
failed to reveal other plausible suspects, including a San Antonio
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal bankrolled by Harrelson's celebrity son, the
lawyers maintain that prosecutors concealed evidence that could
have led to an acquittal, and that his lawyers failed to provide an
adequate defense.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing will take place in Denver federal court, some 100
miles from the maximum-security prison where the convict has served
some 16 years of a life sentence for killing the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia also ordered the government to give Harrelson certain
investigators' notes, polygraph results and other documents related
to a prison informant's allegations linking San Antonio lawyer Alan
Brown to the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson's lawyers contend that Brown briefly represented their
client, a conflict of interest because he also had been a suspect
in the murder investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who also will testify at the hearing, maintains he never
worked for Harrelson. He insists he had no part in the judge's
slaying and that the murder investigation proved those accusations
false.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this case was fully investigated,'' Brown said.
``Every stone was turned.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials, who argued that Harrelson already
had all the pertinent documents he needed for his defense, said
they would respond to Garcia's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia also ruled that celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz cannot
represent Harrelson in court because he is eventually expected to
testify as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Because Garcia is new to the case, the hearing will, in part,
retrace testimony from similar proceedings presided over last year
by U.S. District Judge Fred Biery.
</P>
<P>
   Biery recused himself after questions about conflict of interest
followed his playing in a pickup basketball game with Woody
Harrelson, the star of ``White Men Can't Jump.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Both men dabble in music, admire slain peacemaker
Yitzhak Rabin and are in a hurry for a comprehensive peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of struggles with a hard-line Israeli
government, U.S. President Bill Clinton will host new Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak Thursday amid the fresh air of reconciliation
and hopes of making history together.
</P>
<P>
   Barak took office just 10 days ago, but the stocky ex-commando
is ready, as was Rabin, to talk about nothing less than an end to
the decades of fighting between Israelis and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, drew his support from
Israelis opposed to peace deals with the Arabs. But, Barak trounced
Netanyahu by promising quick solutions to the land dispute with the
Palestinians, the 17-year-old war in Lebanon and the cold war with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, sees the clock ticking on the last 18 months
of his presidency. He was consistently frustrated by Netanyahu.
Though massive U.S. aid to Israel kept flowing during the last
three years, relations were so chilly that Clinton once refused to
see Netanyahu on a visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton plans two dinners and two long meetings with Barak.
If they are lacking for conversation, they can always chat about
political svengali James Carville, who they both relied on for
their electoral success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak is a pianist. Clinton is a saxophonist,'' said David
Clayman, director of the Israel office of the American Jewish
Congress. ``Even if they don't actually play together, I'm sure
they will make music together.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit is part of Barak's exploratory peace tour, which has
been true to form for the meticulous 57-year-old with the master's
degree in systems engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He has met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat and Jordanian King Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, he will be asking Clinton how much the United
States will back various Israeli bargaining positions, and Clinton
will be listening to see how much land Israel is ready to give to
make peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now busy trying to draw a road map that will take us in
the Middle East to the ultimate goal, which will be a stable and
lasting peace agreement,'' Barak spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs U.S. support to win deals from Arab neighbors that
fearful Israelis will find secure and fair. He also wants Clinton
to reduce the heavy-handed U.S. role in the peace talks, something
U.S. officials are eager to do.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton needs Barak to restore comfortable relations with
Israel. Netanyahu regularly consorted with Clinton's Republican
rivals. His anti-Arab rhetoric and tough stands embarrassed the
United States before Arab allies like Egypt and Saudi Arabia and
made the administration appear ineffective in the important Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a comprehensive peace in the region began to seem like a
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with Syria had been terminated despite extensive
shuttle diplomacy by former Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
In the peace process with the Palestinians, U.S. officials went
from mediators to referees. They toiled in excruciating detail to
keep the process limping along.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats trudged into Palestinian prisons to confirm for
Israel that terrorists were really behind bars. They engaged in
crisis diplomacy to diffuse guns-drawn standoffs between Israeli
soldiers and Palestinian police. Clinton flew to the Gaza Strip to
push the peace process along last December.
</P>
<P>
   Barak promises to reopen direct communication with his Arab
counterparts. That gives the United States a chance to fall back
into its traditional peace-making role sending money, maybe troops
to the border with Syria, and just occasionally having to break a
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate concern is the implementation of the Wye River
Memorandum, a peace deal brokered by Clinton in October that has
been stalled for several months. That deal required unprecedented
U.S. involvement in the details of peacemaking. It also cemented
Palestinian gains in relations with the United States, which
Palestinians now fear they could lose.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was welcomed at the White House while Netanyahu was not.
CIA monitors vouched for Palestinian actions against terrorism,
shielding Arafat from Netanyahu's accusations that he was doing
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have the Americans in the room,'' said Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat, ``was protecting our interests, protecting
where we stand.''
</P>
<P>
   By playing off the combative Netanyahu, Palestinian leaders at
least were able to tell their people that they were improving
relations with the superpower United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they say American credibility is at stake in ensuring that
Barak goes ahead with the long-delayed provisions of Wye. They
include more land transfers, allowing the construction of a port in
Gaza, which is expected to provide thousands of jobs for
Palestinians, and allowing ``safe passage'' for Palestinians to
travel through Israel between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a bundle of U.S. cash for the region has been on
hold. The White House is requesting that Israel get a one-time aid
bonus of $1.2 billion _ in addition to the nearly $3 billion it
gets every year to move troops out of land turned over to the
Palestinians. The Palestinians would get $400 million in economic
aid. But the money will only be sent if the Wye agreement is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Money and U.S. troops would likely be involved in ending the war
in Lebanon and resolving stalled talks with Syria. Syrian leaders
want the return of the Golan Heights, which Israel has occupied
since 1967 and is now home to 15,000 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, which controls Lebanon, has encouraged Hezbollah in
fighting against Israeli troops that also occupy part of that
country. Barak promised to remove Israeli troops from Lebanon
within a year. That would likely require a return of the Golan
Heights to Syria and an agreement with Syria to prevent Hezbollah
attacks into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. forces would be instrumental in enforcing the peace in the
Golan Heights and convincing Israelis they are safe.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Syrian President Hafez Assad have exchanged
surprisingly warm compliments in recent days. Again, there seems to
be a new urgency. Assad is said to be ailing and eager to restore
the Golan Heights to Syrian control.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is already planning
to visit Israel and Syria in August, and predicts, fitting for
today's high hopes, a resolution of the issues within a year.

on the yard; that would bend the grass blades) with hands on the
waistband of his baggy, stained shorts surveying his handiwork like
a lord looking over his fiefdom.
</P>
<P>
   His lip curls slightly when he sees the ragged line of his
neighbor's edging. He sneers at the coarse patches of St. Augustine
that some people dare to call their front yard. Turfman recognizes
only Bermuda grass. He grooms it into a uniform thickness and color
rivaled only by the most expensive Stainmaster plush carpet.
</P>
<P>
   He mows, then vacuums up the clippings. He has an edger and a
weed whacker. He can talk fertilizer ratios. He knows that the
wives of his neighbors point to his lawn as the perfect example.
</P>
<P>
   In suburbia, the alpha male is the one whose lawn has the
thickest turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't mow; we manicure,'' says Turfman John Wolf of Keller,
Texas. He and his teen-age son, Christopher, are the ``we.'' The
lawn groomed by team Wolf is a thing of beauty. The grass stands up
as straight as a Marine's regulation haircut, as if each blade is
combed into place. The marks left by the mower wheels are precision
mechanics. The clean edge looks laser-cut.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher is responsible for mowing. He's the one who
determines the ever-changing mowing pattern, ``so the lawn won't
get ridges from the wheels.'' This week, the front yard is mowed in
right-to-left diagonal stripes. John edges every other week. He has
a convoluted system that produces a 90-degree cut; ``You have to
protect the edge; that's key,'' John says.
</P>
<P>
   He decides when to water; almost never in the spring,
occasionally in the summer. Even though he has an automatic
sprinkler system, it is set on manual. John depends on the rain:
``Let the Lord do the watering,'' he says. Three weeks have passed
since he last turned on his sprinkler system. A thick lawn protects
the roots, and the ground stays moist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawn is my thing,'' says John, the seasoned Turfman. ``I love
to buy houses on corner lots with lots of lawn. I love to see the
grass fluffed up, to mow it, to get a clean cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher has been in Turfman training since he was old enough
to push a Fisher Price bubble mower. He graduated to the gasoline
engine when he was old enough to reach the center bar on the
mower's handle. Now he makes short work of the acre lot, mowing
every week in the spring, slowing to every 10 days in July. By next
month, he estimates, the lawn will need a trim every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   John retired from actual mowing several years ago. He may have
passed along the mower, but he is still the Turfman. The title
belongs to the mortgage holder.
</P>
<P>
   Women can claim the honor, but they don't assume the posture.
You're not likely to see a woman marching around her piece of
freshly mowed sod with that puffed chest, better-than-the-neighbors
attitude. She'll be recognized as a good gardener or as a person
who has a way with plants. She will not engender the animosity of
the people who share the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher attests to the competitive spirit of suburban grass
gardening. His father demurs, not wanting to start any local
hostilities. ``Who has a better lawn than us?'' challenges the son.
``No one,'' says the father, his chest beginning to swell.

A HALF-HORSE, HALF-DRAGON, FULL-BODIED BEER FROM JAPAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN MELTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adaptation, assimilation: Whatever you want to call it, the
Japanese are masters at borrowing from other cultures and doing
them a turn or two better.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's tea ceremony, for example, was modified from an older
Chinese version. And just ask anybody who held GM stock during the
1980s; they know all too well just how effectively Japan can adapt
and improve business and manufacturing models.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with beer. The first real brewery in Japan was
American, established in 1869 as a direct result of Admiral Perry's
little surprise ``social'' call at Tokyo Bay in 1853. It
subsequently passed into Japanese ownership and became Kirin, a
name rich with mythical associations and good tidings for the
Chinese (more borrowing).
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, this half-horse, half-dragon came to Earth,
seduced an available female and impregnated her. Their child grew
up to be Confucius. Ever since, visits by the creature are seen as
harbingers of festive events.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's largest and most efficient breweries (natch),
Tokyo-based Kirin turns out a variety of products, most of which
are readily available in America and elsewhere. Kirin beer is very
straightforward, full-bodied, smooth and pleasant in the classic
pilsner style, with a no-nonsense nose and a dry, crisp and
extremely clean finish. Heartier than domestic brews, but not quite
as thick as many Bohemian pilsners, Kirin is delightful with light,
summery foods such as pasta salads, fruits, grilled vegetables and,
of course, sushi.
</P>
<P>
   For those with an exploratory palate who want to step up from
domestic beers but not stray too far from the familiar, Kirin is a
good place to start. Enjoyable, refreshing and well-made, it'll
never replace Bud as America's most popular swill, but it's an easy
brew to enjoy after a long day of yardwork.

 POLTZ LIKES HIS LIFE AS JEWEL'S OLD FLAME/NEW(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We couldn't get Jewel on the phone, so we got the next best
thing: Her ex-boyfriend, Steve Poltz, who's opening for her.
</P>
<P>
   Poltz is a San Diego-based singer/songwriter _ style: wry humor,
sweet honesty _ who made a name for himself in the folk-rock outfit
the Rugburns. With the Rugburns on hiatus, Poltz cut his solo
debut, ``One Left Shoe,'' co-wrote Jewel's hit, ``You Were Meant
for Me'' (he also starred in the video), and is touring with her.
Five questions with him:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Weird photo.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's stupid, I know: the dejected lonely guy holding flowers.
I told the record company I liked the photo of me in a Mexican
restaurant handing someone a taco with food in my mouth and a beer
in my hand. My A&AMP;R guy was like, `Sure, Steve.' Now sad flower guy
is everywhere. It's gonna haunt me the rest of my life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Speaking of, you dated Jewel. That is so cool.
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, she was and continues to be cool. We're still great
friends. When she's onstage, she'll say, `This guy showed me so
much about music.' We used to sit around and listen to Randy Newman
and all these other people she likes now. Since I'm older, I'm
supposed to be the mature one here or whatever, but she is smarter
than me and so much more wiser.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How's it feel to be opening for her?
</P>
<P>
   A: She asked me to tour with her. Atlantic (Jewel's label) would
have stuck one of their bands on the road with her if she hadn't
said anything. It's a little tiring. I play acoustic guitar in her
band, so I get off stage to cool down for 15 minutes, then I go
right back out there. It's like the Grand Ol' Opry _ `Hey, I just
saw that guy.'
</P>
<P>
   Q: How'd y'all meet?
</P>
<P>
   A: We met seven years ago when she was 18 and I was... seven
years younger than I am now (39). I went to an open-mike night at a
coffeehouse and when I walked in, this lovely girl says, `Hi, may I
help you?' It was Jewel.
</P>
<P>
   I had a sore throat, and she made me this great tea. We started
talking about songwriting, then we wound up writing together. At
one point, she said, `How can I get a following like the Rugburns?
You guys are so popular.' It was so funny. Next thing I knew, there
were limos pulling up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Must get killer royalties for co-writing her hit, ``You Were
Meant For Me.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, my mom summed it up perfectly. She said, `You're the
only boy I know who can go on a trip to Mexico ('cuz that's where
we went on vacation) with a beautiful blonde and get paid for it
the rest of your life.''

CHRISTIAN MUSIC STAR RENEWS FAITH AFTER SCHOOL SHOOTINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many Americans, the shootings at Columbine High School in
Colorado were a horror seen from afar.
</P>
<P>
   For Steven Curtis Chapman, they hit home _ for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman, the Grammy-winning Christian superstar, is from
Paducah, Ky., site of a high school shooting in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When that happened, he participated in the funerals of three
students and returned for a benefit show, where he debuted a song
called ``With Hope.'' The song was shipped to Colorado in an effort
to console victims and their families; proceeds are earmarked for
the Neighbors Who Care ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The song is also included on Chapman's new ``Speechless'' CD.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman clearly has tragedy and change on his mind these days.
Various songs on ``Speechless'' _ his ninth studio CD _ deal with
loss and also with trying to be a good father and husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paducah was a thread that ran through the whole thing,''
Chapman said of ``Speechless'' recently. ``It had a significant
impact in the middle of things going on in my own heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Chapman says, he was ``asking what I need to be
doing as a dad and a husband and an artist. I was asking myself if
my career had become a celebrity ride, or is it what I set out for
it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings, he says, stunned him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paducah is as close to `Mayberry' as you can get,'' he says.
``For this to happen there says something about our culture. As a
dad and a concerned citizen and a man of faith, I'm asking myself
how to work through this. The majority of the songs on the CD come
out of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Chapman says, he came through with a new sense of
hope _ for himself, for his family and for America's future. He
recently testified before a U.S. House subcommittee at a hearing
called ``School Violence: Views of Students and the Community.''
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Chapman said that reversing the trend of high
school shootings will come about through being ``focused on
transforming young hearts and minds, transforming our culture and
living as role models ourselves ... I feel the real change is
meeting people with love, one-on-one, the way Jesus Christ
addressed the social ills of his day.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the phone from Knoxville, Tenn., early in the
morning after a long bus ride, he stressed that the only real
answers come from God. The past few years, he says, have only
reinforced that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sung `Amazing Grace' since I was 8 years old,'' he says,
``but this last season of my life has brought me to a new depth of
understanding how amazing God's power is and how bad the bad news
is, and how in need I am and we are of him.''

FEINSTEIN PREDICTS PATIENTS' RIGHTS WILL BE A TOP CAMPAIGN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS 10th graf with updated GOP action. Filed in ``w'' and
``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)

 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Wednesday
that the Democrats will have a strong campaign issue in the coming
election as a result of Republicans scuttling her party's proposals
to boost patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think a patients' bill of rights becomes a major campaign
issue,'' said Feinstein, who is running for reelection next year.
And, she said, ``I think it will be part of the presidential
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Her comments at a breakfast meeting with reporters came in the
wake of the Senate defeat Tuesday of Democratic proposals including
one by Feinstein that would have ensured that doctors, not health
plans, would decide if a treatment is medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Her comments were echoed by other Capitol Hill Democrats who
contend they are forcing Republicans to take politically unpopular
stances on the Senate floor opposing patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   In votes Tuesday, Senate Republicans also beat back popular
Democratic amendments that would have let women in health
maintenance organizations pick an obstetrician-gynecologist as
their primary doctor and ensure that doctors and patients have the
final say on how long women can stay in the hospital after surgery
for breast cancer. Another Democratic initiative would have
guaranteed patients insured access to emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to approve their own narrower bill on
Thursday on how to regulate managed care providers. But aides to
President Clinton have said they will recommend that he veto the
GOP version.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the Democratic proposals would lead to
escalating medical costs, increased insurance premiums and more
uninsured people.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein told reporters that the issue of reining in managed
care organizations is especially important in California. There,
she said, doctors are filing for bankruptcy and hospitals are
closing at alarming rates, but managed care providers continue to
take in large profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, there are real problems,'' she said. ``I just
saw a list of new hospitals that will close shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Republicans pushed through a proposal offered by
Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, to require health insurers to pay for
doctor-prescribed hospital stays after mastectomies. The vote was
55-45 for the measure, which, like the Democratic plan, would allow
decisions on the length of stay in such cases to be determined by
the patient and her physician. But the Democratic measure also
would have guaranteed insurance coverage of routine health care for
dying people getting treatment through clinical trials. Republicans
also planned to offer their own measure regarding access to
emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein predicted that Democrats will win at the polls next
year by blaming Republicans, not only for rejecting Democratic
patients' rights proposals, but also for killing legislation that
would have regulated tobacco companies and tightened rules on gun
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   She accused the Republicans of having a ``pro-tobacco and
anti-health care reform kind of vision'' and said, ``I think the
dominant share of Americans are on the other side of these
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   She said gun control will loom large in the campaign because of
evidence that juveniles are able to get firearms easily and bring
them into schools.
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear need, she said, for ``targeted, prudent
regulation of firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also said her own campaign fund-raising efforts for
2000 will yield about $2 million by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about speculation that she could be a vice presidential
candidate on the Democratic ticket, Feinstein downplayed the idea.
But she said, ``I think the time is right'' for a woman on the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have established that women are taking an
historically unprecedented role in politics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the speculation about her ``makes me
uncomfortable,'' because ``it builds up an expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to be U.S. senator,'' Feinstein said. ``I intend to
serve another term. ... I can't see into the future ... but I want
to be a U.S. senator from California. The probability is very
strong that I will be a U.S. senator.''

regulation of firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also said her own campaign fund-raising efforts for
2000 will yield about $2 million by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about speculation that she could be a vice presidential
candidate on the Democratic ticket, Feinstein downplayed the idea.
But she said, ``I think the time is right'' for a woman on the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have established that women are taking an
historically unprecedented role in politics,'' she said.

   ``I intend to be U.S. senator,'' Feinstein said. ``I intend to
serve another term. ... I can't see into the future ... but I want
to be a U.S. senator from California. The probability is very
strong that I will be a U.S. senator.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been 10 minutes _ time for the next police siren-loud,
multi-tattooed, rap-rock meathead band to step up to pop music's
plate and hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Now batting: Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   Even before they took a swing with their new disc, ``Significant
Other,'' the Jacksonville, Fla., quintet was already on first base:
MTV has constantly been playing the video to their ``Nookie'' song.
Just about every rock station in the country has it in heavy
rotation. And have you seen the new issue of Spin? Guess who's on
the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, Bizkit _ singer Fred Durst, guitarist Wes Borland, bassist
Sam Rivers, drummer John Otto and DJ Lethal _ is pimp with all the
hip kids, the same group of society-bites misfits who scooped up
the last Korn record and listen to Rage Against the Machine but
don't actually hear what they're saying. That would be: Most kids
in junior high.
</P>
<P>
   Although the guys in Bizkit cut themselves from the same sonic
cloth as Rage and Korn _ grinding guitars, stop/start tempos,
shredding vocals, hip-hop scratches _ they lack the integrity of
those bands. You may not like them, but at least Korn has
interesting things to say about society's ills and Rage has plenty
to say about, well, everything else.
</P>
<P>
   What's on the minds of Limp Bizkit? Nookie. No nookie.
Ex-girlfriends. Hanging with homies. Being mad at stuff. Being
really mad at stuff. It's so hard being white in a white world,
isn't it, fellas?
</P>
<P>
   You have to give these guys a bit of credit: Rap-metal is all
the Rage right now, and with Korn off the road, their timing
couldn't be better. Someone has to fill the thrash-hop gap. Someone
has to offer a soundtrack to knocking each other's heads off in the
mosh pit. Someone's gotta make a mil by being mediocre. Why not
these guys?
</P>
<P>
   But, as Borland said in the Spin interview, he's not even sure
if Bizkit's any good: ``To tell you the truth, if I wasn't in the
band, I don't know if I'd buy our album or not.''

 &HT;    VETERANS SECRETARY OVERSPENT TRAVEL BUDGET
 &HT;    330&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Veterans Affairs Secretary Togo D. West Jr. has
told Congress that he will overspend his office travel budget by
$60,000 this year, even as his department is making plans to lay
off hundreds of health care workers.
</P>
<P>
   West, who has been under fire from veterans groups for failing
to be a vigorous advocate for his agency in budget battles, told
the House Appropriations Committee that he has transferred funds
from aides' travel accounts to add to his own $201,000 travel
allowance for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, West chartered an Air Force C-20 executive jet to
travel with seven aides to Anchorage, Alaska. Travel documents
obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show the flight's
cost was budgeted at $60,000, close to one-third of the secretary's
annual travel budget, for the three-day journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boils down mainly to convenience,'' a department spokesman,
John Hanson, said in explaining why West, who usually travels
commercially or by scheduled military flights, decided to use a
charter.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson said that the actual cost of the Alaska flight charged to
the department turned out to be under $30,000, because President
Clinton asked West to return via Casper, Wyoming, where he attended
the funeral of a gay student murdered in a hate crime. Hanson said
another federal agency paid for the return flight.
</P>
<P>
   West and his aides, including two security officers, were also
reimbursed for out-of-pocket costs for the Alaska trip, during
which the secretary gave the keynote address to the Alaska
Federation of Natives Convention. He also toured a veterans
hospital and visited with VA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the trip have added on pressure on West, who
plans to depart his post but who has sent conflicting messages
about the timing. ``He has pledged to be here through fall,''
Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance in Sarasota, Fla., last week, West said that he
had neither submitted a resignation nor had been asked to do so,
the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Reports of excess travel spending have not helped West's weak
standing among key veterans' groups, who are blaming him for
Clinton administration budgets that have proposed no increase for
the VA for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything else in the system squeezed dry, I think it
calls into question the judgment of making those expenditures,''
Richard Fuller, national legislative director for Paralyzed
Veterans of America, said of the secretary's travel costs. ``It is
bad, if those expenditures are not justifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   West, a former secretary of the Army, has been serving in as VA
head since January 1998. He has had increasingly rocky relations
with Congress, where he has been criticized for being too
disengaged from his department and unresponsive to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   At a House veterans subcommittee hearing last April, members
expressed displeasure over West's inability to provide basic
answers on health care policies at veterans hospitals, many of
which are undergoing drastic changes and staff reductions amid
restructuring and budget restraints.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers complained that he had failed to respond to their
inquiries and that he once left a letter from several members
unanswered for three months.

WHAT'S A FEW MILLISECONDS BETWEEN FRIENDS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   c.1999 The Boston Globe   Last April I
wrote a column about Bell Atlantic's new high-speed DSL (Digital
Subscriber Loop) service. In that column, I criticized the speed of
the connection from Bell Atlantic's ISP (www.bellatlantic.net) to
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Using my cable modem in
Cambridge, I wrote, I routinely see round-trip times between Media
One and MIT of 2 to 4 milliseconds. But using Bell Atlantic's DSL
service, I was seeing times of 100 to 200 milliseconds.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day the article was published, a reader sent me a terse
e-mail from his WebTV account. ``Found it astonishing that you
found differences in thousands of seconds not only worth
mentioning, but actually significant! Gosh! How many actual human
users will (care) if one connection takes a smaller fraction of a
second to access the Web? Please!''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the difference between the two connections _
roughly 1/10 of a second _ can be quite noticeable. That's because
delays on the Internet frequently cascade. A few thousandths of a
second here and a few thousandths of a second there can often add
up to delays of a dozen seconds or more. The reason for this
seemingly nonsensical addition has to do with the fact that
information is sent over the Internet in little packets of data,
and that sometimes these packets get lost.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to visualize a packet on the Internet, think of a
postcard moving through the US Postal Service. Each packet has the
address of the person (or computer) that sent it, its destination,
and a little bit of data. Typically packets have between 100 and
500 characters. It might take 100 or more packets to send even a
small photograph across the Internet. I tried downloading the
entire boston.com home page Sunday night; that took 255 packets.
</P>
<P>
   Because packets sometimes get lost, the data sent in each packet
has to be acknowledged after it is received. The time between when
a packet is sent and the acknowledgement is received is the
round-trip time, or latency, that I wrote about in my April column.
And naturally, if a packet is lost, it needs to be sent again.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, designers of the Internet protocol came up with
some clever tricks so each packet doesn't have to be acknowledged
before the next one is sent. Nevertheless, the round-trip time and
the packet loss between your computer and a Web server is usually a
good indication of just how snappy theserver will feel when you are
browsing its pages. When delays are less than 50 milliseconds and
packet loss is less than 2 percent, Web pages seem to come up in an
instant. Delays of more than 500 milliseconds or packet losses of
more than 10 percent generally make you feel like you are surfing
through molasses.
</P>
<P>
   You can measure the latency and packet loss of your own Internet
connections using a program called ``ping,'' which is built into
Windows 95. Just open an MS-DOS Prompt window and type ``ping''
followed by the name of another computer on the Internet, such as
``ping web.mit.edu.'' If you use a Macintosh, two programs that you
can use are Finger and MacPing. Be aware that some Web servers,
including boston.com, block ``ping'' packets.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, programs like ``ping'' only let you look at one
path over the Internet at a time. To get an overall feeling for the
system as a whole you might want to look at one of the growing
number of Internet Weather Reports. These services look at Internet
traffic the way a helicopter might report on the Central Artery.
The University of California at Los Angeles runs a particularly
informative Internet weather service at
http://www.noc.ucla.edu/networking/weather.html. For a nationwide
overview, check out the MIDS weather report at
http://www.internetweather.com/. There is also the Internet Traffic
Report, at http://www.internettraffic.com/, run by Andover.NET in
Acton.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that all of these traffic and weather services are
really looking at the popular Internet ``backbone'' connections in
a given metropolitan area _ they don't necessarily look at the
particular Internet links that your packets will be traveling.
Boston might be having a bad Internet traffic day, for example, but
if your ISP has private links to New York, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C., or San Jose, you might never see a blip.
</P>
<P>
   So that's why in April I was concerned about the differences of
a few thousandths of a second between the Internet connections
offered by Media One and by Bell Atlantic. It may not seem like
much, but there are times when a few thousandths of a second can
make all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   For the record
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when I wrote about Connected Online Backup
(http://www.connected.com/), I should have mentioned that Connected
is just one of several on-line backup systems. If you are
considering an on-line backup system, you should also look at
(at)Backup ($99/year for 100MB of storage, http://www.backup.com);
Atrieva ($14.99/month for 1,000MB of storage,
http://www.i-filezone.com/); and Safeguard Interactive ($9.95 month
for unlimited storage; http://www.sgii.com). Each company offers
slightly different services and pricing models, so if you are
seriously shopping, it pays to look around.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a few weeks ago I wrote about Power Quest's new Lost and
Found data-recovery tool. I said that one of its advantages was
that you could purchase it after your computer suffered a hard disk
crash, since Lost and Found runs off floppy disks. Programs such as
Norton Utilities, I wrote, need to be purchased and installed
before you need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not entirely true,'' says Sherri Walkenhorst, from
Norton's public relations firm. ``Norton Utilities 4.0 has an
emergency floppy disk and bootable CD feature that allows users to
run some of the utilities `after the fact' _ i.e., you can go down
to the store and buy a copy of NU after you've accidentally deleted
a file and still be able to recover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although I still prefer Lost and Found for serious data recovery
tasks, Walkenhorst is right and I stand corrected.

(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   Commercekey, an Internet start-up,
has come up with a business plan with a new wrinkle in the crowded
electronic commerce market. In addition to peddling software and
transaction services to help businesses set up shop on the Web, the
company, with roots in the Greek shipping industry, has its own
world-class fleet of cargo vessels standing by to deliver
customers' merchandise around the world.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The company, which is based in New York and plans to announce
itself later this week, is a joint venture between two Greek
industrial giants, Vardinoyannis Group of Cos. and Leventis Group.
Together, the two companies give Commercekey access to a huge fleet
of freighters along with a network of climate-controlled warehouses
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Owning its own fleet of vessels could help Commercekey clear one
of the big hurdles in electronic commerce: distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come from a tradition of merchants and bottlers,'' said
Alkiviades David, president and chief executive of Commercekey,
whose family has a major stake in Leventis.
</P>
<P>
   Vardinoyannis owns the biggest oil refinery in Greece, Motor Oil
Hellas, along with numerous television stations, newspapers and
Internet service providers. Leventis, meanwhile, is Greece's
primary Coca-Cola distributor and also owns an Internet
telecommunications network in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   David and Demosthenes Vardinoyannis, Commercekey's chairman, met
while they were in high school in Switzerland many years ago. The
idea for Commercekey grew, in part, out of a video conferencing
venture David had started years ago; that technology has become a
component of Commercekey's service offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Together the two companies have invested an initial $12.5
million in the U.S. arm of Commercekey, and they plan to take the
company public early next year.

   High Technology for Money Management
</P>
<P>
   You may not be a Silicon Valley gazillionaire, but here is your
chance to manage your money like one.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Clark, the entrepreneurial engineer behind Silicon
Graphics, Netscape and, most recently, Healtheon, has quietly
embarked on his fourth start-up. It's a company focused on
simplifying the financial affairs of wealthy individuals _ or
anybody else willing to pay for the service.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, called MyCFO, grew out of Clark's own need for a
personal chief financial officer to handle his affairs and track
his investments. ``It was totally out of control,'' said Clark,
whose net worth is an estimated $500 million. (Tax time was
particularly difficult, he said.)
</P>
<P>
   So about two years ago, Clark hired Harvey Armstrong, a former
KPMG manager, who came up with a Web-based system that supplies
Clark and his various financial consultants with access to all of
Clark's financial records. Late last year they decided to found a
company on the concept.
</P>
<P>
   MyCFO (www.mycfo.com), whose clients include John Chambers,
chief executive of Cisco Systems, already has some 20 employees,
including four financial managers, and offices across the street
from the Silicon Graphics headquarters in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With all his recent successes, including the recent $5.5 billion
merger of Healtheon with another online health information service,
WebMD, Clark appears to have had no trouble finding investors. The
list includes Chambers, the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins
Caufield &AMP; Byers, and Thomas Jermoluk, chairman and chief executive
of Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is acting chief executive and chairman of the company,
while Armstrong is acting president, although Clark hopes to hire
an outsider to be chief executive and president by the fall. At
that point, Armstrong would become the lead financial consultant
for MyCFO.

those intergalactic ``Star Wars'' heroes wielding light sabers? Yes
_ at least in the world of video games.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of wrestling-related video games from January through May
increased by 23 percent, to $60 million, over the comparable period
last year, according to NPD Group, a Port Washington, N.Y.,
research group. That increase outpaced the growth of video-game
sales generally, which grew 14 percent, to $1.9 billion during the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the launch of `Star Wars' in May, wrestling-related
merchandise will likely be among the industry's best sellers when
final numbers are released at year end,'' said Ed Roth, president
of NPD Leisure Activities, a Glen Cove, N.Y., research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Bell, a publicist for THQ Inc., said wrestling-related video
games ``have been frighteningly successful.'' THQ publishes three
of this year's best-selling titles: ``WCW/NWO Thunder'' for Sony's
Playstation, the top wrestling title; ``WCW/NWO Revenge'' for
Nintendo 64; and ``WCW Nitro'' for Nintendo, Playstation and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is the featured character in ``WWF War Zone'' by Acclaim,
one of the year's best-selling titles.
</P>
<P>
   If the strong pace of sales keeps up, few wrestlers may be
tempted to follow the path of their former colleague Jesse ``the
Body'' Ventura into the political arena. Who needs the governor's
mansion, when there's a shot at becoming a lead character in a
Playstation title?

RESEARCH SHOWS SEARCH ENGINES LAG AMID EXPANDING NET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RYAN DAVIS   c.1999 The Boston Globe   As the World Wide Web
expands at a staggering rate, search engines are failing to keep
up, according to a study released Wednesday by two New Jersey
researchers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The researchers estimate that the Web more than doubled in size
between December 1997 and February 1999, but major search engines _
services that probe the Web and provide links to sites matching key
words _ combine to cover less than half of the available cyber
information.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 11 major Internet search engines covers even
one-sixth of the Web's estimated 800 million publicly accessible
pages, according to the study in the journal Nature by Steve
Lawrence and C. Lee Giles of NEC Research Institute in Princeton.
That figure is down from about one-third just 14 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search engines are finding the Web very difficult to
manage,'' Giles said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted in February, found Cambridge-based Northern
Light to be the most expansive engine and Waltham-based Lycos and
Euroseek the least. About 85 percent of Web browsers use search
engines to locate information, they wrote. The study also found
that it may take months for new pages to be recognized by search
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Rajive Mathur, Lycos's director of search services, said his
company's database is five times as large as represented in the
study. Some of the growth has come since the study was completed,
spokesman Brian Payea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``February 1999 is a long time ago in the Internet world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers entered 1,050 queries and analyzed the responses
of search engines. They found the return rates of the engines and
compared them to Northern Light, which said it had indexed 128
million _ or 16 percent _ of the estimated 800 million pages.
</P>
<P>
   Giles said his research indicates that ``catch-all'' search
engines are becoming increasingly inadequate for the sophisticated
Web user. Those users are looking for more specialized information
_ such as science studies _ than Joe Internet, who is logging on
for a cyber test drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't all drive the same kind of car,'' Giles said. The
all-inclusive search may go the way of the Model T, he said. The
concept will last, he said, but there is a growing market for
services that find specialized information, such as the lowest
price for a book.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Web's expansion, Giles said, can be traced to
electronic commerce. He was startled to find that 83 percent of
servers _ which house hundreds of Web sites _ have commercial
content.
</P>
<P>
   New pages are being added to the Web at a clip of 3 million a
day, but the study found that, on average, it took more than six
months for a major search engine to find new documents matching a
given query.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers specifically cited updating scientific
information as an area that would greatly improve the lagging
search engines. Research articles are often available on the Web
much sooner than in traditional databases, they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``An index of all scientific information on the Web would be
feasible and very valuable,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence and Giles conducted a similar study in December 1997
using six search engines. During that study, they estimated the
size of the Web at only 320 million pages. The Web will continue to
grow, but the pace will likely slow, Giles said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 study, the researchers found HotBot covered 34
percent of the pages and the engines combined covered about 60
percent of the Web. Lycos purchased HotBot last year, but continues
to run it as an independent search engine.
</P>
<P>
   The new study found the overlap between engines remains
relatively low, and the major engines combine to cover 42 percent
of the Web, they wrote. Search sites such as MetaCrawler that
combine the results of multiple engines provide a great deal more
coverage, they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Next after Northern Light were Snap and AltaVista, which covered
15.5 percent of the Web. HotBot covered 11.3 percent; Microsoft,
8.5 percent; Infoseek, 8 percent; Google, 7.8 percent; Yahoo, 7.4
percent; Excite, 5.6 percent; Lycos, 2.5 percent, and Euroseek, 2.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   He said the widely used search engines are not indexing more
because it does not help them make more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true for a lot of companies,'' said Marc Krellenstein,
Northern Light's chief technical officer. ``But it's not our
feeling. We've had a goal from the beginning to have a
comprehensive database.''

FTC RECOMMENDS CONGRESS HOLD OFF ON PRIVACY LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (lh) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   WASHINGTON _
While finding that the online industry has a long way to go in
protecting the privacy of consumers, the Federal Trade Commission
has approved a report recommending that Congress hold off on
legislation to regulate how companies can collect and use consumer
data.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The report, approved 3-1 by the commission, was a victory for
industry groups that have been scrambling for the last year and
half to avert privacy legislation. They have made a case for
self-regulation, encouraging companies to declare policies that
allow consumers to choose and control the information collected
about them over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Varney, a former federal trade commissioner who is now
a legal counsel to the Online Privacy Alliance, a group of Internet
and technology companies that was formed a year ago when the
commission threatened to seek legislation, said, ``I think it does
reflect that the industry has done an enormous amount of work over
the last year and a half and we are on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates insist that the latest surveys of the
privacy practices of online marketers _ and the commission report
itself _ prove that self-regulation is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is plenty of evidence that self-regulation has
not worked,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, a civil liberties advocacy
group. ``What these privacy policies are telling people is how much
privacy they don't have. The consequence as a legal matter is
expectations of privacy in the online world continue to decline.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was not without criticism of the industry. Indeed, it
cites a survey this spring by Georgetown University showing that
while 66 percent of Web sites now post privacy policies _ up from
14 percent a year earlier _ only 10 percent also follow the
commission's criteria for protecting personal information, giving
consumers choice and control over such information and a form of
redress if it is misused.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The self-regulatory initiatives described above reflect
industry leaders' substantial effort and commitment to fair
information practices,'' the report states. But it goes on to say
that ``only a small minority of commercial Web sites have joined
these programs to date.''
</P>
<P>
   The report will be officially submitted on Tuesday at a hearing
of the House Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and
consumer protection, at which trade commission members and others
on both sides of the privacy issue are expected to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Edward Markey of
Massachusetts, says he intends to introduce an online privacy
``bill of rights'' to protect consumer control over personal data.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the commission, denied that its
conclusions were in conflict. ``Responsible elements of the
Internet community have begun to do what they set out to do,'' he
said. ``On the other hand, just putting a notice on the Internet
about a privacy policy is not all the protection that consumers
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said the commission would continue to closely monitor
online privacy. And the report lays out an agenda for public
workshops and task forces of industry, privacy and consumer groups
to make sure the progress continues.
</P>
<P>
   It also promises another review of Web site privacy practices,
probably in another year, Pitofsky said, emphasizing not just the
adoption of policies but their substance, monitoring and
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes a year after the commission released the first
survey on Web site privacy practices and won approval of
legislation requiring Web sites that collect information from
children to get parents' permission. It also warned that it would
seek legislation regulating the use of personal information
collected from adults if substantial progress was not made.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 UNDATED: payment deadlines. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And that delay brings up the question of the ``float'' and why
there's more of a float in electronic banking. In banking terms, a
float is the period between the time you issue a check and the time
it becomes available to the recipient. If you issue a check to an
out-of-state recipient, the money will not be credited to the
account of that company or person for up to five business days
after the check gets to the recipient's bank. A recipient in the
same state gets access to the money in up to three business days
after it is deposited, while someone with an account at the same
bank will get the money within one business day.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a regular checking account and issue a check, the
money won't be deducted until it is presented to your bank by the
recipient's bank for payment. But for many electronic accounts, the
bank automatically debits your online account soon after you hit
the button to instruct the bank to issue a check out of your
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The float is a big psychological issue for a lot of people,''
said Jim Bruene, editor of Online Banking Report, an industry
newsletter. ``The tighter someone's funds are, the more he or she
relies on it. None of this is very meaningful when you're making 2
percent interest on cash balances.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some organization _ sometimes a bank, sometimes a
check-processing company _ is able to hang onto your money for the
length of the float means that it can make money off your money, in
very short-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a payment is taken out of an online account right
away, that doesn't necessarily mean that the recipient of the money
is paid quickly. For example, Philip Goodman, a film and video
producer in Manhattan, paid a friend $25 out of his Chase Online
checking account. His checking account was debited quickly, but the
money did not show up in the recipient's account for three days,
Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's electronic, but it's not,'' he complained.
``They debit your account and then send a check. I can send a
check!''
</P>
<P>
   Most online banks use third-party check consolidators like
Checkfree to process the checks from online accounts, send them
along and disburse the money. In those cases, the bank pays
Checkfree the amount of the check, and Checkfree pays the company
or person receiving the check.
</P>
<P>
   If the check recipient is set up to receive payments
electronically, through a process known as electronic transfer, the
payments move through an automated clearing-house system within 24
hours, said Matthew Lewis, a senior vice president at Checkfree.
</P>
<P>
   But if the recipient is not set up to receive payments
electronically, Checkfree mails a check to the recipient's bank,
where it is processed in a transaction that can take up to five
business days if the payment crosses state lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is not sure about online banking's effect on
the float. ``We've tried to do what we can to manage float, but
whatever happens with the electronic technology is still an unknown
at this point,'' said Doug Tillet, a spokesman for the New York
Federal Reserve Bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Knowing that money is paid out of an account right away can help
online customers if they want to make last-minute electronic
payments, he added. If the recipient of a payment is set up to
receive electronic transfers, most online banking customers can
issue a payment at, say, 4:59 p.m. on the day the payment is due
and won't have to allow for mail delivery times.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bank Rate Monitor, an online service that tracks
interest rates for credit cards and personal loans offered by major
banks, at least 215 of the 350 largest Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.-insured banks in the country offer the ability to pay bills
electronically. But bill consolidators like Checkfree are also
providing electronic payment services to nontraditional banks on
the Internet, which means your choice of where on the Internet to
pay your bills is becoming a lot broader. Internet-only banks can
be a good choice for people who keep a lot of money in their
checking accounts because they generally pay higher interest, but
they also tend to charge higher fees for automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Personal and business financial software like Quicken and
Microsoft Money offer an electronic bill-paying option via
Checkfree. Customers can also use such software, which gives a user
an overall financial picture, with many types of online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bill payments, Checkfree and other consolidators,
like Transpoint and Cybercash, are also working with banks and
other financial sites to bring your bills and account information
to you online.
</P>
<P>
   With its E-card, First U.S.A., a leading credit card issuer,
offers customers online access to detailed information about their
credit card purchases as well as the ability to pay their bills
online. Many banks are finding ways to let customers see their
bills online as a way of offering better service than the
nontraditional banking competitors who are zeroing in on their
business.
</P>
<P>
   A type of bill-presentment service was recently announced by
Chase Manhattan Bank, First Union and Wells Fargo; they are forming
a new company that will enable people and businesses to both
receive and pay bills electronically. The company, called the
Exchange, will serve as an electronic hub that will allow companies
issuing bills to reach consumers through their financial
institutions. Consumers will be able to log on to their online
banking site and view lists of their outstanding bills, said Sharon
Osberg, executive vice president for financial services at Wells
Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   The three banks will have a customer base of 60 million and
almost 60,000 corporations, said Wendy Grover, a spokeswoman for
Wells Fargo. Ms. Osberg added that by the time the Exchange is
fully up and running next year, all electronic payments will be
settled on the day they are issued, effectively eliminating any
float.
</P>
<P>
   But whether an electronic overdue notice will be easier to
ignore than a piece of paper that says ``account past due'' in red
letters on it remains to be seen.

 UNDATED: he added.  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most cable and DSL modems also make it easier for hackers to go
after specific computers.
</P>
<P>
   In dial-up systems, the addresses belong to the service
provider's modems, rather than to its customers. When customers
dial in for a connection, each one gets an IP address of the modem
reached for that session; each modem is associated with a finite
number of IP addresses. The next time the computer may well connect
with another modem and get another address, particularly if the
customer has a large service provider operating huge banks of
modems. ``To some extent that's security through obscurity,''
McElearney said.
</P>
<P>
   For cable-modem and DSL customers, not only are their addresses
fixed, they are also often easy to learn. The addresses appear in
the headers (which usually aren't displayed) that travel with every
e-mail message or newsgroup posting customers send.
</P>
<P>
   Many service providers have begun to respond to the problem.
Some, including Road Runner, are introducing a system that
regularly rotates their customers' IP addresses. Addresses based on
this system, however, may not change for several days and will
still appear in the headers.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus is also distressed about one unintended side effect of the
steep decline in computer prices. Inexpensive PCs increasingly mean
that some families now own several computers, all of which can be
serviced by a single high-speed line. To take advantage of that,
some people are setting up mini-networks in their homes, with one
computer acting as the go-between to the Internet for all the
others.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy server software that makes that possible, however,
often has very flawed security measures, Klaus said. To obscure
their identities, sophisticated hackers will first log into a home
network software before launching an attack against their ultimate
target. Junk-mail spammers can resort to the same trick. In either
case, the result can be highly embarrassing for the unsuspecting
home network owner, who will appear to be the originator of the
hacking or spam.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there is not a straightforward answer to the question
of how to guarantee security while enjoying high-speed Internet
connections. For Larry Rogers, who tracks Internet security
problems at Carnegie Mellon University's CERT Coordination Center,
part of the solution is simply hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with these connections need to play systems
administrator,'' he said. ``It's a matter of vigilance.''
</P>
<P>
   That vigilance can include something as simple as having Windows
users make sure that Network Neighborhood _ a file-sharing system _
is turned off. Rogers also suggested steps like regularly
downloading software security patches from Microsoft's Web site or
modifying arcane portions of the operating system. Not
surprisingly, these are just the kind of housekeeping tasks that
many users somehow never get around to.
</P>
<P>
   Some software companies are offering their help. In May,
Sybergen Networks (www.sygate.com), which mostly makes corporate
security protection software, introduced a $29.95 software package
for home users called Syshield. Similar products include Conseal
Private Desktop by Signal 9 Solutions (www.signal9.com).
</P>
<P>
   Such software generally blocks the computer from receiving some
types of data, limiting the paths in for hacker. Syshield can also
be set up to in effect disconnect the computer from the Internet
late at night.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate protection is that now used by Keeney, who has
become a computer-security consultant since his 1997 attack. He has
copied, on a much smaller scale, the system used by most
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   All his Internet business now runs on a network with a single
computer operating as a firewall and using the Linux software
system. Because it is difficult for hackers to get past the
firewall computer in such set-ups, that computer acts as a
sacrificial lamb of sorts. Keeney freely admits, however, that most
home users are unlikely to adopt such a complex setup.
</P>
<P>
   If the speculation in the industry is correct, they may never
have to. Many believe that ``security appliances'' _ extremely
stripped-down computers with security software that sit between
another computer and its Internet connection _ may eventually hit
the consumer market. Such systems for business users are already
available.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, another answer would simply be to put up with the
slow speeds and petty annoyances of a dial-in modem. But for anyone
but the more basic e-mail user, Klaus does not think that is a
great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many benefits that outweigh the security risks,
provided you take precautions,'' he said. To prove his point, Klaus
added that he was now shopping for cable modem service for his
home.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been 10 minutes _ time for the next police siren-loud,
multi-tattooed, rap-rock meathead band to step up to pop music's
plate and hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Now batting: Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   Even before they took a swing with their new disc, ``Significant
Other,'' the Jacksonville, Fla., quintet was already on first base:
MTV has constantly been playing the video to their ``Nookie'' song.
Just about every rock station in the country has it in heavy
rotation. And have you seen the new issue of Spin? Guess who's on
the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, Bizkit _ singer Fred Durst, guitarist Wes Borland, bassist
Sam Rivers, drummer John Otto and DJ Lethal _ is pimp with all the
hip kids, the same group of society-bites misfits who scooped up
the last Korn record and listen to Rage Against the Machine but
don't actually hear what they're saying. That would be: Most kids
in junior high.
</P>
<P>
   Although the guys in Bizkit cut themselves from the same sonic
cloth as Rage and Korn _ grinding guitars, stop/start tempos,
shredding vocals, hip-hop scratches _ they lack the integrity of
those bands. You may not like them, but at least Korn has
interesting things to say about society's ills and Rage has plenty
to say about, well, everything else.
</P>
<P>
   What's on the minds of Limp Bizkit? Nookie. No nookie.
Ex-girlfriends. Hanging with homies. Being mad at stuff. Being
really mad at stuff. It's so hard being white in a white world,
isn't it, fellas?
</P>
<P>
   You have to give these guys a bit of credit: Rap-metal is all
the Rage right now, and with Korn off the road, their timing
couldn't be better. Someone has to fill the thrash-hop gap. Someone
has to offer a soundtrack to knocking each other's heads off in the
mosh pit. Someone's gotta make a mil by being mediocre. Why not
these guys?
</P>
<P>
   But, as Borland said in the Spin interview, he's not even sure
if Bizkit's any good: ``To tell you the truth, if I wasn't in the
band, I don't know if I'd buy our album or not.''

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been 10 minutes _ time for the next police siren-loud,
multi-tattooed, rap-rock meathead band to step up to pop music's
plate and hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Now batting: Limp Bizkit.
</P>
<P>
   Even before they took a swing with their new disc, ``Significant
Other,'' the Jacksonville, Fla., quintet was already on first base:
MTV has constantly been playing the video to their ``Nookie'' song.
Just about every rock station in the country has it in heavy
rotation. And have you seen the new issue of Spin? Guess who's on
the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, Bizkit _ singer Fred Durst, guitarist Wes Borland, bassist
Sam Rivers, drummer John Otto and DJ Lethal _ is pimp with all the
hip kids, the same group of society-bites misfits who scooped up
the last Korn record and listen to Rage Against the Machine but
don't actually hear what they're saying. That would be: Most kids
in junior high.
</P>
<P>
   Although the guys in Bizkit cut themselves from the same sonic
cloth as Rage and Korn _ grinding guitars, stop/start tempos,
shredding vocals, hip-hop scratches _ they lack the integrity of
those bands. You may not like them, but at least Korn has
interesting things to say about society's ills and Rage has plenty
to say about, well, everything else.
</P>
<P>
   What's on the minds of Limp Bizkit? Nookie. No nookie.
Ex-girlfriends. Hanging with homies. Being mad at stuff. Being
really mad at stuff. It's so hard being white in a white world,
isn't it, fellas?
</P>
<P>
   You have to give these guys a bit of credit: Rap-metal is all
the Rage right now, and with Korn off the road, their timing
couldn't be better. Someone has to fill the thrash-hop gap. Someone
has to offer a soundtrack to knocking each other's heads off in the
mosh pit. Someone's gotta make a mil by being mediocre. Why not
these guys?
</P>
<P>
   But, as Borland said in the Spin interview, he's not even sure
if Bizkit's any good: ``To tell you the truth, if I wasn't in the
band, I don't know if I'd buy our album or not.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    The scoop: News on Internet might not be fit to print
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Be suspicious of anything I say about newspapers and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   After all, I've been around both for a long time, and sometimes
a guy can spend so much time in his own back yard that he no longer
notices the trees there. But, given that warning, I'm going to stay
in my own back yard today.
</P>
<P>
   It's on my mind because a lot of smart people, even folks in my
own business whom I respect, worry that somehow the Web and all the
news sites there have turned the newspaper into some sort of a
dinosaur, doddering around on its last legs, dying slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is simple and logical. In the old days, it was
difficult-to-impossible for individuals and poorly funded small
start-ups to create a competing newspaper. Marketing people would _
in their own jargon _ say that the barrier was cost of entry. In
plain English, it means that the cost of starting a conventional
print newspaper from scratch is so high that it creates a barrier
most people can't cross.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came the Web. All of a sudden, anyone could get a Web
site, put news on it and call that operation an electronic
newspaper. Instead of a big printing press and trucks to deliver
the paper and staffs of thousands, they needed an Internet
connection, the ability to type and some news to publish. And,
since defining news is like defining love (it is whatever it seems
to be to the person involved), that part was easy.
</P>
<P>
   So, understandably I think, bosses at newspapers started to
worry _ with that barrier down _ that the days of traditional
newspapers were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, maybe you've noticed this yourself, but sometimes the
bosses are wrong. This is one of those times.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy a newspaper, you're paying for a lot more than the
printing press and all those trucks. What you are buying _ and I
know this sounds corny, but a lot of true things do sound that way
_ are the services of professionals with ethical standards. While
you may see newspapers as biased and often wrong (lots of people
do), you'd have to hang out at one for 30 years or so _ and I've
done that _ to see just how seriously most newspaper folks treat
their task of presenting the news accurately and fairly. They often
do it imperfectly, but the real marvel of a newspaper is how often
it is done right.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, as with airline pilots, lawyers and doctors, plenty of
mistakes are made, and there is the normal distribution of idiots
and jerks. But maybe that's a good comparison. While there are
undoubtedly physicians who are stump dumb and others who are evil,
you'd still rather take pot luck with a physician if you need
medical help than seeking out your neighbor who had just finished
the ``Brain Surgery for Dummies'' book.
</P>
<P>
   And now we're getting to one of my real fears about the Web.
I'll start by acknowledging that there are all sorts of wonderful
sites, filled with information you can access seven days a week, 24
hours a day. And newspapers aren't alone in seeing others step into
their traditional roles. You'll find information and advice for
law, medicine, fixing the drain in the kitchen sink and even coping
with your neurotic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   That scares me. Let's create a perfect world where every one of
these sites is manned by really smart and decent people who do
their best. Even then, if I had a serious need for legal, medical
or plumbing help, I'd call a professional. And, when you consider
that the world is not a perfect place, and that some of the bad
information on the Web is presented just as slickly as the good
information, well ... what a mess.
</P>
<P>
   The day may come when a computer can fix a leaky pipe, cover the
news professionally or create an airtight legal document. But that
day is not here. So, enjoy this new world of instant information
but also avoid the temptation to think that everything that looks
good is good.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Yahoo policy crosses property lines
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ This week, a huge Internet battle was resolved
and if you publish or plan to self-publish on the Web, its
implications will affect you.
</P>
<P>
   The fight started in June when Yahoo changed the terms of its
service policy on Geocities.com, the Web hosting site it now owns.
The new service policy transferred Yahoo's own policies onto
Geocities. The policy, which created an instant uproar in the
Geocities community read, in part, ``By submitting Content to any
Yahoo property, you automatically grant Yahoo the royalty-free,
perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive and full sublicensable right
and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate''
Web pages submitted.
</P>
<P>
   Translated into English, the policy says that Yahoo would own
anything people publish on their own sites _ including original
content, graphics, text and video posted on personal Web pages _
and could use it for whatever Yahoo wanted to, royalty-free.
</P>
<P>
   Web authors, a group notoriously vocal in their efforts to
protect their right to post family vacation photos on the Web
without having to cower to The Man, started a boycott of Yahoo.
Their main point of contention was that the policy was retroactive:
it affected content that had already been created and posted as
well as future Web creations.
</P>
<P>
   The Geocities watchdogs went into action, creating a Boycott
Yahoo Web site and altering their Geocities pages to make them
gray, which they called the ``Haunting of Geocities.''
</P>
<P>
   They advised Net activists to use other search engines and to
repost their sites using other free Web hosts that compete against
Geocities. Suddenly, Yahoo was in the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the Internet company recognized the error of its
ways and changed its policy. In an open letter addressed to
``Homesteaders,'' the company said it made a mistake, trying to
merge the terms of services for two companies into one.
</P>
<P>
   The Boycott Yahoo site announced ``It's Over!'' and the Haunting
of Geocities became the Rehabitation of Geocities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the resolution, the Yahoo flap is an important lesson in
the increasingly complex issue of copyright law on the Internet.
There are a few absolutes: If you use your company's computer for
e-mail and you check it on company time, chances are you don't own
it and you have no privacy. If you create Web content for a company
as a full-time worker, you don't own what you write. And you
generally give up your rights of ownership on e-mail you receive
using a free Web-based mail service. After all, the information is
housed on their server and you're using their resources to log in.
That's part of the agreement you sign when you log in.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the creative author of a work is the legal copyright
owner, but what about republishing rights and the right to use user
pages to promote a site such as Yahoo? Could Yahoo reprint
Geocities Web sites on a CD-ROM, for instance, as an archive?
</P>
<P>
   Joe Dreitler, an intellectual property lawyer specializing in
trademarks and the Internet, says questions like this will continue
to arise as more people publish on the Web, and many more cases
will erupt as companies try to establish boundaries on what belongs
to them and what belongs to users.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one example of the stickiness on issues of ownership on
the Internet,'' said Dreitler, who works for Vorys, Sater, Seymour
and Pease in Columbus, Ohio. ``In the Yahoo case, they argued that
they have a role in the creation of the work because they make the
technical adjustments that go into it. But if all they're doing is
posting it up on the Web, that's a fairly aggressive position. The
owner under copyright law is the person who creates the work _ that
in my opinion is the person who sits down at the computer and
creates a Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   The best defense against such problems, Dreitler said, is to
read the fine print _ the sometimes convoluted service agreements
you're asked to agree to when you sign up for a free Web service or
when you install new software.
</P>
<P>
   Many users don't read the agreements and don't know what rights
they're giving up. For instance, buying a copy of Microsoft Word
doesn't entitle you to ownership of the software _ only a license
to use it. It's all in the license agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people don't read that, they never do,'' Dreitler said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yahoo case, the boycott was justified _ the rules were
changed long after the game was being played. But as an increasing
amount of our time and work goes online, it's important to know
what we own and what we don't.

 CHRON  
Editors Note: This special Millennium issue consists of
introductory lede by San Francisco Chronicle Food Editor Michael
Bauer with two main stories.  APOCALYPSE CHOW: Will a brave new world mean dining on pills? Or 
 will the next millennium renew the pleasures of the hearth?  
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  We've seen the future of food _ and it's here. But
what does that mean exactly? One group of prognosticators is
convinced that in a few years we're all going to be swallowing
pills and getting an intravenous fix to take care of our nutrient
requirements. No food to be consumed; no dishes to be washed.
 &HT;    Talk to the other camp and you may be convinced that we're going
to reach back to more rustic ways for safety and comfort in this
emerging technological revolution. Could that be the reason that
more and more people are putting wood-burning ovens in their
kitchens?
 &HT;    Today, the Food section is taking a step back to examine where
we've been and where we're going. We'll present the cases and let
you decide what the next millennium holds.
 &HT;     
 
 
 The Future of Eating  
   
 By Kim Severson 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Children born in the next millennium might never
know what it means to go on a diet.
<P>
   They will live in a world where eating food is optional.
Patches, pills or gels will provide nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   But cooking won't be abandoned entirely. People may not cook as
much in the future as they did in the past, but when they do it
will become almost sacred. And they'll do it in kitchens so wired
that with a few keystrokes, they can determine daily nutritional
needs, shop for groceries, watch a movie, coordinate the family's
schedule and even get an education.
</P>
<P>
   Though many culinarians disagree, instead predicting a return to
home and hearth, prognosticators say the next millennium holds
radical changes for how we eat. And the kitchen, a consistent
measure of cultural change, will be at the epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of years ago, the kitchen was far away from living
quarters, largely for safety reasons. When it moved into the house,
the kitchen and its bubbling pots and warm open fires drew families
together. It also became the bastion of the servant class.
</P>
<P>
   Upper-class families ate in dining rooms as far away from the
kitchen as possible. Even as late as the 1920s, etiquette expert
Emily Post suggested that no food smells be apparent when guests
arrived for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   As the era of servants ended, the kitchen's casual comfort again
became essential to family life. But in the last half of this
century, women began working outside the home in larger numbers.
The television _ and its corollary, the TV dinner _ replaced
sit-down family dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Today we're in an era of showplace kitchens that may be used for
little more than re-heating prepared food. But the kitchen itself
is on the brink of another transformation _ this time to the nerve
center of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to create family meetings around meals. Home
offices will be in the kitchen. Instead of going to a doctor,
you'll touch a screen and it will tell you you need more vitamin D
that day and the refrigerator will order your groceries
accordingly,'' says Faith Popcorn, an author and head of
BrainReserve, a New York marketing consulting firm that tracks
cultural trends and projects future fads.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the kitchen will be the center of family life,
people will seek out alternatives to actually eating, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will ingest perfectly balanced foods but we won't eat meals
in the figurative sense,'' she says. ``You're going to go, `God, I
don't have time so I'll just take this pill.' Or you'll say, `I
don't want to eat tonight so I'll take a liquid or IV
replacement.'''
</P>
<P>
   People are already feeding, not eating, she says, pointing out
that 60 percent of Burger King's customers eat in their cars rather
than around a table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, meals satisfy very few emotional needs - so meals
in the form of pills won't make a major difference in that
regard,'' she predicts. Popcorn, whose own diet includes BLTs,
french fries, Raisinets and tacos, says she will gladly consume
pills instead of food to save time and ensure adequate nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists agree food alternatives are on the way. Although
their world does not look as foodless as Popcorn's, many envision
cracking genetic codes predisposing people to certain diseases.
They'll know much more about how certain foods prevent disease.
</P>
<P>
   That means that a parent will be able to use instant diagnostic
tools wired into the kitchen to plan their children's diet,
offering a specific mix of food and supplements to lessen risks of
contracting heart disease, cancer or even obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see a world where kids might not know what it's like to
eat certain foods because we've eliminated the junk and found a way
to replace it with foods that are sound but still satisfying,''
says Liz Applegate, professor of nutrition at the University of
California at Davis and the author of ``Eat Your Way to A Healthy
Heart'' (Prentice Hall Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Other nutritionists don't see a world of broccoli patches and
beta carotene gels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is so ridiculous,'' says Joanne Ikeda, instructor in the
Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of California
at Berkeley. ``It presumes people eat purely for getting the
nutrients. In reality that's one of the last considerations about
why people eat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Popcorn and other futurists aren't arguing food will
disappear. In fact, the emotional and sensual power of food will
increase. When people do eat traditional meals, the food will be
both comforting and significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we will continue to eat `real' food instead of pills is
around the meals that do have some emotional connection for us _
Thanksgiving, birthdays, family dinners, anniversaries and anything
where the preparation of the food, of the table and the sharing of
the meal have significant meaning,'' Popcorn says.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen will have morphed into the family's spiritual center
_ part of a trend Popcorn calls ``anchoring.'' America will need to
reach back to spiritual roots and taking what was secure from the
past to create an anchor in an unsure future. The kitchen will be
the symbolic family anchor and cooking akin to religious ritual
like communion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been forecasting for some time that the kitchen will
become the center of life in the next millennium,'' says Marian
Salzman, an international trendspotter for New York's Young and
Rubicam advertising agency. ``Home is going to become the safe
place for us, and the kitchen will be the center of our safe space
because it is not safe out there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Popcorn, Salzman sees a world in which nourishment can be
taken either in the form of pill or food. People will glean the
sensory needs food fulfills through aroma and virtual eating
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   That future is not as far away as it might seem. Already, the
food-medicine hybrid called nutraceuticals or functional foods is a
$17 billion a year business. At the same time, Crabtree&AMP;Evelyn
sells room sprays with names like Patisserie and Salad Greens.
</P>
<P>
   While the futurists dream of a pill-popping future where the
kitchen becomes a shrine, academics like Bertram Gordon, history
professor and food expert at Mills College in Oakland, sees a more
practical future for the American food scene _ one defined by
economics.
</P>
<P>
   The future will depend on three things, he believes: What people
are willing to buy, how major food producers can continue to make a
profit and how enough food can be produced to feed a growing
population.
</P>
<P>
   But give the futurists credit for the vision of where science
will take us, Gordon says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are probably on the verge, in next 10 to 20 years or so, of
understanding how the digestive system works,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In labs across the country, scientists are studying how
hormones, genes and the digestive tract work together. Some
research centers on how the brain's emotional response to food
affects nutrition and what combinations of chemicals in food
provide both nutrition and emotional satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we understand the model of how we supply nutrition to our
bodies and how we taste _ the biological cravings the way the brain
works _ eating as we know it will radically change.''
</P>
<P>
   And we're much closer to that than it might appear.
</P>
<P>
   To put it in perspective, imagine what the world was like a
couple of years before Copernicus came along in 1512 and proved
that the sun, not the earth, was at the center of the universe, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   That year marked the start of a new paradigm. ``Apply that
today, and we're in 1507. A huge change is just around the
corner.''
</P>

 &UR; Home is Where the Kitchen Is &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Kim Severson &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Don't let all this technology fool you.
</P>
<P>
   The American family of the next millennium might well spend its
time gathered around the hearth, using simple, high-quality kitchen
tools to prepare essential, comforting foods gleaned from cultures
all over world.
</P>
<P>
   Technology, scientific advances and the speed of life outside
the home will become so overwhelming that we will embrace a return
to simple, nourishing food.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what several Bay Area culinarians believe. They
disagree _ often quite vigorously _ with those who envision a world
where nutrition comes in a pill and food's sensual and emotional
pleasures are manufactured or relegated to special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Some common ground between the two does exist. Both sides say
the kitchen will emerge as the center of life in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kitchen, in a sort of emotional and psychological sense,
is going to emerge more strongly as the center of the family as it
was in the past,'' says Marc Halperin of San Francisco's Center for
Culinary Development. ``There is a reason people come back again
and again to food that is simple and nourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, a growing interest in the kitchen is visible. If people
could pick any room in the house to remodel, 42 percent would start
over in their kitchens, according to the 1999 American Express
Retail Index on home improvement trends.
</P>
<P>
   And the movement is toward homey, comforting cooking. Consider
that about 1 million pressure cookers were sold in the United
States last year and that an estimated 55 million households made
Christmas cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Culinarians argue that all the technology in the world won't
change the basic human desire for real food _ in fact, it will
serve to emphasize it. As humans become more isolated through
technology, they will naturally crave simple, homey nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Halperin offers his nieces, 17 and 18, as examples. For most of
their teenage years, they have rarely sat down with their parents
for a meal. Like many of their peers, they fill up on multiple
small take-out or microwaved meals and lots of snacks. But they
still crave comfort foods like roasted chicken and macaroni and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why on earth would people who have been raised on TV dinners
and who eat nutrition bars in front of their computers want
(comfort) food? There must be profound genetic reasons for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Williams, the octogenarian who founded the Williams-Sonoma
chain of cookware stores in the 1950s, sees a future that merges
technology with an innate human need to cook. The bread machine is
an early indicator of how we'll approach eating in the future, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came out of nowhere but showed that people who didn't cook
a lot and eat out most of the time still want the satisfaction of
loading up that thing, pushing a button and making something
wonderful that fills their kitchen with the smell of fresh baked
bread,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And while the kitchen will be high-tech, he believes ``the
simple act of cooking is fundamental to life. We will never lose
the love of a good knife or vegetable peeler.''
</P>
<P>
   More academic thinkers dismiss such theories as simply romantic
notions. The elevation of the kitchen to a spiritual center filled
with mashed potatoes and roasted chicken might occur, but it will
be a mere cultural blip. It's the sort of conservative response
that comes at the end of significant periods, not unlike the stuffy
late-Victorian era at the end of the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the midst of a re-adjustment in America, so it's not
surprising that you're seeing so much nostalgia. The reality is the
rest of the world is simply trying to survive and get enough food
to eat,'' says Bertram Gordon, a history professor and food expert
at Mills College in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor to consider is the increasing influence of
immigrants, who bring an entirely different set of cultural values
and traditional foods to the American culinary landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Ikeda, instructor in the Department of Nutritional
Sciences at the University of California at Berkeley, believes the
immigrant influence might well be the thing that saves American
eating habits from the pill-popping, fast-paced world some say is
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Ikeda recently finished writing a chapter on the cultural role
food plays for ``A Sociology of Food and Nutrition: The Social
Appetite'' (to be published this month by Oxford University Press).
The ethnic influence is already apparent in both high-and low-end
Bay Area restaurants, she says. And it will continue to have a
strong, but more subtle influence in Bay Area homes, celebrating
growing, cooking and eating food with an extended family or
community.
</P>
<P>
   She points to the Hmong immigrants in the San Joaquin Valley who
grow unusual varieties of tomatoes and eggplants from seeds they
have brought from Laos, and to some of the state's Latino and
Native American communities where 95 percent of the meals people
eat are at family gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrant communities have not bought into the idea that life
should be structured in 15 minute increments and eating is a chore.
Sharing food is bred into everyday activities, and the kitchen is
central,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, no one really knows what's around the millennium's
corner. But as we head into the brave new world of wired kitchens,
bioengineered food and nutraceuticals, those who are passionate
about eating hold onto their belief that food will always remain a
significant part of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are human beings,'' says the Culinary Institute's Halperin.
``The fewer ways a person can touch or stimulate their senses, the
less happy he or she is going to be. And one of the most profound
ways to touch your senses is through food.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Computer recipes to keep a cook going
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the small advantages of old age is a
willingness to avoid pontificating on subjects about which one
knows nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, when it comes to reviewing a computer cookbook, I
always turn to Mrs. Warner, who is the best cook I know. She hates
it when I say that, because she doesn't particularly enjoy cooking.
</P>
<P>
   She quite graciously submitted these comments on Sierra's new
Mastercook Suite featuring Betty Crocker recipes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I searched for my mother's vegetable beef soup, which I was
pretty sure came from a Betty Crocker cookbook, circa 1940, and
found one very close to it in the section called Kitchen Classics.
Mother had added okra, but everything else was the same _ beef,
potatoes, carrots, onions, celery and cabbage. It took me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, no bologna
</P>
<P>
   (To see if it would take me back, I searched for my mother's
bologna salad, a dish so disgusting I had wiped it from my memory
until my sister mentioned it recently. MasterCook Suite, I can
assure you, makes no mention of bologna in any form. Back to you,
Mrs. Warner.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Each recipe includes serving suggestions (a salad and bread
for mother's soup) and, of course, number of servings, ingredients,
directions, cooking time, preparation time, categories (beef pot
pie was listed in five categories: Beef, Breads, Luncheon, Main
Dishes, Pies &AMP; Pastry). Some recipes also include Cuisine and
Notes. Boston brown bread is American Cuisine; notes suggested
substituting dates for raisins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The source is usually included _ many copyrighted by General
Mills, and many from such kitchens as the Texas Beef Council and
Pepperidge Farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program is based on individual books. They range from the
four Betty Crocker cookbooks (`Best of Baking,' `Best of Healthy
and Hearty Cooking,' `Cookie Book' and `Basics') through `Casual
Dining' to `Famous American Chefs' to `Quick Fix' to `What to Fix
for Dinner' _ 26 books in all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutrition analysis has come a long way from the days of the
first computer cookbooks. Entering ingredients is easy in
Mastercook Suite, and nutrition analysis is instantaneous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program has all the standard features _ it will generate a
shopping list, tell you what you can make when you tell it what is
in your pantry, suggest menus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggested a rather daunting dinner party menu for six that
was a far cry from the store-baked ham and twice-baked potatoes I
usually serve. The menu: Crab-stuffed Mushrooms, Mandarin Hazelnut
Salad, Halibut With Mushroom and Shrimp Sauce, Garlicky Greens and
Beans, Bow Knot Dinner Rolls and Ginger Pudding. Total calories
come to 932 per guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tips section is particularly helpful. Information ranges
from adzuki beans (a small reddish-brown bush bean cultivated in
China and Japan) to zymurgy (the science of fermentation,
especially as it applies to brewing). This section also presents
film clips of various kitchen techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it, straight from her mouth. I might add that she
examined the program while I was consuming the better part of a
loaf of her fresh-baked walnut wheat bread.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    View of Atlanta's downtown available online
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of Atlanta's nicest views recently became a lot
more visible.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Dial restaurant, atop downtown's Westin Peachtree Plaza
hotel, has a 360-degree view of Atlanta. A while back, the hotel
started charging non-guests $5 to take the glass elevator ride to
the top of the 73-story hotel. The Web camera gives the same view
for free to anyone with a computer and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The camera is mounted on the revolving bar level of the Sun Dial
restaurant. You can see it at sundial.directsight.com/.

   If you're wired but don't know how to wire, Better Homes and
Gardens' Web site might be able to help.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.bhglive.com/homeimp/index.html, is an encyclopedia
of home improvement and home repair tips, divided into five
categories: wiring, decks, plumbing, carpentry, and masonry and
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The tips and instructions are adapted from the Better Homes and
Gardens how-to books. The Home Improvement Encyclopedia has more
than 2,000 pages of content and 53 animated demonstrations.

   Bulk-buying discounts on brand names offered
</P>
<P>
   Small booksellers have found that size matters and have
struggled to compete with the big retailers that can buy in bulk
and sell for less. Now maybe you can get the same advantage.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site that launched last month, www.mercata.com, hopes to
bring bulk buying to individuals over the Internet. With Mercata's
``power buy,'' people can buy brand-name products _ JVC stereos,
Kodak cameras and Toshiba televisions _ for a limited time at group
discounts. Shipping is free, also for a limited time.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can recommend products for Mercata to offer. For now,
the site offers consumer electronics, sporting goods, power tools,
lawn and garden equipment, specialty gifts, and items for the home.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata's product line includes Baby Jogger, Braun, Bushnell,
Coleman, Cuisinart, General Electric, Top-Flite and Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata, funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan
Ventures, also offers customers a 30-day satisfaction guarantee on
products, customer service from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. EDT Monday through
Friday and real-time delivery tracking.

</P>
<P>
   The site, www.discovery.com/exp

<P>
   /earthjourneys/earthjourneys.html, has features that let
visitors take a closer look at our planet. Peel the Planet lets
people look at the different layers of the Earth and find out how

   Lovett or leave it: Finding right CD price
</P>
<P>
   The number of places on the Web where you can buy things is
getting almost too big to manage. And, unlike with the telephone,
there are few ways to make sure you are getting the best deal ahead
of time when you check the price of a CD or any other product
available online.
</P>
<P>
   One site, www
</P>
<P>
   .bottomdollar.com, works as a comparison shopper. Choose a
category, such as music, type in a singer, such as Lyle Lovett, and
in a few seconds the search engine produces several prices for Lyle
Lovett CDs and cassettes at several different Web sites, with
prices ranging from inexpensive to unimpressive.
</P>
<P>
   The site was chosen by Cool Site of the Day,
www.coolsiteoftheday
</P>
<P>
   .com, last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom Dollar's power shopper is described as a virtual Brillo
pad to scour the Web to get the best deal.

 CHRON  
 Marnee Thai Prawns Show Flavors of Future   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Year after year, Marnee Thai in the Sunset
District is listed as one of the Bay Area's favorite restaurants.
And anyone who's tasted Chai Siriyarn's Yellow Curry Prawns will
know why.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Siriyarn represents a growing number of chefs who are poised to
take authentic-tasting food into the next millennium. All the
combinations evoke the exotic flavors of Thailand, but the chef
adapts the recipes to what's available here. That doesn't mean
they're Americanized _ sweetened and blanded down _ but they're
reformulated to create the delicate balance you'd discover if you
had the same dish in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   Great curry is a blend of more than a dozen ingredients, so it's
much more complicated than opening a jar of curry powder from the
grocery store. But once you taste this version, you'll find that
the extra effort to create a from-scratch mix is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   In this dish the curry is made with chiles, garlic, shallots,
lemongrass, ginger, galangal, kaffir lime, shrimp paste, fennel
seeds, coriander, cumin and cloves. It's a hauntingly intricate
blend that seems to sweeten the prawns and soak into the little
cubes of potato. Coconut milk, which smooths the raw edges of the
spices and lends a velvety texture, allows the complex flavors to
literally unfold in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   If you think all curries are pretty much the same, this recipe
will convince you otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Marnee Thai, 2225 Irving St. (between 23rd and 24th &LR; 
 &LR; avenues), San Francisco; (415) 665-9500. Lunch, dinner &LR; 
 &LR; Wednesday-Monday. &LR;

 &UR; The curry blend.  &LR; Most cooks take short cuts and use only a few
spices, but the careful mix of seasonings here produces an

 &LR; MARNEE THAI'S YELLOW CURRY PRAWNS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Curry Paste
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 dried red chile peppers, each 2 to 3 inches long, or
chiles to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon coriander seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fennel seeds
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon white peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   3 whole cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon thinly sliced garlic
</P>

<P>
   1 teaspoon peeled and finely chopped fresh galangal
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely chopped lime zest (kaffir lime, if available)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon shrimp paste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon curry powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon turmeric
</P>
<P>
   The Curry
</P>
<P>
   20 medium prawns, shelled and deveined
</P>
<P>
   2 cups coconut milk
</P>
<P>
   1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 cup half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons palm sugar or brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the curry paste:  &LR; Soak the chile peppers in hot water
to cover until soft, about 15 minutes. Remove from the water,
slice, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the coriander, fennel, peppercorns and cloves in a small
skillet. Place over medium heat and toast until fragrant, about 3
to 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Transfer to a plate and let cool
for a few minutes, then grind to a fine powder in a spice grinder.
</P>
<P>
   Place the spice mixture in a blender. Add the chiles, garlic,
shallots, lemongrass, ginger, galangal, lime zest, shrimp paste,
salt, curry powder and turmeric. Puree until a fine, smooth paste
forms, about 3 to 5 minutes. (If necessary, add 1/3 cup water to
facilitate blending.) Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the curry: &LR;  Drop the prawns into a large pot of boiling
water; boil for 10 to 15 seconds. Drain well and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Bring 1 cup of the coconut milk to a boil in a medium saucepan.
Cook over medium heat, stirring often for 5 to 7 minutes. Add the
reserved curry paste and continue to cook and stir until the
mixture becomes dry and fragrant, about 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Web destinations for vacation plans
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's hot, your nerves are shot because the kids are
home from school for the summer, you're broke and the air
conditioner is making a strange grinding noise ... it must be time
for a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   What could be better than piling the whole family in the car and
driving for hours or even days to a place that's even hotter and
that will make you more broke?
</P>
<P>
   Since so much fun awaits you, let's at least make the
preparation for the vacation as easy and inexpensive as possible.
That's where the World Wide Web comes in. You can take care of
almost everything while sitting at your computer.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start our journey at a terrific site called Travel Zone at
search
</P>
<P>
   .thetrip.com/. This site uses the AltaVista search engine so _
as you would expect _ the main advantage here is the ability to
ferret out almost any vacation-planning information you need.
</P>
<P>
   You can simply type in a word or a phrase, click the button and
get dozens of links to that information. You'll also find some
helpful links on the main page that can take care of chores like
figuring conversion rates for foreign currency, finding maps,
guides to cities and airports, and ways to find low-cost airfares.
You'll also want to check out the main page (www.trip.com/), where
you'll be able to rent a car, book a hotel room, and find airline
fares and schedules.
</P>
<P>
   There's also advice aplenty, including ways to find the lowest
airfare, the way to plan what the site's designers call a
``stress-free trip'' and how to decipher airline codes for various
cities.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe that's overkill ... perhaps all you really need is a
virtual road map to get you to your destination. The Web is crammed
with virtual map and travel route planning services. Here are two
good ones: MapQuest at www
</P>
<P>
   .mapquest.com/ and Yahoo!'s mapping site at
maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these sites work in much the same way. If you enter a
starting address and the address of your destination, you can get
both a map and printed turn-by-turn directions, complete with
mileage. In most cases, you'll find the directions good _ perhaps
not the route you would choose, but workable. However, as with any
other kind of directions, including the kind you'd get from a
friend, there is the fairly remote chance that you'd figure a
better way on your own. That's why it makes sense to take a peek at
the map for a common-sense check of the driving directions.
</P>
<P>
   So far, we've covered sites that offer most of the conventional
tools you'll need for planning a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   But for some people, vacations are true adventures ... instead
of lying on a Florida beach, they have hang gliding in South
America in mind. If you have the desire and the cash, there's a
nifty Web site that caters to unique vacations. It's called InfoHub
Specialty Travel Guide and can be found at www.infohub
</P>
<P>
   .com/travel.html.
</P>
<P>
   Simply use a pull-down menu to select a country or a separate
pull-down menu to pick an activity (ballooning, volcano tours,
mountain climbing ... if you can think of doing it, it's listed).
You'll also be able to specify a price range that you are willing
to pay by using another menu.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, keep in mind that for information about a specific
location or activity (whether you are planning a trip to
grandmother's or want to explore the Incan ruins), any of the major
search engines can be used. Simply type in the keywords of the city
you want to visit or the activity that interests you.

 CHRON   `Tis Time to Speak of Hamburgers, Empires and Kings  
   
 By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  An old saying goes, ``The history of every nation
lies visible on its table.'' Wars and victories, its occupation in
defeat, the marriages of its kings, its religion, its empires _ all
have left behind some flavors, ingredients or dishes destined to
become part of the national cuisine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's certainly the case in the U.S., where flavors and dishes
from all parts of the world have become part of our cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to consider: Of all the dishes over the last
200 or so years, which ones can we characterize as classics? And
which new dishes seem poised to become classics in the next
millennium?
</P>
<P>
   If I had to vote on what constitutes the most popular food
classics of this century, I would pick hamburgers and Caesar salad.
</P>
<P>
   I was lucky enough to go to Glendale High School with Bob Wyan,
the creator of what became the huge national chain of hamburgers
called ``Bob's Big Boy.'' One of his employees in the early days
was Ray Kroc, who eventually left to start McDonald's. Kroc
generously credited Bob with inspiring McDonald's Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Bob assembled the hamburger by dividing each bun into three
equal slices. One slice would be spread with mayonnaise and
sprinkled with chopped lettuce, then topped with a hamburger patty.
The top of the middle slice of bun would be spread with relish. The
bottom of the middle bun would be spread with mustard, and then the
last slice of bun would be spread with tomato ketchup (Bob used to
make his own, which was delicious) and chopped onions. The second
thin hamburger patty went on the onions.
</P>
<P>
   The genius of this was that nothing slid or flopped over the
edge of the bun, and the sandwich was no thicker than one's mouth.
(Most hamburgers are thick monsters. There should be a mouth
measure so you never have to buy these impossible-to-eat types!)
Bob Wyan's way of assembling hamburgers was sheer genius, but the
classic hamburger recipe I've given here uses the standard assembly
method.
</P>
<P>
   As for which popular dishes from today might become classics in
the future, I'd vote for grilled or roasted vegetables, which I see
frequently on restaurant menus and in recipes; simple, rustic
Mexican food; and brined meats and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   Brining _ the process of soaking meat in salted water for
preservation _ used to be a common practice before refrigeration.
Today it's purpose is more to tenderize and flavor meats.
</P>
<P>
   Some home cooks make a regular practice of brining pork, beef or
poultry several days before cooking and serving it. Judy Rodgers,
chef/owner of Zuni restaurant in San Francisco, has brined meats
for a long time with great results. Alice Waters of Chez Panisse
also has brined pork and poultry. She says her brined Thanksgiving
turkey (which she did at home) was the best she ever tasted.
</P>
<P>
   To see what differences brining might make, I bought four loin
pork chops, brined one for 24 hours and left the other unbrined.
After cooking both the same way and then tasting them, I found the
brined chop was more tender and had better flavor.
</P>
<P>
   I repeated the test with the remaining two chops, except that I
added rosemary sprigs to the brine and let the chop soak for 36
hours. This chop tasted even better than the 24-hour brined one. In
fact, it was so good I am going to try the method with chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two different brines you may want to try for yourself. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Marion Cunningham, Bay Area cooking teacher, is the author of
``Learning to Cook,'' ``Cooking With Children,'' ``The Fannie
Farmer Cookbook'' and ``The Breakfast Book,'' among others. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
COOKING TIMES FOR PORK CHOPS
</P>
<P>
   Fried pork chops retain their tenderness and moisture when they
aren't cooked to death. Following is a brief guide to cooking
times:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ 1/2-inch-thick pork chops need only about 5 minutes per side
</P>
<P>
   _ 3/4-inch-thick pork chops need 8 minutes per side
</P>
<P>
   _ 1-inch-thick chops need 10 minutes per side.

 Cherin's Spans Electronic Revolution   By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Lou Cherin may sell $5,000 state-of-the-art
refrigerators today, but 65 years ago he was selling iceboxes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You had a top lid that opened up, and you stored a cake of ice
there. Since cold air falls, that air was distributed in the
refrigerator,'' recalls the 84-year-old Cherin, whose Valencia
Street store, Cherin's Appliance, was furnishing San Francisco
kitchens long before microwave ovens, trash compactors or
refrigerators with filtered water dispensers were a gleam in any
engineer's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Now a third-generation family business, Cherin's opened 107
years ago as a furniture store. ``There were no appliances then,''
recalls Cherin, but the revolution was about to begin. Electric
refrigerators and electric stoves came along in the 1920s, electric
dishwashers in the 1940s. At the end of World War II, Cherin's
moved a few doors down the street to its present location and began
to thrive with the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, appliance stores would have a 100 percent
markup,'' says Cherin. ``We were one of the first that discounted
merchandise and were satisfied with considerably less. That
attitude has persisted to this day and probably is the cause for
our success.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't hurt business that many of today's well-heeled Bay
Area residents see the kitchen as a home entertainment center.
Because guests congregate in kitchens now, homeowners want the most
expensive professional-quality stove, the $1,800 soundproof
dishwasher, the cherry-paneled built-in refrigerator that looks
just like the cabinetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conspicuous consumption has a lot to do with it,'' admits
Cherin. ``People who have the extra money are putting these things
in because their friends have them.''
</P>
<P>
   The sought-after kitchen fixtures at Cherin's these days include
the 30-inch-wide, single-bowl stainless-steel sink, large and deep
enough to hold stock pots and full sheet pans. Shoppers are also
going for filtered water dispensers at the sink and in the
refrigerator, and for imported Miele and Bosch dishwashers that
don't make a sound.
</P>
<P>
   Early electric dishwashers were primitive machines, recalls
Cherin _ essentially clothes washers that did double duty. When you
finished the laundry, you put dish racks in the machine and loaded
your dishes. ``It was not too sanitary,'' acknowledges the
merchant, ``but this is what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Top-of-the-line dishwashers today are not only sanitary. They
use dramatically less water and energy than older models. They also
successfully clean soiled pots thanks to better detergents and the
introduction of a soaking cycle. And sheathed in the same material
as the cabinets, they literally blend into the woodwork. One
imported model Cherin's sells consists of stacked, deep pull-out
drawers, making it possible to wash small loads _ say, a single
drawer _ efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   For people who believe refrigerators are eyesores, Sub-Zero will
panel the front to match existing cabinetry, says Cherin. He also
points to another innovation from Sub-Zero, the mini-refrigerator
or mini-freezer that masquerades as an undercounter drawer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sums lavished on remodels today, equipping a kitchen
is relatively less expensive than it used to be, claims the
retailer. In the 1940s, $350 would have bought a stove, a washing
machine and a refrigerator _ appliances that a carriage-trade
shopper might spend $7,500 for today.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I needn't tell you that a home in the Sunset District in
those days was $3,995 or $4,995,'' says Cherin. ``Those homes today
are worth 100 times as much.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lou Cherin, who still works five or six days a week,
kitchens have almost come full circle. When he started in the
business in the 1930s, families gathered in the kitchen because its
wood- or coal-burning stove made it the warmest room in the house.
In contrast, the antiseptic, all-electric kitchen of the 1960s was
a room people couldn't wait to get out of. Wall-mounted,
self-cleaning ovens liberated the housewife from constant stooping
and cleaning; electric cooktops seemed clean, efficient and modern.
</P>
<P>
   Today, cooks are stooping and cleaning again thanks to the craze
for restaurant-quality ranges. In exchange for responsive, high-BTU
gas burners that make the home cook feel like a restaurant chef,
consumers are making do with the accompanying, under-cooktop gas
oven that must be hand-cleaned. ``It's a return to the primitive,''
says Cherin, with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Cherin's three sons _ Marty, Don and Willie _ have followed him
into the business and will no doubt peddle the kitchen innovations
of the 21st century. A fourth generation is ``waiting in the
wings,'' says the patriarch, with a few grandchildren already
working in the store on summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
   He seems only mildly surprised that some grandchildren would
``rather do what they're happy doing'' than take over a successful
business. His generation had other priorities. Nevertheless, it
seems likely that Cherin's future as a family business is secured,
with little chance of it becoming a national chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always believed in a single-unit business,'' says
Cherin. ``One store, one location. And being a single operation and
just having modest expectations, we do very well.''

 The Art of Presentation Is a Fickle World, Indeed   By Karola Saekel 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  The trappings that have surrounded our meals over
the last millennium _ how we set our tables and present our meals _
are easily as interesting as are changes in dress, home furnishings
or musical tastes.
<P>
   As this century plunged from its Victorian comfort into the
Great Depression and went on to the egalitarian post-World War II
era, our tables simplified. Seven-course meals and the dozens of
dishes and plates they demanded became a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   In homes, consomm &LR; e &LR;  cups, claret and sherry glasses, fish
knives, demitasse spoons and cake forks gave way to the soup bowl,
the all-purpose wine glass and the no-nonsense five-piece flatware
setting. In restaurants, as rococo ice sculptures melted away and
elaborate aspic molds were given the heave-ho, a new efficiency
permeated kitchen and service bay.
</P>
<P>
   We might have slipped into near Puritanism if _  &LR; voila &LR;  _ the
French had not presented the world of the '70s with  &LR; nouvelle &LR; 
 &LR; cuisine &LR; , which not only reduced the amount of food on plates but
also elevated the chef from unknown kitchen grudge to  &LR; artiste &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember restaurants like Ernie's and La Bourgogne?'' asks
Tante Marie cooking school founder Mary Risley. ``In the '50s and
'60s, food was placed on a cart in the kitchen and the waiter
plated it tableside.'' Servers also boned the fish and disjointed
the fowl _ jobs today's waitstaff might find daunting.
</P>
<P>
   But under the new modus operandi, plates were arranged _
designed, if you will _ in the kitchen. The look of the plate had
become the chef's signature.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part simplicity went out the window once again as
shape, arrangement and color coordination became almost as
important as the quality of the food served. Roland Passot,
chef-owner of La Folie and Left Bank, remembers with a laugh how,
in the mid-'80s, ``We did all these plates with little dots all
over . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The more-is-better trend peaked in the early '90s, when
architectural elements invaded the kitchen. Curiously, this
coincided with the rediscovery of Americana and a simultaneous turn
toward comfort food.
</P>
<P>
   So while some top restaurants featured the likes of meatloaf and
mashed potatoes, others opted for showmanship. Towering creations
piled meat, fowl and fish atop starches and vegetables, topping
them with more of the same and ending in jagged chips or spears of
fried epazote, fish skin or exotic starches.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco chefs showed some restraint, and the practice
seems to have waned: Mecca recently retired its stunning tower of
seafood. Passot still does a sweetbread and lobster cylinder, but
it's modest and manageable _ three to four inches high.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Kati's chef/owner Kirk Webber says he was as intrigued with
``tall food'' as the next chef, but he soon found that the skewers
of meat he fetchingly planted in papaya halves looked great but
invariably got cold before they reached the diner. Weber still
serves Caesar salad in a vertical mode _ an attention getter but
not difficult to eat.
</P>
<P>
   However, don't expect the architectural approach to be history
by the time the millennium rolls around. People still like
``amazing presentations,'' says event planner Nancy Frumkes DeLong.
</P>
<P>
   In her interpretations, this may mean surprise elements _ butter
may appear on a granite slab instead of a conventional butter dish;
at a garden party, flower pots may become food containers. At a
recent ground-breaking ceremony, hors d'oeuvres were served on dust
pans.
</P>
<P>
   DeLong isn't done with tall food. She may layer fresh mozzarella
cheese and heirloom tomatoes on top of each other rather than
side-by-side, finishing the plate with basil oil, a balsamic
vinegar reduction and chopped basil. Not only do these ingredients
add visual appeal, they complement the flavors of the dish.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking teacher and former California Culinary Academy dean
Linda Carucci refers to the excesses of constructing plates as
``children playing in the kitchen,'' pointing out that food
invariably suffers when handled too much.
</P>
<P>
   Top-flight caterer Paula LeDuc agrees. Although she is known for
extravagance, she draws a firm line _ everything in her
presentations must be edible, in season and compatible with the
dish.
</P>
<P>
   Today, taste is vital to presentation. ``Nobody wants their food
played with,'' quips Bay Wolf chef/owner Michael Wild. He prefers
great ingredients, expertly prepared, quickly making their way
``from pan to plate to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Caterers' and chefs' observations may well open a window on the
future. Meme Pederson of Taste catering doesn't see either a return
to the fussy presentations of the '80s or the obsession with
comfort food that followed it (``everything mashed potatoes''), but
an eclectic approach.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a current trend that is likely to continue, she
says, it's with absolutely top-notch fresh ingredients enhanced
rather than overshadowed by presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Hearon of Rose Pistola and Black Cat agrees. The '80s
obsession with ``having every color on every plate'' added too many
extraneous flavors, he says.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time if the current prosperity continues, diners
will not lower their expectations of the food they consume or how
it is put in front of them. Paul Bertolli of the East Bay's Oliveto
thinks the architectural approach shows no sign of receding in
``big-city restaurants'' _ a genre to which he lays no claim.
Sometimes, he confides with a laugh, if a staffer has arranged a
plate too artfully, ``I go mess (it) up.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In professional food presentation, the eyes have it. However,
what pleases the eye of the beholder and intrigues the hand of the
chef changes over time.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier parts of this millennium, Western culinary
culture, such as it was, played out at the tables of royalty and
the homes of the very rich. Ostentation was in vogue. Whole roasted
animals were presented fresh off the spit, and if a banquet had
less than a dozen kinds each of fish, fowl and meat, it didn't
deserve the name. Many fancy presentations were mainly for show.
Those blackbirds baked in a pie were probably not meant to be
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, now the bellwether of trends in eating, didn't
appear until after the French Revolution, but by the 1800s it
became the place where the affluent bourgeoisie could eat like
nobility _ and glean ideas for their own tables.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the fancies that at times bordered on follies
over the past century:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1900-1920:  &LR; Ice sculptures were the rage, as was almost
anything in aspic, the fussier the better.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1920s:  &LR; Sauces covered everything on the plate. If you could
put food in a patty shell, you were the cat's meow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1930s:  &LR; To be chic, food had to be French, emphasized by adding
a sprig of parsley to every plate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1940s:  &LR; Excess was unpatriotic, so war-time plates strove for
the mess-hall look.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1950s:  &LR; The heyday of Jell-O molds and _ once again _ huge
slabs of meat. Au jus seemed ever so much more sophisticated than
gravy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1960s:  &LR; Back to classic French: If you could put  &LR; a la &LR;  in
front of a dish, you were home.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Plates glistened with Hollandaise and sauce Bearnaise. The
avant garde added sprigs of tarragon, although most herbs used in
cooking were dried.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1970s:  &LR; Enter  &LR; nouvelle cuisine &LR;  and the new minimalism.
Following the less is more mantra, plates started showing lots of
open space.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1980s:  &LR; If you can cut anything into spirals, dress it up with
a trio of anything (from cheeses to sauces), blacken it or call it
 &LR; al dente &LR; , you're hip.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1990s:  &LR; Make it tall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Millennium:  &LR; Experts predict a more balanced approach,
showing respect for the inherent qualities of fresh foods. Some
excesses may fade, including the trend of putting very small
amounts of food on very large plates.
</P>
<P>
   In European culinary circles, there's a joke making the rounds
right now. Waiter: ``And how did you find the  &LR; escalope de &LR; 
 &LR; veau &LR; ?'' Guest: ``By lifting the arugula leaf.''

 Organic Versus Bio-Tech in the Battle for the Belly   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Next time you're at a party with a bunch of
dietitians and things get a little dull, toss out this question:
Should we genetically alter tomatoes to give them more
cancer-fighting properties?
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ask a dozen people and they'll give you a dozen answers,''
says Liz Applegate, professor of nutrition at the University of
California at Davis and the author of two books on eating and
health. ``Right now, it's chaos. No one can agree.''
</P>
<P>
   As we round the corner of a new millennium, the public's
attitude about food couldn't be more confused.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, we demand organic food and question whether
pesticide use, irradiation, genetic alteration have gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, we want our food to be scrubbed clean of
illness-causing bacteria and have a seemingly insatiable appetite
for fortified foods that promise to make us thinner, healthier and
happier.
</P>
<P>
   So which will win? The tomato that's genetically altered to
provide more cancer-fighting lycopene or the tomato grown without
any chemicals or scientific tinkering?
</P>
<P>
   Our buying habits reflect the paradox. The sale of organic food
has grown by as much as 25 percent a year and hit $5 billion in
1998, according to agriculture and food industry sources. At the
same time, the market for foods that have been supplemented with
natural ingredients to make them more healthful continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The Grocery Manufacturers of America estimates sales of
functional food _ the new industry buzzword for foods purporting to
improve the body's performance and ward off disease _ have reached
$17 billion and are expected to climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point all that's clear is that eating to prevent
illness _ the idea of food as medicine _ has presented a whole new
paradigm,'' says professor Clare Hasler, executive director of the
Functional Foods for Health program at the University of Illinois,
the nation's largest center for study on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really dichotomous,'' she says. ``Surveys we've seen show
people don't like the general idea of inserting genes from one sort
of plant into another, or from plants into animals.''
</P>
<P>
   But other data shows that if it's done for health purposes,
people are more accepting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is totally against anything genetically modified,''
says Hasler. ``In this country, we aren't as scared because we have
been educated along the way by companies and researchers who say
certain types of bioengineering are safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although food as medicine seems new, the concept predates the
current millennium. Native American healers knew juniper needle tea
relieved earaches. Chinese doctors have long understood the
importance of ginger and gingko. And didn't your mother feed you
chicken soup when you were sick, and tell you to eat carrots to
help you see better?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Americans have long been comfortable with
scientifically enhanced food. We eat cereal with added vitamins,
drink calcium-fortified orange juice, snack on tortilla chips made
from genetically altered corn and eat pork bred to isolate certain
desirable traits.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the harm with the latest movement toward functional
and bioengineered food?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this feeling that we have moved ahead more rapidly than
we should have,'' says Joanne Ikeda, an instructor in the
Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of California
at Berkeley. ``People have already been burned by experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Among recent examples of genetically altered food gone bad is an
experiment that introduced elements of Brazil nuts into soybeans to
enhance animal feed. When scientists mixed the genes, they didn't
think the properties that make some people allergic to nuts would
transfer to the new soybeans. It did, and the project was
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   And scientists at Cornell University announced in May that when
the pollen from genetically-altered corn was eaten by Monarch
butterflies in their caterpillar stage, it killed nearly half and
stunted the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionists and dietitians expect the debate over functional
foods, nutraceuticals and other bio-tech hybrids to continue into
the next millennium. Among the questions:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; How far should bioengineering go?  &LR; Are we willing to allow
scientists to splice the genes that allow Icelandic cod to
withstand freezing temperatures into beans so frozen products will
have the same texture as fresh? What if that technology could
protect orange crops from freezing? Or help prevent cancer or feed
hungry nations?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; How safe are natural supplements? &LR;  Natural supplements, taken in
too large a dose or combined with certain other herbs or natural
health-boosters can cause more health problems than they help.
Already, doctors have noted nutritional imbalances in people who
are over-using natural products to enhance health or feelings of
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Who should be responsible for regulation?  &LR; Food science is moving
faster than Food and Drug Administration &LR;   &LR; procedure. In spite of
all the nutritional labels already on food and reams of
regulations, many so-called enhanced functional foods and dietary
supplements don't face the same scrutiny as do drugs.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; What is the trade-off between a safe food supply and science? &LR; 
Producers of prewashed, bagged lettuce and large-scale beef
processors want to use irradiation to kill pathogens. The long-term
effects of irradiated food aren't known, although most
nutritionists and scientists deem it safe. Will the public accept
the method in return for, say, meat free of harmful E. coli?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Why are we turning to science to enhance our diets?  &LR; Retired
professor Sidney Mintz, an author who for 25 years lectured on food
and history at UC Berkeley, Johns Hopkins and Yale University,
believes the future of nutraceuticals and bioengineered food is
bright because of the innate quality of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are very reformist people. We're always becoming
better and better,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're told we should take this or that convincingly,
we're inclined to do it. We believe man is infinitely improvable.''

Editors Note: Main story, side bar  Post World War II Saw an End of Family Farms  
   
 By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Before it was Silicon Valley, it was the Valley of
Heart's Delight.
<P>
   Eight million fruit trees blanketed Santa Clara County in the
late 1940s, creating what Wallace Stegner once described as
``springs that were Milky Ways of blossom.''
</P>
<P>
   Today those fruit trees have all but vanished, ripped out and
replaced by houses, shopping malls, office buildings and high-tech
campuses. Like family farms throughout the Bay Area, Santa Clara's
farms couldn't compete with the development needs of a rapidly
growing urban area. Although some observers cite the rise of
farmers' markets as a positive omen for Bay Area farms in the
future, no one suggests that the region will ever revert to its
semi-agrarian past.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Olson Jacobson, whose family grew cherries and apricots
in Sunnyvale along El Camino Real, remembers a childhood spent in
and under the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would drive his truck into the orchard to get
buckets of cherries from the pickers,'' she recalls. ``And if it
was a hot day, you had the opportunity to ride under the cool
trees. They were so big and leafy, and you were underneath all
those luscious cherries, and you could just reach up and pick them
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 100 years after the Olson family began farming in
Sunnyvale, bulldozers ripped out almost half of the family's
remaining 24 acres. In a scene indicative of the past 50 years and
the foreseeable future for Bay Area agriculture, 300 apartment
buildings and a large retail complex will sprout on the site.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I was depressed awhile back,'' admits Deborah Olson,
Jacobson's niece who has maintained the Olson farmstand and
marketed the fruit in recent years. ``We have pictures, but now I'm
going to have to say, `That's what it was. It was a ranch, and it's
no longer going to be a ranch.' &LR;   &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Olsons are among the last holdouts from the days when El
Camino Real was a country road surrounded by 125,000 acres of
orchards and vineyards. As Silicon Valley grew, creating demand for
housing and highways, farmers like the Olsons found their options
eroding.
</P>
<P>
   They could sell to developers and start over in the Central
Valley, as many did. Or they could try to survive on fewer and
fewer acres, as cities swallowed up their property for road
expansions. In the face of these pressures, the county's orchard
and vineyard land has dwindled to 5,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, San Mateo County has witnessed a century of
drastic change, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serramonte Shopping Center was the biggest hog ranch in the
county,'' says Jack Olsen, a San Mateo County Farm Bureau employee.
According to the 1940 crop report, the county had 60,000 hogs and
16,000 acres of vegetables _ mostly peas, artichokes, Brussels
sprouts and lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the breadbasket for San Francisco,'' Olsen adds.
``All the products had to be grown locally because you couldn't
ship halfway around the world like you can today.'' Olsen says a
1920s photo on display in Daly City's Seton Medical Center shows
all of Colma and Daly City in cabbage fields.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the county can claim only 900 hogs and 3,300 acres of
vegetables, but also 19 million square feet of greenhouses. Flowers
and nursery plants now account for more than 75 percent of the
county's agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
   The population explosion following World War II sealed the fate
of many San Mateo-area farms, says Mitch Postel, executive director
of the San Mateo County Historical Museum. Many farmers took
advantage of rising land prices to cash out. But surprisingly, the
county's remaining agriculture bears the mark of a much earlier
influence: the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on Chinese immigration created a void on
turn-of-the-century farms. Who would do the manual labor?
Eventually, Italian and Japanese immigrants replaced the Chinese
and introduced the crops that prevail today. The Italians started
small truck farms, planting artichokes, peas, fava beans, dandelion
greens, cauliflower, spinach and chard. The Japanese took up flower
growing and, by World War II, had successful flower operations
throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Today, San Mateo County agriculture is protected by strict
zoning laws, an approach that some Marin County environmentalists
didn't trust. The story of their battle to preserve West Marin's
agricultural tradition could fill a book _ and has. ``Farming on
the Edge: Saving Family Farms in Marin County, California,'' by
John Hart (University of California Press, 1991) describes the
struggle to save the dairy ranches that had made Marin the state's
premier dairy county at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The abundant grass, the cool summers near the shore, the
unusually long green season in the spring all gave the early dairy
farmers a natural edge over competitors,'' Hart writes. ``And the
customers were right next door.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1950s, improvements in refrigerated transportation
had erased Marin's advantage; giant Central Valley dairies could
deliver milk more cheaply. As Marin County dairies folded and the
suburbs grew, pressure to provide highways to serve the new
residents grew, too. State planners began to sketch out a freeway
from San Rafael to Point Reyes Station to prepare for a fully
urbanized county. According to Hart, one Marin County official
predicted in 1971 that Tomales Bay would eventually look like
Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the prospect, county supervisors passed zoning laws
in early 1972 severely restricting development in West Marin. But
activists like Ellen Straus, a dairy owner in Marshall, weren't
satisfied. They knew that zoning could change at the whim of the
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   To secure the agricultural zone, Straus and others founded the
Marin Agricultural Land Trust (MALT) in 1980, a model organization
that buys agricultural easements from farmers. The land stays in
the farmers' hands and can pass to their heirs, but the deed is
restricted to prevent development _ ``in perpetuity,'' Straus
stresses, ``which means forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact? ``Tremendous,'' says the farmer, who operates Straus
Family Creamery with her husband and son. ``MALT has protected
26,000 acres of agricultural land and is still going strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Protected or no, West Marin dairy ranchers still have to find a
way to make ends meet. The Strauses converted to organic production
a few years ago, set up a creamery, and now produce their own milk,
butter and yogurt; Cowgirl Creamery in Point Reyes Station makes
cheese from their milk.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``We have carved out a niche,'' Straus says. Other ranchers are
planting pumpkins, wine grapes, olive trees or U-pick strawberries,
she says. Still others have begun selling their lamb or beef direct
to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Some local farms are advocating community-supported agriculture
(CSA), inviting urban residents to buy a share in their farms'
production. Direct-to-consumer sales through CSAs and at farmers'
markets put more money in the farmer's pocket and may be the answer
to preserving greenbelt farms in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a positive development,'' Straus says of these
efforts to diversify. ``It means that agriculture is serious
business, that family farms want to continue and overcome all
challenges. It's getting more difficult, but where there's a will
there's a way.''

 CHRON  
 The Battle of E-Grocery and Hands-On Shopping   By Miriam Morgan 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Will the Internet change the way we shop for food?
Yes. Will conventional supermarkets go the way of the horse and
buggy? No.
<P>
   Food shopping will be a mix of both styles in the next
millennium. For the computer-savvy and the time-pressed, online
services will offer convenience and ever-increasing variety. But
for those who like to squeeze the fruit and plan their meals by
wandering the aisles, nothing will replace hands-on shopping.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many consumers are going even further, frequenting
farmers' markets where they can talk to growers and visit with
neighbors _ the medieval town square fast-forwarded into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   On the cusp of the millennium, the supermarket industry _ which
last year posted a record $400 billion in income, a 1.22 percent
increase over the previous year _ is responding to the twin
consumer desires for e-commerce convenience and fresh-from-the-farm
connection. Local supermarket chains like Draeger's and Andronico's
have created stores that, in the words of Bill Andronico, president
and CEO of Andronico's Markets, ``assault the senses.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest Andronico's, set to open in August in Danville and at
29,000 square feet modest by industry standards, will include a
wine-tasting bar, a large nutrition and health center, a cafe and
coffee bar and a cooking school/food education center as well as a
large variety of produce, a service meat counter and regular
grocery items.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Andronico's has contracted with veteran online
grocery service  &LR; www.peapod.com &LR;  to provide grocery items, taking
over from Safeway, peapod's previous supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Draeger's also has evolved from a mom-and-pop corner deli in San
Francisco to a dazzling specialty-grocery chain on the Peninsula.
The San Mateo store, which opened in 1997, is 65,000 square feet of
top-of-the-line produce, meats, cheese, fish, breads, wines and
prepared food on one level, with kitchenware, tabletop items, a
cooking school and Viognier restaurant on the upper floor.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway, the nationwide chain headquartered in Pleasanton, has
pulled out of online shopping for the moment, concentrating instead
on expanding services in its ``brick and mortar'' stores. The
future, says Debra Lambert, corporate director of public affairs,
is healthy _ in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway plans to expand its health products, herbal supplements
and pharmacy sections. ``It increases the relationship we have with
our customers,'' she says. ``There are lots of consultations with
the pharmacists.''
</P>
<P>
   Safeway is also enlarging its organic products selection, once a
fringe aspect of the business. Lambert says Bay Area consumers are
interested in ``freshness, health, exercise. That's what's unique
to cuisine and lifestyle here, and we want to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   She predicts that mid-size stores of about 55,000 square feet _
which allows for wide aisles, about 300 types of produce, a good
variety of grocery items plus specialty departments _ will become
the industry standard in the next century, supplanting warehouse
discount stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Costco kinds of stores may have reached their saturation
point,'' she says. ``Customers don't like to shop in
100,000-square-foot stores. It's too impersonal. Plus, those stores
require lots of land, and there's not much of that left in the Bay
Area.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lambert points out that Safeway has its eye on
soon-to-open operations like Walmart's ``neighborhood'' stores of
40,000- to 60,000-square-foot markets, some attached to the larger
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the size, supermarkets will incorporate more
technology in the next millennium. According to Todd Hultquist of
the Food Marketing Institute, a supermarket trade association,
21st-century shoppers will use palm-sized scanners to keep running
tabs of items in their carts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he says, scanners may replace checkers altogether, with
shoppers scanning their own products. ``It's designed to make it
faster and easier to check out,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   If there aren't any checkers, will there still be personal
service _ the type touted by high-end grocers like Andronico's and
Draeger's? Of course, he says, but much will be ``virtual,'' in
interactive kiosks with product locators, recipe ideas and
nutritional information. In the next millennium, the computer and
shopping cart will be one _ whether in cyberspace or in the
supermarket.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; E-Grocery is Here to Stay &LR;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Web sites for specialty foods, grocery and meal
replacements offer incomparable convenience. They allow consumers
to shop any time for everything from brand name products to organic
produce, specialty foods or an entire meal kit, and to select a
delivery time. No getting in the car, no walking the aisles, no
carrying groceries up the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Internet suppliers see their main customers as those who find it
difficult to get to the grocery store, for a variety of reasons _
time-pressed families with children, single-parent households, the
elderly, those with disabilities and those without means of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mannella, vice president of marketing for Webvan, the
Foster City-based service that went online last month, points out
that the Internet ``allows people the convenience of e-commerce
around the clock and offers great quality items and frees up the
time they'd normally be spending grocery shopping. Plus, they have
the inconvenience of lugging bags.'' The company is so convinced of
the need for its service that last week it announced plans to copy
its automated distribution center in Oakland in 26 new markets
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to grocery items, most Web sites offer customers a
variety of free services. Here's a sampling of what's currently
available:
</P>
<P>
   www.webvan.com &LR;  offers shoppers prepared foods, recipes, a
weekly menu planner and a ``chef's corner'' highlighting famous
chefs and authors, and specialty items from top suppliers (such as
fresh produce from Greenleaf, a quality wholesaler), as well as
standard grocery items.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan emphasizes quality as well as convenience, says Lea
Bergen, culinary director. She points out that prepared meals like
a roast chicken dinner with apple-pecan stuffing, sugar snap peas
and cornbread _ are made daily in Webvan's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan delivers to the entire Bay Area, and charges no delivery
fee on orders placed through the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   www.peapod.com &LR; , the veteran online supermarket, uses
Andronico's Markets, Walgreens and Certified Grocers to supply its
orders. There is a delivery fee for this service.
</P>
<P>
   www.planet-organics.com &LR;  offers customers local organic produce
in $25 or $35 boxes, along with storage information and preparation
instructions. Planet Organics also carries other organic grocery
items. Free delivery available throughout the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   www.cookexpress.com &LR;  offers whole meal replacements in the form
of menu kits with ready-to-assemble ingredients, instructions and
beverage suggestions. Other add-ons include reviews of products and
interviews with food-industry professionals. Shoppers can also
purchase staples when they place their meal orders.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery is currently available to homes and offices in San
Francisco, Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Atherton, with a charge of
$4.95 for orders up to $60; higher-priced orders are free.
</P>
<P>
   www.digitalchef.com &LR;  offers specialty foods and cookware. Bill
Wallace, who spearheaded Oakville Grocery and was culinary director
of Draeger's before joining digitalchef as a vice president, points
out that the more than 3,500 products offered by the company
undergo rigorous taste-testing before being added to the site's
inventory. digitalchef offers customers gift ideas, cookbooks and
an ``Ask A Chef'' column.

 CHRON  
 We'll Be Drinking Less But Better   By Gerald Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  With the millennium now less than six months away,
the worldwide wine community is busy polishing off its crystal
ball. And wine consumers are closely watching the supply and
availability of their favorite wines, while asking what can we
expect in the year 2000 and beyond?
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``American consumers are continuing to move upscale in their
quality preferences as they drink less but better,'' says Jon
Fredrikson of Gomberg Fredrikson&AMP;Associates, wine industry
consultants in San Francisco. Demand for higher quality,
high-premium wines, priced above $7 per bottle retail, is still
very strong, growing by nearly 14 percent per year over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The consulting firm recently completed a survey for The Wine
Club, a successful wine-only retailer with stores in San Francisco
and Santa Clara, which shows that customer preference for wines
from the California Central Coast, Australia and Chile is strong.
While the survey represents sales at The Wine Club stores, it also
reflects general buying trends of American wine consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that Chardonnay continues to be the most popular
white wine, with Sauvignon Blanc slowly gaining ground. Customers
chose Beringer, Ferrari-Carano and Meridian as their favorite white
wine producers.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, Cabernet Sauvignon still tops sales at The
Wine Club, with Zinfandel sales moving up and Merlot sales dropping
off. Preferred red wine producers include Beringer, Silver Oak and
Caymus.
</P>
<P>
   What does all of this mean for the future? Fredrikson says that
an aging worldwide population of baby boomers, many with a good
percentage of disposable income, will be the primary market for
table wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest quality table wines are growing at the fastest
rates,'' he says, pointing out that sales of ``luxury wines'' ($25
per bottle) have climbed by 23 percent a year over the past 10
years. Still, many of California's finest wines remain in short
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at what the future may hold from specific
wine-producing regions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; SONOMA COUNTY
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can likely expect more variety in 2000, says Nick
Frey, executive director of Sonoma County Grape Growers
Association, with Sangiovese, Syrah and Pinot Gris emerging as
major grapes. Frey is also excited about the quality and diversity
of Zinfandel from Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   More winemakers will be blending varieties in the future,
producing a greater range in flavors and aromas, he predicts. New
vineyards are coming into production, many of them planted on
hillsides which produce smaller yields and different qualities than
grapes grown on the valley floor.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hamel, winemaker for Preston Vineyard&AMP;Winery, says the
future will show a ``fairly strong clarification of what grape
varieties belong in what regions of Sonoma County.'' Hamel expects
winemakers to focus more closely on regional characteristics for
wines, even above a varietal approach. ``Emphasis on regionality
has been going on for some time and will increase in the next five
to 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; NAPA VALLEY
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine prices are going up like dot.com stocks without much
regard for value,'' says John Stuart, general manager and winemaker
of Silverado Vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mondavi Wineries general manager, Clay Gregory agrees.
``Prices are not going down. The demand for high-end red wine is
increasing and prices will continue to rise.'' But Stuart sees a
downturn because ``the wine market cannot go up indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men say there is mounting interest among Napa Valley
winemakers for such alternative wines as Sangiovese. ``But
plantable land in the valley is scarce, so new plantings of
Sangiovese are limited,'' Stuart points out. ``Wines like
Sangiovese, Pinot Gris and Syrah are a hard sell. Changes are
gradual in the wine industry and consumer insecurities about wine
usually mean they go with what's safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory believes that one reason for rising Napa wine prices is
the increasing cost of land. ``An acre of unplanted vineyard land
in the valley above Yountville today would cost about $30,000,
while a planted acre could be as high as $100,000.'' Since there is
so little land left in the valley, new vineyards are being planted
south of the town of Napa.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has Stuart concerned for the area's reputation.
``Successes in marketing Napa Valley wines and the name Napa Valley
attracts people to the valley who do not have a passion for wine.
I'm also concerned about the consolidation of small wineries into
one larger firm,'' he says, pointing to the recent acquisition of
Franciscan Estates by Canandaigua. He fears fewer owners may lead
to a lack of individuality.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; AUSTRALIA
</P>
<P>
   California wines may be the favorites of The Wine Club
customers, but the recent survey showed purchases of Australian
wines increased from 19 percent to 24 percent in just the last year
_ a major jump.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Stuebing, wine marketing director for the Australian Trade
Commission in New York City, says Americans are becoming more
familiar with the wines and foods of Australia, thanks to next
year's Olympics scheduled for Sydney. ``The cost of travel is
coming down and as more Americans travel to Australia, they learn
more about Australian wines and cuisine,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Stuebing says only about 200 of the 1,000 wineries in Australia
export wine to the U.S., with most of the Australian imports coming
from the American representatives of major Australian wineries such
as Rosemount USA. But small importers specializing in limited
production Australian wines, such as San Francisco-based Old Bridge
Cellars, are also making their mark.
</P>
<P>
   Riesling is hot in Australia and some market watchers believe we
may soon see more Australian Riesling on American store shelves.
There will be a continued emphasis on red wines like Shiraz (Syrah)
and Cabernet Sauvignon, with growing interest in Australia for
Merlot.
</P>
<P>
   Australian wineries and grape growers are recognizing
regionality as never before, Stuebing says, and are working to
define the borders of wine regions in a system similar to the
American Viticultural Appellation.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; CHILE AND ARGENTINA
</P>
<P>
   Chile also registers on The Wine Club survey as a region of
interest. According to Alex Bartholomaus of Billington
Distributors, a Virginia-based importer of Chilean wines, the
number of Chilean imports is continuing to grow but imports of
Argentine wines over the last three years is growing even faster.
``Argentina is the sleeping giant and it should continue to
flourish into the millennium, especially with Malbec, the wine to

 `Tis Time to Speak of Hamburgers, Empires and Kings   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  An old saying goes, ``The history of every nation
lies visible on its table.'' Wars and victories, its occupation in
defeat, the marriages of its kings, its religion, its empires _ all
have left behind some flavors, ingredients or dishes destined to
become part of the national cuisine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's certainly the case in the U.S., where flavors and dishes
from all parts of the world have become part of our cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to consider: Of all the dishes over the last
200 or so years, which ones can we characterize as classics? And
which new dishes seem poised to become classics in the next
millennium?
</P>
<P>
   If I had to vote on what constitutes the most popular food
classics of this century, I would pick hamburgers and Caesar salad.
</P>
<P>
   I was lucky enough to go to Glendale High School with Bob Wyan,
the creator of what became the huge national chain of hamburgers
called ``Bob's Big Boy.'' One of his employees in the early days
was Ray Kroc, who eventually left to start McDonald's. Kroc
generously credited Bob with inspiring McDonald's Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Bob assembled the hamburger by dividing each bun into three
equal slices. One slice would be spread with mayonnaise and
sprinkled with chopped lettuce, then topped with a hamburger patty.
The top of the middle slice of bun would be spread with relish. The
bottom of the middle bun would be spread with mustard, and then the
last slice of bun would be spread with tomato ketchup (Bob used to
make his own, which was delicious) and chopped onions. The second
thin hamburger patty went on the onions.
</P>
<P>
   The genius of this was that nothing slid or flopped over the
edge of the bun, and the sandwich was no thicker than one's mouth.
(Most hamburgers are thick monsters. There should be a mouth
measure so you never have to buy these impossible-to-eat types!)
Bob Wyan's way of assembling hamburgers was sheer genius, but the
classic hamburger recipe I've given here uses the standard assembly
method.
</P>
<P>
   As for which popular dishes from today might become classics in
the future, I'd vote for grilled or roasted vegetables, which I see
frequently on restaurant menus and in recipes; simple, rustic
Mexican food; and brined meats and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   Brining _ the process of soaking meat in salted water for
preservation _ used to be a common practice before refrigeration.
Today it's purpose is more to tenderize and flavor meats.
</P>
<P>
   Some home cooks make a regular practice of brining pork, beef or
poultry several days before cooking and serving it. Judy Rodgers,
chef/owner of Zuni restaurant in San Francisco, has brined meats
for a long time with great results. Alice Waters of Chez Panisse
also has brined pork and poultry. She says her brined Thanksgiving
turkey (which she did at home) was the best she ever tasted.
</P>
<P>
   To see what differences brining might make, I bought four loin
pork chops, brined one for 24 hours and left the other unbrined.
After cooking both the same way and then tasting them, I found the
brined chop was more tender and had better flavor.
</P>
<P>
   I repeated the test with the remaining two chops, except that I
added rosemary sprigs to the brine and let the chop soak for 36
hours. This chop tasted even better than the 24-hour brined one. In
fact, it was so good I am going to try the method with chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two different brines you may want to try for yourself. &QL;

``Learning to Cook,'' ``Cooking With Children,'' ``The Fannie
Farmer Cookbook'' and ``The Breakfast Book,'' among others. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; COOKING TIMES FOR PORK CHOPS
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Fried pork chops retain their tenderness and moisture when they
aren't cooked to death. Following is a brief guide to cooking
times:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_ 1/2-inch-thick pork chops need only about 5 minutes per side
</P>
<P>
   _ 3/4-inch-thick pork chops need 8 minutes per side
</P>
<P>
   _ 1-inch-thick chops need 10 minutes per side.

 CHRON  
 A Great Restaurant Evolution Might be Just Around the Corner   By Robin Davis 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; It's 6 p.m. on a Friday and you want to go to
dinner with a couple of friends. But this is the Bay Area, where
last-minute restaurant reservations are hard to come by. Which
places will still have tables?
<P>
   You log onto the Web, do a search and snag a reservation at the
new restaurant at the top of everyone's list.
</P>
<P>
   Futuristic fantasy? Hardly. A San Francisco-based company,
www.opentable.com, plans to launch just such a service early next
month.
</P>
<P>
   It's just one of the innovations people in the restaurant
industry forecast for Bay Area diners in the coming millennium. The
already vibrant industry will continue to boom, they say, but just
how is a matter of debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every area of restaurants is going to escalate even more,''
says veteran restaurateur and designer Pat Kuleto. ``Food quality
will rise, service, wine, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But the form this quality will take will vary. Some see the
number of extravagant restaurants continuing to grow, while others
do not. Already high meal prices may keep skyrocketing, but value
may become more important. Some insist fusion will remain a viable
cuisine but others predict authentic regional specialties will
dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dellar, co-owner of One Market and Lark Creek
restaurants, foresees high-end places continuing to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think restaurants are fairly resilient to the economy,'' he
says. Excitement and service are the two factors he believes will
make restaurants successful in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are looking for an experience different from
home _ jazz piano, tableside presentation, dishes that blend
cuisines, he says.
</P>
<P>
   As for service, Dellar sees it becoming more important than
ever. ``With places like Walgreens and Home Depot, the service
element has become a lost art. Restaurants afford the opportunity
to be pampered.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, George Chen, who spent years on Wall Street
before bringing the Bay Area restaurants such as Betelnut and
Shanghai 1930, claims restaurants need a strong economy to succeed.
``People talk about us having a financial hangover when the economy
hits an air pocket,'' he says. ``I think we may have a food
hangover, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen believes customers will be looking to stretch their dollar
in the new millennium. ``I think people will need to see real value
in food beyond entertainment,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Walton of Fortune Public Relations, which specializes in
restaurant accounts, sees splashy restaurants continuing, but not
in San Francisco itself. ``The city is getting overbuilt and
restaurants are either being forced way South of Market by the ball
park or into the so-called suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who recently opened Xanadu and a LongLife Noodle Co. and
Jook Joint in Berkeley, agrees that San Francisco is
``over-restauranted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very wary of all the froth in the restaurant market,'' he
says. ``I don't think it can continue like it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kuleto, co-owner and designer of Boulevard, Farallon and
Jardiniere, takes a survival-of-the-fittest approach. ``We continue
to see a great evolution of restaurants,'' he says. Restaurants
that don't do well will close, while the best restaurants will just
get better.
</P>
<P>
   As for what those restaurants will serve, predictions again vary
widely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fusion is definitely here to stay,'' Chen says. ``It's part of
the world becoming more globalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Many are quick to point out that all food is really fusion.
``There's no purebred anything,'' says Judy Rodgers, chef-owner of
Zuni Cafe. Where fusion has failed is where it's forced, she says.
``What often gets the title of fusion is more intellectual, where
the intellectual is more important than sense the food makes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers sees restaurants' role partly as educational. ``We're in
a really great position to show people (food) choices that are
healthy, tasty, organic and local,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Rodgers feels people look to restaurants to set the trends in
food, rather than the home kitchen where food trends once got their
start. For her, restaurants will continue to have more of a
responsibility in how people eat. She calls it a ``trickle
sideways'' effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it seriously,'' she says.  &LR; ``By our choices, we (can)
show what makes sense to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does make sense for the new millennium?  &LR; Many believe
that fusion, the catchword of the '80s and '90s, will still
dominate menus.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry people are busy trying to figure out what the next
hot cuisine will be.  &LR; Kuleto sees a resurgence of meat and a new
dominance of farm-raised seafood in diners' future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aquaculture is just beginning to poke its head out,'' he
predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Susie Biehler, a restaurant public relations specialist,
believes the exploration of American food will be the next hot
trend, with an emphasis on meat and small plates.
</P>
<P>
   Chen says he gets a kick out of seeing foods that have been made
for hundreds of years all of a sudden turning into a trend.
``Indian food is hot now,'' he says, ``but that's just because it's
under-explored.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Rodgers agrees, laughing that ``people probably didn't make the
same dishes for thousands of years because they were lousy.''
</P>
<P>
   But she hesitates at a prediction. ``Trends come faster. They
bloom faster,'' she realizes. But because trends tend to fade, she
hopes people just find something new they like and ``pause on it.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; And while in the very near future cyberspace may help customers
get restaurant reservations, one of the few things it won't be able
to replace is the restaurant experience itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is trying to bank on the Internet,'' says Chen, ``but
it's not going to get you good food in a good location with good
service. I don't think you can commercialize restaurants that
way.''

CIVIL FORFEITURE LAWS HAVE TURNED POLICE INTO PIRATES 
 &HT;

<TEXT>
<P>
   To see how money corrupts law enforcement agencies, look at the
effects of asset forfeiture laws. A police officer can take all the
money you are carrying and the car you are driving when stopped --
on the mere suspicion that you are a drug dealer -- yet never
charge you with a crime. And it will take you years and thousands
of dollars to recover your property -- if it is even possible to
recover it. Your car may have been sold already or badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   In such forfeiture, called a civil asset forfeiture because you
were never charged with a crime, you must prove in a court of law
that the money and the car are legally yours and were never
involved in some crime. In other words, you have to prove you are
an innocent party -- and, stupid as it sounds, you may have to
prove that your property is innocent, too. The government doesn't
have to prove you were guilty of anything.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be easy to prove you are the legal owner of the
car, it is far more difficult to prove the money you were carrying
is money you earned at your job. Imagine how hard it would be to
prove your car or money were never used to facilitate a crime.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney can cost you thousands of dollars to sue for
recovery of your property. Legal counsel is not provided in such
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in similar situations simply let it go and don't try
to recover their property. Why spend $6,000 on attorney fees to
recover $5,000?
</P>
<P>
   Federal, state and local law enforcement officials put the money
gained from forfeitures into their agencies' accounts and buy new
police cars, hire more law enforcement agents and, in some
instances, use the ill-gained dollars to throw self-congratulatory
parties or buy trucks and sports cars for members of the law
enforcement team to keep as their own.
</P>
<P>
   The preeminent constitutional scholar Leonard W. Levy calls the
current laws of asset forfeiture `A License to Steal,` the title of
his 1996 book on the subject of forfeitures of property. And,
indeed, they are.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of the misuse of these forfeiture laws is
compelling. The evidence demands a change in the laws. The civil
forfeiture laws are unAmerican. They attack the basic right of
property and individual ownership. No matter what the U.S. Supreme
Court has ruled, at heart, these civil forfeiture laws are
unconstitutional. Under the current federal forfeiture statutes no
law-abiding citizen's property is safe from seizure.
</P>
<P>
   The 1984 Comprehensive Forfeiture Act, passed by Congress,
turned law enforcement officers into pirates -- the spoils being
the property of innocent citizens. The American Civil Liberties
Union states that `nearly 80 percent of the victims of forfeiture
have never been indicted of a crime.`
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, 1992, the Pittsburgh Press reported that Tracy
Thomas had $13,000 taken from her by local police. The police were
searching for drugs allegedly sold by Thomas' godson. A state judge
ordered police to return the money to Thomas. Instead, the police
turned the money over to the Drug Enforcement Administration which
is immune to the state courts order.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, 1992, the Orlando Sentinel reported that Ken Brown's
Florida business, Chemco International, was raided because agents
of the DEA found his company's labels in a methamphetamine lab. The
chemicals Brown sold are legal to sell in small quantities. Among
his customers were the U.S. Forest Service and the Florida State
Fish and Game Commission. DEA agents raided Brown's home because an
informant described Brown as the leader of a motorcycle gang.
Federal agents used the forfeiture laws to seize Brown's business,
$300,000 in inventory, his home and cars. Brown was never convicted
of a drug crime. The DEA offered to release his house and cars to
Brown, if he surrendered his legitimate business.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 4, 1993, Newsweek reported that Gary and Kathy Bergman
of South Dakota had their house taken after federal agents found
that a house guest possessed marijuana. Agents also found traces of
marijuana in a car owned by the Bergmans's daughter. The house was
never returned to the Bergmans even though they were never charged
with a federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 18, 1998, the Houston Chronicle reported that federal
agents seized the Red Carpet Inn located in South Houston. A number
of customers of the hotel were accused of drug trafficking. The
hotel owners were not accused of participating in the illegal
activity; nevertheless, the hotel was taken.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals admonished the
DEA for assisting the Plaquemines Parish (La.) Sheriff's Office in
circumventing Louisiana law. The sheriff had taken over $12,000 in
cash from Jeffery Scarabin, a suspected drug dealer. All the
charges against Scarabin were dismissed for lack of evidence, yet
the sheriff's office never returned the money taken from Scarabin,
even when ordered to do so by a state court. Someone in the
sheriff's office bought a cashier's check forthe amount of money
taken from Scarabin. The check was then handed over to the DEA as a
civil forfeiture under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the U.S. Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals accused the
Missouri Highway Patrol and the DEA of conspiring to ignore
Missouri law by not turning over $844,000 seized from Dennis Cole
who had been stopped for speeding. He was never charged with any
drug activities.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers like the Kansas City Star, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,
Miami Herald, St. Petersburg Times, Orlando Sentinel, Hartford
Courant, San Jose Mercury News, Louisville Courier-Journal,
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch have all
documented various local and regional shady deals law enforcement
agencies at every level have made using civil asset forfeiture
laws. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., used many of these news reports in
his 1995 book, `Forfeiting Our Property Rights,` to prove the law
must be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has sponsored a bill (H.R. 1658), the Civil Asset
Forfeiture Reform Act, to return some sanity to law enforcement and
restore due process to the current civil asset forfeiture laws. On
June 24, the bill passed in the House by an overwhelming majority,
375 to 48. It has been read in the Senate twice and referred to the
Senate Committee on the Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires law enforcement agencies to have greater proof
of criminal activity before seizing property. It provides
court-appointed attorneys so that citizens can challenge a
forfeiture without cost to themselves. The bill gives property
owners who have been found innocent, or never charged, a right to
get their seized property back in a specific, short time period.
And the bill provides compensation to property owners for damage to
their property or for the loss of that property when it was in
government control.
</P>
<P>
   Time to call your senators and demand a quick passage of Hyde's
forfeiture reform bill. The longer we wait, the greater the risk to
your property -- the greater the risk to honest law enforcement.

PLAYWRIGHT PURGES PERSONAL DEMONS BY TURNING THEM INTO A MUSICAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Immediately noticeable about Leslie Jordan, besides his bantam
size, is his drawl. It's squeakily spry and not as dramatic or Deep
South as, say, that of Scarlett O'Hara, but it evokes her spirit.
More proof that, even though Jordan is a longtime Los Angeles
resident, you can't take the South out of the Southerner.
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence is found in his works, including his 1991
autobiographical musical ``Hysterical Blindness and Other Southern
Tragedies That Have Plagued My Life Thus Far,'' which played for a
year in Los Angeles in 1991 and ran for seven months off-Broadway
in '95. The show unfolds in 13 scenes about growing up in a
Tennessee Baptist home, and the difficulties and lessons that come
with it, especially for a male discovering he's gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a purge,'' the Tennessee native says about putting his
life on stage. ``In many ways, my devils have set me free.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to say, however, that Jordan wants to broadcast his life
through the stage. ``I will never be confessional again,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At 4-foot-11 _ ``I'm no bigger than a wore-out bar of soap,'' he
says _ he makes up for his stature with a big personality befitting
a man who has devoted himself to writing, acting and directing.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been only for the stage, though. Among his TV gigs are
the NBC crime drama ``Reasonable Doubts'' with Mark Harmon,
``Hearts Afire'' with John Ritter and Markie Post, and many guest
spots on shows such as ``Dharma and Greg, Ellen, Caroline in the
City'' and ``Lois and Clark'' (remember ``Resplendent Man?'').
</P>
<P>
   As much as he loves acting, Jordan's true passion is writing,
something he has done since he first read Eudora Welty's short
story ``Why I Live at the P.O.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the scary monsters under the bed moan, it's time to get
up and write,'' he says. And he's not talking about dust bunnies.
</P>
<P>
   Known for entertaining dinner-party guests with colorful stories
about his childhood, he decided to compile them all into
``Hysterical Blindness.'' ``My original idea was to sit on a stool
and spin yarns,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show received favorable reviews in LA, it didn't do
so well with the New York critics. Jordan thinks it's because the
play is not linear, and also because New Yorkers can't wait to
lambaste stuff coming from Los Angeles, where theater isn't nearly
as important as making a buck in television and/or film. Jordan
admits that his original intention in writing ``Hysterical
Blindness'' was to promote himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In LA, we do theater to showcase ourselves for television and
movie roles,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Barry, a friend who directed the Los Angeles and New
York runs, suggested adding a gospel choir. That's when they nabbed
composer/lyricist Joe Patrick Ward, who grew up in a Louisiana
Baptist home. ``At first I wanted to go with traditional hymns,''
Ward says. ``But there's not that many available (for free,) so we
started writing our own.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the tunes, ``God Loves the Baptists,'' is a ditty about
God's love for the white and Baptist (think `Red, White and Tuna's'
Smut Snatchers singing _ ``white and white and white and white,
they are precious in his sight'').
</P>
<P>
   Jordan many projects in the works, and he can't help dreaming
about the day when one his scripts becomes a blockbuster movie. He
has thought of buying a lake house where he would sit on the porch
and write.
</P>
<P>
   Until that second thought kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, I wouldn't last two days.''

 Student's Guide To Science   By DAVID GRIMES    
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a student, I was never very good at science, a deficiency
that manifests itself annually when I attempt to help my son with
his science fair project.
</P>
<P>
   (Our last project was a ground-breaking examination of how high
various brands of golf balls bounce. The teacher, no doubt feeling
pity, gave us a B.)
</P>
<P>
   So I feel a certain sympathy for and kinship with these
unidentified but quite possibly real fifth- and sixth-graders who
were required by some annoying adult authority figure, most likely
a teacher, to define or explain various scientific terms and
principles:
</P>
<P>
   ``A city purifies its water supply by filtering the water and
then forcing it through an aviator.''
</P>
<P>
   This explains why airlines are having trouble recruiting new
pilots and it also explains why so many people these days are
turning to bottled water. It seems to me that pilots have enough to
worry about, like landing at the right airport or avoiding oncoming
mountains, without having to purify a city's water supply at the
same time. Clearly, we need to devise a better system.
</P>
<P>
   ``A census taker is a man who goes from house to house
increasing the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike with pilots, there is no shortage of men applying for the
job of census taker. Perhaps if we forced water through them, that
would cool their jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The four seasons are salt, pepper, mustard and vinegar.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. You're forgetting the all-important fifth season, Tabasco
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alimentary canal is located in the northern part of
Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a tough one to swallow. I always thought the pancreas was
located in northern Indiana and the alimentary canal was located in
northwestern New York. Or maybe I'm thinking of Love Canal. I
wasn't very good at geography, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so hot in some places that people there have to live in
other places.''
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly the case in Florida, where, in the summer, 80
percent of the people who live here live somewhere else, and the
other 20 percent wish they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inhabitants of Moscow are Mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason why people who live in some places have to live
in other places. It could also explain why Russians are having such
a tough time revving up their economy, what with all the money they
spend on bug spray. Still, you've got to think the world is a safer
place with Russia's nuclear arsenal in the hands (mandibles?) of
bloodsucking insects rather than vodka-swilling people.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main causes of dust is janitors.''
</P>
<P>
   True, just like teachers are the main cause of homework and
journalists are the main cause of corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``For asphyxiation, apply artificial respiration until the
patient is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he doesn't kick off fast enough, try applying the
Heimlich maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ``A monsoon is a French gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   A poltroon, on the other hand, is a French chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday we might discover magnets that can point in any
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a reason to look forward to the new millennium. How
tedious it's been, all these centuries, to have to put up with
compasses that only point north.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vacuums are nothings. We only mention them to let them know we
know they are there.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say that vacuums are very much like French
gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``To keep milk from turning sour, keep it in the cow.''
</P>
<P>
   Beer, on the other hand, should be freed from its bottle as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how clouds are formed, but clouds know how to do
it, and that's the important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much my attitude toward all things scientific.
</P>

SMALL TOUCHES BUILD A HOME  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARY J. LOFTUS    
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Souvenir plates on the kitchen wall. A ficus tree leaning toward
the living room window. A woven rug by the bed. A small statue in
the backyard flower garden.
</P>
<P>
   Every place I've lived, from a dorm room to our family's
farmhouse, has had certain touches that made it feel like home.
</P>
<P>
   With our family's last move, I've discovered we have boxes of
such accessories, from big, colorful potholders and quirky
refrigerator magnets (my favorite is Einstein in his winter coat)
to the children's first stuffed animals and home-from-the hospital
outfits.
</P>
<P>
   I could line every wall in our house with precious memorabilia,
worth nothing but the memories it inspires.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a generic house feel like a private, familiar haven?
</P>
<P>
   According to last month's House and Garden, the trend toward
``luxury'' in home items _ creme brulee, dessert trays,
high-thread-count sheets, espresso machines, velvet couch pillows _
are really a move toward crafting a place of one's own.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have loosened up a bit,'' said Brooke Stoddard, senior
editor of the magazine. ``Luxury doesn't have to be
status-oriented; it can be very personal.''
</P>
<P>
   With the move toward scaling back on high-powered careers and
outside obligations, people are home more, she says. And ``once you
start spending more time there, you pay more attention to
details.''
</P>
<P>
   Among some of the trendy ways the magazine's editors suggest
capturing 1990s personalized luxury:
</P>
<P>
   _ An overstuffed, comfortable reading chair to curl up in with a
novel or magazine, complete with a good reading lamp and ottoman.
Remember Archie Bunker? He knew the value of a good chair. One that
fits just right. (My father-in-law recently insisted on buying an
old, ratty recliner from us that we were afraid wouldn't be picked
up for $10 at our moving sale. ``Sure, I could buy a new one,'' he
says, ``but this is the one I rocked Adam and Sarah to sleep in
when they were babies.'')
</P>
<P>
   _ The smell of freshly dried clothes. Folks who study home
trends say we'll see a resurgence of the ``drying lawn,'' a
protected, grassy place where you can put up an old-fashioned
clothesline and air-dry laundry. My mom was a big clothesline fan,
and I do remember the crisp smell of sheets that had been softened
by a summer breeze. Despite what the commercials would have us
believe, kids may not link nostalgic memories like that to the
boxed fragrance of Snuggles and Bounce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Big, generous napkins in 24- or 36-inch-squares. My family has
never been much for cloth napkins. We're not even a paper napkin
crowd. A square of paper towel folded vertically has always proven
effective, if not quaintly charming.
</P>
<P>
   I can see the appeal of fluffy linens, however. Just like a
dessert that is prepared and served with care, the table setting
can mean the difference between a shared meal and a bunch of food.
</P>
<P>
   I have a friend who carefully sets her table every night, down
to napkin rings and china. With two teen-age boys, her life gets as
hectic as anyone's. But she knows that her family will reconnect at
this table, and find a central place of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite place in our new house is the deck right off the
kitchen, which extends from the second-story over the back yard.
Our neighbor is a gardener, so his back yard frames ours with the
gold of a fish pond, the red of a geranium, the stone gray of a
birdbath. We eat dinner there a lot, taking advantage of this
year's slow transition to fall, so the kids can run around the
porch while Jim and I sip sweet tea and look at the pine trees and
dogwoods that reach toward the darkening sky. I may still use paper
towels as napkins, but the natural wonder of being outside adds a
touch of luxury to any meal.
</P>
<P>
   During our move, though, I discovered a surprising thing about
our family's definition of home. Most of our things were in place,
the throw rugs were down, furniture arranged, even a few paintings
on the wall. The kids were settling into their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, something was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jim went back to Florida and returned in a rental van with
our dogs, cats and bird.
</P>
<P>
   Our 11-year-old German shepherd walked through the door, tags
jingling and decided on a new favorite spot.
</P>
<P>
   OK, we all seemed to decide at once. Now, it's home.

<P>
   SANTA FE , N.M. _ Like summer lightning across the mesas,
history seems startlingly close here.
</P>
<P>
   As Ramon Jose Lopez, an artist, stands in the family chapel of
his home, the light filtering through windows made of rock crystal
onto his hand-adzed altarpieces, it doesn't seem so long ago that
the foothills here were marked by cornfields, rather than
condominiums, and farmers traded their maize for his grandfather's
hand-carved images of saints.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, 47, and his family have filled their homemade chapel with
their art: santos, silver reliquaries, exquisite prayer books made
from buffalo hide, altarpieces painted with yellow ochre he gathers
from caves in the Sandia Mountains. Their artisanship echoes the
days of Spanish colonial New Mexico, when mission churches were
gloriously decorated with the materials at hand and art was a
staple of family life, father teaching son and a mother her
daughters, working alongside numerous aunts, uncles and cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our culture we've always tried to pass knowledge on to our
children,'' said Lopez, whose pieces are in the Smithsonian
Institution and who just opened the Good Hands Gallery here to
showcase Hispanic work. ``Art reflects back to us the strength of
religion that helped families through hard times.''
</P>
<P>
   The rich artistic legacy of Spanish colonial New Mexico, much of
it still crafted at home, is increasingly visible in a state where
40 percent of the population is Hispanic, and it's not uncommon to
see santos sold from pickup trucks by the side of the road. For
nearly 300 New Mexican artists and artisans _ including Lopez and
his twin sons, Bo and Miller, 16 _ it will reach a crescendo on
July 24 and 25 at the annual Traditional Spanish Market in Santa
Fe, the country's oldest and largest setting for traditional
Hispanic work.
</P>
<P>
   The event, sponsored by the nonprofit Spanish Colonial Arts
Society, has grown from 35 exhibitors in 1982 to 170 weavers,
tinsmiths, santeros (makers of santos), embroiderers, jewelers and
furniture makers, along with 100 young artisans, 7 to 17, whose
fingers in preparation are bonded with glue and whose kitchens are
fragrant with simmering homemade dyes. (Embroiderer's recipe: Pick
juniper and sagebrush. Soak four days in coffee can. Add yarn.
Boil.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the Spanish Market is not yet so well known or
glamorous as Santa Fe's famous Indian Market in August, which
attracts jet-setting, concha-belt-wearing collectors, David Revere
McFadden, curator of the American Craft Museum in New York,
believes ``it's only a matter of time and exposure'' before it
rivals its cousin. The Heard Museum in Phoenix and the Taylor
Museum of the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center have begun Spanish
markets, and the National Museum of American Art of the Smithsonian
is among many museums collecting the work of today's Hispanic New
Mexican artists and artisans. In Santa Fe, a 1932 adobe house
designed by John Gaw Meem, the form-giver of local architecture and
an early member of the arts society , has been donated as the first
permanent home for 2,500 objects in its collection, some dating
back to the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   The art of Hispanic New Mexico has been the art of making do
ever since its settlers began scratching a living in isolated
villages on the fringes of the Spanish empire. Lacking Roman
Catholic priests, the devout turned to itinerant painters to craft
devotional images. The art of straw applique, in which tiny pieces
of straw are smoothed and flattened to a lustrous sheen and inlaid
in wood, often on a crucifix, is still called ``poor man's gold.''
Designed for homes and churches, these images were at once
utilitarian and deeply religious, a vibrant blend of the everyday
and the miraculous.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the tradition of home craftsmanship continues, often in
houses of adobe bricks and wood beams that accrete rooms with each
new family member. Some artists support themselves with the Spanish
Market. ``Oh, man, it can make or break you for a year,'' said
David C. de Baca, 51, a furniture maker from La Cienega. Kathleen
Sais Lerner, 43, a third-grade teacher in Los Lunas, moonlights as
a colcha embroiderer, helping to revive the fast, thick stitching
unique to the region.
</P>
<P>
   In households like Eliseo and Paula Rodriguez's in Santa Fe,
straw applique is as natural as supper, with Paula and Eliseo and
their children and grandchildren gathered around the dining room
table, set with glue, razor blades and straw.
</P>
<P>
   For many Spanish Market artists, art is a crucial link to
culture and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived a double life,'' said Irvin Trujillo, 43, a
seventh-generation weaver from the centuries-old weaving village of
Chimayo, whose childhood was divided between it and Los Alamos,
where his father, Jacobo O. Trujillo, a venerated weaver, worked as
a government property manager. ``On weekends, we lived in the
Hispanic world, cutting weeds in the chili fields and putting away
alfalfa with a pitchfork,'' he said. ``Monday to Friday, we lived
in the American one, with paved roads and metal houses.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like many Chimayo weavers, Trujillo grew up making congitas, or
small blankets, for the tourist trade. ``It drove me crazy,'' he
said. He eventually abandoned weaving for an engineering degree.
Feeling adrift in his 20s, he returned to his father's tradition,
resurrecting long-lost dye recipes from his father's Work Projects
Administration ledger book. ``My father was on the loom the day he
retired from the government,'' Trujillo reminisced. He now weaves
side by side with his wife, Lisa, at their studio, Centinela
Traditional Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, their raw material, a flock of churro sheep, grazed
blissfully in the pasture, beside chili pepper fields. The churro
is a traditional breed whose fleece is prized by native American
and Hispanic weavers for being easy to spin. Ms. Trujillo pointed
out her favorite-color sheep, a sweet-faced ewe with a bell around
her neck who is considered ``a genetic oddity _ a redhead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trujillos are known as innovators for applying natural dyes
from plants like chamisa and yellow clover to Chimayo blankets,
which typically had red, white and black commercial dyes. Like a
growing number of Spanish Market artists, they follow tradition but
take off from it. Trujillo has designed a blanket inspired by David
Bowie's Ziggy Stardust period, now in the permanent collection of
the Smithsonian, and he combines native banded motifs with images
like a space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   What constitutes tradition has been debated since the Spanish
Market's inception in 1929, when the arts society's conservative
faction insisted that artists base their designs on historical
prototypes. The guidelines have loosened over the years. Vendors
feel free to sell objects like woven cell phone covers and Spanish
colonial potty chairs. ``There are inconsistencies,'' said Bud
Redding, the society's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   But many artists, including Luis Tapia, 49, who has a one-man
show at Owings-Dewey Fine Art in Santa Fe, have defected,
considering the emphasis on traditional art too confining.
(Photography, for example, would not be included, although it could
be found at the smaller Contemporary Hispanic Market over the same
weekend.)
</P>
<P>
   Tapia, who considers himself a modern-day santero, does what he
calls ``traditional work that experiments with what's happening to
my culture today.'' The Hispanic low-rider car culture is a
frequent theme for him. Inspired by his mother's saint-decorated
dashboard, he observes that in his world, ``cars have been like
religious altars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think tradition means replicating the past,'' he
added. ``That becomes stifling to a culture. Tradition is in your
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Lawrence Baca, 37, a silversmith, welcome the
emphasis on tradition, at least for one weekend. ``In silverwork
you can go way out there,'' said Baca, whose robust forms draw on
old pawn Navajo jewelry. ``This way I can dip into the traditional,
then jump back.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen R. Locero, the new director of visual arts for the
National Hispanic Cultural Center of New Mexico, to open next year
in Albuquerque, observed that breakthrough artists like Tapia and
Lopez are not so plentiful as they should be. ``Folk art produced
by a minority has always been accepted,'' she said. ``But there is
still an elitist attitude about accepting the work as fine art.''
</P>
<P>
   McFadden notes that typically in the art world, ``the ones who
emerge are usually the artists who completely absorb the tradition
but aren't stifled by it.''
</P>
<P>
   These issues may ultimately be resolved in the warm confines of
Eliseo and Paula Rodriguez's handcrafted dining room and in other
places where traditions are being passed from grandparents to
grandchildren. ``Boy, it gets packed here, I'm telling you,'' said
Mrs. Rodriguez, 84.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, 83, started out as an oil painter before reviving
straw applique in the 1930s under the WPA, which somewhat
paternalistically encouraged him to give up painting for craft. He
never regretted the change. Next to a handmade spice rack in the
kitchen, an image of ``The Last Supper'' hangs beside a photograph
of Franklin D. Roosevelt. ``To me, he's the greatest father we ever
had in our country,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Now a daughter, Vicki, 43, and five grandchildren _ Phillip, 32,
Marcial, 20, Jessica, 18, Gabriel 16, and Monica, 14 _ are creating
their own applique, instead of ``working in fast-food places'' like
their friends, as Gabriel put it. Last summer, Monica, earned
enough money to buy a television and a VCR. ``This summer, I'm very
motivated,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Fe, Ramon Jose Lopez, the painter, never knew his
grandfather, but he's reaching out to him, rebuilding the tiny San
Ysidro chapel, which Lorenzo Lopez Sr. created out of fieldstone on
a rocky promontory. He's kept the original 1926 wooden turnstile
gate, once designed to keep goats out. Today, once again, it lets
worshipers in.
</P>
<P>
   In Chimayo, Trujillo finds himself wishing he could talk to the
grandfather he never met. ``I would ask him how he dried fleeces in
the sun on the patio, or did they spin in the evenings when they
came in from the fields?'' he said wistfully. ``These are questions
I still have.''

   Now these parents must confront computer-conversant children who
want explanations for lightning, dinosaurs, how the human body
functions and how the heavens work.
</P>
<P>
   An encyclopedia or science text won't always suffice. Science
comprises facts, processes and phenomena along with a method of
exploration that involves forming and testing hypotheses. Children
may be able to recite an explanation, but true understanding is
very likely to require deeper involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to experiment with actual objects _ plants and
animals, pulleys and pendulums, an apple as Earth and an orange as
the Sun,'' said Sarah Beth Corning, the science teacher at the
Village Infant Center in Manhattan. ``Hands-on science is fun,
understandable and very real.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where science software comes in. At their best, these
programs allow children to form hypotheses and test them by
changing variables and seeing how those changes would actually play
out. Thanks to full-motion video, children can watch blood flow,
mix chemicals or construct a circuit without having blood,
chemicals or batteries on hand or on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they can try out ideas and manipulate objects
just to see what happens. That's hard to do at home, and even in
school, in part because it can be difficult (and costly) to redo
experiments and in part because an experiment gone awry can be a
major problem.
</P>
<P>
   The only danger with the software, Ms. Corning said, is the
possibility that overenthusiastic parents will wrest control of the
mouse from their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet, in the best educational settings _ be it in the
classroom, before a computer or in a lab _ experiments that don't
go as expected can be powerful learning experiences,'' said Arthur
Pober, an educational psychologist and child and family counselor
who is executive director of the Entertainment Software Rating
Board.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting science software for young children, roughly ages 4
to 8, Pober advised looking for ``exposure and interest'':
introductory programs that expose children to a range of subjects
and put them at ease with something that is part of daily life, and
subject-specific programs that play to a youngster's budding
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Children should be placed in the role of explorer-experimenter.
And the programs should emphasize in their games and activities _
invariably, science principles are embedded in challenges of some
kind _ observation, deductive reasoning, educated guesses and
building on what the child has learned. Activities should offer
adjustable levels of difficulty, and they should go beyond the
presentation of facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids need to discover for themselves why things are as they
are and how things work,'' Pober said. ``Then they'll own that
knowledge.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

<P>
   THINKIN' SCIENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Edmark; $29.95; Windows 3.1 and later or Macintosh 7.0.1 and
later; ages 6 to 8.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This software has the scientific method _ hypothesis,
experimentation, observation and deduction _ at its heart, as well
as stunning graphics. Guided by Carrie, a paper bag, youngsters
enter a child-built Super Secret Science Station, a box containing
a radar screen and spidery Science Web. The radar pinpoints the
location of Bobbie (a sock), Buddy (a leaf) and Einstone (you
guessed it, a rock), who scout out science challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Click on a scout's location and engage in one of five ``learning
environments.'' The Science Web offers supplemental information
related to three of the environments. Most information appears in
print and is also read aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Children explore the physics of motion in Fun Physics by
adjusting ramps, catapults and pendulums to launch weighted balls
over barriers and at moving targets. Or they can try knocking
oranges out of trees.
</P>
<P>
   To observe, store observations and accurately recall them is a
prerequisite for scientists and a valuable life skill. What Did You
See? helps children develop strategies for remembering which
animals they saw where in increasingly complex scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters can then discover how sunlight and Earth's tilted
axis and rotation interact to create day and night.
</P>
<P>
   Children use various tools to study the characteristics of
animals and their habitats in Animal Tracks. Even more reasoning is
needed to play Mystery Cave, whose denizen can be discovered by
gathering and analyzing data about its size, color, smell, shape,
texture and weight. It is a kind of what's-behind-curtain-No. 1
game show for the younger set.
</P>
<P>
   The user's guide is a trove of information regarding how
children think and learn, and what each activity is supposed to
teach. Parents can check their children's progress. They can also
set up the program so that it appropriately increases each
activity's level of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   The handful of suggestions for experiments grown-ups and
children can perform together _ like using playground equipment as
simple machines _ are a welcome reminder that science is all around
us and that parents are an important part of their children's
education.
</P>
<P>
   The rewards for solving science challenges are printable
``treasures,'' like animal masks. That did not prevent some
activities from boring an 8-year-old. But then youngsters can use
Science Web to try to fathom scientific principles and make their
own discoveries. &QL;

   DINOSAUR ADVENTURE 3-D &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Knowledge Adventure; $19.95; Windows 95 and later or Macintosh
OS 7.5.1 and later; ages 4 to 8.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once children get past a gratuitously violent opening scene of
Tyrannosaurus Rex chomping on local scenery (one youngster testing
this CD-ROM jumped as the gnashing jaws came straight at him), they
will find a benign but entertaining and informative program about a
favorite subject for this age group. The premise is simple: T. Rex
has invaded Paleo Island, causing a panic among the resident
dinosaurs, who abandon their eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Players help Rolf the Parasarolophus and his friend, Pterrance
the Pteranodon, find and hatch nine eggs, so that together they can
teach T. Rex a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Hatching an egg means collecting three crystals and finding the
egg. Earn crystals by playing any of six games, divided among the
island's three sectors _ Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Finding
the eggs means recalling what you've learned about dinosaurs and
puzzling through Pterrance's clues.
</P>
<P>
   The games are fun and seductive, with variable levels of
difficulty and lifelike animation _ while Rolf, Pterrance and the
hatchlings are cartoony, most everything else looks as though it
came from the computer kiosks of a natural history museum.
</P>
<P>
   In Triassic Tar Pits, youngsters help Rolf make his way among
floating objects that sink suddenly, to rescue a baby dinosaur from
an island in the tar pits. (The youngest players may need adult
assistance to avoid terminal frustration.) The Triassic
Connect-a-Cave involves creating a map with a limited number of
winding-path tiles so that Rolf can assist a lost dinosaur. It's
easier than it sounds and harder than it looks.
</P>
<P>
   In the island's Jurassic sector, reassemble a dinosaur skeleton
playing Bone Builder, or guide Rolf through a jungle to rescue a
stranded Brachiosaurus _ a comparatively boring, low-information
activity. The Cretaceous sector offers Scrambled Eggs, in which
players match eggs (only those that are free on one side and with
no eggs above them are available for selection) until none are
left, and Galloping Gallimimuses, who need to be steered out of a
canyon to safety and away from a rampaging T. Rex.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, children can click on plants, animals, bones and
stones _ or visit Crystal Cave Movie Theater _ to have Rolf recount
fascinating data about dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Dinosaur Adventure has a few drawbacks. Information is often
presented at a fast pace. But three 6- year-olds who tested the
software returned to it several times over a series of days. The
repetition paid off as names and facts started to stick.
</P>
<P>
   Parents need to make clear that hatching crystals are a fiction.
And as is the case with all such subjects, the information
presented is only as accurate as the state of the science when the
software was created. One hopes that the creators of Dinosaur
Adventure tune in to new developments in the field and adjust the
product accordingly. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BUMPTZ SCIENCE CARNIVAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Theatrix/Sanctuary Woods; $22.49; Windows 3.1 and later or
Macintosh OS 7.0 and later; ages 6 to 10.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a comforting lack of sophistication to the scenes and
characters at the Great Galaxies Amusement Park. Picture, for
example, the Bumptz, who resemble multicolored olives (sans
pimento) or roundish grapes with toothy grins, barbell frowns and
oval eyes perched on their all-head bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Even the plot is simple: Some Bumptz go on an intergalactic
field trip to the amusement park on the planet Snoot. Their bus
crash-lands at the park gates. While joining the Bumptz in the
park's fun and games, children can try, if they wish, to win the
five parts needed to repair the bus.
</P>
<P>
   But as with other Theatrix titles, there is nothing
simple-minded about the lessons this science program teaches. Using
more than 200 animated puzzles, with three skill levels, it guides
children into collecting data, forming and testing hypotheses,
comparing results and trying a new or improved approach _ in short,
thinking like scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Clump-O-Matic, for example, is an addictive contest of wits that
combines observation, data gathering and sorting and classifying
Bumptz in a kind of souped-up tick-tack-toe. At the Photon-O-Tron,
players experiment with the properties of light as they bounce
Bumptz off angled planes and through lenses in an effort to sink
them, billiard-like, into the designated hole.
</P>
<P>
   Magnets and force fields are the tools of choice in
Magnet-O-Whirl, while visitors to the Bubblearium toy with factors
like buoyancy, viscosity and weight.
</P>
<P>
   The games are set up similarly, but the variations on play seem
infinite. And at the highest skill level, youngsters can create
their own science-based puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 6-year-olds who test-drove this product, that wasn't
the best part. Science Carnival offers 12 animated features _ like
mini episodes of ``The Magic School Bus'' or ``Science Court'' _ on
subjects like prisms, gravity and magnetic force fields. As
entertaining, lucid, memorable explanations of natural phenomena
and scientific principles, these alone are worth the price of park
admission.
</P>
<P>
   There is more, however. Science Carnival, which presents in
printable form 19 hands-on experiments to perform at home,
underscores the importance of learning by actually, not virtually,
doing. Steam up a bathroom, for example, turn off the light and
watch what happens to a flashlight beam as the light waves bounce
off water droplets.
</P>
<P>
   Easy to assemble and relying as they do on objects most families
have in the house, the experiments impress children as eminently
do-able _ so they get done. And the explanations of what is
happening enhances the ``Aha!'' effect, which in 6-year-olds
manifested itself as an intake of breath and a chorus of ``Cool!''

FOR KOSOVARS, AN ONLINE PHONE DIRECTORY OF A PEOPLE IN EXILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID S. BENNAHUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Agron Shala, 17, hadn't seen or heard from his
uncle since March, when Agron fled his home in Prizren, Kosovo.
Serb forces had driven his family out of its home and over the
border to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, after a difficult overland trip, Agron and his
mother, father and sister found themselves in Tirana, living with
2,000 other refugees in a camp in a former public park. Like many
refugees, the members of Agron's family _ especially the men _ had
been scattered by Serbs. Many of their fates were unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Agron was handed a yellow book by Paul Meyer, an American worker
with the International Rescue Committee, that listed the names of
Kosovar Albanians, their hometowns and current locations, and he
was thrilled to find his uncle listed in a seaside camp near the
Albanian port town of Durres, an hour's drive away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is him,'' Agron said. ``He is alive. I could only hope
this would be true.'' His family, standing beside him, resolved to
send a message to Agron's uncle.
</P>
<P>
   They had found him through what was essentially a phone book of
an entire country on the move. For refugees cut off from the rest
of the world, this information was precious, a first step toward
retracing the bonds of family and friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Compiled in two weeks, the Kosovar Yellow Pages, as Meyer called
it, is both a Web site and a printed book. ``It works both ways,''
explained Meyer, the book's publisher. ``Kosovars overseas with
Internet access can read the book on line and add their names and
location to it. And those in the Balkans without access can get a
printed version.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, 28, a native of New York City and a former speechwriter
in the Clinton White House, decided to leave politics for a career
in international refugee relief. His focus is on using new media
like the Internet to aid refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In previous refugee crises _ in Lebanon, for instance, or West
Africa _ families found each other through word-of-mouth, or by
luck as their names were read on television or radio. But with
nearly 900,000 Kosovar refugees, Meyer figured that these
traditional means would be ineffective. In addition, unlike in some
other crises, families in Kosovo had been split up.
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with the pace of the exodus, made it extremely
difficult for traditional media to keep up with the movements. In
an 11-day period in April, for example, 310,000 refugees left
Kosovo, according to a United Nations report, and a total of
657,600 have returned in the past month, according to the United
States Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   An array of relief agencies, philanthropies and corporations
worked to help reunify families. The International Committee for
the Red Cross broadcast radio messages from families with missing
people and placed 6,000 names on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Additional Web sites emerged, including one run by the
Association for Democratic Initiatives in Macedonia, which placed
more than 70,000 names on line. Local Albanian television, radio
and newspapers listed names of families daily.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in conjunction with several sponsors, including
Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, tried to create a system for reuniting
Kosovar refugees and issuing new identity cards for families
without them. But keeping up with the movement of people was
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Either the technological structures were too complex to
implement quickly or getting permission from individual refugees to
list their names was too time-consuming. In addition, the various
lists of names weren't combined into one database, making it
difficult to know which organization to approach first.
</P>
<P>
   The phone directory, known as the Kosovo Family Finder, became
the most effective solution, through its blend of high and low
technology. The names were culled from the various relief
databases.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer printed 10,000 copies of the book in Albania in mid-June.
Four thousand made their way into Kosovo, delivered by NATO and
relief convoys. The remaining 6,000 were distributed throughout
Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro by cooperating relief agencies,
to Kosovar refugees living with host families and in refugee camps.
Each copy is meant to be passed around and shared by dozens of
people.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Kosovar Family Finder Web site
(www.kosovofamilyfinder.org) has logged 1,000 hits a day, and
several hundred copies of the book have been downloaded by Kosovars
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The directory contains the names of 19,658 Kosovar families,
representing an estimated 120,000 refugees dispersed in 23
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of the Family Finder is to cut out the middle
man,'' Meyer said. ``Give the information to the people and let
them run with it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Meyer has used computer networks to
reunify families. Before arriving in Albania, he worked in West
Africa with the International Rescue Committee building a system
called Child Connect, which used Lotus Notes, to reunify orphans
from the civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said he came to Albania with the committee in late May
thinking that he would build a similar system to connect orphaned
Kosovars with their families. In this crisis, however, there were
few orphans: children tended to stay with one or more relatives.
Reuniting extended families was the foremost need.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of creating a refugee phone book came to Meyer after he
spoke with an 18-year-old refugee who had lost track of her
parents. ``She had no radio, no TV, no Internet,'' Meyer recalled.
``They were so cut off from any information, and I realized that
the best solution would be to bring the information to them.''
</P>
<P>
   With help from budding Albanian Internet entrepreneurs,
including the founder of Adanet, an Albanian Internet provider,
Meyer, in conjunction with refugee organizations like the Red Cross
and Catholic Relief Services, culled lists of refugees and
assembled them into a single, standard format.
</P>
<P>
   Then the book was put on line, using Adanet's server and a
second server in Florida. ``We were up night after night trying to
get all these different lists together,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by the International Rescue Committee and a grant from
the Markle Foundation _ a New York-based philanthropy that works to
use information technology for public benefit _ the project cost
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technologies like the Internet allow us to rapidly deliver
solutions to public needs without huge infrastructure costs,'' said
Zoe Baird, the Markle Foundation's president. ``It changes the way
we address social problems by enabling people to take action in a
decentralized way.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Meyer is uncertain how many people have found one
another through the directory. In his own experience, he said,
every time he has entered a camp with books, within minutes people
have found families or friends.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Agron Shala found his uncle, another refugee,
Leonard Zhaveli, found a friend who was listed as staying in a
private residence in Macedonia. It included a phone number. ``This
is the first time I've known that he is alive,'' Zhaveli said,
grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his local volunteers, Meyer was able to produce in two
weeks what other relief agencies and corporations _ including
Microsoft and Compaq _ had tried to do over three months. Microsoft
came to the Balkans with a $2.6 million project to take digital
photographs of 400,000 refugees, using them to produce new Kosovar
identity cards, necessary after the Serbs stripped fleeing refugees
of all identification.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty Microsoft volunteers, with laptops donated by
Hewlett-Packard and Compaq, have fanned out to refugee camps in
Macedonia, which are quickly emptying as Kosovars return home. By
late June, Microsoft was ready to begin registering refugees. It
estimates that 400,000 were entered into its database and that
50,000 ID cards were issued. By then, however, it was too late to
use the names for family reunification on any large scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lesson because it is the first time we've ever tried
anything of this nature,'' said Erin Brewer, a Microsoft
spokeswoman, when asked about the program's ability to keep pace
with the refugees' movements. ``We wish we could have moved faster,
but this was the best we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed of refugee movements has also caught up with Meyer. A
second edition of the Family Finder, with 250,000 family names,
awaits publication, based on information gathered when blank
registration forms were passed out in June and July with Red Cross
food deliveries in Albanian and Macedonian refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   People living with host families picked up copies of the book
and forms for listing themselves from a yellow kiosk in central
Tirana. Completed forms were sent back to an International Rescue
Committee office in Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not making final decisions on what happens to the
book,'' Meyer said, when asked about its future as thousands of
refugees return home daily. ``People will go back to their
hometowns, so this could grow into the phone book of Kosovo. It
could help speed up the rebuilding of the country.''

RELIVING THE THRILL OF ROLLER COASTER RIDES, EVERY DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people find happiness in riding roller coasters through
fearsome loops, inclines and curves. They enjoy being jerked around
in their seats by gravity and feeling dizzy after the ride is over.
</P>
<P>
   But few amusement park enthusiasts can afford such thrills every
day. A substitute is to log onto one of dozens of roller coaster
Web sites, which offer things like photographs of corkscrew turns
and stories about plunging down steel mountains at 70 miles per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   No one would argue that scrolling through static images and text
matches the excitement of riding a real roller coaster. But the
sites are virtually uniform in trying to convey a sense of danger
with breathless prose (one ride was likened to ``racing through the
Alps in the driver's seat of a red-lining Ferrari'').
</P>
<P>
   Some carry written warnings that mimic those announced over
amusement park loudspeakers, like ``Keep arms and legs inside the
train at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to roller coaster destinations on the Internet can find
information about new rides, reviews and details about, for
instance, how many minutes a roller coaster takes to complete a
full circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites featuring such information is Thrill Ride
(www.thrillride.com), an online magazine that also chronicles water
park and amusement park free-fall rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger, taller, faster _ that's what everyone wants to read
about,'' said Robert Coker, president of Ride Warrior, which
publishes Thrill Ride. ``If you are into thrills, you are always
looking to push the envelope further. Once you have been on a
100-miles-per-hour attraction, you want to go to 120 miles per hour
or 140 miles per hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Coker said, most of the people who log onto
his Web site are male, and many are teen-agers. Many roller coaster
enthusiasts, he said, go to his site to find out which ride was
voted best in a reader poll or which one is about to open, so they
can plan their vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people literally camp out the night before at an
amusement park to be the first one on a new ride,'' Coker said.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites delve into the history of roller coasters. The Lift
Hill Megasite (www.lifthill.com), for example, says that the first
roller coaster with wheels and a track was built in Moscow in the
late 18th century and that the first roller coaster loop was built
in France in the middle of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   For a sample of what modern roller coasters look like, several
sites offer galleries of images. One is Allyn Fratkin's Coaster
Images (www.fratkin.com/coasters), undoubtedly for roller coaster
enthusiasts who admire photographs of thrill rides in the same way
some people enjoy gazing at slides of Michelangelo's art. It offers
multiple scenes from nine major amusement parks, including Busch
Gardens in Williamsburg, Va., and Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at roller coasters is as close as many people want to
get to thrill rides. They consider being flung and spun around
upside down 15 stories above the ground to be potentially harmful
to their health.
</P>
<P>
   For such people, the Roller Coaster Physics site
(www.rollercoaster.com/designers/physics.html) offers some
reassurance, explaining in nontechnical terms why a roller coaster
car won't fly off into space when it rounds a hairpin curve.  &QL;

WIRING THE HOME HAS COME A LONG WAY BUT HAS A WAY TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., Mass., Nev.)   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the old days _ say, a couple of years ago _ home networks
meant figuring out a way to use a personal computer and some dorky
but simple X-10 modules to turn lamps on and off, control the
sprinkler system and manage a simple home security system. That was
before the availability of inexpensive PCs, the rise of the World
Wide Web and the advent of high-speed connections to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, an estimated 15 million to 20 million American homes have
more than one PC, and family members often find themselves vying
with one another for access to the Internet from the den, the
living room, the bedroom or the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The number of multiple-PC homes is expected to double in the
next few years, the importance of the Internet for communications
and commerce is expected to soar, and home networks are suddenly a
practical necessity for many people, not just a project for
electronic tinkerers.
</P>
<P>
   Large businesses typically attack the problem of networks by
hiring full-time administrators to worry about wiring topologies
and network protocols, but in households where even programming the
VCR or getting Junior to take out the trash is an ordeal, hiring a
network specialist is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Yet industry analysts say we are rapidly approaching the day
when a much broader array of home devices will be sharing data, not
just PCs and peripherals, but also television sets, stereo systems,
smart land-line telephones, cellular phones, digital cameras and
even kitchen appliances. A consumer might download music from the
Internet through a computer and play it on a home stereo, for
example, or play a DVD movie on the home office computer but watch
it on the big television set in the living room.

   In the home of the near future, if all goes as planned, someone
might simply point a digital video camera at the television and the
two devices would instantly recognize one another. A signal sent
from the computer in the car could arm the home security system or
turn down the thermostat. A computer in the master bedroom could
display images beamed from the camera in the nursery or over the
front door.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the more imaginative scenarios, the refrigerator
could know it was low on milk and eggs and place an order with the
local supermarket, and a microwave could check a database that
listed the allergies or eating habits of family members and issue
an alert if an unwanted ingredient was detected when a package's
bar code was waved in front of it. All the clocks in the house
would set themselves by linking to the PC in the den, which would
set its own internal clock via the Internet, checking with an
atomic clock in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The technology to do all such fancy networks exists today. But
to many consumers, it may seem like a complex solution in search of
a simple problem.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, according to surveys done by computer network
companies, the main reason to build a home network is to share
Internet access, whether through a conventional dial-up modem or,
increasingly, through a high-speed cable or digital subscriber line
(DSL) modem. A network enables two or more computers to share the
high-speed connection at the same time, so family members don't
have to take turns.
</P>
<P>
   A network, at a typical cost of $50 to $100 for each connected
computer, is often cheaper than buying a modem for each PC and
getting a second or third phone line from the phone company.
</P>
<P>
   And once the household signs up for high-speed cable or DSL
access _ typically at a cost of $40 to $60 a month for the line,
plus equipment and installation fees, plus additional monthly fees
of $20 or more for the Internet service provider _ it is often
cheaper to add a new PC to a network than it is to set up the new
PC with its own Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The second most common reason to build a network, the surveys
found, is to enable two or more family members to play multiplayer
games together.
</P>
<P>
   Playing against the computer is increasingly passe; racing
against Dad in a Formula One race or teaming up with little sister
in a dogfight is the future of PC games. And playing games, by the
way, is the second-fastest-growing use of home computers, after
surfing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional reasons for a computer network in the office _
the need to share printers, files and applications _ are farther
down the list for PC users at home.
</P>
<P>
   Home networks will get much more interesting and complex in the
next few years with the growing deployment of new digital devices
like television set-top boxes, smart telephones and wireless Web
pads that connect to the Internet via radio waves.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is expected to accelerate as consumers begin buying
digital entertainment, like music, videos and books, over the Net
and downloading on one device _ probably a powerful PC acting as
the household's Internet gateway _ then transferring the files to
another device that can handle them better. That device might be a
stereo with a better speaker system, a television with a larger
screen or some sort of specialized digital device, like an
electronic book that can be carried to the comfy couch in the
living room.
</P>
<P>
   But not yet. Despite the recent arrival of a number of different
home network kits that promise to simplify the task _ they need no
new wires _ setting up the connections isn't that much easier than
it was when only hobbyists were doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional way to build a PC network in offices, using a
technology called Ethernet, is also popular in homes where PC users
demand high-speed connections (10 million to 100 million bits per
second) and have the technical determination to make Ethernet work.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular Ethernet kit for home networks, which involves
stringing wires, is Linksys' Homelink, which connects two PCs for
about $100.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ethernet has snaked into many homes, most consumers are
not keen on do-it-yourself projects that involve boring holes in
walls, stringing wires along the floor with duct tape or paying
hundreds of dollars for custom installations.
</P>
<P>
   But under the battle cry of ``no new wires,'' more than a dozen
companies have come up with alternatives that connect PCs over the
phone wiring a house already has.
</P>
<P>
   I've tried several of these, including the Intel Corporation's
Anypoint Home Network kit ($189); a variation from Farallon
Communications called Homeline ($139 to connect two computers), for
the several million houses where Windows PCs and Apple Macintoshes
co-exist, and one called Homefree from the S3 Diamond Multimedia
($100).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ethernet systems, these new home network kits that
connect through phone lines are intended to appeal to consumers who
love the Internet but don't necessarily like computers. The kits
are relatively easy to install and configure.
</P>
<P>
   The current phone line standard allows connection speeds of one
million bits per second, much slower than Ethernet, but
second-generation versions of the kits scheduled to arrive this
fall are expected have a data transfer speed that is 10 times as
fast.
</P>
<P>
   All of these kits use the home's existing telephone wiring to
share data without interrupting normal phone service or high-speed
DSL Internet service. The computers share the same wires as the
phones but operate at a different frequency that does not interfere
with voice traffic.
</P>
<P>
   You need a phone jack near each computer, and home owners who
have multiple phone lines must make sure that all the wall jacks in
the network have the same phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Despite promises of simplicity, however, the phone line products
have been known to cause even experienced network users to have
conniptions. Computers are complex things, and getting them all to
work in harmony is tricky. Sometimes the network stops working for
no apparent reason: printers can stop printing, and laptop
computers brought home from the office can cause configuration
confusion. That's when cryptic error messages can make even the
most patient person reach for the aspirin bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely some kinks that need to be ironed out,''
said Michael Wolf, an industry analyst with the Cahners In-Stat
Group of Phoenix, who noted that these first-generation network
kits were still too hard for average consumers to use. ``When you
get beyond the techno-geeks, you have some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all computers are hostile in network environments. Network
connectors and file-sharing software are standard equipment on
Apple Macintosh computers, which makes home networks easy as long
as all the computers are Macs. But 9 out of 10 computers sold today
are not as network-friendly as the Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Intel and Microsoft, whose technologies form the
basis of the most common home PCs today, acknowledge that home
networks could be made simpler. They say they are working on
next-generation products that will simplify the setup process and
make home networks more reliable and easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, for example, plans to emphasize ``universal plug and
play'' capabilities in its next version of Windows for consumers,
and it is working with the 3Com Corp. to create a series of home
network kits that will go on sale later this year. Compaq, the
world's largest PC maker, plans to make home network technology a
standard feature in its consumer PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nearly every major PC maker, and many of the largest
consumer electronics companies, have joined one or more working
groups that are trying to establish common standards for networks
that connect through phone lines, radio waves, infrared signals,
home power lines and a variety of special wires.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, of Cahners In-Stat, said he expected home phone-line
systems to be the most common solution for home networks in the
next few years, followed by wireless systems and systems that
connect through electrical outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Networks that connect through a home's electrical wiring have
appeal in houses where phone jacks may be scarce. They connect PCs
to regular 110-volt wall outlets. One such kit is the $199
Intelogis Passport Plug-in Network.
</P>
<P>
   But power lines are finicky, and interference from refrigerator
and air-conditioner power spikes can degrade the network's
performance. Data moves at less than half the speed of the basic
home phone line alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   A more appealing solution, especially for people who use
portable computers and handheld information devices, is to bypass
wires altogether by connecting devices with radio waves. Wireless
network kits like Proxim's Symphony ($199 per card) offer data
transmission speeds that are comparable to the speeds of current
phone-line systems, but wireless systems invariably cost much more
than wired systems.
</P>
<P>
   A company called Sharewave has created wireless network
technology that connect PCs and other devices at Ethernet speeds.
Computer and consumer electronics products based on Sharewave
technologies are expected to be in stores next year. Motorola has
been demonstrating a wireless home-network hub that is expected to
be on sale later this year.
</P>
<P>
   These are all solutions for retrofitting homes and apartments
with computer network equipment. The ultimate and most expensive
approach to building a home network is to buy a new house that has
high-speed wiring already built into the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Many new subdivisions are being built with such wiring as a
standard feature, and some analysts expect computer networks to be
as common in new homes in the 21st century as plumbing and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that in a few years, almost all new construction
will include network cabling,'' said Michael Kwatinetz, a market
analyst with CF First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Two new subdivisions in Houston, each with nearly 2,000 homes,
have been built with IBM Home Director network hubs built into
closets or garages.
</P>
<P>
   At DC Ranch, a development outside of Scottsdale, Ariz., each of
the 8,000 houses that have been built or are planned has high-speed
connections in the walls. And each home is linked on a fiber-optic
network that provides data services, digital television and digital
phone service. A new development of 50,000 homes near Las Vegas,
Nev., is to be built with internal networks as a standard amenity.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the most optimistic forecasters say, Internet access
will be nearly as common as phone access in houses.  &QL;

TAJ MAHAL PLEASURE GARDEN: WHAT A LITTLE MOONLIGHT CAN DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAULA DEITZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Across the river from the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, there was
once a pleasure garden filled with the fragrance of white
night-blooming flowers and blossoming trees. But the Moonlight
Garden, as the acres were called, was neglected even in the
mid-1600s, after its builder, Shah Jahan, was imprisoned. Soon, its
marble fountains, aqueducts, pavilions and watercourses, its
flowers and trees, were buried by three feet of silt from the
flooding Yamuna River.
</P>
<P>
   For hundreds of years, people were intrigued by the idea of the
existence of the Moonlight Garden, documented in paintings and
manuscripts. They knew approximately where it was. What they did
not know were the garden's exact dimensions, how the fountains
worked, where the watercourses were and what exactly was planted in
this classic imperial Mogul garden.
</P>
<P>
   Indian and American experts have begun to uncover the answers to
these questions through scientific research and archaeology. And
the new information about the Moonlight Garden has solved another
mystery, this one about the Taj Mahal itself: why was it built at
the bank of the Yamuna River, with its garden to the south, when
most great Mogul tombs were constructed in a garden at the junction
of four waterways, representing the four rivers of life?
</P>
<P>
   One theory holds that the Moonlight Garden is the missing half
of the original Taj Mahal gardens and that the Yamuna, one of
India's sacred rivers, was the central watercourse that divided two
equal gardens. ``Symmetry was everything in Mogul gardens,'' said
Elizabeth B. Moynihan, an architectural historian and the wife of
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moynihan, who is the head of the American team that is
researching the garden, was sitting in Dr. David L. Lentz's lab at
the New York Botanical Garden. Lentz, a paleoethnobotanist on the
team, had used an electron microscope to identify the remains of
apricot and jujube trees among the charred specimens he unearthed
last summer in the Moonlight Garden. The gardens around the Taj
today have been planted not in the Mogul fashion but with
British-style lawns and tidy flower beds.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moynihan began working in India 26 years ago, when her
husband was the U.S. ambassador to India. She excavated the Lotus
Garden of the 16th-century Mogul Emperor Babur. Her book,
``Paradise as a Garden: In Persia and Mughal India'' (George
Braziller, 1979), recorded imperial gardens that served as open-air
palaces for the nomadic conquerors. She also chronicled the
development of traditional Islamic four-river gardens, or
charbaghs, which were densely planted with blossoming fruit trees
and aromatic plants and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Historic maps of Agra indicate a series of pleasure gardens and
noble residences on the Yamuna as it curves between the Red Fort
and the Taj Mahal. The river provided transport from one garden to
another; in the Moonlight Garden a pavilion on a raised terrace
received visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chronicle of the King of the World,'' a manuscript from
the time of Shah Jahan, contained several brilliantly colored
paintings that showed how these gardens with their dense trees and
marble pavilions appeared from the river. In one scene from 1637
entitled ``Shah Jahan honoring Prince Awrangzeb at His Wedding,''
the pavilions and trees across the river can be seen silhouetted
against the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   But the Moonlight Garden (known in Persian as the Mehtab Bagh)
was on the low side of the river and was doomed by periodic
flooding. Even in Shah Jahan's lifetime, in December 1652, Prince
Awrangzeb reported to his father that water had completely
submerged the garden. ``Consequently, it has lost its tidiness,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India
confirmed that the Moonlight Garden was built by Shah Jahan in the
1630s. The Taj Mahal was built at the same time, and although
tradition holds that it was constructed as a tomb for his wife,
scholars now believe that he built it as a tomb for himself. Mark
Twain was quite taken by this spectral vision of carved and
filigreed white marble, which he described as ``man's architectural
ice-storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moynihan first visited the Moonlight Garden excavation in
1995. In January 1998, she visited again after the silt had been
bulldozed away. She plans to go back this fall with Dr. James
Wescoat, the landscape architect who has traced the water courses
at the site.
</P>
<P>
   What intrigues her, she said, was that ``this half of the Taj
Mahal garden, unlike the garden behind the Taj Mahal, which was
part of a tomb, was strictly a pleasure garden.'' Shah Jahan would
come down the river from his fort and visit the Moonlight Garden
and look at the Taj Mahal under a full moon.
</P>
<P>
   The Taj Mahal has always been most seductive by moonlight, so
much so that a recent proposal has called for bathing it in
simulated moonlight from hidden floodlights on moonless nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Mogul garden has ever been reconstructed and planted in an
authentic manner,'' said Milo Beach, the director of the Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery in Washington. Next year, the Sackler and the
University of Washington Press will publish a report on some of the
work on the Moonlight Garden.
</P>
<P>
   As a first step in restoration, a group in Agra has planted some
6,000 trees in the Moonlight Garden, all based on a list of Mogul
flora. Visitors to the north bank of the river today will find
remnants of a 200-foot, two-level octagonal pool with 25 fountain
jets, which was uncovered by Indian archaeologists. (Red sandstone
coping below the pool, in a lotus foliage design, is intact.)
Sandstone niches, also uncovered, held fresh flowers by day and
colored lamps at night.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the marble arches from the Moonlight Garden's entrance
pavilion, which had been buried by sand, have been put into storage
until the day when a complete restoration of the garden is
possible. And one of the four octagonal brick and sandstone towers
at the corners of the garden remains. It is possible at sunset to
stand by this tower, look at what has always been considered the
``back'' side of the Taj Mahal, and imagine what it was once like
and may yet be again.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Forget happiness, financial security and a healthy
sex life. If you ask people what they're really looking for these
days, ``a perfect sofa'' is what many are likely to say.
</P>
<P>
   For Jamie Cohen, 29, a Manhattan film production executive, the
quest for a sofa took her through three states, from the Berkshires
to the Bowery _ and lasted three months. ``It was a really
intensive search,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, if she had wanted to come up with $10,000 or $15,000, she
could have had anything she wanted. For that amount, you can get
more goose-down stuffing, eight-way hand-tied springs and
kiln-dried maple construction than you can shake a stick at.
</P>
<P>
   But most people don't have the wherewithal for a custom sofa, no
matter how good an investment it may prove to be six decades down
the line. And when it comes to vintage sofas, the best designed and
best preserved are often in the same stratosphere. Another problem
with vintage pieces is the scale: as with Goldilocks and the three
bears, they're mostly too big or too small.
</P>
<P>
   So several small Manhattan vintage-furniture dealers _
Regeneration, Area I.D., Ace Design and Paul Donzella among them _
have taken matters into their own hands, producing sofas that are
not only redolent of the '50s and '60s (for their modernism-loving
customers) but also blend with the styles of other decades (and
other tastes).
</P>
<P>
   This development came none too soon for Ms. Cohen. Her fiance
was moving in with her, and she wanted to make her place ``more
unisex.'' That meant, for one, a new sofa. ``We looked
everywhere,'' she said. ``Antiques stores, flea markets, from the
Berkshires on down, and your typical stores like Crate and Barrel.
We wanted something that was comfy and cozy and fit both of our
styles.'' Her chief criterion was that it fit her 50's esthetic;
her fiance's sole requirement, she said, ``was that we be able to
cuddle on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one day in March, they walked into Ms. Cohen's favorite
modern-furniture store, Regeneration, at 38 Renwick St. (Canal
Street) and saw a neat, simple sofa for about $3,500 that fit both
needs. They bought it off the floor. Ms. Cohen assumed it was a
vintage piece but was surprised to learn it was the floor sample of
the store's new line _ a newly designed and fabricated sofa,
vintage 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing the basic lines of a '50s tufted sofa by Edward
Wormley, a style setter in mid-century furniture, the store's
owners, Christine Miele and Valerie Guaraglia, scaled down their
version to 79 inches (in keeping with the local scaled-down living
room), leveled the seat from a pitched-back position and switched
the legs from brass to stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was that it was the frame of an old sofa that
had been re-upholstered,'' Ms. Cohen said. ``But that doesn't
change my feelings about it. This is a classic sofa, and it could
be placed in almost any space, from my little apartment here to
wherever we go next.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for the store's new line, which also includes a
stark walnut-veneered bedstead based on a George Nelson design,
came from customers like Ms. Cohen, Ms. Guaraglia said. ``We had a
lot of demand for very simple, clean sofas that aren't
overstuffed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While the vogue for modern design has made people more aware _
and desirous _ of furnishings with a designer's name and in mint
condition, Ms. Guaraglia said that for some pieces, provenance is
less important.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a sofa,'' she said, ``people aren't as concerned with
issues like that, because they'll probably re-upholster it anyway.
What our customers are looking for is something they're going to
use _ not a collectible and not a prop.''
</P>
<P>
   At Area I.D., at 262 Elizabeth St. (Houston Street), the store's
new-made sofa is a scaled-down version (69 inches long) of a
kitschy '50s divan with one armrest, and it's ``the star of the
store'' in sales, said the shop's owner, Debra LaChance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that what people wanted was a cross between the
sofa and the settee,'' she said. ``This still looks like a sofa,
it's bigger than a settee or a love seat and it still has the
modern sensibility.'' It's $2,975, with fabric and upholstery
(Ultraleather or Ultrasuede) included.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street (and up the scale), the two-year-old Ace
Design, at 269 Elizabeth, has begun selling two sleek new sofas
with kiln-dried maple frames, hand-tied springs and down filling.
The style that Ace's co-owner and designer, Claudia Bogen, had in
mind was an Italian-American modernist hybrid _ Edward Wormley
meets Gio Ponti. Starting from scratch, she designed the two from
the Lucite legs up; one, the Starlet, with a mid-'50s Sophia Loren
feel, and another, the Squared, with a kind of mid-'60s Brigitte
Bardotishness.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bogen said she was aiming for more softness and curves than
a lot of the vintage modernist pieces she sells. ``I'm way over the
office look,'' she said tersely, referring to the hard edges of
much modernist furniture. ``This is a lot more inviting.''
</P>
<P>
   At $6,000 (excluding the upholstery fabric, which can add
$1,000), her sofas are not cheap, but each is made to order. And
Ms. Bogen is planning another line at about 30 percent less, she
said. The pieces will come in two sizes, already upholstered.

   Paul Donzella's modern-design store, Donzella, at 17 White St.
(West Broadway), is known as one of the best (and more expensive)
in the city for one-of-a-kind pieces from masters like Paul Frankl
and Paul Laszlo. Donzella decided to enter the new-furniture market
in part because he wanted to sell things that more people could
afford. ``The deeper I get into the rarer things, the more
expensive it all is, and the more people can't afford it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Having witnessed his customers' enthusiasm for a pair of
round-back tufted armchairs designed in the '30s by Billy Haines in
his signature Hollywood-glam style, Donzella decided, he said, ``to
knock them off.'' Now, the chairs sell for $2,400 each at Donzella;
at auction last year, a pair of the genuine articles sold at
$8,800, he said. Sales have been strong enough that he is planning
to introduce two sofas to go with the chairs, all part of his
fascination with what he calls ``Bel Air modern.''
</P>
<P>
   While these new, and largely inexperienced, furniture makers may
be untested, the reception of their designs has been so far, so
good _ or at least, so far no returns. With furniture, the real
test is time. Stylistically, they've already passed. After all,
this is the furniture equivalent of what could be called ``an easy
A.''  &QL;

IN THE TOUR DE FRANCE, INFORMATION CAN BECOME POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALPE D'HUEZ, France _ At midday on July 5, the American cyclist
Lance Armstrong and the rest of the riders in the Tour de France
were taking things easy when the third of the race's 20 daily
stages began with the riders setting out from the Loire River city
of Nantes, rolling along at a touristlike 18 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   But in Armstrong's team car, just behind the pack of about 175
cyclists, things were anything but restful. One of the team's
directors, Johan Bruyneel, was driving and chomping on a baguette,
occasionally using his knees to handle the steering, as he was
assaulted by an information frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   From one speaker, Armstrong, who was in second place that day
but is now leading the race, was asking for details on the race
route. On the speaker for Radio Tour, the race's common
communications link, the race director was welcoming a long list of
VIP guests to the race.
</P>
<P>
   Bruyneel's Nokia hands-free cellular phone chirped the William
Tell Overture to alert him to an incoming call. A tiny Clarion LCD
television that popped out of the in-dash CD player showed
highlights from the previous day's race while a second,
conventional television gave the team mechanic, Juan Lujan, a good
view in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Another radio connected to the team's second car blared
complaints from Mark Gorski, the team's other director, that he was
having trouble hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing, it seemed, was a Global Positioning
System receiver offering the precise position of Armstrong and the
team's seven other riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I wouldn't want that,'' said Bruyneel, his voice now also
competing with the roar of three low-flying television helicopters.
``It's a little bit too high-tech.''
</P>
<P>
   From a great height, the 96-year-old Tour de France appears to
be quaintly anachronistic, a throwback to the days of solitary
champions and grueling competition, of unruly elements and unlikely
heroes. But along the 2,500-mile route, it is a Superbowl on
wheels, as more than 4,500 team members, cycling officials and
journalists wage their own technological race along the hairpin
turns and mountain roads.
</P>
<P>
   For the organizers, an increasingly sophisticated array of
electronics helps overcome many of the race's logistical problems.
But for the riders, the technology has begun changing the racing
itself. Teams like Armstrong's have discovered that in a sport
where strategy is as important as speed, information can be power.
</P>
<P>
   Bruyneel joined the Armstrong team, which is sponsored by the
United States Postal Service, after his own 12-year riding career
ended last season. During his riding days with the Spanish ONCE
team, Bruyneel was one of the first cyclists to use a radio during
the race.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment was not highly successful. The bulky radios had
to be built into helmets, making them uncomfortably heavy. Because
they were relatively expensive, even well-financed teams could
afford only one or two units. Even worse, the systems generally
proved unreliable. Although cyclists have to keep going even in the
worst weather, the early radio systems were not up to the job.
</P>
<P>
   But like personal computers, two-way radios have become more
sophisticated and much less expensive since the beginning of the
decade (although the United States Postal Service team estimates
that it has spent $20,000 on communications equipment).
</P>
<P>
   The daily dressing ritual for Armstrong and his teammates during
the three-week Tour now includes depositing a tiny two-way radio in
a back jersey pocket. The rider then threads wires to allow him to
clip a thumbnail-sized microphone under the front of his jersey and
insert an earpiece. Most of the other riders do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   For George Hincapie, the sprinting specialist on the United
States Postal Service team, the radios have meant the end of a
racing ritual. He no longer has to carry in his back pockets a
palm-size card giving details about that day's stage: the location
of tough climbs, easier flat stretches or treacherous curves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point _ Johan can now give us much more information
from the car,'' Hincapie said. ``Occasionally we don't take the
radios to a race and we feel completely lost without them.''
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the riders' radios allow Bruyneel to shape
the team's strategy during the race. Rather like deskbound office
workers, professional cyclists must endure seemingly endless
meetings where each team member's responsibilities for that day's
race are laid out. Of course, the actual race rarely fits the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping back to a team car for advice was not always an option
in the past, especially if the inevitable unforeseen development
involved a big increase in speed. When that happened, the team
leader would generally make a not always fully informed decision
and try to relay it to his team.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bruyneel simply analyzes the situation and broadcasts a
revised plan. ``It has changed the race a lot,'' Bruyneel said
while flicking the steering wheel to allow another team car and a
photographer's motorbike to pass on the narrow road. ``The
directors have much more control over the teams now.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day the Tour left Nantes, for example, two riders had
pulled ahead of the main group in a breakaway, which meant that the
best Hincapie could hope to do in a sprint was place third.
``George, it's not worth the energy to go for the sprint,''
Bruyneel advised via radio.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the radio gives Bruyneel more control, it also allows
dissenters to weigh in. The order not to participate in the sprint
was immediately followed by a transmission from Armstrong. ``Ah,
come on,'' he said in a lighthearted attempt at insurrection. ``Go
for it. You can do it!''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Armstrong used the system to great effect during a
time trial later in the week that put him in the race leader's
yellow jersey. Bruyneel radioed a warning that he was about to pass
his greatest rival in the race against the clock, Abraham Olano,
even though Armstrong had started two minutes behind Olano.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone at the race, Bruyneel depends on Radio Tour to
develop strategy. The Radio Tour system appeared in a crude form in
the late 1960s and has evolved into an extensive operation.
Controlled from two station wagons with antenna forests on their
roofs that travel in front of and behind the race, the system uses
three airplanes flying at 3,000 feet to relay its transmissions
over routes that generally stretch over 125 miles or more each day.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, about 50 official cars, vans and motorbikes of
the tour organizer, Societe du Tour de France, feed information
into Radio Tour through the antenna-laden cars. Some, particularly
the red Lancia carrying the race director, Jean Marie Leblanc, let
everyone else know what's happening in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Other transmissions make sure that the hundreds of cars and
trucks ahead and behind the race do not become tangled up with the
riders.
</P>
<P>
   But the airspace above the Tour is no less crowded. In addition
to the three Radio Tour planes and the three television
helicopters, five airplanes fly overhead to relay live commercial
radio and television signals.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest danger now facing the Tour is that its
communications system will turn into an electronic Tower of Babel.
Because local cellular phone equipment can be overwhelmed by the
estimated 3,000 wireless handsets carried by race followers, France
Telecom now unfolds special truck-mounted high-capacity cellular
towers at the start and finish of each day's event.
</P>
<P>
   Fights over radio frequencies are also developing. The Societe
du Tour de France alone operates on 258 radio frequencies. In an
attempt to keep order, the French government agency responsible for
assigning radio frequencies has sent technicians to the race for
the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not us who has the problem now, it's them,'' said Didier
Blondel, the head of telecommunications for the Tour, with obvious
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Still, problems persist. On the way out of Nantes, the United
States Postal Service riders mysteriously found themselves
receiving instructions intended for a rival French team, Credit
Agricole. Bryneel took it in stride: ``At least they'll have no
secrets from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, with the exception of television, most of the Tour's
communications use old-fashioned analog systems rather than
higher-capacity digital devices. Blondel said that brief
experiments with digital radio showed that it had trouble coping
with rainstorms and the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Blondel is dreaming of a digital future. He
sketched out his Tour car of the future while sitting in his
office, which, even though it is housed in a fold-out trailer
truck, nevertheless has several Gallic touches, including a potted
artificial rose bush.
</P>
<P>
   His dream car would have integrated LCD screens on the
dashboards and seat backs. A computer behind the back seat would
receive and decode digital television signals, a digital version of
Radio Tour and Web pages from the Tour's site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too expensive to do this now and the technology isn't
perfected, but it will come,'' Blondel promised, presenting his
drawing with a flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, Bruyneel will continue with his cellular
phones, radios and televisions while steering with his knees
through narrow roads filled with rabid European cycling fans. He
is, as the French say, ``au four, au moulin'' _ ``in the oven, in
the mill'' _ the closest phrase in French to ``multitasking.''  &QL;

HOME CLINIC: TIME TO POUR AND CURE CONCRETE SLAB

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week this column described the preparations for
constructing a concrete slab. This week it will outline the
procedures for ordering and pouring the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The concrete will need to be reinforced with steel mesh,
embedded within the slab, which will help to control the expansion
and contraction of the concrete, and prevent hairline cracks from
widening. Choose a mesh with 1/4-inch diameter wire and cut it so
it is slightly smaller than the slab.
</P>
<P>
   The mesh should be midpoint in the depth of the poured concrete.
There are three ways you can position it there. You can lay it on
the subgrade, propped to the approximate height with small stones;
the concrete will then poured over and through the mesh. The mesh
can be laid directly on the subgrade and pulled up through the
poured concrete with hooks made of bent rod or it can be set on the
wet concrete and pushed down into position.
</P>
<P>
   The most convenient and economical source of concrete is a
ready-mix dealer. Ready-mix concrete is sold by the cubic yard and
delivered by truck. A local dealer will usually be able to deliver
any quantity greater than one cubic yard. To determine how much
concrete is required for your project, calculate the area of the
proposed slab in square feet by multiplying the length by the
width. Next multiply the area by the thickness of the slab. If the
thickness is in inches, convert it to feet. Finally divide the
total by 27, the number of cubic feet in a yard, to convert the
volume into cubic yards. Add an extra 5 to 10 percent to this
amount to cover possible waste or spillage or variations in the
thickness of the subgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the quantity, you should also consider two other
factors. The first is the maximum aggregate size in the mix.
Concrete is a mixture of two materials: an aggregate, which is
usually sand and gravel or coarse stones, and a paste made of
Portland cement and water. The aggregate size should not be larger
than roughly one-third the thickness of the slab. A slab 4 inches
thick should have aggregate stones no larger than three-quarters of
an inches in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   The second factor to consider is the maximum slump of the
concrete. Slump is a measure of the consistency of concrete and
gives some idea of how workable a mixture is. For most home
projects, a slump of 3 to 5 inches is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   If volume calculations, and concepts like aggregate size and
slump seem confusing, do not be afraid to discuss them with the
dealer. Describe your project and let him check your figures and
advise you on the best mix for your needs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ask the dealer for the cost per cubic yard of the
mix. That price should include delivery and a certain amount of
truck-waiting time. Get a price quote for the overtime charges and
ask how much time the truck can be on site before overtime charges
start. Finally ask what methods of payment are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Before the cement truck arrives, assemble your helpers and have
all the necessary tools on hand. One or two helpers should man the
wheelbarrows, and the other person should remain at the site to
move the concrete in place. Start by dumping the first load of
concrete in the farthest corner of the site then spread it with a
flat shovel. Add additional loads directly to the spreading
mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Do not use a garden rake for moving concrete because it
separates the larger pieces of aggregate from the mix. You may be
able to rent special concrete rakes and hoes, called come-alongs,
at a rental store.
</P>
<P>
   When all the concrete is poured, use a long (at least 12 inches
longer than the width of the slab) 2 by 4 commonly called a screed
to level off the surface. Rest the board on the forms and slide it
back and forth across the slab to remove all the high spots. Make
several passes until the entire slab is level. Next, smooth the
leveled concrete by pushing a bullfloat across the surface.
</P>
<P>
   After smoothing the surface, use an edging tool with a 1/2-inch
radius to produce a rounded edge around the slab. Use a jointing
tool, sometimes called a groover, to cut control joints (these will
eliminate unsightly random cracks) at six-foot intervals across the
slab. Finally, apply a rough texture to the surface by brushing the
concrete with a stiff-bristled broom.
</P>
<P>
   The job is essentially done, but the concrete should be allowed
to cure properly so it can become hard and durable. Curing is done
by keeping the concrete damp; spray the slab with a garden hose
periodically for a least a week.

`MICHAEL JORDAN AND THE NEW GLOBAL CAPITALISM': HIS AIRNESS AS
NEO-IMPERIALIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not exactly news that Michael Jordan may well be one of
the most familiar figures in the world today. As arguably the
greatest basketball player ever to play the game and as a pitchman
for products ranging from Nike sportswear to McDonald's fast food,
Jordan has become as recognizable to natives of Lhasa, Tibet, and
students at Beijing University as he is to hometown fans of the
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Walter LaFeber, a history professor at Cornell University,
is out to make a larger point in his catchily titled new book,
``Michael Jordan and the New Global Capitalism.'' Arguing that
Jordan represents a new form of culture that is sweeping the globe
and changing ways of life everywhere for good or ill, LaFeber poses
the question: Is Jordan simply a great salesman or does he
represent what some see as an insidious form of cultural
imperialism? If the answer is the latter, what are the implications
for America's relations to the world?
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of getting answers to these questions is intriguing
enough to draw the reader through much material familiar to any
basketball fan or reader of the financial pages. LaFeber begins by
tracing Jordan's roots, emphasizing his atypical background (for an
African-American ballplayer) of having grown up in a rural area
relatively innocent of racial prejudice and the civil rights
struggles of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The book's focus then turns to the history of basketball since
its invention by Dr. James Naismith in 1891 as a pastime for
keeping the young men at Springfield College in Massachusetts out
of trouble between the football and baseball seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that within decades the game became the special
preserve of blacks in the inner city (especially New York), LaFeber
nevertheless stresses how quickly basketball caught on with women
(in 1896, the women of Stanford defeated Berkeley, 2-1 _ each
basket counting a point _ in a game watched by hundreds of female
fans), how soon it became internationally popular and how well it
lent itself to broadcasting on television.
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan's entry into the National Basketball Association in
1984 (as the third pick in the annual draft of college players
after the Houston Rockets took Hakeem Olajuwan and the Portland
Trailblazers selected the now forgotten Sam Bowie), several
synergistic forces came together, LaFeber argues. Jordan himself
quickly developed into both a peerless player and an appealing
spokesman for commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   The new commissioner of the NBA, David Stern, introduced
innovative policies that allowed professional basketball to begin
its leap to international prominence. New communications technology
permitted television to provide the medium to broadcast that leap.
And Nike Corp., led by Phil Knight, established itself as a
paradigm of the modern transnational company, the distinguishing
characteristics of which are to depend largely on overseas
production, to be knowledge-based rather than reliant on industrial
goods, to look to the world instead of just the United States for
profits, to be driven by large-scale advertising campaigns carried
by the new communications technology and to lie beyond the control
of any single government.
</P>
<P>
   What the synergy of these forces produced, writes LaFeber, was
called ``soft power,'' referring to ``the influence of U.S. culture
and commerce, rather than to its military and political muscle.''
The author continues: ``Transnationals such as Nike epitomized such
soft power. Their influence was made greater by widespread use of
the English language _ the international language of computers,
science and many of the young who considered themselves `cool.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent students of `post-imperialism','' he goes on, ``argue
that transnational corporations have created in many nations a new
class _ a native `nationalist managerial' class _ which works to
help the transnational spread its power among people of whom this
new class is a part.'' He concludes: ``This post-1970s class can
provide a vital support on the important local political level for
transnationals. The new corporations thus not only change buying
habits in a society, but modify the composition of the society
itself. For the society that receives it, soft power can have hard
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Do all of LaFeber's points connect to form a picture of the
future of the global economy? Not really. For one thing, the book
is more about Jordan than the effects of what he has done. We learn
much about his suffering from having struck a ``Faustian bargain''
with the media, but not very much about why precisely his image has
proved so appealing. (The author barely mentions perhaps the most
striking feature about Jordan, not his airness, but instead that
he's hairless.)
</P>
<P>
   When LaFeber does explore how Jordan and Nike operate, he fails
to examine in detail the implications of the low wages the company
is accused of paying to foreign workers, or the extent of its mass
cultural influence. One wonders what will happen when the supply of
cheap labor dries up, as it is bound to do if, as Nike
representatives have argued, its influence in poor countries has
helped to create a middle class. One wonders too if the mass
culture that transnationals are accused of spreading can't be
resisted by advocates of high culture, just as it continues to be
here in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on the question of whether Jordan is good or bad for
the world, LaFeber cops out. He cites a few trivial examples on
both sides. He then concludes somewhat lamely: ``In the new tightly
wired world, Americans cannot escape these questions'' of whether
global capitalism is benign or evil. ``They can only begin to deal
with them by understanding the history of how we all became part of
a global market economy and market society.'' Presumably he has
written a piece of that history. But it doesn't provide very many
answers.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the tank of Dale Burg's toilet cracked last
February, she thought it would be as good a time as any to redo the
two bathrooms in her Upper East Side apartment. Like so many other
people contemplating modest renovations in these boom times, she
was wrong. Four contractors turned her down. The $17,000 job didn't
impress them.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara and Morton Kligerman were planning to spend about
$100,000 to enlarge and add some closets, install crown moldings in
a sitting room and fix up a bathroom in their Philadelphia home.
They found a contractor who could fit them in at the tail end of
the summer season. Then _ a fatal mistake _ they asked if he could
delay starting until October so they could take a trip. He said,
``Sure.'' They never saw him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not driving the bus these days,'' said Sara Klar, an
interior designer in Manhattan. Finding a contractor who will even
return phone calls has become so difficult that she has resorted to
supplicating faxes. Even loyal contractors who have worked with her
for 13 years are not coming through. ``They are so unbelievably
busy. No matter how much I say I need to have this or that done, it
doesn't make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't do bids, they resent comparison shopping, they want
an architect on the job, they expect generous deposits. One will
accept jobs only within walking distance of his TriBeCa home;
another won't work for lawyers. If today's experienced contractors
grant new clients an audience (more likely, a private cell-phone
number), it's at their whim.
</P>
<P>
   Call them Lords of the Drywall.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't try contacting them with a project under $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one more person calls, I may just hang up the phone,'' said
Steven Lamazor of Taocon Inc., a Manhattan general contractor who
turns down calls with new work every day. Lamazor is running 10
jobs, ranging from a $150,000 floor installation for an artist with
chemical sensitivities to a $6 million conversion of a small
apartment building. His 50 employees are working double time, and
he's paying bonuses to keep them from moving on to other projects
without him. ``Clients are begging me, and I'm begging my subs,''
said the contractor, who is up mornings at 5:30, placing orders,
getting estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Residential remodeling has risen nationally by approximately $4
billion in the second quarter of 1999, up almost 8 percent over the
same period in 1998, according to a report by the Joint Center for
Housing at Harvard University, to be released on Tuesday. It
estimates that homeowners spent more than $93 billion in the last
12 months, a more than 7 percent increase over the previous period.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kermit Baker, the director of the Joint Center's
Remodeling Futures Program, said that money spent on kitchen
renovations alone has increased from $9.1 billion in 1995 to $10.1
billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Baker attributed the spike in remodeling activity to decreases
in the interest rate, strong home sales and the recent stock-market
gains that ``have encouraged many homeowners to undertake
remodeling projects that may have been deferred.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of contractors at work appears to have
risen only slightly, from about 800,000 in 1992 to an estimated
900,000 in 1997, Baker said. Add to that material shortages _
primarily of gypsum board, but also of insulation, especially in
the Northeast _ and the result is a tremendous squeeze on a work
force that is already a famously transient group of largely
self-employed crafts people.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with more than a dozen contractors revealed a
heightened sense of empowerment. Several spoke of establishing a
threshold for new clients at a quarter of a million dollars (while
remaining happy to accommodate repeat clients with smaller jobs)
and of accepting only residential work with an architect or
designer already attached to the project. To screen calls from old
and new clients alike, one Manhattan contractor visits job sites
with a cell phone manned by an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Clark, a Manhattan contractor, slipped into the Nixonian
third person as he described his rationale for rejecting homeowners
without designers: ``Chris Clark can't sit down at the kitchen
table with Mrs. Jones, who wants white cabinets, a granite counter
and Miele dishwasher. The room for dispute is too vast. Do you know
how many white Formicas there are?''
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise to Olivia Goldsmith, a writer, to learn that
most Manhattan contractors have a full dance card. She talked to
five of them about moving a few walls in her loft and came up empty
handed. ``The professionals were very smooth,'' she recalled.
``They acted as if, if they could book you in the next millennium,
you were the lucky one.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Deffenbaugh, the editor of Remodeling magazine, has heard
it all before. ``There just aren't enough people to do the work,''
he said. ``Americans don't value skilled construction labor, so the
younger people coming up don't see it as the career choice they
used to.'' The traditionally cyclical nature of the business also
takes a toll, making more experienced contractors wary of
overextending themselves, then going out of business when the jobs
dry up, as they inevitably will.

   Right now, the contractors that people are apt to find for
bread-and-butter work _ modest kitchen and bath makeovers, small
cosmetic additions _ are more likely than ever to be inexperienced
and potentially unscrupulous, said Brett Martin, a spokesman for
the National Association of the Remodeling Industry in Alexandria,
Va. Lamazor said: ``It's on the smaller jobs that everyone gets
started, and that's where new contractors are working out their
kinks. I wouldn't want to be doing a $50,000 job right now.''
</P>
<P>
   His recommendation is to check the most recent references _ a
site inspection is preferable _ and to make sure that contractors
are licensed where required. (More than 30 states now have
licensing or registration requirements for general contractors.)
Martin also advised homeowners never to succumb to luring
contractors with more than half of the money up front. ``Times like
these are a golden opportunity for scam artists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (In New York City, contractors are required to carry a license
from the Department of Consumer Affairs; 4,712 do. The department
estimates that more than 1,000 do not. In case of trouble,
homeowners who have been working with a licensed contractor can
file a complaint and may be able to recover as much as 50 percent
of losses up to $20,000 from a consumer affairs trust fund.)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, contractors are just two-timers. A fashion designer
in Manhattan found out by reading the newspaper that hers was also
working on a huge loft for someone else. ``You feel like you have
your hat in your hand all the time, when in fact, you are paying
them,'' she said, preferring anonymity. Her kitchen renovation,
begun more than 18 months ago, is still missing some light fixtures
and cabinet handles, and she didn't want to antagonize him.
</P>
<P>
   For those willing to adjust, the situation is not as grim as it
appears, promised Warren Ashworth, a partner in the architectural
firm of Bogdanow Partners Architects and a former contractor. One
alternative, he said, is to ask the manufacturers of products being
purchased if they have a design staff. Many kitchen, bath and tile
showrooms do. The cost may be higher than a general contractor's
estimate, but the focused attention of a team of workers dedicated
to getting the job done on schedule can even things out.
</P>
<P>
   But if you find the contractor of your dreams, Ashworth had a
courtship tip: ``Sell yourself,'' he advised, suggesting that
homeowners use such inviting phrases as: ``We're not going to
change anything in midstream'' or ``My architect has drawings that
make it perfectly clear'' and the musical ``We can wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a contractor is hooked, it doesn't hurt to wine and dine
them at a nice restaurant for lunch or give a little Christmas bash
for the crew. ``Things like that help tremendously to show you
really care,'' said Ian Banks, a contractor in Pomona, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldsmith solved her problem by calling in a contractor from
Vermont who had worked on her home in upstate New York. She put him
and his crew up in a six-week rental apartment in Queens for
slightly more than $3,000, including expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Burg found that a sense of humor may well be the
real key to surviving a contractor impasse. To redo her bathrooms,
she finally turned to a Russian immigrant she liked with a can-do
attitude but little experience. The results were mixed, but she
discovered that a few mistakes only gave the work more personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were learning together,'' she said, indulgently, recalling
how she once overheard him shouting to his workers, also recent
arrivals from Russia: ``Sergei! Americans like their tiles to line
up, not like in Russia!''

   Show Me the Flowers
</P>
<P>
   Q: Two summers ago, I planted a double-file viburnum, Shasta,
whose label promised the white flowers pictured on it and described
berries. Why has it never bloomed and never had any of those
berries? It looks healthy and gets light sun in the latter part of
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A: When plants refuse to bloom despite all begging and pleading,
there's always a good reason. In the case of your Viburnum plicatum
var. tomentosum, there are probably two.
</P>
<P>
   First, it needs at least six hours of full sun, so you may need
to move it to a sunnier spot. Second, the plant normally grows 6
feet tall and 10 feet wide, and if you have been shearing or
pruning it at any time other than just after flowering you have
probably been cutting off the following spring's flower buds along
with the branches. Since it takes flowers to make berries, solving
the flower problem will also solve the berry problem.
</P>
<P>
   A failure to bloom as pretty as the picture is a common
complaint, with a variety of causes. Late frosts can kill flower
buds, and overfertilizing can promote vegetative growth at the
expense of flowers. Sometimes the problem is just that the plants
aren't old enough to flower, and the only cure is time. Many plants
need to outgrow a juvenile stage, become well established and grow
to a particular size before they are ready to expend the energy to
produce flowers, seeds and even berries. Clones (propagated from
cuttings taken from mature stock like your Viburnum Shasta) are
less likely to go through a juvenile stage than plants grown from
seed. But patience is always a virtue when gardening.
</P>
<P>
   Grass Stripes and Pinstripes
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I make my lawn look like the Yankee Stadium outfield?
I want that striped look. Is it in the cutting, or is it different
kinds of grass?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can have that ballpark look by doing what the Yankees'
groundskeepers do. George Solano, who helps keep the Bermuda, blue
and rye grass in the outfield in top shape through dry springs and
hot summers alike, said the trick is in the cutting: a metal bar is
attached to the front of the mower to bend the grass as it is cut,
leaving it at a slight angle. After being mowed in alternating
directions, the grass strips reflect light differently, giving the
effect of lighter and darker stripes.
</P>
<P>
   But to see the stripes, you'll have to put a video camera up a
tree and watch your lawn on your television. The effect is really
just an optical illusion. The small amount of contrast between
stripes is enhanced by the angle of view and the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Since summer television is mostly reruns, an evening of watching
the lawn sit there doesn't sound bad.
</P>
<P>
   Slow Betty
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have several plants on my property 110 miles upstate from
New York City that have literally not grown since I bought them
four years ago. One is a Magnolia Betty. I thought that perhaps
they were not quite hardy enough for the zone, but my nurseryman
contends that if they survive each winter that's not the problem.
He suggests fertilizer, but most of my other plants are thriving.
Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Magnolia Betty is one of the Little Girl hybrids, a group
that consists of Ann, Betty, Jane, Judy, Pinkie, Randy, Ricki and
Susan, all bred at the National Arboretum. These small trees grow
10 feet to 15 feet tall and are hardy in Zones 4 through 7.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Bachtell, director of collections at the Morton Arboretum
in Lisle, Ill., said it's likely that the tree's roots have never
grown out of the (now imaginary) container that it came in.
</P>
<P>
   Container-grown trees and shrubs are often in the containers
long enough that their roots grow to the edge and begin circling
around, forming a dense, impenetrable mass. If the soil ball isn't
scored and some roots pulled out and away from the ball before
planting, the tree doesn't realize that it is in a new home, and
the roots continue to grow round and round, never going into the
surrounding soil. This limits the amount of water and nutrients
that can be taken up, slowing growth to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Bachtell's advice is to dig up the plant carefully next spring
(magnolias are among the trees that shouldn't be planted in the
fall) to look at the root ball and see if the roots need to be
loosened and spread out.
</P>

   How many jokes has Gary Lewis sent by e-mail over the last
month?
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of jokes that circulate on the Internet, it isn't
even funny.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, an architect who lives in Lake Mohegan, N.Y., is a human
hub on what may be the Internet's most far-flung network: joke
tellers and their electronically captive audiences. Lewis' modest
goal is to put a little laughter into the lives of his 32 or so
closest friends and acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, some of his material hasn't been going over so
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have asked to be taken off the list,'' Lewis said
ruefully. ``You start seeing the same jokes over and over again. So
I try to do the right thing and spend more time editing. But then
you think, `Is this really funny? Which joke is more appropriate
for this particular person?' It's easier trying to design a very
complicated building.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokes are often the first e-mail new Internet subscribers
receive and, in time, the most common. That's in part because they
are so easy to tell. Forget the setup and timing _ just click on
the Forward button on your e-mail program and you're a regular
comedian.
</P>
<P>
   But as the audience for online comedy expands, Internet
joke-telling is developing as an art unto itself, with its own
customs, critics and avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   One video clip now on the e-mail circuit shows a large animated
monkey in the passenger seat of a car boogeying to music from the
radio, next to an apparently oblivious human driver. If that
doesn't sound funny, take it from those who have their computers
set to play it over and over _ it is.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM.
</P>
<P>
   Even as new joke forms develop, a debate has broken out among
some of the computer network's more sophisticated jesters over
whether the new Internet mode of distribution is destroying the
age-old essence of humor, and what to do about it. At stake, some
say gravely, is the future of the joke itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume diminishes the impact of a good joke,'' said Al
Paster, 70, a retired computer programmer who frequently replies to
Lewis' e-mail jokes by correcting their punchlines. In a gesture
toward quality control, Paster refuses to pass on E-jokes. ``What
really disturbs me is when the jokes I know _ and I know quite a
few _ are changed for the worse,'' he said. ``I predict the death
of humor by the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have noticed a pall settling over off-line humor as a
result of the Internet's unparalleled capacity for joke
propagation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going out to dinner tonight with people and normally any
lull in the conversation I could fill in because I knew five new
jokes,'' said David Perlmutter, a New York lawyer who has 43
addresses on his joke list. ``Now the only way they don't know
those jokes is if they haven't read my e-mail. It's socially
depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, more people are telling jokes than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   Take Peter Coan, a typically reserved architect in Ghent, N.Y.,
who stunned friends at a dinner party last month by telling a banjo
joke he found on the Internet. (The difference between a banjo
player and a treasury note? Eventually a treasury note matures and
earns money.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is abnormal for me,'' acknowledged Coan, who took to the
Internet in search of jokes shortly after his wife took up banjo
playing. ``I'm not that interested in jokes. I know two or three
jokes and I can't even remember them. But these rang true.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Internet allows for convenient sorting of jokes
by category. There are Web sites featuring frog jokes, lawyer
jokes, light bulb jokes, Microsoft jokes and of course, Star Trek
Lost Episodes. But by releasing the sender from the obligation of
actually uttering the words, some humor experts say the carbon-copy
nature of the Internet zaps the hidden level of meaning that makes
jokes funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joke-telling allows us to get away with saying things that are
taboo, impolite, politically incorrect,'' said Lawrence E. Mintz,
director of the Art Kliner Center for Humor Studies at the
University of Maryland. ``Internet jokes lose that value because
the teller doesn't have the personal commitment to the joke. People
send whole strings of jokes that they have no commitment to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dispatched along with the oral tradition are the tone of voice
and overall delivery that are so often the key to getting laughs.
The ability to scroll down to the punchline tends to undermine even
the best setup.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet humorists may be injecting meaning into their
material in new ways. Because of the concentric circles through
cyberspace that most jokes seem destined to travel, a sense of
community with strangers often develops among a given joke's
thousands of recipients. There is heightened competition to be the
first to relay a good one _ a more difficult task when everyone is
connected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent a technology joke yesterday to a principal in a
management consulting firm in Los Angeles,'' said a manager at a
financial services firm who asked that his name be withheld because
his company prohibits sending jokes over its e-mail system. Later,
the recipient got the same joke from Esther Dyson, the technology
pundit. ``Can you believe it?'' he said. ``I beat her.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM.
</P>
<P>
   Since many companies have cracked down on the jokes stampeding
through their corporate networks, sending them requires a
dedication by employees to flout the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want us doing this but I say, I'm doing it
anyway,'' another surreptitious joker said, referring to his
employer. ``They can only control my life up to a point.'
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM.
</P>
<P>
   Standards are being raised by the challenge of getting onto
premier distribution lists. Joke mavens who take themselves
seriously forward only a small portion of the jokes that reach
their e-mail In box.
</P>
<P>
   At rec.humor.funny, a venerable newsgroup devoted to jokes, less
than 2 percent of submissions make the cut. ``On average I accept
one per day, and on a busy day I can receive as many as 100,'' said
Jim Griffith, the moderator. ``A lot of them are jokes we've seen
before. And a lot of people aren't as funny as they think they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   For Andrew Gelb, a lawyer in Los Angeles who began receiving
floods of jokes as soon as he got an Internet account last fall,
e-mailed jokes offer a dimension others do not: headers that offer
clues to their provenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to look at the long list in the message to see who else
got the joke,'' Gelb said. ``I get a kick out of how fast and how
far these things travel.'
</P>
<P>
   A list of one-liners, for instance, reached Gelb recently from
Carollee Krueger, a fellow wine aficionado in Santa Monica, Calif.
Ms. Krueger received the joke from Lewis, the architect, who got it
from Mark Paine, an IBM consultant who lives in North Salem, N.Y.
Paine received it from Tom Dietsche, a chemist at Dow Chemical in
Midland, Mich., who got it from a colleague in another building,
who got it from his brother David Czerepinski, a junior high school
science teacher in Madison, Wis. who got it from Warren Avery, a
computer salesman in Tempe, Ariz., who hit it off with Czerepinski
last year at his wife's high-school reunion and has been sending
him jokes ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier times, jokes were thought to spread as traveling
salesmen pollinated their customers with one another's humor.
Pre-Internet, the phone was the most efficient distribution tool,
wielded with particular proficiency by Wall Street traders who were
credited, among other things, with some of the more tasteless
attempts at humor that followed the explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger. Now joke trackers say they see a growing body of
original material from all types of individuals. With each link in
an e-mail chain, jokes flit across the world in a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Industrial Revolution of jokes,'' said Dave
Barry, whose humor column for The Miami Herald is distributed
widely on the Internet. ``Instead of doing something useful with
your day, you're probably reading a joke. And you've noticed that
at the same time there's been this huge explosion of jokes going
around, there's also been this huge surge in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the impact on the gross national product, Barry
Wellman, a sociologist at the University of Toronto, said Internet
joke-sending plays a role in maintaining relationships that might
not otherwise be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jokes are a way of reaffirming a connection with somebody,''
said Wellman, who has his own archive of 748 jokes and a list of
more than 100 people to whom he sends good ones that roll in.
``Before e-mail, what did people do? They did nothing or they sent
a Christmas letter. Jokes serve as a Christmas card but they come
much more often because it's really easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Trea Graham, 57, could do without the weekly Christmas cards
from her son, a naval engineer. A recent dispatch included some dog
haiku that she thought was funny, but she said she would rather get
e-mail he had written himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked him, `Francis Spencer, are you contacting your
mother a lot?' he would say yes, because he's pushing a button and
going `Forward to Mom,''' Ms. Graham said. ``Well, it's not the
same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   The same liberal forwarding attitude has caused other kinds of
offense to be taken as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel free to be more edgy or sexist or racist because
they feel less responsible for the joke,'' said Patrice Oppliger, a
lecturer at Northeastern University who is studying joke-sending
habits. ``People who would never tell these jokes face to face send
them out en masse.''
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing a little technology can't solve. A Web site
called Jester, for instance, uses ``collaborative filtering''
techniques to recommend jokes based on user ratings of a set of
samples (shadow.ieor.berkeley.edu/humor).
</P>
<P>
   ``Humor is a very difficult thing to characterize,'' said Ken
Goldberg, who is one of the site's designers and an engineering
professor at the University of California at Berkeley. ``The
computer treats all jokes as numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there has been considerable evolution of the Internet
joke form. One of the first computers to be connected to the
nascent Internet in 1973 offered off-color limericks on request.
Anyone who contributed three new ones received a copy of the entire
database.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Internet has proved hospitable to more elaborate
jokes. A longtime rule that mandates a punchline after 15 or 20
seconds or you lose your audience doesn't apply in a medium where
jokes are read instead of heard. Long lists, like the Top 26
Children's Books Not Recommended by the National Library
Association (No. 25: ``The Little Engine That Could Becomes
Intoxicated and Kills Civilians''), are thus more plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, technology jokes, particularly the Microsoft
sub-genre, have found an appreciative audience on the Internet
(Microsoft acquires the Vatican, Christmas, the year 1995, the
rights to all further ``Microsoft Acquires'' announcements, and so
on). ``Not only do you have more people on line,'' said Griffith,
the newsgroup moderator. ``But you have more people who understand
why Microsoft-bashing is funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokes that might never find an audience off line have suddenly
become worth telling on the Internet. One of Griffith's favorites
involves the chemical cesium: ``With the Internet there are enough
people out there who appreciate cesium humor,'' he said.

FORECASTS TO EXPLAIN THE NEAR FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Okla., Colo., Va.)   (af)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weather forecasters have Doppler radar and other tools to tell
them what's happening in the present and cumbersome computer models
to suggest what will probably happen in the future, for a day or
two, or even a month or two, ahead. But predicting in any detail
what is going to occur in the next few hours is a tricky operation,
prone to errors.
</P>
<P>
   Now forecasters are beginning to tap into the increased speed
and power of computers by experimenting with ingenious computer
programs that permit more detailed and accurate ``nowcasts'' _
predictions of what's likely to happen in the next few hours,
anywhere from 15 minutes to 6 hours away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we are forced toward very general nowcasting, like
`Rain is expected on the shoreline of Lake Erie this afternoon,'''
said Dr. Stephan Smith, a research meteorologist for the National
Weather Service at its Techniques Development Laboratory in Silver
Spring, Md. ``Instead, we want to give the forecasters tools that
let them say, `It's likely to start raining in about a half an hour
and keep it up for two hours on the shoreline of Lake Erie north of
Cleveland.'''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Smith is developing software that renders fairly
detailed predictions of the weather in the difficult 15-minute to
3-hour range. He particularly wants to be able to warn of imminent
severe conditions, like damaging winds, heavy rainfall,
thunderstorms, tornadoes, lightning and large hail.
</P>
<P>
   The predictions are extrapolated from information provided by
advanced weather satellites, which transmit gigabytes of data each
day on Earth's surface and atmospheric conditions, as well as on
information from radar, high-altitude aircraft, weather balloons
and the more earthbound thermometers and wind vanes of surface
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he hoped to see some of the nowcasting applications
go into regular use in the next year or two in the more than 120
offices of the National Weather Service network. The weather
service wants to be able to issue nowcasts for dangerous conditions
on land and water and for weather hazards during fires, like wind
shifts, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Johnson, a research meteorologist at the National Severe
Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla., is one of the scientists using
weather data in coordination with Smith to develop nowcasting
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and his colleagues have created software applications
that alert forecasters to impending tornadoes. The programs have
been tested on several hundred tornadoes in 18 National Weather
Service offices so far. ``Using the programs, we've increased the
warning time for tornadoes from 13 minutes to 17 minutes, roughly
30 percent,'' he said. In tests for severe thunderstorms, the
warning time increased from 18 to 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The nowcasting programs are designed to keep track of the flood
of data available to forecasters and help them make sense of the
information. ``Forecasters can be swamped by all the data,''
Johnson said. ``They need help.''
</P>
<P>
   The forecasters must keep track of things like radar
information; surface data, like temperature, moisture and wind
speed, and satellite data, like the temperature of cloud tops and
photos of clouds from above. Just to monitor radar, a forecaster's
computer receives about 11 billion bits of data every five minutes,
Johnson explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be overwhelming, especially when lots of storm events
are taking place,'' Johnson said. ``It's very difficult for one or
even two people to keep track of what's going on. Forecasters need
applications that process data behind the scenes to give them
guidance on what's going to happen. Basically we are building
systems that give them a heads-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will be taking some of his severe-weather software to
the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, where he will be training
local forecasters in its use. ``We'll be trying out the
applications with the new Australian Weather Service data and a new
hemisphere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Roberts, an associate scientist at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., uses National Weather
Service data in cooperation with Smith for a different type of
nowcasting: predicting where thunderstorms will be in 30 to 60
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts and her colleagues decide on a forecast after
analyzing the flow of air as it exits the thunderstorm and collides
with air outside the storm area as well as other data, like the
state of cloud formation. ``Our system automatically analyzes the
data and uses the information to tell forecasters where the storms
will be and how much havoc they may produce,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The thunderstorm system was first tested by the National Weather
Service in its Sterling, Va., office last summer, where it sharply
reduced the percentage of false alarms, when severe thunderstorms
were predicted but never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are testing the program again this summer in
Sterling _ but this time the weather is not cooperating.
``Unfortunately,'' Smith said, ``this summer has been extremely
dry, but we still have hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts is comfortable with nowcasts an hour or so out, no
matter how fickle the weather; she says the real difficulties come
at the two- hour mark. ``Saying what's going to happen in two hours
is really the challenge,'' she said, ``when you no longer have
observations that you can extrapolate from.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-hour nowcasts would be particularly useful to pilots, she
said. ``If the aviation community had a good two-hour forecast,
they could more easily fly planes around squall lines or lines of
storms and miss the most vigorous cells,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   The new nowcasting applications are not yet part of the National
Weather Service system that forecasters consult to analyze weather
data and prepare bulletins and warnings, although Smith said he
hoped that they would be integrated into the network by the end of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly learning how storms evolve and dissipate,''
Smith said. ``The new applications aren't meant to supplant
interpretations by people. They are another tool when forecasters
are making decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson agrees. ``We know we're providing guidance, not the
final product,'' he said. ``Nowcasts will always be a combination
of good data, good technology and human interpretation.'' &QL;

PUBLIC RADIO STATION FACES UPROAR OVER FIRINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ILENE LELCHUK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Hundreds of noisy protesters stormed
Berkeley's beloved public radio station after the management of
KPFA-FM dismissed its third radio host in three months, a tussle
heard on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested 52 people during Tuesday's conflict,
including Dennis Bernstein, who hosts the station's public affairs
program ``Flashpoints.'' Bernstein was taken into custody five
hours after being pulled off the air and for refusing to leave the
building.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven other employees and station volunteers were
arrested when they refused to disperse, along with 44 protesters
inside and outside the listener-supported station on Martin Luther
King Way.
</P>
<P>
   The protest, which quickly escalated and brought the police in
riot gear, began just before 6 p.m. as Bernstein ended his one-hour
program. He aired segments of a news conference held earlier in the
day about 13 protesters who were arraigned Tuesday on trespassing
charges for demonstrating against personnel changes at the station
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein violated orders not to report about growing tensions
between KPFA and its parent company, the Pacifica Foundation,
station spokeswoman Elan Fabbri said.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners said Bernstein spent only the last few minutes of his
broadcast on the KPFA struggle, but Fabbri said he spent his entire
hour violating the station's policy. She later admitted, however,
hearing only a few minutes of the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   About 6:10 p.m. Bernstein, off the air, was informed that he was
being put on administrative leave, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow his ensuing struggle with Pacifica guards went on the
air, breaking into a newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Another host tried to explain what was happening but management
shut him off, leaving listeners with dead air for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was all this yelling and the Flashpoints host said, `I'm
afraid I'm going to get hurt!' and then there was nothing,'' said
longtime 94.1 FM listener Felicity Buxton of San Francisco. ``It
was totally frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein maintains he was just reporting the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flabbergasted that I would be pulled from the air ... by
people who founded the station to stand as a bastion of free
speech,'' Bernstein said. ``I believe this is about First Amendment
rights. This is an absolute case of censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica canceled all live broadcasts and replaced the evening
news with a taped Marxist-Maoist analysis of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Taped lectures continued throughout the night in what the staff
and the protesters called a corporate coup and the death of the
nation's oldest public radio station, founded 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's dismissal touched off a massive community response.
KPFA supporters flooded the station lobby, sat down and refused to
leave even under the threat of arrest. Those who finally did leave
on their own were cheered by demonstrators awaiting them outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``KPFA sparks a lot of emotion. I just started listening three
months ago and I never figured I'd be here,'' Jon Logan, 21, of
Benicia, said as he left the lobby. He sped to the station as soon
as he heard the on-air tussle.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested were demonstrators who blocked a police
paddy wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the direction and control of the station _
considered the last bastion for liberal voices _ have been
increasing since April after the contract of the popular station
manager, Nicole Sawaya, was not renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, broadcaster Larry Bensky and volunteer folk music
host Robbie Osman were fired for denouncing management's policies
on the air.
</P>
<P>
   And more than a dozen KPFA supporters were arrested during a
protest at the station in June, when they refused to move away from
the entrance to allow Pacifica Executive Director Lynn Chadwick
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime staffers maintain that Pacifica's board wants to give
KPFA a more mainstream image so that it can attract corporate
donations. Others worry that KPFA might be sold to a commercial
buyer.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail written by a Pacifica national board member that
mentions his interest in selling was intercepted Monday by the San
Francisco-based Media Alliance, a First Amendment watchdog group
that has been monitoring the deepening rift at KPFA. That news had
been announced in Tuesday's press conference, snippets of which
Bernstein used on Flashpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica owns and operates five stations, including KPFT in
Houston and WBAI in New York.

<P>
   George Lucas isn't the only auteur who has been working on the
same fictional universe for 20 years. In the lesser-known realm of
computer games, Richard Garriott is the artistic marathon runner
whose creations have sustained generations of rabid fans over the
decades. As the creator of Ultima, the longest-running fiction in
digital media, Garriott has tended his vision from the dawn of the
PC era to the wired world of sprawling multiplayer on-line games.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Star Wars trilogy, Garriott's computer games have
evolved technologically. When Ascension, the ninth and final
chapter in the Ultima saga, arrives this autumn, Ultima's fictional
realm of Brittannia will unfurl on 266-megahertz computers. But the
underlying themes have always been compelling enough to make the
story viable, even when computer speeds were in the low double
digits.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an astronaut and an art teacher, Garriott, 38,
learned to program in the age of teletype (in the Ur-Ultimas,
graphics meant a 10-by-10 grid of asterisks for walls, spaces for
corridors, dollar signs for treasure and fearsome alphabet letters
in place of orcs, goblins and trolls). Systems were primitive, but
they were sufficient to mimic the fantasy role-playing games of the
time, which were also based on paper.
</P>
<P>
   There was an affinity between Dungeons and Dragons and early
computer games. Both allowed brainy teenage boys to construct
detailed, rule-based fantasy worlds filled with monsters, treasure
and heroic conflict. Both took place largely in the player's
imagination. Together, they spawned a dedicated underground culture
_ and the young Richard Garriott, aka Lord British, ruler of
Brittannia, was an avid, card-carrying member.
</P>
<P>
   The first Ultima was a product of this era: a medieval
hack-and-slash game with simple graphics, programmed on the
state-of-the-art Apple II while Garriott was 19 years old and a
computer store clerk in Houston. ``The manager saw some of the
games I'd done,'' Garriott recalled, ``and said, `These are as good
as some of the stuff we're selling. Why don't you put them up on
the shelf?' So I put them in the cutting-edge packaging of the
time: floppies in plastic bags. And one of those floppies made it
off the store wall to a publisher in California.''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher called and offered to fly him out. ``I signed a
piece of paper, and they started sending me money,'' he said. ``The
company sold about 30,000 copies, and my royalties were about
$150,000. For a high-school kid, for a few weeks' work, that's
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The next two Ultimas followed in quick succession. ``That was my
learning-to-program era,'' Garriott said. ``Ultimas 1, 2 and 3 were
about mastering Basic, then figuring out it would work much faster
in assembly language and teaching myself assembly language.'' The
content was perfectly suited to the entertainment needs of a
20-something fantasy game fan: more monsters, more treasure, more
hacking, more slashing, better graphics.
</P>
<P>
   While Ultima was evolving stepwise, Garriott's life was changing
in leaps. There were big 20-something decisions about moving out of
the house, buying a car, dropping out of college and teaming up
with his brother, Robert, to found a company, Origin Systems (now a
part of Electronic Arts). Next to these real-life risks and
responsibilities, medieval hack-and-slash seemed all too
predictable, even pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got bored with it,'' he said. ``And at the same time, I was
getting these letters calling me the Antichrist because there are
people who associate Dungeons and Dragons with devil worship. And
while I certainly don't think I was corrupting America's youth by
producing this stuff, I had to sit down and consider the ethical
implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultima IV was a coming-of-age story, both for the designer and
for the players. In the game, there was lots of combat. But you
couldn't go around indiscriminately killing people. You couldn't
slaughter villagers, ransack their houses for treasure and rack up
experience points (a winning tactic in Ultima 3). Or rather, you
could, but that made you public enemy No. 1, and the villagers
would attack you. And needless to say, no one would help you.
</P>
<P>
   You were accountable for your actions. If you shortchanged a
blind old hag behind a shop counter, she wouldn't give you a
crucial piece of information later in the game because you were a
dishonest creep. It wasn't enough to be stronger than anything that
crossed your path. Your character, the Avatar, had to attain and
embody virtues like honor, spirituality and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Ultima IV was a true throwback to chivalric legends (in contrast
with Dungeons and Dragons, which, despite its Arthurian trappings,
embodies conquistador values: explore and pillage). Artistically,
it was a huge risk; in 1985, ethical consequences were a new
frontier in game design. Arguably, they are still a new frontier in
1999. But the risk paid off for Garriott and company; Ultima IV was
Origin's first best-selling game.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 15 years, Ultima has been a game where ethics made
sense, not for their own sake but because what goes around comes
around. There have been consequences for shady actions. Every new
title has been a chance for the player to test himself against this
universe and to see its story unfold.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, even the best stories must end. In the forthcoming
Ultima Ascension, the first thing you learn is that this is your
last journey into Garriott's fictional world. When this story ends,
the Avatar can never go back. So the whole adventure is tinged with
a certain wistfulness. For some people, this is the end of a
15-year relationship.
</P>
<P>
   That air of finality enhances the emotional impact of the story.
It also transforms the game play. In Ultima IV, you had to be more
than a wandering marauder. In Ultima Ascension, you have to be more
than a hero who swoops in to solve problems when things go wrong.
You have to teach the people in that world how to survive without
you, giving them the tools they need to sustain themselves. At the
end of the game, you have to leave Ultima behind. This is your last
challenge as a player.
</P>
<P>
   It's also Garriott's last challenge as Ultima's designer. To
ascend from his own fiction, he has to leave behind a living world.
Ultima Online (Origin's first and only networked Ultima) was a
means to this end: a persistent universe populated by 125,000
players, all capable of doing favors and holding grudges and
sustaining their own dramas in a larger community, sans Garriott.
With Ultima Ascension, the designer sees himself out, closing the
door quietly and leaving his players to their own devices.
</P>
<P>
   Lord British has left the building.

GEHRY PLANS ANOTHER ARCHITECTURAL SURPRISE FOR SPAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELCIEGO, Spain _ Frank O. Gehry drove into this medieval
village, 90 minutes south of his acclaimed Guggenheim Museum in
Bilbao, plotting another architectural surprise for Spain in his
first winery project.
</P>
<P>
   There was no international competition this time, like the one
in which he was chosen in June to expand the Corcoran Gallery of
Art in Washington. Gehry, now 70, said he simply wanted another job
near the Guggenheim and was charmed by the hard-working owners of
the 139-year-old Marques de Riscal winery.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million deal was clinched over a bottle of rare red wine
from Riscal's vintage of 1929, the architect's year of birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went into the cellars and brought out a bottle of 1929,''
Gehry said. ``We drank it and it was even good. How could you turn
them down?''
</P>
<P>
   That was last July. On Gehry's second visit to the winery this
month, he showed a preliminary scale model and sketches that depict
a new rectangular building, which he admits will not be the final
shape. As with the Corcoran project, he won over the winery with
his concept for the job; the conclusive design can come later.
</P>
<P>
   Riscal, a pioneer in Spain's premier red wine appellation, Rioja
(which now has 400 wineries), wants to preserve its 19th-century
sandstone buildings with red tile roofs and build Gehry's
four-level structure in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   It will include a visitor's center, public restaurant and
private lodging. He will not design any wine-making facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The winery, whose full name is Vinos de los Herederos del
Marques de Riscal SA, plans daily guided tours, common at many
American wineries but practically unheard of in Spain. Riscal's
owners also envision Gehry architectural tours, starting at the
Guggenheim and then coming 80 miles south to view his design at the
winery, due for completion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim is a curving titanium-clad structure that Gehry,
inspired by the old shipbuilding city of Bilbao, has likened to a
ship. But he said the winery structure would not resemble a wine
bottle, much less a corkscrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it will address the culture of wine,'' Gehry said, ``but
you have to see what I did in Bilbao. I psyched out the culture and
made a building that expressed that. It's more intuitive.''
</P>
<P>
   It will not go unnoticed in this village of 900 people, which is
named after a blind innkeeper of long ago. (``Ciego'' is ``blind''
in Spanish.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You will always, I guess, be able to recognize my work _ there
will always be a bit of surprise,'' Gehry said. ``At first it looks
strange, but people end up liking it. When they first saw the
Guggenheim, there was a lot of anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. The Guggenheim has had 2 million visitors since
opening in 1997, single-handedly revitalizing Bilbao's tourist
trade. Many come principally to see the building, widely praised as
one of the most important architectural works in this century, and
Gehry has become quite fond of Bilbao.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship with the Basque region has been like a
family,'' he said. ``It's so great to be there. Everyone hugs me.
I've never been so adored in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A Basque government official introduced Gehry to Riscal's top
executives, who are mainly from the winery's five owner families.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never gone out picking my work,'' he said. ``I wait
till it hits me on the head.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect has a second winery project in the works, which
grew from an introduction by a cousin. Gehry is to design a $3.4
million winery for a Canadian and French joint venture to create a
new winery in Ontario. It will be his first building in his native
Canada, although he has designed interiors there. He left for Los
Angeles half a century ago and became an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   At Riscal, Gehry has not disclosed the building materials. ``I
don't think we'll use titanium,'' he said. ``Plaster, stone, glass
and wood are the likely candidates. The winery is after a
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Riscal's winery production director, Francisco Hurtado, a
descendant of the founder, agreed. ``The winery is a series of
buildings. To join all of them so visitors can come on a coherent
circuit, we've asked for his help.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado, who participated in planning sessions with Gehry,
predicted: ``The new building won't have a straight line. All
curves.''
</P>
<P>
   The winery is Gehry's third project in Spain. For the Barcelona
Olympics in 1992, he designed a giant fish sculpture and commercial
center at the base of a new skyscraper hotel on the city's
Mediterranean beach.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry's 33,000-square-foot winery plan will consist mainly of
the visitor's center, but he will also design an entrance for a new
wine-making plant nearby on the company's 37-acre headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Riscal is a mid-size winery that exports to 52 nations, the
United States among them since 1903. Gehry does not consider
himself a wine expert, but over a winery lunch of lamb chops, green
salad and four red wines, including a 1942 and a 1945, he ribbed
his hosts for not sending wine to his home in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want one from every year,'' Gehry deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Later Hurtado said the winery hoped that the globe-trotting
architect would stay within budget but that it planned to exercise
little other control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gehry's No. 1,'' said Hurtado, standing in a Riscal aging
cellar that holds 4 million bottles. ``You can't tell him how to do
it.''  &QL;

   The rush to register Internet addresses a few years ago produced
a horde of speculators eager to cash in on the appreciated _ or
busted _ values of their virtual real estate. Thousands of Internet
addresses are being offered for sale daily at auction sites such as
Ebay, Amazon.com and Yahoo. The most popular themes for sale
involve the 2000 election, assorted body parts and the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   If auctions are the fairest way to assess market value, then
most of the domains appear worthless &UR; , &LR;  attracting bids that fall
short of the $70 initial registration fee required by Network
Solutions, the Internet domain registration body that once had
exclusive control over .com, .net and .org domains.
</P>
<P>
   JewelersMallofAmerica.com and ad.com had not received any bids
in their first four days listed on Ebay. In fact, a search of
current and completed auctions revealed that more than 90 percent
of domain names offered for sale on the sites receive no bids. Many
of the names have awkward `e' and `i' prefixes like
eBillionaires.com and iWimbledon.com, or are strung together by
unappealing hyphens like cowboys-r-us.com.
</P>
<P>
   To attract bidders, some sellers suggest uses for their
addresses. The owner of hillary2OOO.org, a name that uses capital
`o's in place of zeros, proposes a parody site of the First Lady's
senatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some domain &UR; - &LR; name sellers never intended to start Web
businesses. Others had business plans that never got off the
ground. In some cases, the Internet addresses became obsolete when
the company's name changed. Todd Bernhard, president of Internet
Headquarters, registered memo.com in 1993 after he left Sun
Microsystems to start a company called Memorandom.  &UR;  &LR;  When the
company changed its name to Internet Headquarters and its Internet
address to hq.net, Bernhard found himself with a valuable piece of
Internet real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ebay seemed like a good way to market our domain to a
high-tech audience,'' Bernhard said. The domain name recently was
bid up to $50,000 on Ebay. But he sold it later for an undisclosed
amount. A popular way for owners to test the value of domain names
is to put them on sale with high undisclosed reserve prices. If the
test run is encouraging, owners will frequently offer the item for
auction again.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Schwartz, a self-proclaimed virtual real estate developer
who owns more than 3,000 names, browses auction sites daily for
good deals. In one day he bid on pennsylvania.com,
dailystockpick.com, digitalnews.com and faithful.com.
</P>
<P>
   Before domain name auctions took off a few months ago, Schwartz
searched registration databases and made offers to owners through
e-mail. Now, he says, the auctions have brought sellers out in the
open, creating a clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Among Schwartz's most valuable properties are porno.com and
men.com, for which he paid $42,000 and $15,000, respectively, in
1997. He estimates they are worth far more now and does not plan to
sell any of his names soon. Schwartz said he has several million in
annual revenue from advertising on his sites and other Web-related
business.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 of his domain names have pornographic overtones. But
he has a sentimental side, too. A few weeks ago, Schwartz bought
hy.org on Ebay for $400 to set up a commemoration site for his late
father, Hy, who died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Straightforward names are the most valuable, Schwartz said. ``It
should be easy to spell, easy to remember and have a direct
association with product you are trying to sell. The more valuable
the product, the more valuable the domain name,'' said Schwartz,
who decided to forgo marshmallow.com because there is little money
to be made with the confection.
</P>
<P>
   He said there is a definite premium for .com addresses, which
are more popular. ``If you buy a dot net it's almost spitting in
the wind.''

<P>
   George Lucas isn't the only auteur who has been working on the
same fictional universe for 20 years. In the lesser-known realm of
computer games, Richard Garriott is the artistic marathon runner
whose creations have sustained generations of rabid fans over the
decades. As the creator of Ultima, the longest-running fiction in
digital media, Garriott has tended his vision from the dawn of the
PC era to the wired world of sprawling multiplayer on-line games.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Star Wars trilogy, Garriott's computer games have
evolved technologically. When Ascension, the ninth and final
chapter in the Ultima saga, arrives this autumn, Ultima's fictional
realm of Brittannia will unfurl on 266-megahertz computers. But the
underlying themes have always been compelling enough to make the
story viable, even when computer speeds were in the low double
digits.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an astronaut and an art teacher, Garriott, 38,
learned to program in the age of teletype (in the Ur-Ultimas,
graphics meant a 10-by-10 grid of asterisks for walls, spaces for
corridors, dollar signs for treasure and fearsome alphabet letters
in place of orcs, goblins and trolls). Systems were primitive, but
they were sufficient to mimic the fantasy role-playing games of the
time, which were also based on paper.
</P>
<P>
   There was an affinity between Dungeons and Dragons and early
computer games. Both allowed brainy teenage boys to construct
detailed, rule-based fantasy worlds filled with monsters, treasure
and heroic conflict. Both took place largely in the player's
imagination. Together, they spawned a dedicated underground culture
_ and the young Richard Garriott, aka Lord British, ruler of
Brittannia, was an avid, card-carrying member.
</P>
<P>
   The first Ultima was a product of this era: a medieval
hack-and-slash game with simple graphics, programmed on the
state-of-the-art Apple II while Garriott was 19 years old and a
computer store clerk in Houston. ``The manager saw some of the
games I'd done,'' Garriott recalled, ``and said, `These are as good
as some of the stuff we're selling. Why don't you put them up on
the shelf?' So I put them in the cutting-edge packaging of the
time: floppies in plastic bags. And one of those floppies made it
off the store wall to a publisher in California.''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher called and offered to fly him out. ``I signed a
piece of paper, and they started sending me money,'' he said. ``The
company sold about 30,000 copies, and my royalties were about
$150,000. For a high-school kid, for a few weeks' work, that's
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The next two Ultimas followed in quick succession. ``That was my
learning-to-program era,'' Garriott said. ``Ultimas 1, 2 and 3 were
about mastering Basic, then figuring out it would work much faster
in assembly language and teaching myself assembly language.'' The
content was perfectly suited to the entertainment needs of a
20-something fantasy game fan: more monsters, more treasure, more
hacking, more slashing, better graphics.
</P>
<P>
   While Ultima was evolving stepwise, Garriott's life was changing
in leaps. There were big 20-something decisions about moving out of
the house, buying a car, dropping out of college and teaming up
with his brother, Robert, to found a company, Origin Systems (now a
part of Electronic Arts). Next to these real-life risks and
responsibilities, medieval hack-and-slash seemed all too
predictable, even pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got bored with it,'' he said. ``And at the same time, I was
getting these letters calling me the Antichrist because there are
people who associate Dungeons and Dragons with devil worship. And
while I certainly don't think I was corrupting America's youth by
producing this stuff, I had to sit down and consider the ethical
implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultima IV was a coming-of-age story, both for the designer and
for the players. In the game, there was lots of combat. But you
couldn't go around indiscriminately killing people. You couldn't
slaughter villagers, ransack their houses for treasure and rack up
experience points (a winning tactic in Ultima 3). Or rather, you
could, but that made you public enemy No. 1, and the villagers
would attack you. And needless to say, no one would help you.
</P>
<P>
   You were accountable for your actions. If you shortchanged a
blind old hag behind a shop counter, she wouldn't give you a
crucial piece of information later in the game because you were a
dishonest creep. It wasn't enough to be stronger than anything that
crossed your path. Your character, the Avatar, had to attain and
embody virtues like honor, spirituality and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Ultima IV was a true throwback to chivalric legends (in contrast
with Dungeons and Dragons, which, despite its Arthurian trappings,
embodies conquistador values: explore and pillage). Artistically,
it was a huge risk; in 1985, ethical consequences were a new
frontier in game design. Arguably, they are still a new frontier in
1999. But the risk paid off for Garriott and company; Ultima IV was
Origin's first best-selling game.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 15 years, Ultima has been a game where ethics made
sense, not for their own sake but because what goes around comes
around. There have been consequences for shady actions. Every new
title has been a chance for the player to test himself against this
universe and to see its story unfold.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, even the best stories must end. In the forthcoming
Ultima Ascension, the first thing you learn is that this is your
last journey into Garriott's fictional world. When this story ends,
the Avatar can never go back. So the whole adventure is tinged with
a certain wistfulness. For some people, this is the end of a
15-year relationship.
</P>
<P>
   That air of finality enhances the emotional impact of the story.
It also transforms the game play. In Ultima IV, you had to be more
than a wandering marauder. In Ultima Ascension, you have to be more
than a hero who swoops in to solve problems when things go wrong.
You have to teach the people in that world how to survive without
you, giving them the tools they need to sustain themselves. At the
end of the game, you have to leave Ultima behind. This is your last
challenge as a player.
</P>
<P>
   It's also Garriott's last challenge as Ultima's designer. To
ascend from his own fiction, he has to leave behind a living world.
Ultima Online (Origin's first and only networked Ultima) was a
means to this end: a persistent universe populated by 125,000
players, all capable of doing favors and holding grudges and
sustaining their own dramas in a larger community, sans Garriott.
With Ultima Ascension, the designer sees himself out, closing the
door quietly and leaving his players to their own devices.
</P>
<P>
   Lord British has left the building.

`THE THING CALLED LOVE:' A COUNTRY MUSIC TRIANGLE COMES FULL
CIRCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
 &HT;     By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Look out, Music City, `cause I'm here now, and I ain't never
leavin'!'' an aspiring country singer with the potent name of
Miranda Presley (Samantha Mathis) whoops into the night from a
Nashville rooftop early in ``The Thing Called Love.'' Her exultant
shouts distill the optimistic down-home spirit of this cheery but
trivial 1993 movie, directed by Peter Bogdanovich, about
guitar-toting hopefuls converging on the country music capital at a
moment when (thanks to Garth Brooks) the music was enjoying a huge
spurt of popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Watching this mildly engaging, formulaic film, you can imagine
how it was pitched as a can't-miss early 90s fusion of
``Nashville'' and ``Urban Cowboy,'' with a sure-fire soundtrack
album tie-in. Not only would it revive the director's sagging
career, it would be just the vehicle to propel its male lead, River
Phoenix, into the stratosphere alongside John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   Well, so much for Hollywood fantasies. After ``The Thing Called
Love'' fared disappointingly at the box office in some regional
dates, it went straight to video. It also turned out to be the last
completed feature film for the star, who died of a drug overdose on
Halloween in 1993. Six years later it is having its New York
theatrical premiere, Saturday at Anthology Film Archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thing Called Love'' begins promisingly, as Miranda arrives
in Nashville by Greyhound from New York just minutes too late to
participate in weekly auditions for a Saturday night showcase at
the legendary Bluebird Cafe. While hanging around the place,
however, she falls in with two other hopefuls, best friends and
fellow musicians James Wright ( Phoenix) and Kyle Davidson (Dermot
Mulroney), both of whom develop instant crushes on her.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda also befriends Linda Lue Linden (Sandra Bullock), a
marginally talented singer-songwriter who obviously doesn't have
what it takes to be a country star. Linda Lue, who eventually
decides to enter a local beauty contest, invites Miranda to be her
motel roommate. Miranda takes a job as a waitress at the cafe,
where she is watched over by its crusty but good-hearted
proprietor, Lucy (the country singer K.T. Oslin).
</P>
<P>
   Although well acted, with early scenes that deftly sketch the
atmosphere, the movie, written by Carol Heikkinen, never takes off.
Instead of seriously exploring Nashville's music world and
concentrating on Miranda's struggle to succeed, the screenplay
throws her into a listless triangle with James and Kyle. Since
Miranda seems hardheaded and commonsensical most of the time, her
impulsive marriage to the selfish, manipulative James is
unconvincing. Meanwhile, Kyle, an inept daredevil prone to injuring
himself in showoff stunts, mopes around until an inevitable
showdown brings the two friends to blows. The tacked-on feel-good
ending is utterly false.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, who has outgrown his boyish ingenuousness in this film,
strikes some sparks as a spoiled, hotheaded rising star whose charm
curdles into a glowering sulk the instant he doesn't get his way.
But it is finally not a star-making performance. Phoenix even gets
to sing one of his own songs in the film, the mediocre ``Lone Star
State of Mind.'' Somebody was smart enough to realize that such
fare could never climb any chart. That's why James'
career-launching hit, ``Until Now,'' was written and sung in the
movie by someone else, namely Rodney Crowell. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thing Called Love'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It has some strong language and sexual situations.

FAKE TANS GO UPSCALE WITH SALON APPLICATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am bronzed. I am golden. I am glowing. As I walk down the
street after lunch on a bright July day, I have to work at not
staring at my perfectly tanned skin, or at least not being too
obvious when I do.
</P>
<P>
   Then I look down, and I let out an involuntary yelp. Oh, dear!
My pale khakis are turning brown! Not everywhere, just in spots.
But big ones. Big, brown, spreading spots.
</P>
<P>
   My new fake tan has sprung a leak.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't just any fake tan. This was a tan that cost $65,
plus tip; a fake tan that had taken an hour and a half to be
applied that very morning, painstakingly painted on by an
aesthetician in a chic day spa.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to American ingenuity and our ultimate service economy
to come up with this. Not only can you buy a fake tan, now you can
pay someone to put it on you.
</P>
<P>
   At spas and hair salons around North Texas, the process _ called
body bronzing, self-tanning buffing or simply bronzing _ costs from
$45 to $65, and sometimes more if you get the recommended sea-salt
exfoliation first. The idea is simple: A technician applies
self-tanning lotion to your near-naked body. She gets all the spots
you have trouble reaching (the small of your back, the back of your
knees). Because she's a pro, she coats your skin evenly, without
streaks or bald spots. You wait for it to dry, you put your clothes
back on, you walk out of the salon smoothly aglow. If you're lucky
_ and you don't scrub too vigorously in the shower _ your tan might
last a week.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the salon-applied tan was born on the West Coast
nearly a decade ago. It has now taken off in Texas, where, despite
the danger of skin cancer and the threat of wrinkles, tans have
never truly gone out of style. Here, unless your natural skin color
is a creamy alabaster or a smooth mocha, you probably want to be
darker, or at least sun-kissed.
</P>
<P>
   The salon-bought tan has another selling point: Leaks, cost and
time obligation aside, this kind of fake tan looks GOOD.
</P>
<P>
   Fake tans are nothing new, of course. As far back as the '60s,
back before anyone talked about skin cancer or sunscreen SPF
factors, you could buy a tan-in-a-bottle. For years, though, the
products had a reputation for creating orangy, streaky tans.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of today's self-tanners use the same active
ingredient as the early products _ dihydroxyacetone, or DHA, a
pigmenting agent that produces a reddish-brown color by binding
with amino acids in the outer layers of the skin. Manufacturers
have tinkered with the formulas over the years, changing the DHA
concentration and the moisturizers and the fragrances; now, the
resulting color tends toward a more natural golden-brown. But the
makers couldn't control user error.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel they can't get (the self-tanner) on evenly, or
they have trouble getting it on their backs or the backs of their
legs,'' says Kay Rose, an aesthetician at the Neiman Marcus salon
in Fort Worth, where she has performed the bronzing process for
about two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone else does it for you, it goes on much more
smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the idea behind the most recent development in the
self-tanning business: the Mystic Tan at Palm Beach Tan in Coppell,
a Dallas suburb. For $20 _ less if you buy a tanning membership _
you stand in a specially designed shower stall and gets sprayed
with a mixture of moisturizer, self-tanner and bronzer. It's
essentially a human carwash, except you come out tan.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how it's applied, sunless tanning creams grt
dermatologists' vote over the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harmless,'' says Dr. James McCarty, a Fort Worth
dermatologist in practice for 20 years. ``Obviously, we would
prefer people do something like this rather than go out in the
sun.''
</P>
<P>
   All sunless tanning products are essentially the same, he says.
Therefore, you might as well buy the cheapest ones. If you have
trouble getting the product on smoothly, McCarty recommends
slathering yourself with lotion first.
</P>
<P>
   The salon services have a certain snob appeal and an obvious
attraction for people who aren't adept at applying tanners. People
like me. From my earliest tries (an unfortunate experience with a
product no longer available, Sudden Tan, which made me look like a
walking yam), to the most recent (Neutrogena spray-on, which
resulted in reasonably tan-looking legs except for the spots I
missed), tanners fail me miserably. Every summer I buy a new type,
and after one or two tries, I give up. Who needs streaky tan skin?
Up with pale!
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of a no-fault tan _ paid for by my employer _ was
too much to resist.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Mystic Tan. Not much to it. Strip down, enter the
booth, assume the position, close your eyes and push the button.
The spray lasts 17 seconds. You're supposed to hold your breath,
but as a thorough reporter, I cheated, and can report no ill
effects or noxious smells. The spray is followed by a brief
fan-blown drying period. Then you exit the booth and buff your skin
with a towel, kind of like using a chamois on a car.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was, at first, on the orange side. And when I
exercised a few hours later, the stuff turned my socks a weird
pinkish-tan. But the next morning, my skin was lightly tan and
glowing. Nobody asked me what kind of fake tanner I'd used. People
thought I'd spent the weekend swimming. I could get used to this.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a fake tan doesn't last very long. Within a week,
I was back for more, this time at Daired's Hair Salon and Day Spa
in Arlington, between Fort Worth and Dallas. The spa version of the
body-bronzing process is slower, more pampering, more personalized.
An aesthetician uses a paintbrush to apply a liquid self-tanner
called Safe Tan all over as you relax on a heated massage table.
After an hour and a half, the effect is smooth and remarkably
similar to a real tan.
</P>
<P>
   Before I head to work, I'm warned not to sweat or shower for at
least 12 hours. The lotion needs time to settle in. At the office,
I feel tan and healthy, as if I'd just gotten back from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, however, the drawbacks start to show up.
Spots appear on my pants. I start to feel dirty. Painted. I need a
shower.
</P>
<P>
   But I hold off. I have been converted, and not just because of
the $65 price tag: Mostly, I don't want to wash away my tan.

REMOLDING BURROUGHS' TARZAN TO FIT DISNEY'S MODERN MYTHOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the stunningly animated Disney film ``Tarzan,'' there is
little doubt about the evil tendencies of a big-chinned character
named Clayton: he wants to cage friendly apes, has little respect
for women and likes to shoot first and ask questions later. He
embodies egotistical maleness, a quality that, outside action
films, has become the epitome of contemporary villainy.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, though, the Clayton that Edgar Rice Burroughs
created. In the 1912 novel, Clayton is not an imperialist game
hunter ready to sell Tarzan's apes into slavery. He is Tarzan's
nobly born father.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's transformation of Clayton from extraordinary ancestor
to villainous nemesis is just part of a major revision of the
Tarzan story that has largely gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   The film is likely to become a Disney classic, but along the way
it remolded the ape-man to fit Disney mythology, a mythology that
began to take shape more than 60 years ago and is inextricably
linked to American attitudes toward race, ethnicity and culture.
</P>
<P>
   But before leaping onto those knotted vines, consider the
original novel. However marred it is by racial stereotypes and
occasional banalities, its ambitions are grand and unexpectedly
intelligent. Lord John Clayton is commissioned by Her Majesty's
government to investigate a competing imperial power's ``unfair
treatment of black British subjects'' in a West African colony. The
black natives are being indentured into a form of slavery, and
Clayton is dispatched to see justice done. He is meant to reflect
the noble side of what Kipling called the ``white man's burden.''
He is to enforce the ideals of civilization among the civilized.
</P>
<P>
   But from the very start he sees just how thin that veneer of
civilization is. On the boat that is transporting him, a crew of
``brutal,'' ``coarse'' seamen mutiny and split their captain's head
open with an ax. Clayton is saved by a friend among the crew
members who sends him a ``crude message printed in uncouth
letters'' warning him of the mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The friend does him another favor with far less pleasant
consequences: Clayton and his pregnant wife are dropped off in the
uncharted jungle instead of being killed. Clayton's first vision is
of a fearsome manlike figure in the distance, which turns out to be
a vicious ape, the inverse image of his future son, an apelike
figure who turns into a man.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history, with pulpish smatterings of ``Robinson
Crusoe,'' ``The Jungle Book'' and ``Heart of Darkness'' along the
way. The Claytons die, and their infant son is raised by apes.
</P>
<P>
   But Burroughs keeps beating the drum for one of his main themes:
It is difficult to tell the civilized world _ with its vicious
mutineers, ruthless imperialists and plotting capitalists _ from
the jungle world. The main difference seems to be in surface
manners: Tarzan wipes his ``greasy fingers upon his naked thighs''
after feasting on raw flesh, while in London his cousin Lord
Clayton follows his roasted meat course by dipping his fingertips
in a ``silver bowl of scented water.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise the similarities are rampant. The apes' communal
gatherings are ancestors of the ``forms and ceremonials of modern
church and state.'' The ship's mutineers devour human flesh just as
the jungle cannibals do.
</P>
<P>
   Tarzan, though, finally discovers the differences (partly helped
by what Burroughs imperially thinks of as his ``noble blood''). He
learns to read and write from the picture-book primers he finds in
the Claytons' cabin. He ends up becoming ruler of the apes not by
brute force but by applying strategy, delaying gratification and
using tools. Tarzan masters nature while learning culture; in the
book, his first spoken language is French.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this was stripped away by dozens of other Tarzan films,
but in Disney's version, the transformation is meticulous and
deliberate. Tarzan's father's name is given to a callous blockhead.
Tarzan's laborious and solitary attempts to cultivate his
``higher'' qualities are turned into a lighthearted exploration of
human identity with Jane and her father.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his cynicism, Burroughs left no doubt about
civilization's achievements. But in Disney's version, the apes end
up seeming more sympathetically human than their hunters.
</P>
<P>
   What does this have to do with Disney mythology? Well, animated
Disney films _ from ``Snow White'' to ``Mulan'' _ have almost
always been about outsiders, like Tarzan, seeking a home in an
inhospitable world. These figures are rejected, isolated, alien,
the victims of jealousy, snobbery, banality and hatred. This is why
the ``ethnic'' _ a word that now connotes being outside a
mainstream _ has been such a recurring Disney trope.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every animated Disney film has important ethnic
characters (who often get the best songs): the black crows in
``Dumbo,'' the jazz-playing alley cats of ``The Aristocats,'' the
Italian cooks in ``Lady and the Tramp,'' the Jamaican crab in ``The
Little Mermaid,'' the Gypsy in ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame.''
Sometimes the portraits verge on racial caricature. (James
Baskett's portrayal of Uncle Remus in ``Song of the South'' in
1946, for example, will probably never be released in video form.)
</P>
<P>
   But mainly the ethnic is granted a wisdom that will help the
hero or heroine, a fellow outsider, find acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The real villains are the racists and nativists who reject all
difference and insist on exclusion: the other elephants in
``Dumbo,'' for example, or the narrow-minded Gaston of ``Beauty and
the Beast.'' Despite the right-wing reputation Walt Disney himself
had, the studio's films have long honored a version of melting-pot
liberalism. The outsider is welcomed, the tramp civilized, the
beast turned human, the mainstream transformed.
</P>
<P>
   This theme changed slightly in the 1990s under the influence of
ethnic politics. Why strive to join a middle when the middle should
be asked to respect the margin? Instead of seeking integration,
films were preoccupied with identity and separation. The notion of
a mainstream nonethnic culture seemed to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pocahontas'' presented a declaration of ethnic independence:
the outsider (the intruding white man) was a danger. Similarly
``The Lion King'' celebrated an ethnic culture (the African
``Circle of Life'') that needed protection from outside attack (by
the campy heathen Scar). ``Mulan'' extended the genre by allying
gender-bending feminism with ardent ethnic assertion: the Chinese
repel their invaders with the help of a woman dressed as a man and
men dressed as women.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Tarzan,'' which would seem to be a kind of hybrid of
earlier Disney modes. Like the Little Mermaid and the Beast, Tarzan
is an outsider who yearns to be accepted in a society he seems ill
suited for (even if, in his case, it is not human). He is
heartbroken over his difference from his jungle family, but firmly
declares, ``I'll be the best ape ever,'' an immigrant determined to
earn his credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The path isn't easy. The ape king, who rejects the pale-skinned
human boy, is challenged by Tarzan: ``Why are you threatened by
anyone different from you?'' But then comes acceptance; at the
point of death, the ape king names Tarzan heir: ``Take care of our
family, my son.'' This melting-pot acceptance is then joined with a
``Lion King'' style celebration of a beleaguered ethnicity: taking
care means defending the clan against the alien, white and human
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   But as if holding a finger to the cultural winds, the Disney
team also uses the story to give these ideas an even more
contemporary twist. Tarzan cannot fully oppose the human nor fully
join the apes. He is like the child of a biracial or bicultural
marriage. The ethnic issue is by no means clear; allegiance can be
declared, but it can't be made absolute. The xenophobic ape and the
xenophobic human, with their opposing versions of ethnic supremacy,
are both to be scorned. Ethnic pride must be tempered.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few hints of this idea in ``Pocahontas,'' which
seemed to set up a symmetry between the more extreme Indians and
colonists. But in the end, sides were taken in favor of the
pastoral ethnics. Even in ``Tarzan,'' remnants of this advocacy
remain. The West is hardly held up as a cultural paragon: the movie
ends with the decent humans deciding to remain in the jungle,
swinging through the trees.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Tarzan,'' unlike any other recent-vintage Disney film,
allegiance to a single culture is part of the problem, not part of
the solution: the message is cultural equivalence. This is really
where Burroughs' novel is stood on its post-colonial head. There
are no distinctions to be made. There is no higher wisdom, no
inborn nobility, no human superiority.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Disney myth, which originally celebrated the melting
pot, now honors the latest version of democratic multiculturalism
with Tarzan as its unlikely prophet. This is why Clayton could not
survive in his old form; he would have been a reminder, however
flawed, that there might be some distinctions worth making.
</P>
<P>
   It only looks as if Tarzan remains in the jungle at the movie's
end. Actually, he is right at home.  &QL;

FINDING TRANSLATION HELP TO VIEW WORD AND EXCEL

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I use Microsoft Word and Excel and make copies of the files
for my secretary. She does not have Word or Excel on her PC, and
when she tries to open the files, she gets gobbledy-gook. Is there
a way to open these files if you do not have Word or Excel? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a free program called Word Viewer that might help
you; you can download it from Microsoft's Web site. Word Viewer
allows people who don't have Microsoft Word installed on their
computers to open, read and print Word files.
</P>
<P>
   Opened with the viewer, the documents look the same as they do
on the screen of someone using Word. A Word Viewer file cannot be
edited or altered, but you can copy information from it into
another program to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also distributes free viewer software for documents
created with Excel. You can download both from Microsoft's Web site
(www.microsoft.com/office/000/viewers.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how complicated a Word file is, in terms of text
styling and formatting, you can also save it t as a Text Only file,
which your secretary should be able to open and edit in Word Pad or
just about any other word-processing program.
</P>
<P>
   If you frequently need to open files created in other programs,
try a file-translation application like Conversions Plus from
Dataviz (www.dataviz.com). &QL;

 &HT;    Half-baked Bizkit unleashed
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guitars crunch like monster trucks in a mating duel. Weird,
distorted keyboard lines bounce and squish like a throbbing,
morning-after migraine. Crisp hip-hop beats snap and crackle.
Despite its self-promoted image as the lowest of the low, the
Florida-spawned hard rock band Limp Bizkit has its virtues: The
group knows how to hone a sonic concept until it gleams like a
lethal weapon. That there's almost nothing original about that
concept, which welds metal's thundering intensity with rap's slinky
bottom end and verbal gymnastics, really doesn't matter. By
cross-wiring Rage Against the Machine with Cypress Hill, and
replacing the left-wing politics and stoner schtick with a
bottomless well of adolescent anger, Limp Bizkit seems to speak for
a nation of brats.
</P>
<P>
   Brats with bucks: ``Significant Other'' is the No. 1 album in
the country this week, which reflects the potency of anything
remotely hip-hop (vocalist Fred Durst raps in a sing-song fashion
and collaborates with guests such as DJ Premier of Gang Starr and
Method Man from the Wu-Tang Clan) and the almost subversive need
for surly, aggressive rock 'n' roll amid a deluge of squeaky clean
teen pop. Yet, Durst's insistence on playing the role of a whiny
dirt bag gets old fast, and his efforts at emulating his rap heroes
won't cause the Beastie Boys to lose any sleep.
</P>
<P>
   What redeems ``Significant Other'' is the way its tilt-a-whirl
rhythms erupt out of the speakers _ you'll find the name of
Atlanta-based producer Brendan O'Brien (Rage Against the Machine,
Red Hot Chili Peppers) listed as the mixer _ and a sense of
playfulness that sneaks in behind Durst's splenetic fits.

<P>
   Public Enemy. Atomic Pop.
</P>
<P>
   14 tracks. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In 1988, Public Enemy picked the needle up on dance-happy rap
and dropped it on its state-of-the-rap-world address, ``It Takes a
Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.'' The boom that is lead rapper
Chuck D's voice, backed by the sirens that became his group's
signature, made Public Enemy's second album the start of a
heightened political awareness within hip-hop culture.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, the consciousness some wore around their
necks _ with a pendant in the shape of Africa _ has gone the way of
the fat gold chain. Dance-happy rap has returned to turntables. And
Public Enemy is still mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a nation of sellouts to keep us back,'' roars Chuck D
on ``Do You Wanna Go Our Way ???'' as industrial-strength guitars
seem to signal Godzilla's approach. That lyrical barb hurled toward
rap's mainstream appeal is one of many in this terse, cleverly
written _ if not always cohesive _ arsenal. ``I'' is aimed at the
record industry. White-owned black radio stations come under fire
on ``Crayola.'' The standout, ``41:19,'' targets the shooting of
Amadou Diallo _ the unarmed African immigrant killed in a barrage
of bullets by four New York policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Since this effort only comes up for air _ and levity _ on ``What
What,'' listening could be exhausting. But overall it's an exercise
worth the exertion.

   ``Nothing for Anyone''
</P>
<P>
   Alastor. Gate-Crasher Records. 10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The title of this local rock trio's second release suggests a
willful turn toward the esoteric _ the antithesis of ``something
for everyone.'' But fear not, Alastor fans (and you are a slowly
but steadily growing congregation): ``Nothing for Anyone'' is quite
listener-friendly, even more so than the group's catchy debut,
``Javelin Catcher.'' Elizabeth Elkins, the trio's vocalist,
guitarist and songwriter, draws on a variety of influences, from
the Velvet Underground to the Pretenders, to produce a concise set
of rockers that spit attitude and hum with hooks. The album's
naked, sometimes flat, production would sink a lesser singer.
Luckily, Elkins possesses a nuanced and charismatic voice.

<P>
   ``Eden''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Brightman. Angel. 16 tracks. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Brightman has a pretty voice, albeit not a lot of taste in
repertory. (Consider ``Aspects of Love.'') The CD for her latest
concert tour, ``Eden,'' which brought the 38-year-old singer to the
Atlanta Civic Center this week, shows the former Mrs. Andrew Lloyd
Webber in a classical vein, mostly, singing real and ersatz opera:
some, such as ``Nessun dorma,'' done straight; some, such as the
Albinoni adagio and the theme from the 1986 film ``The Mission,''
juiced up with a rock beat and dreamy-dreary lyrics (mostly by her
current flame and producer, Frank Peterson). For the soft-pop
numbers, she uses a wispy, little-girl voice that's supposed to
sound innocent but is mostly breathy. But she does ``Lascia ch'io
pianga'' (from Handel's ``Julius Caesar'') as though she means it,
in full and luscious voice. Wish the whole album could have been
that way.

 &HT;    An aural guide to mix-and-match music
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Surrender'' isn't the most innovative dance record of the
year, but it is one of the most varied. As busy DJs, Chemical
Brothers Ed Simons and Tom Rowlands must keep the slabs of vinyl in
their record crates fresh. When recording their own tracks, Simons
and Rowlands graft bits of those grooves onto Chemical Brothers
tracks. There's a little of the French House of Daft Punk and
Motorbass, touches of the hyperdrive techno-pop soundscapes of
Underworld and some updated takes on the funky break beats that the
pair's own ``Exit Planet Dust'' helped popularize. They dig deep
into the record bins of the past, too. Shades of Kraftwerk and New
Order color several tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Top-notch vocal contributions come from New Order's Bernard
Sumner, Oasis' Noel Gallagher, Mercury Rev's Jonathan Donahue and
Mazzy Star's sleepy-voiced Hope Sandoval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Control,'' with Sumner on lead vocal, is one of the
brothers' finest achievements. It sounds just as you'd expect a
collision of the Chemical Brothers and New Order would: percolating
synthesizers, ferocious beats and melancholy melodicism that's
bound to inspire frenetic dancing.

 &HT;    Stopping by the `Station' well worth it
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Central Station'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Cynical adult gets stuck with adorable kid and gradually
rediscovers faith in the world. It's a moth-eaten movie setup: Adam
Sandler's ``Big Daddy'' is only the latest spin on it. So you might
approach this Brazilian nominee for best foreign film with caution.
Don't. What's remarkable about Walter Salles' film is the way it
subverts expectations and sidesteps easy sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   It earns tears honestly. That's largely thanks to Fernanda
Montenegro's performance as Dora, an embittered former
schoolteacher who ekes out a living in Rio de Janeiro's central
train station, writing letters for the illiterate masses _ letters
she doesn't bother to send.
</P>
<P>
   When one of her clients dies, she finds herself in charge of the
woman's 9-year-old son (Vinicius de Oliveira), who claims his
father lives in a village far away. Reluctantly, Dora accompanies
him through the poverty-stricken landscape, in search not only of
this elusive father figure, but of Dora's own belief in life and
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Salles shoots with a detail that gives the movie a documentary
feeling, as starkly naked as Dora's makeup-free face. And that face
alone is worth the price of the movie's rental. With all due
respect to Gwyneth Paltrow, Montenegro delivers the most
uncompromising and memorable female performance of 1998.

   &QR;  ``A Civil Action'' (PG-13) _ Based on a true story, this legal
thriller stars John Travolta as a slick, small-time personal injury
lawyer who tackles two giant corporations whose careless waste
management caused leukemia in a dozen kids. Robert Duvall is his
cagey opponent. Travolta is miscast, and the movie can't quite

reworking of ``Pygmalion,'' the comedy has one big problem: Its

   of Engagement'' (Unrated) _ A haunting examination of the 1993
tragedy near Waco, Texas, director William Gazecki's documentary is
unashamedly one-sided. But it convinces the viewer that everything
he may have heard previously about the Branch Davidians was also
one-sided: damage-control sound bites spun from the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and FBI spokesmen during and after
the 51-day standoff. The movie's ample footage, inside and outside
the compound, interviews with Branch Davidians who survived the
siege and Capitol Hill testimony suggest that many decisions made
by ATF and FBI agents were at the very least questionable, if not
outright criminal. The film's underlying thesis is that the
government bungled its initial assault, lied about mistakes made by
ATF officials and essentially razed the compound and killed its
occupants to destroy evidence and save face. It's a bald
allegation. But Gazecki certainly makes you question many of the
government's actions. Grade: B

 &HT;    INDIAN ELEPHANTS STILL ABUSED, ACTIVISTS SAY
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Horrific abuse continues against elephants in
India, Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., told his colleagues Wednesday,
urging them to support a waiver that would help fight it.
</P>
<P>
   Wild elephants, captured when they raid crops, ``are still being
beaten and starved into submission'' by animal trainers, Farr said.
In addition, he said, elephants face increasing pressure from
habitat loss and poaching for their tusks and meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current threat to Asian elephants is often greatly
underestimated by the international community,'' Farr said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Derby, a celebrated animal trainer, said that education is
key to alleviating the abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers ``may believe it's the right thing to do, but if they
are exposed to alternatives, you can change them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Barker, host of ``The Price Is Right'' and an animal rights
activist, urged animal trainers to listen to experts in the global
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to give them expert advice and we have the
funds available that we are willing to spend to help them,'' Barker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Farr said the 1997 Asian Elephant Conservation Act is critical
to the survival of elephants in India, home to more than half the
Asian elephants remaining in the world. Sanctions currently prevent
India from receiving U.S. funds from the program. Farr said
President Clinton has agreed to lift the sanctions, but has not yet
signed a waiver doing so.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The tragedies swiped at her like a relentless
revolving door. In 1980, her ex-husband, dance partner and soul
mate, Gower Champion, died hours before the opening of his last
musical, ``42d Street.'' Nine months after that, her husband, Boris
Sagal, who directed television movies, was killed on location by a
helicopter blade. Six years later almost to the day, her younger
son, Blake Champion, 25, died in a car crash.
</P>
<P>
   But following Ann Reinking's tribute to her last month at the
opening gala of the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass.,
the dancer-actress-choreographer Marge Champion, who turns 80 in
September, again commanded center stage in jewels and an evening
gown, and announced saucily, ``I just want to say: It does get
better!''
</P>
<P>
   At her Manhattan apartment the other day, Marge _ that's what
everyone calls her _ said the losses left her with a stark choice:
``You either go under or you get up and start moving.'' Her
decision? To polish her reputation as a woman who adores a good
party, preferably one with a dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   You haven't met, you say? Oh, but you certainly have. There's
Marge at 14, a trained dancer, posing for Disney animators as Snow
White. That's her in a tutu, filmed in black and white,
demonstrating the Hippo Ballet for ``Fantasia.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the late '40s and '50s, and Marge, reunited with Gower
Champion, a junior high school friend and pupil of her father _
Ernest Belcher, founder of the University of the Dance, who taught
Gwen Verdon and Shirley Temple _ is a star. The elegant Gower, 6
feet tall, dances low, with bended knees, to show off 5-foot-2
Marge, who moves with wit and great joy.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrated story-dance team sashay across ballrooms and
Broadway, and then 57 cities in three months with Harry Belafonte.
They loom large on the seven-inch screens of infant television,
eventually alternating slots with ``The Jack Benny Program.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, they whirl through a half-dozen movie musicals.
Sinatra is making headlines with his randy pals. ``We weren't
eligible for the Rat Pack,'' said Marge, because of the sweetheart
image that clung to the Champions and to the regulars at their
Sunday pool parties: Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, Sheila and Gordon
MacRae. ``We called ourselves the Mouse Pack.''
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday, the families ate supper in front of the TV and
watched Ed Sullivan. ``Elvis Presley was on,'' Marge said. ``I said
to Gower, `I think it's over.'''
</P>
<P>
   She was right. (Gower exacted revenge by choreographing the
Presley send-up ``Bye Bye Birdie.'')
</P>
<P>
   After their 25-year marriage ended, Marge choreographed for
theater, film and television, winning an Emmy. Her influence
continues: in June, she completed a nine-year tenure on the
nominating committee for the Tony Awards. (``Dancers are better
trained than any in our day,'' she said, ``but the choreographers
are killing them, by crowding dozens of steps into four bars of
music. So you don't get to know the dancers. They're too busy doing
tricks.'')
</P>
<P>
   Her Manhattan apartment is vintage Old Hoofer: the Al Hirschfeld
drawing of the waltzing Champions, their film posters, a collection
of easily doffed hats, tap shoes in the closet. ``Tap isn't my
mother tongue,'' remarked Marge, whose father taught her ballet,
``but you can do it until you die.''
</P>
<P>
   She had been a lifelong optimist with surging energy, but when
her son died, the losses of the 1980s crushed her. Marge staggered
into a clinical depression. She had been living across the road
from Blake in a 1790 barn and farmhouse in Stockbridge, Mass.
Usually decisive, ``I would look at the Cheerios and the cornflakes
for a half-hour,'' she said. She rued having married Sagal on a New
Year's Eve. ``After his death, on our anniversary I'd take a
sleeping pill at 10 p.m. just to avoid midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychotherapy and, briefly, antidepressants helped, and Marge,
always seen as someone's daughter or wife, discovered she liked
playing top banana. She joined several arts boards, became a
gardener, worked on Berkshires shows, lectured (``my dog-and-pony
act'') and occasionally performed, most recently at Carnegie Hall
in May. She had her barn moved, slat by slat, to Jacob's Pillow,
where Blake's Barn is an archive and lecture hall.
</P>
<P>
   She deepened old friendships and cultivated new ones, seeking
out younger people. She gives a party on Christmas Eve and on
Oscars night, and an afternoon bash on the Fourth of July, for
which she cooks for 75 friends. ``I make popovers big as my fist,''
she said, waving a clenched one mightily.
</P>
<P>
   Now she prefers attending dinner parties alone. ``I get to talk
to so many more people that way,'' she said. ``It's a bonus I
couldn't have imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   For dance parties, she takes an escort. ``Otherwise, there are
certain men, who may be fairly good dancers, but the only reason
they ask to dance is to say afterward they danced with me. It's a
little like being a trophy for the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 pounds heavier than when she graduated from Hollywood
High, she exercises fastidiously. In Manhattan, she takes dance
aerobics. In the Berkshires, she spends hours at the gym, ballroom
dancing. Favorite partner? A man smooth and athletic enough to keep
up with her, the former Yankee pitcher Jim Bouton.

SHOOTOUT HAS BORDER TOWN ON EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN LUIS RIO COLORADO, Sonora _ A furious weekend shootout
between Mexican police and a gang of suspected drug traffickers put
this normally placid border town on edge, prompting its mayor to
seek the help of federal troops if violence erupts again.
</P>
<P>
   Three smuggling suspects died, and four other people, three of
them city police officers, were wounded during a fusillade in a
vacant lot only blocks from the Arizona border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inevitably, there's a sense of worry,'' Mayor Florencio Diaz
Armenta said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our citizens don't understand who is responsible for what.
There are tensions because there are people dead, and state
authorities are looking for suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   During the roughly 10 minutes that bullets were flying, one of
the bandits tossed a fragmentation grenade into the melee, but it
failed to explode, Assistant Police Chief Santiago Huizar Rubio
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old boy, who was not identified, was passing by the
area when the violence started. Huizar Rubio said he was wounded
along with the three officers. All are expected to live.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law enforcement officials, who are used to battling the
steady flow of drugs and associated crime along the border, say the
extremity of Sunday's violence was surprising. Roughly two dozen
men armed with AK-47s opened fire on police. There were reports
that the fragmentation device was fired from a grenade launcher.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agents on both sides of the border were still
scrambling Tuesday to make sense of the outburst and to learn more
about an alleged drug kingpin whom Mexican authorities identified
as Gil Amarillas.
</P>
<P>
   Huizar Rubio said Amarillas was identified as the boss of a drug
smuggling operation by some of those involved in Sunday's shootout.
He said the organization is thought to be based in San Luis,
because most of those killed or arrested were native to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police in southern Yuma County were alerted to watch
for suspects from the shootout trying to cross into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Local and federal agencies in Arizona also put two of the three
wounded Mexican officers under protection in Arizona hospitals and
whisked the officers' immediate families to hideouts north of the
border after threats were made on their lives, said Ernesto Lugo, a
police officer in San Luis, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of drug activity, yes,'' Lugo said. ``But for
it to get this violent, especially against police, is very
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Lugo, the department's liaison with Mexican law enforcement,
said authorities know little about Gil Amarillas and his gang.
</P>
<P>
   As Mexican federal police, or Federales, took over the
investigation, police fanned out through the city Monday and
Tuesday seeking suspects and drugs. Huizar Rubio said officers
raided 15 homes, arresting 10 suspects. He declined to release
their names.
</P>
<P>
   Huizar Rubio also declined to name those killed. ''El
Independiente,'' a newspaper published in Hermosillo, on Tuesday
listed the dead as Alberto Velazco Ojeda and Jesus Armando
Alcantar, both of San Luis, and Hector Madrid Amarillas, from
Mexicali in Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   The injured officers were identified as Ramon Ramos, who was
hospitalized in Mexico with a bullet wound to the stomach;
Guillermo Arreola, hospitalized in Arizona with leg and foot
wounds; and Israel Avendano Parra, hospitalized in Arizona with a
head wound and symptoms of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   According to municipal police, Sunday's deadly fray started with
the arrest of a man in his early 20s for speeding through town.
</P>
<P>
   The speeder was jailed but paid a fine and was released
Saturday. Early Sunday, the suspect and his friends, armed with
assault rifles, found the arresting officer and confronted him. The
police officer was roughed up and threatened, but he escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Thugs next went to the home of the officer's parents and
threatened his family.
</P>
<P>
   Huizar Rubio said a 36-man security force was being assembled
when police learned about armed men in a vacant lot just east of
the city's heart. As patrol units arrived, they were met with
gunfire. Huizar Rubio said it was an ambush, and the cross-fire
continued as reinforcements were called in.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, a bullet-riddled wall was the only remaining
evidence. Cars cruised by with occupants gawking at the damage.
Across the street, at the Motel Continental, it was business as
usual.
</P>
<P>
   One of those stopping to take in the sight was Jose Lopez
Beltran, a San Luis native who was angry at police for engaging the
gang in a gunfight with so many innocent people nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really shouldn't put people in danger,'' Lopez Beltran
said, adding that he'd never seen that kind of violence in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Other bystanders and workers in nearby businesses were reluctant
to discuss the shootings, fearful of reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   But Augustin Diaz, a San Luis cabdriver who frequently cruises
through the neighborhood, said people are scared. ``People are
afraid to talk about it. They don't know what will happen. It could
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's hail of bullets was not the city's first. In 1997,
Benjamin Flores, editor of the local newspaper, ``La Prensa,'' was
gunned down for his journalistic crusade against drug trafficking
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Several other less-publicized killings took place in the city
during that period, as Mexico's powerful drug cartels battled for
control of smuggling turf. However, city officials maintain that
San Luis, a bustling commercial center in an agricultural region,
has been safe ever since. &QL;

WINDOWS IN YOUR POCKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Microsoft Corp. is to sustain its dominance of the software
industry in the 21st century, it must spread its Windows software
far beyond desktop and portable computers and into our television
sets, our automobiles, our telephones and even into our pockets.
</P>
<P>
   But not even Captain Kangaroo could fit the forthcoming Windows
2000, with 50 million lines of computer code, into his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   So, to make good on its ``Windows everywhere'' strategy,
Microsoft is developing several new versions of its flagship
operating system, including a lightweight version called Windows
CE.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has been refining Windows CE to run an array of small,
inexpensive devices, including video game consoles, Web-TV systems,
cable set-top boxes, digital video recorders, desktop or wall
telephones with video displays, wireless phones and pagers,
dashboard computers for automobiles, cash registers, kiosks and
automated teller machines. Microsoft has even toyed with placing
Windows CE in refrigerators and other kitchen appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recent improvements in Windows CE are on display in
the Compaq Aero 2100 pocket computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero 2100 is an advanced clone of 3Com Corp.'s popular Palm
Pilot, a small, lightweight device that stores personal information
and performs simple processing tasks. More than 4 million Palm
Pilots have been sold in recent years. The Aero 2100 has the same
list price, $449, as the new Palm V, which was reviewed favorably
in this space in February. Like the Palms, the Aero is intended to
fit in a pocket or purse and complement, not replace, the user's
desktop or portable PC.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the operating system was the biggest difference
between the Palm Pilot and its palm-size PC imitators, including
devices from Casio, Everex, Philips, Uniden, Hewlett-Packard and
other companies, plus Compaq. The 3Com Palms use the Palm OS; the
other PPCs use Windows CE.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Compaq Aero the imitators are starting to
differentiate themselves from the market-leading Palm Pilots and,
for the first time, to offer themselves as compelling alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   They are still more expensive than all but the top-of-the-line
Palm V and VII models from 3Com. They are still a bit more
complicated to learn and operate. They are a bit bulkier. They
still lack the vast libraries of third-party programs available for
the Pilots. And they are still a bit more sluggish. But the Aero
has narrowed the gaps considerably, and added features that the
Palm Pilots would do well to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious difference is the Aero 2100's 256-color display
screen. The screen is 2.4 inches wide and 3.2 inches high, slightly
larger than the monochrome screen of the Palm organizers. 3Com has
improved the readability of the Palm Pilots' notoriously dim
screens, but the screens cannot compare with the Aero's bright,
active-matrix color display. On its brightest, battery-sucking
setting, the Aero's screen is legible even in direct sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Color is nice, but it is unclear how important it is for a
pocket organizer. Other than being able to display a game of
Solitaire in color, the added hues are mainly useful if one wants
to use the Aero's Picture Viewer utility to show off digital
pictures of the kids, for example. Someday, perhaps, it will be
useful for watching movies and music videos, but that day is not
near.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has advanced display technologies in the works that
promise to greatly increase the already decent screen resolution on
future Palm-size PCs. Prototypes I've seen make text so sharp and
clear that the idea of using the device as an electronic book
suddenly makes sense. One can imagine downloading newspaper and
magazine articles to the device through a desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   But reading longer works like ``Moby Dick'' or ``The Road
Ahead'' on the device still seems like a bit of a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Those paper-quality screens are in the future. Today, I'm more
likely to listen to Moby Dick on the Aero than to try to read it on
screen. One of the most intriguing advantages the Compaq has over
the Palm Pilot is its ability to act as a portable audio device. It
has an adequate built-in speaker, and comes with an external
ear-bud speaker and microphone.
</P>
<P>
   At the touch of a button the Aero can function as a digital
voice recorder. Again, this is primarily useful for smaller tasks,
like reminders on what to get at the grocery store or where the car
is parked in the airport lot. For recording long speeches, an
old-fashioned analogue cassette recorder is probably more
efficient. Thirty minutes of audio recording consumes one megabyte
of the Aero's precious memory (8 MB to 16 MB, depending on the
model). A 24 MB memory-expansion module is available as an option
for $129. Even more storage space, up to 100 MB, can be created by
adding a Compact Flash PC card to the Aero's built-in card slot. A
40 MB card costs $166. There is also a 56 K modem card for $159.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lately, I've been enamored of the Aero's close working
relationship with a company called Audible, which sells audio
recordings of popular books, newspapers and magazines that can be
downloaded over the Internet (www.audible.com). The user has to
download and install in the Aero a Windows CE helper application,
called Audible Manager, and it took a couple of tries to get it
installed correctly. But once that hurdle was crossed, I was able
to buy audio recordings of current books and to subscribe to a
daily, audio summary of articles in The New York Times and other
publications.
</P>
<P>
   With another helper application, I was able to download and play
digital music files, effectively turning the Aero into a portable
MP3 music player _ although with its monaural sound system, the
Areo is no threat to any of the new dedicated MP3 players like the
Diamond Rio. Perhaps next year's models will add stereo sound.
</P>
<P>
   But the audio and entertainment features are basically bonuses
to the main functions of the Aero, which are to store, organize and
synchronize the user's personal information, including e-mail
messages (downloaded from the desktop PC), calendar, contacts,
tasks and notes. Anyone familiar with Microsoft Outlook, the
personal information manager that comes with Windows 98, will be at
home with the similar features in Windows CE.
</P>
<P>
   Synchronizing the Aero to my desktop Windows PC was relatively
straightforward, although not quite as easy as with the Palm
Pilots. Information from Microsoft Outlook was transferred to the
Aero without snags, including appointments from my datebook that
had been set to remind me. Another nice touch: The Aero has three
alarm settings, including the standard chirping, but also vibration
and silent screen alerts.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero has buttons along the bottom of its silver case that
act as shortcuts to the calendar, to-do list, address book and
notepad. Like the Palms, the Aero has a virtual keyboard on its
touch-sensitive screen that allows the user to enter text and
numbers tap by tap. Unlike the Palm, there is no Graffiti
handwriting-recognition language to learn. Instead, handwritten
notes are stored in the Aero as, well, handwriting. If your
handwriting is as cryptic as mine, the virtual keyboard may be a
better idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero also has an expense-account tracker and a built-in
dictionary, including an English-Spanish translator.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big knocks against earlier Windows CE companions was
limited battery life, which was exacerbated by the demands of the
operating system and the bright screens. The Aero 2100, like the
Palm V, uses rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that provide a
maximum of about 10 hours of use between charges. Other 3Com Palms
use standard AA batteries that are good for weeks of use. A big
drawback to the Aero is that unless it is returned to its docking
station every few days, there is a risk that its memory and all the
data in it will evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero is not a hands-down winner over its Palm competitors,
but it does have special features that make it worth consideration
as a pocket companion.

HOUSE PANEL REJECTS TYING ANTI-DRINKING ADS TO DRUG CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ky.)  (js) 
 By CARL HULSE   
(Carl Hulse is Washington Bureau chief for the New York Times
Regional Newspapers.)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of a key House panel have rejected the idea
of expanding the national anti-drug campaign to include messages
against underage drinking, disappointing activists who contend
alcohol is the ``drug of choice'' for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Karolyn Nunnallee, president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving,
called the vote ``a victory for those who don't want our kids to
get the message that alcohol is a dangerous, illicit drug for
people under age 21.'' MADD was the main backer of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee voted 32-23 Tuesday to kill a
provision that would have given the White House drug czar authority
to include alcohol abuse ads in the $1 billion prime-time campaign
best known for the ``your brain on drugs'' commercials. In light of
the Senate's rejection of the provision earlier this month, the
fight appears over for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the proposal authored by Rep. Lucille
Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., said that it unfairly linked a legal
product with such hard drugs as heroin and cocaine. They also noted
that Gen. Barry McCaffrey, head of the National Office of Drug
Control Policy, opposed the idea on the grounds that it was
untested and would dilute the anti-drug message.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a shot in the dark and splitting already too few
dollars that we are spending on drugs,'' said Rep. Anne Northrup,
R-Ky., who led the fight against the alcohol provision.
</P>
<P>
   Among her allies was the National Beer Wholesalers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Roybal-Allard said adding underage drinking to the campaign
would have boosted its impact since alcohol is a proven ``gateway''
to other drug use. She intends to reintroduce her proposal next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not over,'' said Roybal-Allard. ``I will continue to
fight for the health and well-being of families in my district and
across the country.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The riff is that writing is the loneliest and most tormenting of
callings, and the romantic image of the novelist at work, amid the
litter of words and thoughts, is anything but Apollonian. But what
if two people write a novel together? Can they do it as well as
one, locked up together as they are in what can be a jail house of
familiarity? Which everyone knows breeds contempt and resentment
and even skulduggery.
</P>
<P>
   The above is wildly overstated. Novels written together by
husbands and wives, friends, sisters, all manner of pairings, are
being popped into the bookstores this summer by nearly every
publishing house, exploits of the imagination created with little
apparent strain on the relationship between the collaborators.
(Mostly, when there is tension between the co-authors it is in the
writing of serious nonfiction, generally a longer, more complicated
process in which the fun can fade fast.)
</P>
<P>
   The two doing one probably started with Somerville and Ross'
Irish tales and more recently with Nordhoff and Hall, authors of
the ``Mutiny on the Bounty'' trilogy, and most novels written by
pairs since then have been adventures or thrillers of one sort or
another. That is, they are usually long on story and plot, short on
character, not emotion-driven.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, two people writing novels together is supposed to be, if
not merry, at least lucrative sport. Howard Kaminsky, a former book
publisher, started collaborating with his wife, Susan Stanwood
Kaminsky, on screenplays _ ``120 pages of air'' _ and then moved on
to rather scary novels ``because we wanted to further test our
marriage. We were trapped together in the car during long drives to
the Berkshires.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``We're still married. I think that's the real test.
There are arguments over the unimportant things in the book, not
the kind that sends one off for a week.'' The Kaminskys' latest
novel, ``The Twelve'' (St. Martin's Press), has ``Howard &AMP; Susan
Kaminsky'' on the cover. It is an ominous tale of 12 children after
their rescue from a Waco-like cult implosion. It is their fourth
novel together; the first two had Brooks Stanwood as author, Brooks
in honor of Kaminsky's cousin Mel Brooks and Stanwood because it
was Mrs. Kaminsky's maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   How do two people write one book? ``Howard generally comes up
with the idea, and does a lot of the plotting; I throw in my
opinions,'' Mrs. Kaminsky said. ``We write separate chapters
separately. When we get to the end we rewrite each other. You might
not like the voice, but we do so much rewriting there is a voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Solitary sufferings are not for Kaminsky. ``I'd rather have a
partner,'' he said. ``I'd rather write half a novel than a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters O'Shaughnessy have it both ways. They collaborate on
legal thrillers, about the tough but tenderhearted lawyer Nina
Reilly. But they live 80 miles apart, their sisterhood saved by the
computer and the telephone. Or, as Pam O'Shaughnessy, the older of
the two and a lawyer, put it: ``If we lived next door to each
other, plus wrote books together, after eight months we probably
wouldn't even want to know each other.'' O'Shaughnessy is their
maiden name, and the sisters write their books as Perri
O'Shaughnessy, the Perri in tribute to the great Perry Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Mary O'Shaughnessy, a biochemical engineer, said, ``We started
out with that old-fashioned concept of earning `pin money.' We're
certainly doing better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Their latest hardcover, ``Acts of Malice'' (Delacorte Press),
went on sale Tuesday. It was their fifth novel. Their paperback,
``Breach of Promise'' (Island Books), was on the New York Times
paperback fiction best-seller list for two weeks this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Shaughnessys spend an hour on the telephone most mornings
creating an outline for their novel. ``Whoever has the most energy
that day writes it down,'' Pam said. But before they start a novel
they designate one to be the primary writer for that book.
</P>
<P>
   She describes it this way: ``Say Mary will be responsible for
the first draft. She'll write eight chapters, and then maybe hit a
brick wall. Then I step in and write alone for a while. Pretty soon
we have a first draft. It's back and forth. The second person gets
the blind spots, polishes them and restructures. In the last
run-through, the primary writer of that book gets three weeks to go
back and stick back in all she wanted in the book that the other
writer cut out.'' They do have what they call their veto rule. If
one sister positively, absolutely cannot stand something the other
sister wrote, out it goes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the actual writing, Mary O'Shaughnessy said: ``We're good
friends. I wouldn't really describe what we have over the novels as
fights. I'd call them exciting discussions. If one of us gets
temperamental, the other gets calm, so we balance each other out.''
They go on book tours together, for two weeks at a clip. ``We're
Irish, you know, so we're entertainers a bit,'' Mary O'Shaughnessy
said. ``We get out there and try. If somebody on a tour has
something critical to say, I turn it against Pam. I set it up so I
take the praise and she takes the blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Call any publisher and get a pitch about a joint-effort novel.
For instance, Nicci French is described as a female journalist
living in London whose ``Killing Me Softly'' (Warner
Books/Mysterious Press), published last week, is ``a novel of
obsession.'' Well the hot-blooded Nicci is really the husband and
wife team of Nicci Gerrard and Sean French, two English
journalists. Their editor, Sara Ann Freed, said that the couple
have such a single voice that ``when I make suggestions to them
they respond in the same seamless voice. It's as if they never have
disagreements.''
</P>
<P>
   This month Warner Books also published ``Thunderhead,'' about
the search for the Lost City of Gold in Utah, of all places, the
fifth novel written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Andrews is the pseudonym for David Russell Handler, a
novelist, and Peter Andrew Gethers, editor at large at Random
House, publisher of the Library of Contemporary Thought, and a
writer. They are the authors of ``Gideon'' (Ballantine), their
first thriller written together, although they have collaborated on
film and television scripts. In case anyone doesn't know who
Russell Andrews is, the publisher has thoughtfully put their photos
with names on the book's flap. Writers don't want to be that
lonely.

   WASHINGTON _ Without changes in the law, Americans will be
denied access to new technology that allows high-speed access to
the World Wide Web or will be forced to pay inflated prices for it,
executives of Internet service providers told Congress Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the executives William Schrader, chairman of PSINet Inc.
in Herndon, Va., told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Congress
should force cable television companies, which control the wires
that high-speed Internet service runs on, to open their networks to
all Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, cable carriers, unlike local phone companies, are not
obligated to let PSINet and other Internet service providers (ISPs)
offer service to cable customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that I'm asking for is free competition and the chance to
provide Americans with a service that's going to become a necessity
as the Internet grows,'' Schrader told the committee, which is
investigating competition in the ISP market.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader said that under current law, cable companies can use
their monopoly control to limit which ISPs their customers have to
choose from.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, AT&AMP;T Corp.'s cable operation, which
services 26 percent of the nation's cable subscribers, has an
exclusive contract with  &LR; Home, an ISP that is partially owned by
AT&AMP;T. Therefore, he said, when AT&AMP;T provides high-speed Internet
access to a customer, that person has no choice but to use  &LR; Home to
connect with the World Wide Web, that part of the Internet that
lets users see graphics, read text and hear sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how anybody can call that free and open
competition,'' Schrader said.
</P>
<P>
   Alex J. Mandl, chairman of Teligent Inc., an ISP in Vienna, Va.,
told the committee that the cable industry's monopoly control of
high-speed access could result in millions of homes going without
the service.
</P>
<P>
   He said that without competition, cable companies have little
incentive to install lines or upgrade older phone and cable lines
in rural areas _ an expensive process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monopolies tend to stick only to major urban areas where their
profits are the highest,'' Mandl said.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 million American homes have Internet access over
conventional phone lines, called dial-up access. About 500,000 gain
access over cable or upgraded phone lines that are 10 to 80 times
faster than typical phone connections. Research firms project that
the number of such high-speed subscribers will grow to as many as
16 million by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the high-speed access will be needed as the
Internet provides an increasing array of products, including videos
and voice connections.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, chairman of AT&AMP;T, defended his company's
deal with  &LR; Home, saying its cable customers recently were given the
option of choosing an ISP other than  &LR; Home. However, when
questioned he admitted that if customers choose another ISP, they
still must pay  &LR; Home's subscription fee on top of the other
company's fee.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong warned the committee that forcing cable companies to
open their networks to all Internet providers could result in some
cable companies slowing or stopping their push to upgrade their
lines for high-speed connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have little incentive to undertake the considerable
expense of upgrading our lines if they are merely to become a pipe
through which others _ who have paid nothing _ deliver service,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also said the cable industry's monopoly of high-speed
Internet access likely will end in the near future as new
technologies such as satellite connections and wireless phone
networks, which can deliver the same service, become widely
available to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monopolies just can't survive long in this fast-moving
industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, did not say he
wants to change the law but vowed to continue to investigate the
ISP market to determine if legislation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-speed connections are the future of the Internet, and no
signal company should control who can access this new technology,''
Hatch said.

 &HT;    CLINTON MOCKS BUSH'S 'COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVE' SLOGAN
 &HT;    420&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ President Clinton poked fun at George W. Bush and
boosted Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign Wednesday in
a speech to the Democratic Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't do this because it's not presidential, but I'm
going to do it anyway,'' Clinton said before offering a
tongue-in-cheek critique of the Texas governor's signature slogan,
``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan ``has a great ring to it,'' Clinton said, ``and near
as I can tell, here's what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like you. I do,'' Clinton intoned with an air of mock
seriousness. ``And I would like to be for the patient's bill of
rights. And I'd like to be for closing the gun show loophole. And
I'd like not to squander the surplus and, you know, save Social
Security and Medicare for the next generation. I'd like to raise
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to do these things, but I just can't. And I feel
terrible about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech came on the heels of a barbed anti-Bush
introduction from Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante of California, the first
Hispanic elected to statewide office in the nation's most populous
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there is a joke going around the country,''
Bustamante said. ``It's called 'compassionate conservatism. Some
Republicans think that if you put a nice word in front of a mean
word, you can fool people, the way some Texas Republicans think
that all you have to do to get the Latino vote is to speak a little
Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean anything if you don't listen and you don't
help people earn what they want in life,'' he added. ``Calling
yourself a 'compassionate conservative' doesn't mean a thing when
for too many years 'conservative' meant divisive ethnic politics,
mean-spirited policies and selfish corporate greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite persistent accounts of a rift between the president and
vice president, Clinton praised Gore for continuing to advance
ideas developed by the centrist Democratic Leadership Council in
his campaign for the party's 2000 presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this election ought to be about,'' he said. ``Even
commentators on the other side point out that so far he's the only
person who has actually said what he would do if the people gave
him, which I think is a reasonably good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenging Republican candidates to explain their positions on
the gun issue, Clinton said, ``There will be clear choices here:
will we have common-sense gun laws or government by the gun
lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore continues to trail Bush by double digits in
hypothetical match-ups in public opinion polls, there was little
sign of panic among members of the council, the organization that
Gore helped found in 1985 following Walter Mondale's disastrous
defeat by Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia compared Bush's performance to the
opening of a new movie. ``You have a great opening week or two, and
then things kind of settle down and it's tested by critics and
history and examination,'' said Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early polls understate Gore's strengths and overstate
Bush's,'' said Al From, the DLC executive director and the
intellectual force behind the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The DLC does not endorse candidates, but, according to From, its
membership overwhelmingly supports Gore over former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, the vice president's sole opponent in the
Democratic contest who has long kept his distance from the DLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been with us since day one,'' said From.

Simon, one of several unknowns who have been forced into the

of the greatest highlights in the history of the tournament, but it
only serve to solidify a second-place finish and a what could have

the team, doesn't want to take the singles spots from loayl Davis
Cuppers Jim Courier and Todd Martin, who have committed to play
every round, not just a big tie like this one. But with hard court
ace Patrick Rafter lurking on the Australian team, plus the world's

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday at 3 p.m. the temperature in Raleigh-Durham registered
69 degrees, or about 25 degrees below the seasonal average high for
the date. Thick cloud cover and frequent rainfall has contributed
to the unusual chill, which has covered much of the southern Middle
Atlantic States the past several days.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, glimpses of sun will return to the region, allowing
temperatures to rebound into the 80s over most of the Carolinas and
Virginia in the afternoon. Partly sunny and humid conditions will
affect the remainder of the Southeast, with isolated thunderstorms
erupting near the Gulf Coast where developing sea breezes will
undercut and lift the sultry air.
</P>
<P>
   A warm high pressure system will stretch from the Middle West to
the interior Northeast Thursday. Sinking currents of air associated
with the high will suppress clouds, bringing plenty of hazy sun to
the region. Overall, the tenor of the weather will change little
across the Midwest and Northeast the next several days as heat and
humidity rise to uncomfortable levels by the upcoming weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly humid air will surge north through the Plains,
setting the stage for potent thunderstorms from the Dakotas to
western Minnesota Thursday. Large hail and damaging winds are
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Moist air in the lowest 10,000 feet of the atmosphere will spark
spotty thundershowers in the southern Rockies. Thundershowers will
be most numerous during the afternoon as heating of the ground and
overlying air by the sun encourages ascending currents of humid
air.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Taking the Plunge
</P>
<P>
   Within less than an hour on Tuesday afternoon, a potent
thunderstorm turned searing summer heat into a damp autumnal chill
in Satley, Calif., along the east slopes of the northern Sierra.
Between 4 pm and 5 pm the mercury plunged from 97 degrees to 57
degrees as over an inch of rain pelted the town. When precipitation
begins to fall from a tall thunderstorm some of the droplets
evaporate, cooling the surrounding air. The cooled air that is
dragged earthward by the falling raindrops can often be felt before
the storm as a rush of cool air that meteorologists call a gust
front.

 &HT;    A serving of memories and mayonnaise
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On this day, Michael Lee West is again praising mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just any mayonnaise, though. It's her far-and-away
favorite _ Duke's _ unavailable where the author lives in Lebanon,
Tenn., outside Nashville. But here it is, she says with relish in a
phone interview, as given to her by a devoted reader at a book
signing in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Her reply to the thoughtful giver? ``It transforms everything.
... I'm your devoted food slave.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an auspicious gift can mean only one thing to a woman whose
life, as well as the lives of a bunch of relatives she labels
``eccentric,'' revolves around food: Time to make potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the beginning of an essay from West's new book,
``Consuming Passions: A Food Obsessed Life'' (HarperCollins, $25).
(For information on her upcoming Atlanta book signing, see page
H1). In fact, one chapter is entitled ``In Praise of Mayonnaise.''
Another, ``Potato Salad,'' begins: ``When we lived in New Orleans,
my mama gave loud dinner parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Categorizing this book is not nearly as easy as reading it.
Nonfiction, it is a memoir with embellishments. Yes, her mother did
threaten to swing from the chandelier of a swanky club. But, no,
she did not actually swing, West says, admitting the exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a cookbook, though it contains an impressive batch of
recipes for such nostalgic fare as Lilly's Fried Cabbage, which
conjures a hungry ghost; Ary Jean's Gumbo, from her mother, who
objects vehemently to the mere mention of okra in such a stew, said
mention of which leads to said chandelier-swinging; and Sugared
Violets, to pretty up a coconut cake.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to writing fiction, West, 45, began the memoir when
asked if she would like to write something for the Junior League of
Atlanta's 1995 cookbook, ``True Grits: Tall Tales and Recipes From
the New South.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I came home and wrote a little essay on iced tea (published
in `True Grits') and enjoyed it so much I wrote another one on cast
iron.'' Soon her agent thought there was a book in it, the
publisher agreed and it was released in May.
</P>
<P>
   These days, West spends much of her 12-to-15-hour writing day on
a sequel to ``Crazy Ladies'' called ``Mad Girls in Love,'' which
should be out in a year. She also has plans for another novel, but
after ``Mad Girls'' will begin a screenplay for Laura Dern, who has
optioned ``She Flew the Coop.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing, she's been testing recipes. Raleigh News
&AMP; Observer food editor Susan Houston asked West to pick the best
reader recipes in a contest for covered dishes ``to take to someone
who's sick, just had a baby, or to a funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the South, we seem to be drawn to whenever there's a crisis
to bring food,'' Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly true in West's ``eccentric'' family, lovingly
pictured in ``Consuming Passions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had very colorful relatives, all joined by our love of food.
And they still are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her oldest son, Trey, is sous chef at the Lodge at Little St.
Simons Island. When she's home at their renovated funeral home, and
cooking, husband Will and 15-year-old son Tyler are among the
beneficiaries. So are neighbors, one of whom, after receiving the
product of a recipe test, sent back the dish with a note saying it
was delicious and had prompted her to get back in her own kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what I wanted to do,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's getting older or getting my hands into
the flour, but I'm thinking this is wonderful.''
</P>

15-20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is one of two quick shrimp dishes West's mother claims are
``company-acceptable.'' To make 4 servings, use the smallest
amounts of butter, flour and shrimp listed. It is rich and
comforting, but some of the company might like to add a dash of
cayenne or Tabasco.

   Sometimes when Michael Lee West goes on a book tour, her husband
and son ask her to make and leave behind a batch of these cookies,
which, unlike most gingersnaps, are moist in the center. The recipe
is from a woman from whom the Wests purchased a bed said by the
owner to have belonged to Margaret Mitchell. She also said this
recipe was given to her by a Georgia woman who knew Mitchell and
made the cookies for her when she was writing.

</P>
<P>
   In a medium mixing bowl, combine melted butter, 1 cup sugar,
molasses and egg. Mix well. Into another bowl, sift together the
flour, baking soda, cloves, ginger, cinnamon and salt. Stir dry
mixture into sugar mixture. The dough will be soft and sticky.
Cover dough and chill several hours. When ready to bake, preheat
oven to 375 degrees. Roll bits of chilled dough into 1-inch balls.
Then roll each ball in the remaining 1/3 cup sugar. Place 2 inches
apart on cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven,
let cool 1 minute on sheets, then remove to wire racks to cool
completely. Store in an airtight container. _ Adapted from:

SHAKESPEARE'S HOSTILITIES OF COURTSHIP, ITALIAN STYLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ American cinema audiences of the 1950s and
60s were thrilled to the marrow when Italian movies demonstrated
that you didn't have to make nice to make love. Sniping, scrapping
and thumb-biting as foreplay? How exotic, how earthy, how
passionate it all seemed when Sophia Loren and Marcello
Mastroianni, or Anna Magnani and anyone, were butting heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage Italian Style,'' the name of the most legendary
Loren-Mastroianni collaboration, might as well be the subtitle of
the fast, furious and overstuffed interpretation of ``The Taming of
the Shrew'' that runs at the Williamstown Theater Festival through
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Roger Rees, who plays Petruchio to Bebe Neuwirth's
Kate, this very animated production of Shakespeare's prickly comedy
of courtship reinvents Renaissance Padua as a cartoon version of
the world of De Sica and Fellini. Neil Patel's eye-popping set is
Pop neo-realist, with clotheslines festooned with soccer jerseys
and alley walls featuring oversize ads for tomatoes and pasta. The
rowdy young men and women who hang out in the streets wear clothes
(by Kaye Voyce) out of ``I Vitelloni.'' When Petruchio meets Kate,
they rumble with Vesuvian menace and many hand gestures.
</P>
<P>
   It is a clever, if not entirely original, approach to a classic
that tends to trouble latter-day theatergoers. While the wiry and
brittle Ms. Neuwirth and Rees may not be obvious stand-ins for the
robust Ms. Loren and Mastroianni, there are moments when this shrew
and her would-be tamer bring a vivid, self-surprising pleasure to
their hostile mating dance, as though each had finally discovered
another person who speaks the same language.
</P>
<P>
   Rees, it should be noted, wants to have his passion and
apologize for it, too. Even as this ``Shrew'' styles itself as a
giddy male fantasy of romantic conquest, there is the sense that
neither Kate nor Petruchio is altogether easy with the roles they
play.
</P>
<P>
   The production also takes novel liberties with the Christopher
Sly ``induction'' sequence, which frames ``Shrew'' as a play within
a play, to emphasize that it is by no means advocating the work's
approach to marital counseling. Further distance is provided by the
what-the-heck merriment of the staging, which keeps the pace
athletic (soccer is a dominant motif) and lets the supporting
actors riff outlandishly, like fledgling trumpeters at a jazz club.
There is some merit to all of these elements. But you do wish that
Rees had edited them down. The show, which includes such shrill
touches as an Elvis-impersonating manservant and a goggle-wearing
domestic staff out of ``Monty Python,'' suffers from a surfeit of
invention.
</P>
<P>
   Its energy and its obvious eagerness to please keep the audience
with it, but the production doesn't stick together. There are
bright flashes of insight throughout, especially (and unexpectedly)
from Ms. Neuwirth, but they are often obscured by the evening's
dominating glare. Even basic clarity is sometimes sacrificed to
maintaining a high adrenaline level.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreters of ``Shrew,'' also the subject of a current
production by the New York Shakespeare Festival in Central Park,
have seemed embarrassed by it. James M. Barrie reconceived the work
(for Maude Adams, who played his Peter Pan) along the lines of his
own ``What Every Woman Knows,'' turning Kate into a sly, sweet
manipulator of her obtuse master. When the German director Max
Reinhardt did ``Shrew'' in 1909, it was as a commedia dell'arte
style romp that made it clear no one was to take Petruchio
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Rees incorporates both of these traditions, and then some. The
program for the show features academic quotations on topics like
``inward aggression,'' ``parental deprivation'' in Tudor-Stuart
England and ``negative reinforcement.'' It is best to ignore these,
or you will really be at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The production begins with a late arrival's disruption of the
audience. That's Rees, doing a boisterous take on Christopher Sly,
the drunken taverngoer, for whom the story of ``Shrew'' is
performed in Shakespeare's original. (Theatergoers unfamiliar with
the play are unlikely to know what's going on.) In this version,
Sly is arrested by a tough, nightstick-wielding police officer, who
happens to be played by Ms. Neuwirth.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of what follows, this prefatory scene has an appealing
verve, but it isn't altogether thought through. Rees is clearly
better at plumbing individual moments than at connecting them. And
he indulges his actors in ways that finally serve neither them nor
the play. When the servant Biondello (Sam Breslin Wright) describes
the arrival of Petruchio on his wedding day, it turns into an
applause-milking standup performance (with interpolations) that
eclipses Rees' subsequent entrance.
</P>
<P>
   A certain license for excess must be allowed summer theater.
Wright's Biondello, along with his fellow servants Grumio (David
Aaron Baker) and Tranio (Kyle Fabel) do give off an enjoyable
vitality. So do Neal Huff and Carrie Preston as the lovers of the
subplot, Lucentio and Bianca, Katherina's sister, here presented as
a spoiled Italian princess in a headband. But they could all
benefit from some streamlining of shtick.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially the case because Rees clearly has more on his
mind than slapstick. His own Petruchio, while presented as a
slightly seedy, mercenary greaser who wouldn't be out place at an
Off Track Betting parlor, is also given to serious moral doubts.
Rees, a Royal Shakespeare Company veteran who can play with the
comedy's language as though it were a beach ball, provides some
intriguingly shaded line readings. But he also often seems out of
place in his own production.
</P>
<P>
   He is by far at his best in his scenes alone with Ms. Neuwirth,
who is the evening's real revelation. This perennially droll
actress, justly celebrated for her work on Broadway (``Chicago'')
and television (``Cheers''), has an arch, contemporary style that
would not seem to lend itself either to Shakespearean language or
the tempestuous Kate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet without altering her eccentric signature delivery, she gives
her much abused, much abusing character a credible psychological
center. Ms. Neuwirth always exudes both the beleaguered air of the
underdog and the highhandedness of the diva, and she mixes those
traits quite touchingly here.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an entirely convincing performance. But by the time
she gets to Kate's notorious submission speech, Ms. Neuwirth has
cannily laid the groundwork for its presentation by a woman who has
learned that love demands compromise. There's an implicit wink
along with real passion in the moment, as though she were catering
to a fantasy that both she and her husband know is a joke at heart.
Even before Ms. Neuwirth returns in police garb for a surprise
postscript, this Kate has had the last word.
</P>

 &HT;    470&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ President Clinton poked fun at George W. Bush and
boosted Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign Wednesday in
a speech to the Democratic Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't do this because it's not presidential, but I'm
going to do it anyway,'' Clinton said before offering a
tongue-in-cheek critique of the Texas governor's signature slogan,
``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan ``has a great ring to it,'' Clinton said, ``and near
as I can tell, here's what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like you. I do,'' Clinton intoned with an air of mock
seriousness. ``And I would like to be for the patient's bill of
rights. And I'd like to be for closing the gun show loophole. And
I'd like not to squander the surplus and, you know, save Social
Security and Medicare for the next generation. I'd like to raise
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to do these things, but I just can't. And I feel
terrible about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, told of Clinton's comments during his own visit to
Baltimore, said, ``It's amazing that the president of the United
States would spend time talking about me, even before I get my
party's nomination.'' At another point, Bush said he was
``honored'' by the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech came on the heels of a barbed anti-Bush
introduction from Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante of California, the first
Hispanic elected to statewide office in the nation's most populous
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there is a joke going around the country,''
Bustamante said. ``It's called 'compassionate conservatism. Some
Republicans think that if you put a nice word in front of a mean
word, you can fool people, the way some Texas Republicans think
that all you have to do to get the Latino vote is to speak a little
Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean anything if you don't listen and you don't
help people earn what they want in life,'' he added. ``Calling
yourself a 'compassionate conservative' doesn't mean a thing when
for too many years 'conservative' meant divisive ethnic politics,
mean-spirited policies and selfish corporate greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite persistent accounts of a rift between the president and
vice president, Clinton praised Gore for continuing to advance
ideas developed by the centrist Democratic Leadership Council in
his campaign for the party's 2000 presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this election ought to be about,'' he said. ``Even
commentators on the other side point out that so far he's the only
person who has actually said what he would do if the people gave
him, which I think is a reasonably good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenging Republican candidates to explain their positions on
the gun issue, Clinton said, ``There will be clear choices here:
will we have common-sense gun laws or government by the gun
lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore continues to trail Bush by double digits in
hypothetical match-ups in public opinion polls, there was little
sign of panic among members of the council, the organization that
Gore helped found in 1985 following Walter Mondale's disastrous
defeat by Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia compared Bush's performance to the
opening of a new movie. ``You have a great opening week or two, and
then things kind of settle down and it's tested by critics and
history and examination,'' said Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early polls understate Gore's strengths and overstate
Bush's,'' said Al From, the DLC executive director and the
intellectual force behind the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The DLC does not endorse candidates, but, according to From, its
membership overwhelmingly supports Gore over former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, the vice president's sole opponent in the
Democratic contest who has long kept his distance from the DLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been with us since day one,'' said From.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ President Clinton poked fun at George W. Bush and
boosted Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign Wednesday in
a speech to the Democratic Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't do this because it's not presidential, but I'm
going to do it anyway,'' Clinton said before offering a
tongue-in-cheek critique of the Texas governor's signature slogan,
``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan ``has a great ring to it,'' Clinton said, ``and near
as I can tell, here's what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like you. I do,'' Clinton intoned with an air of mock
seriousness. ``And I would like to be for the patient's bill of
rights. And I'd like to be for closing the gun show loophole. And
I'd like not to squander the surplus and, you know, save Social
Security and Medicare for the next generation. I'd like to raise
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to do these things, but I just can't. And I feel
terrible about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, told of Clinton's comments during his own visit to
Baltimore, said, ``It's amazing that the president of the United
States would spend time talking about me, even before I get my
party's nomination.'' At another point, Bush said he was
``honored'' by the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech came on the heels of a barbed anti-Bush
introduction from Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante of California, the first
Hispanic elected to statewide office in the nation's most populous
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there is a joke going around the country,''
Bustamante said. ``It's called 'compassionate conservatism. Some
Republicans think that if you put a nice word in front of a mean
word, you can fool people, the way some Texas Republicans think
that all you have to do to get the Latino vote is to speak a little
Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean anything if you don't listen and you don't
help people earn what they want in life,'' he added. ``Calling
yourself a 'compassionate conservative' doesn't mean a thing when
for too many years 'conservative' meant divisive ethnic politics,
mean-spirited policies and selfish corporate greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite persistent accounts of a rift between the president and
vice president, Clinton praised Gore for continuing to advance
ideas developed by the centrist Democratic Leadership Council in
his campaign for the party's 2000 presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this election ought to be about,'' he said. ``Even
commentators on the other side point out that so far he's the only
person who has actually said what he would do if the people gave
him, which I think is a reasonably good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenging Republican candidates to explain their positions on
the gun issue, Clinton said, ``There will be clear choices here:
will we have common-sense gun laws or government by the gun
lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore continues to trail Bush by double digits in
hypothetical match-ups in public opinion polls, there was little
sign of panic among members of the council, the organization that
Gore helped found in 1985 following Walter Mondale's disastrous
defeat by Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia compared Bush's performance to the
opening of a new movie. ``You have a great opening week or two, and
then things kind of settle down and it's tested by critics and
history and examination,'' said Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early polls understate Gore's strengths and overstate
Bush's,'' said Al From, the DLC executive director and the
intellectual force behind the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The DLC does not endorse candidates, but, according to From, its
membership overwhelmingly supports Gore over former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, the vice president's sole opponent in the
Democratic contest who has long kept his distance from the DLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been with us since day one,'' said From.

 &HT;    REPORT FAULTS CONTRACTORS OVERSEEING FRAUD IN MEDICARE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government contractors, who are the designated
guardians against fraud for $220 billion in Medicare benefits,
routinely falsify documents, cover up errors and authorize improper
payments, a team of investigators told a congressional panel
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal and civil settlements have mounted to $216 million
against private companies who have processed the claims in the
massive federal health care program for the elderly since 1993.
That represents only the contractors in six states, amid
indications that the problem is much more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably still don't have a handle on the fraud and abuse
in this program _ we're still only scratching the surface,'' said
Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., at a Commerce subcommittee hearing he
chaired to examine the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record suggests that we may have gotten state-of-the-art
private-sector efficiency in fleecing the taxpayer,'' said Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said the abuse was left largely unchecked
because the six contractors often had a cozy relationship with
their overseer, the federal Health Care Financing Administration
(HCFA).
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings, contractors:
</P>
<P>
   _ Improperly rushed claims though the system, sometimes turning
off the computer systems designed to detect problems before making
overpayments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Destroyed or deleted backlogged claims.
</P>
<P>
   _ Switched off customer service telephone lines when the staff
could not answer calls within the required time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Falsified reports to HCFA on their own performance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Doctored or hid files of claims that had been incorrectly
processed.
</P>
<P>
   The companies implicated include BCBS of Florida, Michigan,
Illinois and Massachusetts as well as Blue Shield of California and
Pennsylvania Blue Shield.
</P>
<P>
   So pervasive was the corruption found in one company that George
Grob, deputy inspector general at the Department of Health and
Human Services, showed a chart of the top 50 positions of one of an
unidentified contractor, showing those offices implemented in fraud
in blue. All except a dozen of the posts were shaded in blue.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Grob said that the companies failed to use basic
accounting procedure known as ``dual entry,'' meaning that both
debits and credits are entered to provide an accurate balance
sheet. Instead, the contractors used ``single entry'' accounting,
he said. ``That's the equivalent to buying a baseball team and
finding out they do not use bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers split over who's to blame for the Medicare fraud and
how to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're sitting on your tail,'' Rep. Joe L. Barton, R-Texas,
told HCFA representatives. ``Do you see that this is not an
academic exercise? It's real dollars. It's big dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats defended the Clinton administration and raised
questions about privatizing the work, which is now assigned to
22,000 private contractors whose companies were paid $1.6 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government contracts out the work,'' said Rep. Bart
Stupak, D-Mich. ``But often it's more trouble than it's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie G. Aronovitz, an auditor with the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress, told the panel that
having the government do the work itself is not a clear remedy.
``You wouldn't necessarily solve your problems by trying to put it
in-house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is to imprison those guilty of fraud, said Rep. Ted
Strickland, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we treated them like they really are _ criminals, we might
have a different set of circumstances,'' he said.

<P>
   TOKYO _ In their annual sweep of the Aokigahara woods at the end
of last year, police officers found 73 bodies.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing unusual about finding bodies in Aokigahara. The
lush and sprawling forest nestled at the foot of Mount Fuji has
long been one of the most popular places in Japan for suicides.
</P>
<P>
   What's different now is the number: A year earlier, police
recovered 55 bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese are killing themselves in record numbers. Some 90
people a day committed suicide last year, a 34.7 percent rise from
the previous year, according to statistics from the National Police
Agency that provoked the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's leading
daily newspapers, to declare the situation an ``emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economic recession, and the shame and stress caused by
layoffs or the fear of them, are largely to blame, say most
experts, although suicides often stem from a combination of
factors, among them depression.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese are grappling with unemployment that has risen to
record levels as struggling companies slash their work forces and
cut back on hiring new graduates in an effort to bring costs more
in line with international standards.
</P>
<P>
   In total, 32,863 people committed suicide in 1998, both the
largest number and the highest rate of suicide recorded since
police began keeping records in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall anything like this ever before,'' said Yukiko
Nishihara, who for more than 20 years has run a suicide prevention
hot line in Osaka and now Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide in Japan has little of the stigma it carries in Western
societies; In literature, history and even today, suicides are
often portrayed as noble, a matter of conscience or an honorable
form of protest. In recent years, though, there has been increasing
criticism of suicide as irresponsible to survivors. And for years,
suicide rates in Japan have been lower than those in several other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, what caused most people here to catch their
breath was the increase in the number of middle-aged men who killed
themselves. There was a 44.6 percent rise in suicides among men
aged 40 to 59, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese were also shocked by the number of young men who took
their lives. Some 40 percent more men in their 20s committed
suicide last year. Typically, this is a stable time in Japanese
life, where young men could count on becoming '`shaiin,'' literally
members of society, by entering the work force. Now, jobs are
harder to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you graduate from the best university, you cannot
always find a job,'' Mrs. Nishihara said. ``Young people are
feeling very hopeless about their future.''
</P>
<P>
   The shame associated with not having a job is immense,
overwhelming and much understood by senior executives, who feel
bullied by foreign investors and analysts pushing them to move more
aggressively to cut jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there is a relationship between restructuring and
suicide,'' said Atsushi Murayama, the managing director in charge
of personnel at Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and one of the
few Japanese executives who has spoken openly, if reluctantly,
about the problem. ``Foreign analysts and the foreign press also
have responsibility, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsushita, like many other Japanese companies, has worked hard
to avoid layoffs, a stance characterized as foot-dragging by
foreigners but regarded as heroic here. ``Yes, we have to be
competitive with global companies, but seniority pay emphasizes
security,'' Murayama said. ``We have to adapt to free-style
competition but also take consideration of the Japanese social
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a job, however, apparently does not confer much of a
sense of relief, either. Many men who killed themselves in the last
year were employed but fearful of losing their jobs or overwhelmed
by increased work loads that were a result of colleagues losing
their jobs, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
   Wages have fallen, too, which is especially disastrous for
middle-aged men who are usually the sole earner in families
struggling to shoulder the heavy burden of both mortgage payments
and supplementary educational programs, which are standard for many
Japanese children.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Bureau of Employment Security showed that of
those unemployed white collar workers in their fifties who have
managed to find jobs after being laid off, the average income is
just 60 percent of what they were previously making.
</P>
<P>
   Financial straits, however, are not as important as the loss of
face that is a corollary to losing a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there are some people who commit suicide for
financial reasons,'' said Hiroshi Kawahito, a lawyer who
specializes in representing the families of victims of karoshi
(literally death from overwork) and an outspoken commentator on
suicide and its causes. ``But I think the most important reason is
that in Japan, if workers lose their jobs, they will be looked down
upon by society.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kawahito and a group of lawyers recently opened a one-day hot
line that received more than 300 calls from families of karoshi and
suicide victims, as well as victims in the making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often companies scold the families of victims, saying the
victim escaped his responsibilities and so behaved in an
irresponsible manner,'' Kawahito said. ``So in Japan, the culprit
and the victim are often reversed, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Families of suicide victims who die by throwing themselves in
front of a train are good examples of that. The Chuo line has been
nicknamed the Chuo-cide in some quarters because its tracks are a
favorite among suicides. JR East, the company that operates the
line, charges families a fee depending on how badly traffic is
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The rail line has reflected the overall trend in suicides. In
the fiscal year that ended March 31, 33 people were killed on the
line compared with 25 in the previous year. (The company calls the
deaths accidents because, it says, it has no way of distinguishing
the person who died as a result of suicide from the one who
wandered drunk onto the tracks.)
</P>
<P>
   But while economic distress has clearly helped boost the
numbers, Shizuo Machizawa, one of Japan's few specialists in the
field, suggests that economic woes have only exacerbated a trend
that would have developed anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Machizawa, like many observers of Japan after World War II,
believes that the suicide rate is one response to a gradual
breakdown of a system that rewarded traditional Japanese values of
loyalty, hierarchy and paternalism.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, in Japanese companies, subordinates offer their
department heads absolute loyalty, and in return Japanese
executives take care of their charges with an almost fatherly
devotion. Now, with pressures to lay off employees, cut costs and
improve efficiency, neither the boss nor the subordinate can
necessarily fulfill their side of the traditional bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, employees could predict their career
trajectory,'' said Machizawa. ``Now, they can't.'' As managers are
forced to lay off staff or tell older workers that younger
subordinates may be making more money, the sense of shame for the
bearer of bad tidings can be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Japanese managers have a great responsibility to
secure employment for their work force so their lives won't fall
apart,'' said Kouji Nishigaki, the president of NEC Corp., which
has embarked on one of the most sweeping employment cutbacks ever
taken by a Japanese corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a large chunk of its job cuts have come at the
expense of employees in its international operations, while in
Japan, a cutback in recruitment combined with early retirement will
ultimately eliminate some 6,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   NEC is just one of several Japanese companies that have hired
Machizawa to consult with distraught and depressed employees and
conduct seminars, although, in general, psychiatric care here is
limited to administering anti-depressants and advising patients to
try to take time off, advice that is unrealistic in an era of
rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Kawahito, the lawyer, noted that the number of people who kill
themselves vastly outnumbers the number of people who die in
traffic accidents. ``If there was an increase in traffic accidents,
the Japanese government would surely make an effort to reduce the
number,'' he said. ``But the suicide rate keeps going up and we
have no government policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Aokigahara, several local groups have banded together with
the police to fight suicide in the forest. They have nailed signs
on trees along several of the paths leading into the woods,
imploring potential suicide victims to think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is a precious present from your parents,'' the signs say.
``Think quietly about your parents, brothers and sisters and
children. Do not agonize alone, please consult us first.'' The
telephone number for the Fujiyoshida Police Precinct follows.
</P>
<P>
   Police patrol the area looking to prevent suicides and pick up
about one person a day on average, a precinct spokesman said. ``For
instance, if someone is wearing a suit, we certainly stop the car
and take them into custody,'' he said.

forced to lay off staff or tell older workers that younger
subordinates may be making more money, the sense of shame for the
bearer of bad tidings can be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Japanese managers have a great responsibility to
secure employment for their work force so their lives won't fall
apart,'' said Kouji Nishigaki, the president of NEC Corp., which
has embarked on one of the most sweeping employment cutbacks ever
taken by a Japanese corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a large chunk of its job cuts have come at the
expense of employees in its international operations, while in
Japan, a cutback in recruitment combined with early retirement will
ultimately eliminate some 6,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   NEC is just one of several Japanese companies that have hired
Machizawa to consult with distraught and depressed employees and
conduct seminars, although, in general, psychiatric care here is
limited to administering anti-depressants and advising patients to
try to take time off, advice that is unrealistic in an era of
rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Kawahito, the lawyer, noted that the number of people who kill
themselves vastly outnumbers the number of people who die in
traffic accidents. ``If there was an increase in traffic accidents,
the Japanese government would surely make an effort to reduce the
number,'' he said. ``But the suicide rate keeps going up and we
have no government policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Aokigahara, several local groups have banded together with
the police to fight suicide in the forest. They have nailed signs
on trees along several of the paths leading into the woods,
imploring potential suicide victims to think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is a precious present from your parents,'' the signs say.
``Think quietly about your parents, brothers and sisters and
children. Do not agonize alone, please consult us first.'' The
telephone number for the Fujiyoshida Police Precinct follows.
</P>
<P>
   Police patrol the area looking to prevent suicides and pick up
about one person a day on average, a precinct spokesman said. ``For
instance, if someone is wearing a suit, we certainly stop the car
and take them into custody,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jiri Kylian is at his best and deepest in ``One of a
Kind,'' a ballet that has the glow of a magic onyx. Bathed in both
darkness and light, this new work choreographed by the longtime
artistic director of the Nederlands Dans Theater made for a
stunning opening on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The popular experimental Dutch company will present two programs
through Sunday afternoon at the New York State Theater as part of
Lincoln Center Festival '99.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever intellectual baggage is involved ( Kylian's program
notes describe a springboard for the piece), the impact of ``One of
a Kind'' is totally visual and kinetic.
</P>
<P>
   The fierce motor pulse of Kylian's choreography, sensed even
when his exceptional dancers come to rest in barely contained
stillness, is the work's most spectacular feature. There is a new
movement vocabulary here, full of lightning-swift shifts in weight
and a propulsion that has the company virtually skating across the
floor. The intricacy of the partnering ties the work's many duets
into knots with whirlwind force.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the same dancing is impossible to separate from the
spellbinding production values that envelope it: ingeniously
resonant decor by the Japanese architect Atsushi Kitagawara
combined with the fluent poetry of Michael Simon's lighting.
Surprises abound, beginning with a stylized version of the usual
Kabuki theater ramp, or runway, which Kitagawara moved to the
center of the stage as a path to his angular caves in the rear. In
the rear as well, but at the end of the ballet, are his fragments
of three black staircases seen through the striped dazzle of three
curtains of gold beads.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Kylian works, ``One of a Kind'' is a full-evening
piece in three acts. But like most Kylian ballets, it appears
plotless and carries an emotional subtext. The action, whose mood
is further influenced by the onstage presence of a cellist, Pieter
Wispelwey, suggests life's journey as part of a dream that can also
be a nightmare. But then this is only one interpretation of a work
that invites interpretation. It is Kylian's wont to present his
basic concept in such distilled form that the initial springboard
serves as a metaphor for a theme rather than a theme itself.
</P>
<P>
   Kylian's program notes tell us that the ballet was commissioned
by the Dutch Ministry of Home Affairs to celebrate the 150th
anniversary of the Dutch Constitution and that he conceived of the
work as an ode to individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of a Kind'' can then be stretched into a metaphor for this
putative theme largely because the dancers have been asked to
express themselves by collaborating on the choreography. The one
dancer who remains onstage throughout the piece as a constant also
improvises during intermission as stagehands change the scenery and
other dancers warm up or rehearse. Cora Bos-Kroese (Megumi Nakamura
leads the second cast) occasionally shadowboxes with flailing
raised fists and also lies down. As the first to enter, she was,
with her stretched taut line and loose-hipped wide swing of a leg,
the prototype of the highly trained dancers, male and female, who
followed her.
</P>
<P>
   The dancer's input may be part of the choreography (especially,
one suspects, in the solos) but the ruling sensibility is very much
Kylian's.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the body is always an expressive instrument. Kylian
rarely descends into the literal, although in the first act there
is more than a suggestion of a gang rape. At this dawn of
civilization, Kitagawara has built a long strip folded into a
cavelike shelter. The music (both live and on tape) by Brett Dean,
an Australian, is part of a collage that ranges from the chants of
Tibetan monks to John Cage.
</P>
<P>
   The movement palette is restricted in the first act, with a wiry
energy coursing through the zigzagging bodies of Ms. Bos-Kroese and
the four women who emerge from the darkness after her. There are no
large leaps, but the dancers scoot across the floor, legs apart,
their feet barely skimming the stage.The six men rush in and out
with aggressive power.
</P>
<P>
   The image of double duets is expanded in the next two acts with
the same swivel-smooth polish. The set in Act II consists of a
diamond-shape and a revolving cone that suggests a futuristic
sundial. The mix of modern dance and ballet here is full of tension
and elongated line in trios and duets.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, which has a cast of 23, expands in the center and
shrinks to 8 dancers in Act III. Tough dancing in duets leads to an
existential fade-out. Ms. Bos-Kroese faces the three staircases to
paradise or the future and does not ascend.

MET'S EXTENDED SCHEDULE DISMAYS BALLET THEATER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Concerned that its run would be pushed deep into the
summer doldrums, American Ballet Theater has voiced its dismay over
an unannounced plan by its landlord, the Metropolitan Opera, to
expand the opera season permanently by two weeks, to 32 weeks,
starting in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   That year alone, it would actually add three weeks of Kirov
Opera performances before turning the opera house over to Ballet
Theater's dancers in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet company warned that the change, even for one season,
would cause serious damage. ``Moving ABT's performance dates to the
middle of the summer would not only have a dramatic impact on
ticket sales but could seriously affect long-term relations with
our subscribers, who are accustomed to seeing the company in the
spring,'' said a company spokesman, Robert Pontarelli.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Volpe, the Met's general manager, confirmed Wednesday
that the Met would expand its regular season and bring back the
Kirov Opera in 2002 for a repeat of last year's postseason series.
But he said in an interview that he was not in any way shouldering
aside Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer in ABT,'' he said. ``They are important to the
Met, and I want them to flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   After voicing the ballet company's concerns, Pontarelli, too,
sounded a conciliatory note, saying: ``The Met has been ABT's home
and partner for a very long time, and we value that relationship.
Hopefully by working together we can still find a mutually
beneficial solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a three-year contract now up for renewal between the Met
and Ballet Theater, the Met will not present any other dance
company after the end of the opera season in April or May prior to
Ballet Theater's performances. But it may present another opera
troupe.
</P>
<P>
   By bringing back the Kirov, under Valery Gergiev _ who is also
the Met's first principal guest conductor _ after its newly
expanded 32-week season in 2002, the Met would delay the start of
Ballet Theater's performances until after Memorial Day, pushing its
season into July. This, Ballet Theater officials said, would make
it difficult to attract audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But Volpe said the company could return to its earlier start in
subsequent years.

US BASKETBALLERS DEBUT IN OLYMPICS QUALIFIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   SAN JUAN _ They never expected to be here in the summer of '99,
battling with the likes of Uruguay, Cuba, and Panama simply for the
right to participate in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. But they're
here, so they figure they might as well make quick work of their
brethren from the other Americas and make it official.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incarnation of the much-abused term ``Dream Team''
makes its debut Friday in the pre-Olympic qualifying Tournament of
the Americas. The United States, forced into such humble company
because it didn't win the World Championship last summer, fields a
team of nine NBA stars and three collegians, the latter all lottery
picks in last month's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone feels this will be simply 10 days of muscle flexing by
the Yanks. They not only aren't expected to lose, they're not
expected to break a sweat, at least not in the air-conditioned
comfort of Roberto Clemente Coliseum. The United States, which
plays Uruguay, tuned up for the tournament by drubbing Canada,
97-69, in an exhibition game last Saturday in Orlando. The first
three international teams composed of NBA players (1992, 1994,
1996) had average victory margins of 43.8, 37.7, and 32.3 points,
respectively. This one doesn't expect that to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to embarrass anybody,'' said point guard Gary
Payton, who won gold in 1996 at Atlanta. `If we get up by 30, we're
not going to start throwing it behind our back and stuff like that.
We're coming to play. But we also know USA Basketball doesn't want
to be sitting on their hands and seeing any close games. They want
to be relaxing, chatting with their buddies when we are up 30.
That's what they want to do. That's what we're going to do so we
won't see (NBA and USA Basketball official) Rod Thorn hide his
head.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ever-candid Payton, the US team also features
Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Jason Kidd, Tom Gugliotta, Allan
Houston, Vin Baker, Tim Hardaway, and Steve Smith from the NBA.
Those nine also are ticketed for Sydney. Soon-to-be NBAers Elton
Brand, Wally Szczerbiak, and Richard Hamilton round out this squad,
coached by Philadelphia's Larry Brown. It is anticipated that three
NBA players will replace the collegians at Sydney. Houston's Rudy
Tomjanovich, who bowed out here because of exhaustion, is slated to
coach that squad.
</P>
<P>
   These lads also were scheduled to play last summer in the World
Championships in Athens. But they refused to participate after the
NBA imposed its lockout, and USA Basketball, which sponsors the
team, had to scramble and come up with a team largely composed of
CBA players. That team won the bronze medal when gold was needed to
automatically qualify for Sydney. Hence, the unanticipated trip to
the Caribbean, where the most interesting battle will be for second
place.
</P>
<P>
   This marks only the second time that a United States team has
been forced to qualify for an Olympic berth. The original 1992
Dream Team had to qualify in Portland, Ore., because the 1990 team
had failed to win the gold medal at the previous World
Championships. The United States has won the gold medal in 11 of 13
Olympics, failing in 1972 (the infamous loss to the USSR in Munich)
and in 1988 (John Thompson's Seoul team). The Americans did not
participate in the 1980 Olympics in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   While the US team is the undeniable leader in star power, there
are some familiar faces on other rosters. The late, great
University of Massachusetts backcourt of Edgar Padilla and Carmelo
Travieso is back, playing for the hosts, while Felipe Lopez, the
former New York schoolboy supernova and current Vancouver Grizzly,
is playing for the Dominican Republic. There also is speculation
that Pacers guard Mark Jackson may play for the Dominicans; he
apparently qualifies because of the birthplace of one of his
grandmothers. The Canadian team doesn't have Rick Fox, but it does
have Steve Nash of the Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   The game marks the first of eight straight days of competition
for the United States, assuming it makes it to the Final Four. The
semifinals will be July 24, with the winners qualifying for Sydney.
The gold medal game is the following day. At last check, TNT was
planning to televise four games, including Thursday's opener and
the gold medal game. NBC plans to televise the US's semifinal game.

FOR A MOMENT CLINTON, THE NEW DEMOCRAT, ACTS LIKE AN OLD DEMOCRAT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 18)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For a fleeting moment this summer, Bill Clinton,
the new Democrat who has aligned himself with the aspirations of
the middle class, sought to strengthen his link to the old
Democrats who still care about the welfare of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Zooming recently from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta, East
St. Louis, and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and on to Los
Angeles and Phoenix, the president focused on those pathetic souls
who seek to survive in persistent pockets of poverty while the
nation bursts with affluence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton launched his mission late in his presidency. But it
affirmed his claim to the legacy of his most distinguished
Democratic predecessors and dramatized his desire to remember those
Americans who in the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt were known as
the ``common man.''
</P>
<P>
   When the president concluded his four-day journey, there were as
many poor people as there had been when he began. Their plight,
however, had been observed on television by millions of viewers and
in person by a few hand-picked business leaders and politicians who
might be able to propel them into the economic mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the trip was little more than the kind of
photo-op politics that Clinton has practiced successfully for years
or that it was, as Minnesota Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone
claimed, too little and too late.
</P>
<P>
   It might also be noted that now, when jobs are plentiful and
most people are enjoying an abundance they had not previously
known, many Americans can't understand why some others continue to
live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But as Clinton found, the poor cannot move up the economic
ladder because they lack education, training and incentives to
prosper and their communities lack job-producing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike FDR, Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson,
Clinton did not propose vast new federal programs to aid the
downtrodden. His purpose was to get business leaders interested in
locating enterprises in depressed areas.
</P>
<P>
   His emphasis and that of his immediate Republican predecessors,
Ronald Reagan and George Bush, have been primarily on helping the
middle class rather than the underclass. The middle class is the
backbone of the republic, and its votes determine who wins
presidential elections and which party controls Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has supported various federal programs to ease
the burden on the poor and has established strong ties to the
African-American community, he has not been as strong an advocate
of federal economic intervention as some of his Democratic
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   A plan that the president calls his new markets initiative,
resembles enterprise zones, which were advocated in the 1980s by
Republicans, especially former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, and
empowerment zones, which have been overseen by Vice President Al
Gore for the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Under both programs, local governments must get business leaders
involved in degraded areas.
</P>
<P>
   In a CNN interview with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who accompanied
him on the journey, Clinton said that entrepreneurs who invest in
poor neighborhoods ``should expect a profit.'' He added: ``We're
not asking anybody to do anything that is not good business.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the program moving, Clinton said, Congress should provide
business and industry with the same tax and other incentives that
are provided for investment overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing will happen overnight. But Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who played a major role in arranging the
Clinton trip, is expected to keep pressing for action.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the Washington Post at the end of Clinton's journey,
Cuomo noted that ``government cannot fill the void left by the
private sector's absence.'' By the same token, he added, the effort
cannot be left to the private sector alone because it ``has failed
in these places.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The intelligent synthesis,'' said Cuomo, is that government
should give the private sector incentives ``to invest in poorer
communities and help them overcome competitive economic
disadvantages.''
</P>
<P>
   That means a strong partnership between the private sector and
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The government has tried before to help the poor, as with Lyndon
Johnson's massive war on poverty. Some aspects of that program
still are with us, but the federal effort to defeat poverty
basically was abandoned when America became involved in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for the enthusiasm surrounding a major federal
program to fade or for new leaders to want to launch projects of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   America will benefit if Clinton's incentive plan succeeds. But
there is no guarantee that will happen.

/apollo11) tells the story of Apollo 11 from launching to landing
in words, sounds and pictures (including a shadowy black-and-white
video image of Armstrong descending the ladder to the moon
surface). The Lunar and Planetary Institute, a NASA-financed
organization in Houston, maintains a Web site with pages for all
the Apollo missions (cass.jsc.nasa.gov/expmoon &QL; 
/apollolandings.html).

   Fans of the space program may also want to visit a memorial site
for Pete Conrad, who was killed in a motorcycle accident last week.
At www.peteconrad.com, the site contains photographs and tributes
to Conrad, the third person to walk on the moon.

   VOICE XPRESS LETS YOU WORK WHILE ON THE GO
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it; typing while you drive is not good form. Yet in a
world that runs on Internet time, every minute not spent working is
60 seconds wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Lernhout &AMP; Hauspie, a speech recognition company, has introduced
a product that can move at least some of your down time _
commuting, for example _ into the productivity column of life's
grand balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The L&AMP;H Mobile Voice Xpress Mobile Professional system,
available for about $200, combines Lernhout &AMP; Hauspie's latest
speech recognition software with a digital recording device from
Olympus that weighs less than two ounces and fits easily in a shirt
pocket or the tiniest purse.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympus DS-150 holds 70 minutes of dictation, runs for weeks
on two AAA batteries and has a built-in noise-canceling microphone
for handheld use. It also has standard connectors for a
microphone-headset, allowing hands-free operation.
</P>
<P>
   In the office or at home, the Olympus DS-150 connects to the
serial port of a computer, which transcribes your dictated words in
the background, allowing you to do other work.
</P>
<P>
   As with all speech recognition, it has a way to go with homonym
differentiation, but fixing such errors is a snap because it
produces documents in standard text or Microsoft Word formats.
</P>
<P>
   The thoughtful addition of sound-editing software lets you
excise evidence of road rage (and other things you wish you hadn't
said) before transcription begins. No more excuses for not writing
the Great American Novel _ and that letter to mom.

   ON A NEW ONLINE ARCHIVE, THE QUARRY WILL BE SOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Most online archives do a commendable job of enabling people to
search what can be seen, whether rare manuscripts, literary
treasures or old photographs. But searching for sounds requires a
new level of technological expertise.
</P>
<P>
   A digital-library project announced Wednesday will try to reach
that level. Michigan State University in East Lansing is embarking
on the project _ called the National Gallery of the Spoken Word _
with $3.6 million from the National Science Foundation. The gallery
will be an archive of recordings, including presidential speeches
and voices captured on the first Edison cylinders. Nonprofit
organizations, museums and universities are helping to stock the
archive, which is available at www.ngsw.org.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of technology and software for searching sounds
will underpin the project, said Dr. Mark L. Kornbluh, the Michigan
State history professor who will oversee it. The archive is being
designed to allow people to search sound files by typing or saying
words or phrases that they might expect to find in speeches,
oral-history recordings or news broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is being created with the understanding that we will
someday talk to our computers,'' Kornbluh said. ``We won't always
type to our computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Two experts in speech-recognition technology _ John Hansen at
the University of Colorado at Boulder and John R. Deller Jr. at
Michigan State University _ are leading the effort to create the
searching software. They are now grappling with the size of the
database, which is expected to contain more than 5,000 hours of
recordings of widely varying sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   But within the next year or two, Deller said, visitors to the
Web site should be able to type basic words to find specific
phrases or words. In four or five years, he added, the database
will be able to recognize voices. ``The user may specify a speaker
and subject,'' he said, ``or they may just come up and ask, Who
said `I am not a crook'?''

   EASY E-MAIL WITHOUT CORDS, JACKS OR PLUGS
</P>
<P>
   For the average laptop user on the road, getting and sending
e-mail can be a chore. There's no way to plug the computer into a
pay phone, and calling from a hotel room can mean changing the
laptop modem's dialing properties.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies, Sharp and JVC, offer devices that allow the
sending and receiving of e-mail from just about any phone, with no
cords or plugs required. Sharp's Telmail TM-20 and JVC's HC-E100
sell for about $100 each, are about the size of an eyeglasses case,
offer organizer and address-book functions, and use Pocket Mail, an
e-mail service offered by Pocket Science for $9.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The user types in a message (up to 4,000 characters) on the
small keyboard and stores it until a phone is available.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's simply a matter of calling a toll-free number, placing
the device against a telephone handset and firing away. Outgoing
mail is sent, and incoming mail received.
</P>
<P>
   The devices work with most phones, including cordless and
cellular models.

   Free Service Is a Way to Keep Prying Eyes Off Your E-Mail
</P>
<P>
   A new company in Palo Alto, Calif., has created a free e-mail
service to fend off the online equivalent of Dumpster divers _
people who root through mail servers to find messages that you sent
days, weeks or even years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Ziplip.com, says it will protect your e-mail
messages from snoops and delete all traces of the messages after
they have been read by their intended recipients. To lock up
messages that are sent over the Internet, the service scrambles the
messages using 128-bit encryption _ the strongest encryption code
that the United States allows to be sent over the Internet. The
company then applies an even stronger encryption code to the
messages that are stored on Ziplip's computers.
</P>
<P>
   The service does not ask users to set up new e-mail accounts, as
does Hushmail.com, another snoop-resistant service that opened this
summer. People who want to use Ziplip must go to the company's Web
site at www.ziplip.com to type and send messages.
</P>
<P>
   They are required to provide the e-mail address for the intended
recipient but are not asked to fill in their e-mail addresses or
other information. Ziplip then sends a brief e-mail message to the
recipient that includes a Web link to the actual message on
Ziplip.Com's Web site. Users are encouraged to use passwords to
keep the messages even more private.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is allowing someone to literally track every move
we make,'' said Kon Leong, president and chief executive of the
company. ``I thought it was about time that technology was used to
counter that trend.''

   A MAN WITH A NEW MISSION: A COMPUTER IN EVERY KITCHEN
</P>
<P>
   Computers may be proliferating throughout the house, but they
have generally bypassed the kitchen. Bob Lampson wants to change
that, and as the man who brought the Juiceman juicer and Breadman
bread machine to countless kitchen counters (via countless
infomercials), he may just be the fellow to do it.
</P>
<P>
   His company, CMI Worldwide of Seattle, has come up with the
Advantage 2000. While the machine does not slice and dice, it lets
the cook do a lot of things: watch a cooking show on TV or a CD-ROM
video, browse for a favorite recipe on the Web or get that famous
Neiman Marcus cookie recipe via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The machine uses a non-Windows operating system, with a browser
by Spyglass, and CMI Worldwide will provide Web access through its
own portal for a monthly fee. The company is betting that people
who spend a lot of time in the kitchen will be willing to pay extra
for the convenience of sending e-mail or searching the Web without
having to go elsewhere in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The machine, which a company official said should be on the
market this summer, will be available in two models. An
under-the-cabinet version with a fold-down screen will cost about
$2,800. The plan is to market it mostly to builders who want to
include it as a kitchen feature. A countertop model, priced at
about $1,000, will be marketed to the public _ largely through
infomercials, of course.

HAZARD OF THE TOUR: FAN WITH A CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   L'ALPE D'HUEZ, France _ Usually it's the steep mountains, the
hairpin switchbacks, the speedy descents, or the frantic sprint
finishes that can ruin a rider in the Tour de France. Wednesday it
was none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   An overzealous fan almost cost Guiseppe Guerini his stage
victory. The fan wanted a snapshot of the leader as he pedaled his
way to the summit. But the fan darted into the street and ran right
into the oncoming rider, sending Guerini and his bike sprawling.
The spectators gasped and rushed to get the Italian back on his
bike and give him a shove to keep going. A wobbling Guerini kept
going and got to the line 21 seconds ahead of Russian Pavel Tonkov.
</P>
<P>
   No word on what happened to the fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, I went from the most beautiful moment of my life to
the worst,'' Guerini said. ``I thought I'd lost the race. But I saw
I had a few seconds advantage over the others, so I went flat
out.''
</P>
<P>
   American Lance Armstrong had no such scares. He rode in the main
pack for the entire race and finished fifth, just 25 seconds back.
Combined with Abraham Olano's 12th-place finish more than two
minutes back, that helped boost Armstrong's margin and keep his
hold on the leader's yellow jersey. The rider from Austin, Texas,
now has a 7-minute-42-second lead over Olano.
</P>
<P>
   The umbrellas at the race's start, which took place in an
Italian village, were to protect the fans from the drizzle on the
dank and cool morning. More than six hours _ and 138 miles _ later,
umbrellas were out again, but this time to dodge the sun and heat
in the high Alps.
</P>
<P>
   The course was guaranteed to be one of the toughest on the Tour,
as it came a day after the first Alps stage and included three
so-called ``above category'' climbs, the longest and steepest
climbs.
</P>
<P>
   So the French turned out in large numbers to watch the race and
to cheer on countryman Richard Virenque in the hope that he would
bring them a win on Bastille Day. White banners with red polka dots
(depicting the mountain climber jersey he has won four times)
declared ``Allez Virenque!''
</P>
<P>
   But no such luck. Both he and Armstrong would finish in the lead
group but be denied the win.
</P>
<P>
   The pack stayed together until Frenchmen Thierry Bourguignon and
Stephane Heulot took off coming down the first descent. They built
up a lead of more than 11 minutes until the second climb, 30 miles
later.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't bother Armstrong, who was with the rest of the
pack and surrounded by Postal Service teammates Kevin Livington and
Tyler Hamilton. They helped lead him up the mountain _ protecting
him from other riders who might start a break, and being there to
offer support of a wheel or bike if he got into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders' gap had evaporated, and when the riders came down
the last descent, Armstrong went out with a group of six others who
rode together until Guerini broke away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only objective today was to hold onto the yellow jersey,''
Armstrong said. ``The other riders were strong today; I was
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The stage, which finished at yet another ski resort, has become
known as the most grueling aspect of the Tour. The road is an
8.3-mile climb to the top up 21 switchbacks with an average grade
of 7.9 percent. And in case any rider isn't sure how far he has to
go, the switchbacks are numbered with a black-and-white card tacked
onto the side of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour, which has reached the halfway point of its 2,240-mile
ride, has taken its toll. Four riders dropped out during Monday's
first mountain stage, including Italy's Mario Cippolini, who won an
unprecented four straight stages last week. Eight more either
didn't start or ``abandoned'' Wednesday, leaving 160 cyclists
remaining from the original 180.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Armstrong refuses to guarantee that he'll wear the
yellow jersey until the end of the race, his fans are not as
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be Armstrong, 100 percent,'' said Annamarie Angliouus
of Belgium, who with her husband rode halfway up the stage
Wednesday in their camper. They have been at every race of the
Tour, and have two big American flags that they show off at the
side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born Belgian, but I have an American heart,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is undoubtedly fine with Armstrong.

KASICH ENDORSES BUSH, STIRRING SPECULATION ABOUT TICKET SLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush picked up the endorsement
Wednesday of Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who announced that he was
giving up the presidential race and his House seat, sparking
speculation that Kasich was angling for the vice presidential slot
on a Bush ticket.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush at his side, Kasich, the chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said that he shares Bush's political philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush's `compassionate conservative' really kind of
defines what John Kasich is all about,'' the Ohio congressman said,
adding: ``I feel as though I have a soul brother.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked Bush what Kasich's chances were to be the
vice presidential nominee on a Bush ticket, the Texas governor
quipped: ``They just increased.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kasich was asked whether he'd want to be on a Bush ticket,
Bush answered for him: ``Sure, he would.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich would bring geographical diversity and Washington
experience to a Bush ticket but his paltry success in this early
campaign season shows that he didn't make much of an impact with
Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mann, a political science expert at the non-partisan
Brookings Institution here, said that it was ``unlikely'' Bush
would select Kasich for the ticket. ``He certainly didn't do
anything to enhance his standing during the campaign, which was a
bust. It wasn't a real serious effort,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Others speculated that Kasich might have his eye on the job of
director of the White House Office of Management and Budget in a
Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich's departure from the race for the Republican presidential
nomination comes after he was unable to raise his standing in the
polls or win wide support among GOP campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   In current polls, Bush is the strong front-runner for the
Republican nomination. A recent CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of likely
GOP voters showed Bush winning 59 percent while Kasich drew just 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich has raised only $3 million so far this year, including
$1.4 million transferred from his House campaign warchest. Bush, on
the other hand, has raised $36.2 million in the first six months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite ending his campaign, Kasich said he was encouraged by
the response he received from voters in Iowa, site of the first
political caucus of the 2000 campaign, and New Hampshire, which
will hold the first primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words that I heard were, `Don't go away. Don't give it up.
This just isn't your time,''' he said. ``I think you have to be
mature enough in politics and in life to able to accept some
disappointment,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, 47, also said that he would not seek reelection to
Congress after his ninth term expires in 18 months. ``There does
come a time when you know it's time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Although technically Kasich never officially became a candidate
for the nomination, he is the second Republican to drop out of a
crowded field for the Republican nomination. On Tuesday, New
Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith announced he was leaving the party and
running for president as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bush, those remaining as either announced
candidates or semi-declared candidates include Elizabeth Dole,
former cabinet secretary and head of the Red Cross; Gary Bauer,
conservative activist; Pat Buchanan, conservative commentator;
publishing magnate Steve Forbes; former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander; Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Bush praised Kasich, who has espoused fiscal conservatism as
chairman of the House Budget Committee and a key player in efforts
to balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``John can connect with a lot of folks around the country that
are looking for a different campaign and a different kind of
government,'' Bush said. ``He's going to fit perfectly on my
team,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also attended a $1,000-a-plate fundraising luncheon in
suburban McLean, Va., of high-tech executives and a dinner in
Baltimore. The events were expected to gross a total of about
$650,000.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1995 two Manhattan club owners started the
Macintosh Music Festival to fill the summer gap left after the New
Music Seminar _ a weeklong mix of panels, deal making and scores of
alternative rock concerts _ collapsed under the weight of its debt.
The new festival, the club owners said, would merge computer
technology with live performance, posting 360-degree concert photos
and written descriptions of shows on the Internet to become the
first festival to take place simultaneously in clubs and on the
Web. To many people at the time, the whole concept seemed like a
lot of smoke blown around an attempt keep the clubs crowded and to
sell more beer.
</P>
<P>
   But next week the annual event returns with a new name, the
Digital Club Festival, and a victory smile. Not only has figuring
out how to put a price tag on the connection between music and the
Internet become a top priority of the record business, but just
last month SFX (the company that turned the concert industry upside
down by buying more than half of the country's concert promoters as
well as many concert halls, ticket companies and tours) announced
that it was beginning an Internet spending spree and had made a
deal with Intel to cybercast 20 shows this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the Digital Club Festival seems prescient. Last year,
the festival says, 250,000 computer users watched live feeds of
concerts online; this year it expects more than half a million.
</P>
<P>
   There are three components to this year's festival, said Andrew
Rasiej, a former owner of Irving Plaza who runs the Digital Club
Network with Michael Dorf of the Knitting Factory. The first is the
music: some 350 bands at 25 clubs over four nights, beginning on
Tuesday, with live feeds available free on its Web site:
www.digitalclubfest.com. Passes that allow access to all shows
(space permitting) are available online or from Ticketmaster for
$50. Among the groups performing are Bush, Everlast, Live, Public
Enemy, the Donnas, Spain, Will Oldham, Frank Black and Public
Enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The second component is two days of lectures and panel
discussions on technology and music, called Plug-In, at the
Marriott Marquis Hotel. Beginning on Monday and open to 800 people
for a prohibitive fee of $1,300 to $1,400, it includes many of the
biggest executives in the record and technology industries, like
Chris Blackwell of Palm Pictures, Danny Goldberg of Artemis
Records, Strauss Zelnick of BMG and Rob Glaser of Real Networks.
Many of these executives wouldn't even attend the festival in its
first year, Rasiej said, noting that record companies can no longer
afford to be seen standing on the sidelines of the Internet-music
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is why musicians as well known as Wyclef Jean of
the Fugees, Seal, Public Enemy and the Artist Formerly Known as
Prince are performing on Monday night at an awards show for Web
sites, the Yahoo! Internet Life Magazine On-Line Music Awards, at
Studio 54.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the week also sees the beginnings of Rasiej and Dorf's
new company, the Digital Club Network, created with the belief that
live concerts should not disappear into the ether when the show is
over but should be archived and exploited like studio recordings.
``What A&AMP;E and Bravo were to cable TV in 1985,'' Rasiej said, ``we
believe the Digital Club Network will be to broadband in the year
2005.''
</P>
<P>
   Going Commercial
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 13 years on public radio, ``Rhythm Revue'' is
graduating to commercial radio. The show, a popular
rhythm-and-blues flashback produced every Saturday by Felix
Hernandez on WBGO in Newark, N.J., (88.3 FM), will be heard on
Jammin' 105 (WTJM, 105.1 FM in New York) beginning on Saturday
morning from 7 to 11. It will also be broadcast Sunday nights from
6 to 10. The station, which changed its format from adult
contemporary to rhythm-and-blues oldies in December, first
approached Hernandez with the offer a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was a difficult decision to leave WBGO, but in the
end the cons were outweighed by the pros, which included ``reaching
a wider audience and the high probability of syndicating the
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerned e-mail from fans, Hernandez said that besides
the insertion of commercials and extra hours, the show would not
change, and that he would continue to choose the music. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dead? No Prob!
</P>
<P>
   This week Private I/Mercury Records announced that it would be
releasing the first of three recordings of Patsy Cline duets on
Sept. 14. These aren't rarities rescued from the vault, but recent
recordings, made 36 years after Ms. Cline's death. With the support
of Ms. Cline's children and former husband, producer Michael Blakey
hired a scientist to help him remove sections of Cline's original
vocals and then reconstructed the tracks, adding extra
orchestration and the voices of Willie Nelson, Glenn Campbell,
Waylon Jennings, Crystal Gayle, Bob Carlisle and others.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time music has been made using the voice
of someone too dead to object. Recent years have seen similar
albums or songs with John Lennon, Nat ``King'' Cole and Mexican
singer-songwriter Jose Alfredo Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   But Mercury's confidence in the three separate Cline CDs points
to a new genre that may be growing so popular that it will need its
own section in record stores: ``Rock-and-Roll Over in Your Grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sections of Jimi Hendrix's guitar solos can be replaced
with riffs by some of today's fine young guitarists, like one of
the guys from Korn. Janis Joplin's entire ``Pearl'' album could be
remade as a duet with Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   And a supergroup called 27 Grave could be digitally created,
featuring Hendrix, Joplin, Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison and others who
died at that age. And while we're at it, why not replace the
trumpet in Miles Davis' ``Kind of Blue'' with belching sounds? Or
has that already been done?

Committee, said that he shares Bush's political philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush's `compassionate conservative' really kind of
defines what John Kasich is all about,'' the Ohio congressman said,
adding: ``I feel as though I have a soul brother.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked Bush what Kasich's chances were to be the
vice presidential nominee on a Bush ticket, the Texas governor
quipped: ``They just increased.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kasich was asked whether he'd want to be on a Bush ticket,
Bush answered for him: ``Sure, he would.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich would bring geographical diversity and Washington
experience to a Bush ticket but his paltry success in this early
campaign season shows that he didn't make much of an impact with
Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mann, a political science expert at the non-partisan
Brookings Institution here, said that it was ``unlikely'' Bush
would select Kasich for the ticket. ``He certainly didn't do
anything to enhance his standing during the campaign, which was a
bust. It wasn't a real serious effort,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Others speculated that Kasich might have his eye on the job of
director of the White House Office of Management and Budget in a
Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich's departure from the race for the Republican presidential
nomination comes after he was unable to raise his standing in the
polls or win wide support among GOP campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   In current polls, Bush is the strong front-runner for the
Republican nomination. A recent CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of likely
GOP voters showed Bush winning 59 percent while Kasich drew just 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich has raised only $3 million so far this year, including
$1.4 million transferred from his House campaign warchest. Bush, on
the other hand, has raised $36.2 million in the first six months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite ending his campaign, Kasich said he was encouraged by
the response he received from voters in Iowa, site of the first
political caucus of the 2000 campaign, and New Hampshire, which
will hold the first primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words that I heard were, `Don't go away. Don't give it up.
This just isn't your time,''' he said. ``I think you have to be
mature enough in politics and in life to able to accept some
disappointment,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, 47, also said that he would not seek reelection to
Congress after his ninth term expires in 18 months. ``There does
come a time when you know it's time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Although technically Kasich never officially became a candidate
for the nomination, he is the second Republican to drop out of a
crowded field for the Republican nomination. On Tuesday, New
Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith announced he was leaving the party and
running for president as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bush, those remaining as either announced
candidates or semi-declared candidates include Elizabeth Dole,
former cabinet secretary and head of the Red Cross; Gary Bauer,
conservative activist; Pat Buchanan, conservative commentator;
publishing magnate Steve Forbes; former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander; Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Bush praised Kasich, who has espoused fiscal conservatism as
chairman of the House Budget Committee and a key player in efforts
to balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``John can connect with a lot of folks around the country that
are looking for a different campaign and a different kind of
government,'' Bush said. ``He's going to fit perfectly on my
team,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also attended a $1,000-a-plate fundraising luncheon in
suburban McLean, Va., of high-tech executives and a dinner in
Baltimore. The events were expected to gross a total of about
$650,000.

CRACKER BARREL RESTAURANTS ARE A TRAVELER'S TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (bl) 
 By JASON HALL   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Logs crackle in the stone fireplace, and two
boys jaw over a game of checkers on the porch. A lady in an apron
hustles along, her hands full with a pitcher of sweet tea and a
steaming plate of chicken 'n dumplings and country ham.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome home?
</P>
<P>
   No, welcome to one of nearly 400 restaurants just off interstate
highway exits all over the country _ in places like Milford, Conn.,
and Yuma, Ariz. Welcome to Cracker Barrel Old Country Stores, one
of America's favorite restaurant chains and certainly one of the
country's most old-fashioned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   While CEOs and talking heads from all walks of business race to
be the first to squawk about Y2K compliance and e-commerce
initiatives, Cracker Barrel managers and employees seem content to
fret about whether peppermint sticks belong on the top shelf or the
bottom shelf and if $8.49 is just too much to pay for a country
fried steak dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Evins, Cracker Barrel's co-founder, president and CEO,
opened his first restaurant 30 years ago just off Interstate 40 in
rural Wilson County, Tenn., on the outskirts of the town of
Lebanon. That first restaurant is now a Citgo gas station, but in
1999 there are 385 Cracker Barrel Old Country Stores coast to
coast, and they pulled in $1.32 billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem superb on the surface, but it's how Evins got
there that sets Cracker Barrel apart. Since that first day in 1969,
Cracker Barrel hasn't changed the type of food it serves or its
style of service.
</P>
<P>
   All the restaurants are company owned, with no franchisees. All
the restaurants are physically the same as well _ wide front
porches covered with enough rocking chairs to scare even the
bravest long-tailed cat; gift stores offering antiques, candy and
crafts, dining rooms with the familiar fireplace, checker board and
infuriating peg game on every table.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurants are at or near interstate exits, continuing
Evins' vision of Cracker Barrel as a prime eating spot for
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokeswoman Julie Davis said consistency and an
unwillingness to change has served the company well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think that we have succeeded in maintaining the old
country store atmosphere _ and our focus on guests and hospitality
_ as we have grown,'' she said. ``We will stick to a core vision.
There will always be a tweak here, a tweak there, but you're not
going to see any radical changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistency of service brought consistency of results for the
chain, which is still headquartered in Lebanon. After going public
in 1981, Cracker Barrel became a favorite of Wall Street for its
steady results and a lack of true competition for its niche market.
</P>
<P>
   But restaurants keep popping up. As Cracker Barrel sees more
competition, its customers see more choices. In the most recent
quarter, the chain's holding company, CBRL Group Inc., recorded its
second straight quarterly decline of earnings per share, to 25
cents from 39 cents a year ago. Wall Street is not as favorable as
it once was, particularly since same-store sales have fallen for
four consecutive quarters, despite the fact that the restaurant
industry overall is on an upswing.
</P>
<P>
   Cracker Barrel has made recent changes _ cutting prices here and
there, adding more staff per shift _ that have a negative effect on
short-term bottom line but may pay dividends in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Customers treat Cracker Barrell well in industry surveys. It was
named best restaurant chain by tour operators in Destinations
magazine from 1994 to 1998, and this year Restaurants &AMP;
Institutions named it the best family dining chain for the ninth
year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't all been grits and gravy for the restaurant chain
that relies heavily on its country charm image. In 1991, the
company touched off nationwide protests by adopting a policy
banning homosexuals from working at its restaurants. Public outrage
caused the restaurant to rescind the policy within the year, but
the damage was done, said David Smith, spokesman for Human Rights
Campaign, a Washington, D.C.-based gay rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that although discrimination against gays still
occurs in workplaces all over the country, Cracker Barrel was
unique in the overtness of its stand. ``I think that the company
has still made no effort whatsoever to erase that image,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that in fact, the company has done something. Though
the company's employment policy does not specifically mention
homosexuals, it does say that Cracker Barrel does ``not tolerate
discrimination of any kind toward any individual or group.''
</P>
<P>
   The flap generated headlines but did not seemed to affect the
company's growth. Last year, the CBRL Group holding company was
formed when Cracker Barrel bought the Logan's Roadhouse restaurant
chain, which includes about 50 stores.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 stores have been added since July 1996, with
another 40 expected this year. Two restaurants have been built away
from interstates, but that concept is still in the testing phase,
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The lion's share of the company's expansion will take place
outside the company's core market, which is the Southeast. Opening
restaurants in the Northeast or Southwest presents a unique
problem, Davis admits: When your specialty is scrumptious Southern
cooking, how do you educate a public that couldn't tell the
difference between a grit and a dumpling?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a story I've heard of a man from the Northeast who
came into the Cracker Barrel for breakfast one day. He asked the
waitress what she recommended, and she told him that grits were
excellent topped with gravy or sugar. He said, `Yeah, I'll try a
grit. Bring me one.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She had to inform him that it would be hard to eat just one
grit.''

ARGENTINE STOCKS REACT TURBULENTLY TO CANDIDATES' COMMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Argentina)  (js) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Ever since Gen. Juan Domingo Peron
remade Argentine political campaigns in the 1940s and 1950s, the
tough talk has been as traditional as drinking gourds of mate tea
with the masses. Presidential candidates question why the country
should repay its international debt. They offer populist rhetoric
challenging world capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Then they govern more moderately once they take office.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson lost on investors in recent days, say government
economists, when anti-capitalist comments by the two leading
presidential candidates sent the main stock index on a
roller-coaster ride. The market lost 4 percent of its value last
week, and then on Monday suffered an 8 percent drop before
rebounding back about 5 percent total on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's tumble was caused at least in part by a comment from
Buenos Aires Gov. Eduardo Duhalde, the candidate of the ruling
Justicialist Party, which investors interpreted as provocative and
reckless. In a radio interview, Duhalde said he intended to discuss
with Pope John Paul II the possibility of a worldwide one-year
suspension of debt servicing for nations in economic trouble like
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``What countries like ours should ask for,'' Duhalde said, ``is
not a pardon for part of the debt but a breathing period.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of disturbing economic fundamentals behind
the turbulence in the Buenos Aires exchange, which has sent
shudders through emerging markets from Brazil to Poland. They
include a growing government deficit, a failing public pension
agency, falling exports and climbing unemployment. Moreover,
President Carlos Saul Menem is looking like an increasingly weak
lame duck, especially after capitulating to truck drivers on strike
last week who demanded an easing of vehicle taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Duhalde's comment on debt relief and the pope was only the
latest in a series of campaign statements by Duhalde and his
opponent, Buenos Aires Mayor Fernando de la Rua, that have irked
Argentine business executives as well as government economists. The
winner of the October election is to take power in December.
</P>
<P>
   At a June 25 news conference, Duhalde said ``debt payments are
bleeding us.'' He added that with ``current levels of
debt-servicing there will be no possibility of recovery for our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly De la Rua, candidate of the Alianza opposition
coalition, offered a sweeping critique of the new global economy
three weeks ago in a speech before a convention of the Socialist
International held in Buenos Aires. ``The opening has been a one
way street,'' he said, ``in a process of privatizations that has
badly served the consumer, created monopolies and created an
excessive dependency on the whims of international markets.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later De la Rua, who has a small lead in the polls,
attempted to calm investors at a conference for Argentine bankers
by pledging that he would not take Argentina off its free-market
path or touch the government policy of pegging the value of the
peso to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Duhalde attempted to soothe investors on Tuesday by
telling reporters that his previous statements had been
misinterpreted. ``We're not going to do anything crazy,'' he said,
adding that he did not intend to seek a debt pardon nor even a
year's grace.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Duhalde retained a tone of criticism toward
international business. ``The power of the state should not be in
the hands of investors,'' he said. He added: ``We defend our
interests. The people at the stock exchange defend investors, we
defend the debtors.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Wall Street analysts have not liked the increasingly
leftist tone of the political campaign, few believe it means a
future Argentine government will significantly shift economic
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street and Argentine analysts say the current campaign
rhetoric reminds them of Menem's statements during the 1989
campaign in which he promised to initiate a costly government
employment program and suggested that Argentina should default on
its debt. Once elected, Menem stunned the country and enthralled
international investors by starting a sweeping privatization
program that slashed the government bureaucracy and tied the peso
to the dollar. Those moves ended a long period of hyperinflation
and spurred years of rising Argentine stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidates' comments are political posturing and should
not be taken seriously,'' said Jorge O. Mariscal, Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co.'s chief investment strategist for Latin America. ``If Argentina
were not in the shape it is they would not matter. Unfortunately
Argentina is not in good shape today.''
</P>
<P>
   A Goldman Sachs report this week predicted that Argentine stocks
would continue to slump for months because of low agricultural
commodity prices as well as competitive problems attributed to the
high value of the Argentine peso relative to the currencies of
neighboring Brazil and Chile. Fears of rising interest rates in the
United States were also hurting stock prices, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, the presidential campaign has been a lackluster
affair with neither candidate offering anything even approaching a
coherent economic plan. But in the last couple of days, the
candidates have been making hints about what their tax policies
will be.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, De la Rua said he could not promise that he would
cut taxes, saying such a pledge would only encourage taxpayers to
cheat on their returns this year. ``There will be no tax
amnesties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Duhalde said Wednesday that he would seek to cut
the country's 21 percent value added tax, though he would not
specify by how much. And in a renewed attempt to reassure
investors, he told reporters, ``No serious country in the world
would take a unilateral decision on its foreign debt.''

EUROPEAN UNION TO END BAN ON EXPORTS OF BRITISH BEEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The European Union executive commission announced
Wednesday that its worldwide ban on British beef exports caused by
the outbreak of mad cow disease was ending and that shipments could
resume on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said scientists and
veterinary experts had certified that Britain had taken the
necessary steps to rid its meat of the deadly infection which had
led to the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wouldn't be convinced about that, then I would not vote
in favor to lift the ban,'' Fischler said in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The blockade started in March 1996, after the British government
had confirmed that people who ate beef tainted with bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, could develop a
variant of the fatal Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which wastes away
the human brain.
</P>
<P>
   Forty people, all but one in Britain, are known to have died
from the disease. Even though no new cases should occur, scientists
say the death toll may rise, because the disease has a long
gestation period. The number of cases in Britain has fallen, to
1,000 a year from 37,000 in 1992 at the height of the epidemic.
Experts say they expect the disease to disappear completely by
2002.
</P>
<P>
   The news was greeted with relief in Britain, where the
three-year embargo has cost the farming industry $2.4 billion,
brought on bankruptcies and shutdowns, devastated farm communities
and even caused suicides. The crisis destroyed all confidence in
the safety of a signature product of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that it will take time to rebuild British beef's
reputation and recapture its lost markets, Ben Gill, president of
the National Farmers' Union, hailed the end of the ban not as a
final victory but as ``the beginning of the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture officials said that there was no hope of returning
to the pre-embargo annual export level of $930 million soon, but
that they would focus early efforts on traditional importers of
British beef like Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands and South
Africa. Exporters hope to turn the three-year trial to their
advantage by arguing that with all the new safeguards now in place,
British beef is the safest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the lifting of the ban, only deboned beef
from cattle born after Aug. 1, 1996, the date when a prohibition on
feeding meat and bonemeal to animals became fully effective, will
be approved for export.
</P>
<P>
   European Union inspectors have visited Britain in recent months
to approve slaughterhouse standards and to check that computer
databases are prepared to track herds. The British have tightened
feed controls, raised standards of hygiene in slaughterhouses and
installed computer tracking of animals. Each cow will effectively
have an individual passport from birth until slaughter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, more than 4.3 million of the country's estimated 11 million
cattle were destroyed, mostly because they were old enough to
conceivably harbor the disease agent. A total of 174,857 British
cows were confirmed as infected.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the European Union agreed to a partial lifting of the
ban to allow exports from Northern Ireland of cattle certified to
be free of mad cow disease. But the province has found it difficult
to regain the foothold that it once had abroad. Northern Ireland
was singled out for favorable treatment, because the province had
the most advanced computer monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ban, Northern Ireland relied on sales outside the
province for 80 percent of its annual production and exported half
its finished beef in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic broke out in 1986, when cows began dying from the
neurodegenerative condition in which the brain is riddled with
holes like a sponge. The beasts underwent behavioral changes and
suffered fits of staggering, symptoms that led to the mad cow name.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the infection was traced from the practice,
outlawed in 1988, of supplementing cattle feed with sheep offal
that might have been contaminated with scrapie, a related brain
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic became a consumer crisis in 1996 with the shocking
discovery that the disease could in effect be transmitted to
humans, causing the fatal Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
   The government, then under Prime Minister John Major, bitterly
protested the decision in Brussels to shut down British beef
shipments worldwide, and at one point Britain refused all
cooperation with the European Union in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Britain complained that the European officials were exceeding
their reach in extending the prohibition beyond the continent and
making it global. But the European Court of Justice ruled they had
the power to do so. The move was justified, the judges reasoned,
because British beef could otherwise be channeled to the continent
in a roundabout backdoor way from third countries elsewhere that
had bought it and then traded it on to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Tony Blair that came to power
in May 1997 set about trying to meet the conditions set by the
European Union for ending the ban and even added its own
restrictions in December 1997, when it banned the sale of all beef
on the bone from animals more than 6 months old.
</P>
<P>
   That decision, which angered the cattlemen and brought loud
protests from the public, was prompted by new evidence that the
disease could be transmitted to humans through the spinal nerve
ganglia and bone marrow of cattle.

   WASHINGTON _ The nation's largest cities are falling behind in
the race to fix computers before the 2000 date change, with some
saying that even vital services such as water treatment and
telecommunications won't be ready until the final days of the year,
according to a new congressional study.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study being released Thursday by the General
Accounting Office, Boston is the only one of the nation's 21 most
populous cities claiming to be fully prepared to face the ``Y2K
bug.'' That software glitch will cause many older computers to
misread dates ending in ``00,'' possibly causing them to
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21 cities, 10 said they would be Y2K-ready by Sept. 30,
and the rest between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   While most cities said they have fixed the computers that
control transportation and telecommunications systems, few have
finished upgrading systems that run water treatment, public
buildings and emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   Leaked copies of the report by the GAO, the auditing arm of
Congress, were posted Wednesday on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, the Senate's special Year 2000 Committee will hold
a hearing to discuss the report and gather other information on how
state and local governments are preparing for the date change.
</P>
<P>
   GAO researchers interviewed city officials between June 28 and
July 9 to obtain information about the status of Y2K repairs and to
request supporting documentation.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 cities that reported that they don't expect to be ready
until the last quarter of the year were Los Angeles; Chicago;
Phoenix; San Antonio; Detroit; San Francisco; Baltimore; Columbus,
Ohio; El Paso, Texas, and Washington. While most of those said
they'd be ready by November, Baltimore and El Paso said they
wouldn't be prepared until December.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the nation's capital told the GAO they expected to
be ready by the end of November, but at the moment, Washington is
not Y2K-compliant in the following areas: electric power,
telecommunications, city services and public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The cities expecting to complete their repairs by Oct. 1 were:
New York, Houston, Philadelphia, San Diego, Dallas, San Jose,
Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Memphis and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's Year 2000 Committee, headed by Sens. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah, and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., has been gathering
data for two years and is spurring public officials to work faster
on Y2K problems. While federal agencies are expected to be ready
for the date change, Y2K experts fear that state and local
organizations have waited too long to avert numerous problems.
</P>
<P>
   A recent National League of Cities survey of 400 cities found
that only two-thirds of the cities have made contingency plans to
deal with Y2K-related emergencies.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Indian officials said Wednesday that the
withdrawal of Pakistani-backed forces from an Indian-controlled
area of Kashmir was on schedule to be finished by the deadline on
Friday, but they expressed outrage at what they described as a
Pakistani-sponsored act of terrorism that took place on Tuesday in
the Kashmir valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian air force has conducted sorties over the Kargil
sector of Kashmir, the scene of fierce fighting over the last two
months, and found no sign of the men who had infiltrated from
Pakistani-held Kashmir and occupied peaks overlooking a highway
that serves as a lifeline to the Indian military, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   India says the men were Pakistani soldiers on a carefully
plotted misadventure, while Pakistan maintains that they were
Islamic guerrillas who are pulling out because Pakistan's prime
minister, Nawaz Sharif, asked them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who helped broker Sharif's call for a
withdrawal, has called on India and Pakistan to resume talks once
the pullout is complete, and both sides have reaffirmed the
sanctity of the ``line of control,'' which divides Indian- and
Pakistani-administered areas of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   But Indian officials said Pakistan would have to stop fomenting
violence against India by Islamic militants in Kashmir before talks
could proceed. ``It's obvious that for any composite dialogue to
succeed, this kind of cross-border terrorism has to stop,'' said
Raminder Singh Jassal, a spokesman for India's External Affairs
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   India described a guerrilla attack on Tuesday on a paramilitary
camp north of Srinagar, which left four people dead, as an example
of ``Pakistan's brazen and continuing sponsorship of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan says it gives the militants, whom it describes as
Kashmiri freedom fighters battling Indian rule, only moral and
diplomatic support, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   After killing four people, the two or three militants who burst
into the Border Security Force camp took a dozen hostages,
including five children. Commandos from India's National Security
Guard rescued all the hostages Wednesday morning, said Mohammed Zia
Ullah, a spokesman for the Border Security Force.
</P>
<P>
   The commandos later fired a rocket into the building where one
or two militants were believed to be hiding, he said, and part of
the building caught fire and collapsed. A search party found one
body, an AK-47 and eight grenades, Zia Ullah added.

HOUSE BACKS AWAY FROM CUTTING NEA FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARIA RECIO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a surprising break in the cultural wars, the
House refused Wednesday to make further cuts in the National
Endowment for the Arts and even came close to increasing funding
for the arts agency.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial agency, which the House voted to fund in 2000
at its current level of $98 million, has been a favorite target of
conservatives for more than 10 years. But missing from Wednesday's
debate was the often-bitter rancor of years past, when the NEA was
the poster child of permissiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The House defeated by 124-300 an amendment to cut the NEA budget
by $2.1 million in the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. The
agency's funding is part of a larger $14 billion bill that funds
the Interior Department and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   And the chamber narrowly voted 207-217 against increasing the
funding for the NEA and its sister agency, the National Endowment
for the Humanities, by $10 million each. Many members were leery of
taking the $20 million from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to fund
the agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Such largely supportive votes would have been unthinkable as
recently as last year, when the House leadership tried to fund the
agency at zero.
</P>
<P>
   NEA chairman Bill Ivey, credited with making the agency more
inclusive, said: ``The additional $10 million would have allowed
the endowment to serve a greater number of communities across the
country. While disappointed in the outcome, I am heartened by the
closeness of the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, who has led the fight
to eliminate the NEA, set the tone earlier in the week in a meeting
with reporters. Noting that ``I've been in these wars since 1985,''
Armey went on to praise Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, chairman of the
subcommittee that funds the agency, for having ``done a great deal
to provide reform and accountability to the NEA. I think that needs
to be appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Under fire and in danger of extinction, the agency carried out a
series of reforms and checks on grants. Conservatives, galvanized
by NEA support for such controversial artists as Robert
Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano, demanded elimination of the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the newly elected Republican majority engineered a 40
percent cut in the agency's funding and termination of most
individual grants in its fiscal 1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will soon consider a similar funding bill that funds
the NEA at $99 million.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Angry words launch themselves from deep inside Bernie
Williams, his emotional silos opening and unleashing responses
aimed to hurt an antagonist, the way Williams hurts when someone
else fires slashing words at him. He never fires the first shot _
his parents weaned him of this instinct long ago, constantly
reminding him that he needed to be respectful of others.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams wants to retaliate. Before angry words escape his
mouth, however, they lodge in his throat. They are choked off. He
says ... nothing. Williams tries to say something vicious, he needs
to say something nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he will stare softly and pause for five seconds or
maybe 10, and sometimes, in his velvet voice, Williams will spit
out his best retort: ``I can't believe you said that, man.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a Bernie Williams explosion. This is his most blistering
counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
   There is great praise aimed Williams' way, too. After winning
last year's American League batting title, he is batting .336 with
13 home runs and 52 runs batted in this season, and he was one of
three Yankees who participated in Tuesday's All-Star Game. While
there is a passive exterior that his teammates see in the
clubhouse, they all recognize the signs of that emotion burning
within him. But rarely do those translate in his responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's sickening,'' Williams said about his own
reticence. ``Sometimes you really want to hurt people with what you
say, but it's always a burden on your mind. Yeah, it's terrible,
man. It hurts to not be able to express the feelings the way you
want to feel them. You don't want to finesse them and make them
come out in a civilized way. You just want to go out there and
really say what you feel _ it's something I've got to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams paused, his eyes questioning. ``Do you ever feel that
way?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Williams is now the highest paid player in franchise history
after signing a seven-year, $87.5 million contract last November,
following a pivotal face-to-face meeting with club owner George
Steinbrenner, in which Williams spoke his mind.
</P>
<P>
   All around the country, fans berate him in center field, where
he is out in the open. Even in the sanctum of a baseball clubhouse,
Williams is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates routinely ride each other, naturally picking out the
most prominent bullseye in another's personality. Paul O'Neill,
their right fielder, plays in a rage, and he prefers that nobody
notice how he flips his bats or punches water coolers or smashes
his helmets to the ground; teammates choose to make light of this.
Derek Jeter is embarrassed by teen-agers cooing his name, so his
colleagues sometimes do their best 14-year-old female impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Williams came to the big leagues in 1991 as a natural target,
bespectacled, awkward socially, so quiet and introverted. Mel Hall,
the former Yankees' outfielder, berated him constantly, to the
point where club officials thought Williams would be driven to
tears and, at the least, be less effective as a player. Gene
Michael, then the general manager, told Hall he would be traded or
released if he didn't leave Williams alone; Michael asked Hall why
he treated Williams so badly, and Hall never really did have a good
explanation, or the simplest explanation: Williams was defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   The teasing now generally is good-natured, most of the
practitioners have decent intentions. For players on the fringe of
the Yankees, like Hideki Irabu and Ramiro Mendoza, being ribbed
draws them closer, demonstrating they are part of the fraternity;
it would be far worse to be ignored completely. Tim Raines, the
veteran outfielder who left the Yankees to sign with Oakland after
last season, possesses such a positive personality that even
Williams laughed when Raines taunted him.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is never fully comfortable with the nettling, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm think I'm one of the guys,'' he said, ``but I'm not one of
the big guys, always ragging about people and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts me to rag on people,'' he said. ``I don't like to rag
on people, because I don't want them ragging on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is handsome, his brown skin taut over cheekbones
rounded like the backs of tablespoons, his brows framing gentle
eyes. He wears thin wire glasses that could be crushed with one
hand.
</P>
<P>
   He has never felt completely at ease with others, never revealed
his feelings easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have,'' said Williams, ``and to tell you the truth, I
don't think I ever will.''

</P>
<P>
   At an early age, growing up in Puerto Rico, he became convinced
he was very different. Williams was larger than his peers,
long-legged, quiet and introspective, and the growing sense that he
was different than other kids probably increased his reticence. ``I
was always afraid of rejection,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   His father disliked the idea of being the center of attention or
speaking his mind in front of strangers, and he avoided gatherings
or parties. Williams would go out with friends, and after an hour
or two, the family station wagon would appear: Time to go home.
``He wanted to make sure we wouldn't get into any trouble,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   His parents insisted he treat others the way he wanted to be
treated, and Williams knew how he wanted to be treated: He wanted
to be left alone, he wanted others to treat him respectfully and
kindly.
</P>
<P>
   He learned to play the Spanish guitar, strumming folk songs on
balcony at his parents' home, alone.
</P>
<P>
   He still plays guitar, in his corner locker at Yankee Stadium,
when the team flies from city to city, sometimes turned away from
others. He can be creative playing the guitar, he can be emotional,
and yet never really reveal himself. ``I think it's a way for him
to share his thoughts,'' said Yankees catcher Joe Girardi,
``without anybody really knowing what they mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates sometimes will surround Williams when he plays, and
with his head down, concentrating, he is the center of attention
and entirely at ease. Sometimes they listen, and sometimes they
will try to sing along; Raines and Jeter screeched through ``Purple
Rain'' last season.
</P>
<P>
   Williams never seems to sing, he just plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're struggling, and you just want to disappear for
awhile, just pick up the guitar and it does the trick for you,''
Williams said. ``If you feel fine, and you think you've got some
time to kill, you pick up the guitar and that can do it for you. If
you're just trying to show off _ I mean, you can use it in so many
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can communicate with people.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. ``Or sometimes, they say, `Can you just turn it
down?'''
</P>
<P>
   His closest friend in baseball, Atlanta outfielder Gerald
Williams, believes that Williams finds peace in playing the guitar,
a harmonious quid pro quo. ``He connects,'' said Gerald Williams,
who came up in the Yankee system. ``He gets in return exactly what
he gives.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not the same with people? ``Not at all,'' his friend
said, laughing softly. ``People are not that consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill plays the drums, and when he and Williams get together
with their instruments, they will try different styles, different
songs. Ultimately, O'Neill said, Williams always ends up playing
the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Williams began emerging as a major leaguer in 1995, batting .307
that summer, hitting 29 home runs and driving in 102 runs the next
year, when the Yankees won a World Series for the first time in 18
years. Each winter, however, Williams and his agent, Scott Boras,
scrapped with the Yankees over the next contract. Boras wanted his
client paid like an front-line star, but it became apparent that
many Yankees' officials did not believe Williams fit that
description.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he has spectacular range in center field, they argued
internally, but he often misreads the trajectory of line drives hit
in the outfield gaps. They complained how opposing baserunners
exploited Williams' poor throwing arm. His exceptional speed
sometimes is offset by a penchant for mistakes, they said. After
Bob Watson, the Yankees' former general manager, offered Williams a
four-year, $24 million contract in 1996, Watson said Williams was
``a good player, but not a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams rejected a five-year, $37.5 million early in 1998, and
Watson said, ``This is star money for a non-star player.'' The
Yankees nearly traded Williams for Larry Walker four years ago, and
Watson arranged a deal with Detroit in November 1997, Williams for
two pitching prospects, before backing out. For someone afraid of
rejection, someone who wanted others to respect him as he respected
them, the ebb and flow of negotiations stung Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it hurt,'' said David Cone, the Yankees' pitcher.
``I'm sure all the contract squabbles hurt, regardless of what any
ballplayer says. There's a need to feel wanted, a need for some
sort of validation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>

</P>
<P>
   During the World Series last fall, and just before he became a
free agent, Williams referred to the poor history between him and
the Yankees' officials, and told reporters he would give the team
as much opportunity as any other to sign him. Some in the
organization viewed this as tantamount to announcing his departure.
</P>
<P>
   When Don Mattingly retired just before the 1996 season, Williams
inherited his corner locker in the Yankees' clubhouse, , a locker
that is perhaps 50 percent larger than the others. Williams can lie
on his back within its confines, legs outstretched, nobody knowing
he is there, a place to escape. He's in his own cage, his own
world, Jorge Posada said of Williams, speaking figuratively. His
teammates came to understand his need for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   While he wasn't ready to bare his soul to everybody in the
clubhouse, Williams nonetheless developed a comfort zone with the
Yankees by the `96 season. He could jam with O'Neill, or talk to
Cone about politics, or laugh with Raines, and smile and offer some
wry witticism to Jeter or Tino Martinez. He will never initiate
conversation, Cone said, but you can approach him with a topic that
interests him ``and he'll surprise you.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams fit in perfectly, and the team fit around him
perfectly, as well. Williams bats cleanup for the Yankees, between
O'Neill and Tino Martinez, and the great depth of the lineup frees
him of the responsibility of hitting home runs. He doesn't have to
be a star, with Jeter drawing swoons. He isn't expected to lead
vocally. ``All we ask of him,'' said Mark Newman, vice president of
player development and scouting, ``is that he be the best Bernie
Williams he can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams thought about all this, after the Boston offered a
seven-year, $91.5 million deal last Nov. 23, after the Yankees had
won the World Series and a record 125 games.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, the negotiations with the Yankees had gone
nowhere, in Williams' eyes. At the Yankee victory parade, Williams
responded to the pleas of fans to stay by motioning to Steinbrenner
and saying, ``You've got to talk to this guy here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees' offer of five-year, $60 million contract was
far less than Boston's.
</P>
<P>
   Williams met and really liked Jimy Williams, the Red Sox
manager, but there was something strange about the idea of signing
with Boston. They had been rivals all those years, and of course,
if Bernie Williams went to the Red Sox, he would replace Mo Vaughn
in the lineup, a popular star who had just departed after a
disagreement with the team's front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have been a situation I could've gotten used to
right away,'' said Williams. ``It would've been a challenge to play
there, perhaps being more of a vocal guy, more of a leader, being a
guy everybody would've looked up to, being a leader in pressure
situations. That probably would've been me and Nomar'' _ Nomar
Garciaparra, the Boston shortstop. ``It would've been a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams wanted to play for the Yankees, but he would never sign
for a bargain rate, certainly not after all that had been said. He
wanted the Yankees to treat him as he felt he had treated them; he
wanted the Yankees to pay him competitively, and he wanted
validation from the organization, from Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Boras arranged a meeting with Steinbrenner late in the afternoon
of Nov. 24. ``This is the time to tell them how you feel,'' Boras
told his client.
</P>
<P>
   When Bernie speaks with others, his friend, Gerald Williams,
said, ``He tries to slow everything down, so he can interpret
everything properly, and never lets emotion overtake him in any
given situation. He tries to think as rationally as possible,
because I think with many individuals, they tend to use emotion,
rather than think rationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams intended to speak as clearly and rationally as
possible to Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Two fans hang from the ceiling in the square conference room at
the Yankees' minor-league complex in Tampa, Fla. The walls are
covered in Yankees' colors, blue on the bottom half and off-white
on top, adorned with framed pictures of Yankees' players. A 14-foot
oblong table stands in the center of the floor. For this meeting,
Steinbrenner sat at one end when he met with Williams; Williams sat
directly to his right, with Boras, Newman and General Manager Brian
Cashman also perched in high-back gray chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees weren't even sure if Williams wanted to re-sign. He
had been so aloof during the post-season, at a time when he and his
wife, Waleska, dealt with a personal problem he has declined to
discuss. The Yankees' officials wondered if the issue would prevent
him from playing in New York again; Boras had assured them Williams
wanted to come back.
</P>
<P>
   But it was left to Williams to convince Steinbrenner, to express
his feelings; it was, he says now, one of the best moments of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Williams talked about how much it meant to him to play for the
Yankees, about the team's tradition, and in his even tone, he
recited the offers he had received to Steinbrenner - the Boston
proposal, another from the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood this was a young man who truly wanted to remain a
Yankee,'' Steinbrenner said afterward, ``and he didn't like the
idea of going to another team.''
</P>
<P>
   He responded to Williams affectionately, saying he'd always
liked Williams, and always consider him a Yankee. As the meeting
broke up, the Yankees' owner told Williams, ``Bernie, you came
here, you talked to me, and I really have to think about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras walked into the room believing the Yankees would not
increase their offer. ``But when George said that, I felt there was
a chance,'' Boras recalled. ``Bernie had never heard those things
from George - his entire relationship with him, ever since he was a
young kid, George wouldn't even know his name. George wouldn't say
anything to him. This was the first time the Yankees' owner had
accredited him with the type of affection and affirmation that he
had always wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees still were intent on spending about $60 million
for their cleanup hitter. Late on the night of Nov. 24, as Williams
waited anxiously to hear from Steinbrenner, the Yankees offered
moody slugger Albert Belle a five-year, $60 million contract; Joe
Torre, the Yankees' manager, lobbied hard to get Belle and his
thunderous bat.
</P>
<P>
   As Williams boarded a flight to Puerto Rico the next morning,
after a nearly sleepless night, he had come to realize his days
with the Yankees likely were over, that he probably would agree to
a contract with Boston that day. Williams spoke to Newman on the
phone, and Newman heard the anxiousness in his voice. ``I was
growing frustrated,'' Williams remembered, ``because nothing was
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Waleska Williams said later, ``I saw the pain in his eyes when
he came back. That's the saddest I've seen this man in eight
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman called Belle at about 11 a.m. on the morning of Nov. 24,
and Belle indicated that he was ready to sign with the Yankees, so
long as the deal was restructed: He wanted four years for $52
million, or $13 million per year, rather than a $12 million salary
over five years. Cashman said he was sure that would be fine, that
he needed to call Steinbrenner formal approval.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes passed, and Cashman called back Belle's agent
and relayed word Steinbrenner approved the deal. The agent
hesitated. Albert has changed his mind, he told Cashman, and later,
the agent, Arn Tellem, told Cashman that Belle simply was leery of
the New York media, and he had decided to sign with Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m. on Nov. 25, this was the situation: The rival Orioles
were going to get Belle, and if the Yankees didn't increase their
offer, Williams would sign with Boston, a team Steinbrenner hates
to lose to. With Williams' words from the day before in the back of
his mind, Steinbrenner called Boras and, in 20 minutes, they
negotiated the $87.5 million deal. Boras phoned Williams to brief
him. ``This is it, man!'' Williams shouted. ``Yeah, yeah, yeah!''
</P>
<P>
   Boras called again later that night, past midnight, and Waleska
Williams told the agent her husband was in another room, with his
guitar, alone and happy, probably playing the blues.  &QL;

   TEHRAN, Iran _ After six days of nationwide pro-democracy
protests that deteriorated into violent rioting, massive crowds
staged counter-demonstrations Wednesday in at least two dozen
cities and towns throughout the country, heeding the official call
to praise the Islamic Republic and condemn its enemies,
particularly the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Calm returned to the capital city of Tehran as residents obeyed
official warnings that the government would use all necessary means
to restore order. There were no signs of pro-democracy
demonstrators or baton-wielding vigilantes, no smell of tear gas or
bonfire smoke, no sound of gunfire or ambulance sirens.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face underscored both the fluid nature of Iranian
politics and the ability of Iran's ruling clerics to restore order
by proclaiming a national crisis.
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami made no public appearances Wednesday
and the students who were angry over delays in his program of
democratic reforms boycotted the day's marches.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the streets belonged to the backers of Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the country's conservative ``supreme leader.'' Chants of
``Death to America'' replaced ``Death to dictators'' over
loudspeakers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, normalcy did not return. Tehran's vast bazaar, the heart
of the capital's commercial center with its thousands of shops and
miles of passages, was closed for a second day so that employees
could march, as were hundreds of shops on many of the main
thoroughfares.
</P>
<P>
   The government blocked all mobile telephone communication in
Tehran in an effort to prevent speedy conversations among students,
journalists and would-be saboteurs, officials said. Even the
country's highest-ranking officials were left without their mobile
phones, as ubiquitous among the clerical ruling class as prayer
beads. An official in the president's office said that the system
would not be operational for two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest erupted last Thursday, after students protested the
passage of tough press laws and the closure of a popular
left-leaning newspaper. The protesters repeatedly praised Khatami
and called for faster progress toward the cultural and democratic
freedoms he has promised, but they did not suggest changing the
Islamic foundation of government.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the regime's determination to staunch the worst
unrest since Iran's 1979 revolution, Khamenei gave a green light to
paramilitary Islamic volunteers, known as the baseeji, to terrorize
and crush the country's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Baseej children must reserve the necessary readiness and be
present at any scene where they are needed to intimidate and crush
the base enemies,'' Khamenei said in a message to the nation that
was read out at rallies across the country. ``It has been two days
now that a group of bandits, aided by certain bankrupt political
grouplets, and with the support and encouragement of foreign
enemies, have engaged in destroying public property throughout
Tehran, creating havoc and intimidating the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Rouhani, a cleric who is the secretary of the Supreme
National Security Council, Iran's top security body, warned that
protesters and rioters under arrest would be tried and punished as
``enemies of the state'' and ``corrupt of the earth,'' crimes that
are punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our revolution needs a thorough cleanup and this will help
advance the cause of the regime and the revolution,'' Rouhani told
a massive crowd gathered at Tehran University, which was also the
scene of six days of student demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Rouhani also warned that the Islamic system would not tolerate
any challenge to the principle of ``velayat-e faghih,'' which,
under the Iranian Constitution, gives ultimate authority to one
clerical ``supreme leader'' for life. ``The velayat is the symbol
of the nation's might. Insulting the velayat is insulting the
nation and all Moslems,'' Rouhani said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Iran's revolution, demonstrators had
chanted slogans against Khamenei, who controls the country's
security and intelligence forces, the Armed Forces and the
judiciary, as well as radio and television. He therefore wields
much more power than Khatami, the country's popularly-elected
president. Some demonstrators even called for Khamenei to resign.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the ayatollah's forces reigned.
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran, dozens of buses brought in students, workers,
disabled war veterans, old people, children and villagers for a
rally that included speech after speech praising Khamenei and
denouncing the ``hidden hands'' of the United States, Israel and
traitors for causing the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The march and the rally that followed resembled thousands of
similar gatherings that have commemorated important anniversaries
over the course of the revolution. As in those gatherings, the
participants were primarily from the lower classes, the
``oppressed'' as they are called.
</P>
<P>
   No one dared to challenge Wednesday's speakers or the chanting
crowd. Students at Tehran University who led the initial, peaceful
protests boycotted Wednesday's march and distanced themselves from
rioting on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But along the fringes of the counter-demonstration, a quiet
chorus of dissent criticized Wednesday's spectacle. ``Bad, bad,
bad, bad,'' said one women in her sixties, who could clearly be
identified as secular and middle class by her colorful head scarf
and the bits of bleached blond hair that it revealed. ``Write about
it when this crowd sets fire to the whole city!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Employees in many government and private offices were ordered to
participate in the demonstration; one Army soldier said that his
unit was dismissed Wednesday so that it could march in civilian
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Many Tehran residents did not show up for work, particularly in
the downtown area around the university. That meant that the
usually slow-moving, fume-filled rush-hour traffic flowed with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's state-controlled television broadcast extensive footage
of the demonstrations from two dozen cities and towns including
major urban centers like Tehran and Isfahan and small, remote
places like Yassouj and Naghdeh. All the footage showed huge crowds
of bearded men and black-veiled women punching the air with their
fists and chanting slogans of praise for Khamenei and condemnation
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Television gave the impression that the crowds were massive and
indeed they were. But numbers are relative, and the crowd in Tehran
at least was smaller than others, including the one that gathered
at the same place for Khatami in May 1998 on the first anniversary
of his election. Certainly there was no comparison to the crowds of
more than a million people that came to the streets over and over
during the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Television did not show footage of the people who left the rally
long before it ended or the ice-cream-licking marchers who
preferred window-shopping to chanting.
</P>
<P>
   In the student-led demonstrations of the last few days, there
were plenty of posters of Khatami and none of Khamenei. On
Wednesday, there were plenty of posters of Khamenei; only a few
posters of the president, who is also a cleric, were seen. Many
children, even toddlers in strollers, wore blue paper banners
around their foreheads with the words, ``Khamenei is our leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the security apparatus deployed on the streets on the
last few days disappeared as regular army and police were posted
along the route of the marchers and at the university. Plainclothes
security officers carrying walkie-talkies carefully followed people
who didn't blend in, even following them into shops.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the marchers expressed their willingness to die for
Khamenei. A father and his two young sons wore white funeral
shrouds hand-painted with the words ``Death to America.''
</P>
<P>
   Long cloth banners strung along the university's iron gates
read, ``The blood in our veins is a gift to our leader,'' and
``There is no place for traitors in an Islamic university.''
</P>
<P>
   The chant of a large group of schoolgirls was simple: ``The
rioters should be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the pro-democracy demonstrators had chanted
``death to dictators,'' and ``death to despots.'' But incited by
official statements blaming the United States and other ``hostile''
powers for masterminding the unrest, the pro-Khamenei crowds
Wednesday reverted to a more familiar slogan: ``Death to America.''
</P>
<P>
   There were signs that at least some of the students felt
abandoned by Khatami, who won in a landslide victory in 1997 with
the help of the youth vote. The reformist newspaper Neshat on
Wednesday published a letter from a university student that spoke
of the ``loneliness of the students behind those closed gates. They
were looking for someone who was not there.''
</P>
<P>
   In a front-page column Wednesday, the reformist newspaper
Khordad noted the ``suspicious presence of paramilitary forces''
wearing civilian clothes ``who consider lawfulness an end to their
own existence and do not want to see the country in peace.'' The
column asked why there was not any criticism of this law-breaking
group.
</P>
<P>
   A man standing at a newspaper stand outside the university gates
said, ``What's going on inside is not serious. You'd be crazy to go
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman whose office is close to the university said, ``It is a
good show. That's all it is, a good show.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man watching the demonstration from a side street
said over and over, ``Have patience. Have patience.'' He said he
had seen many things in his long life. ``These are the last days of
this regime.I'm old and experienced. I know what I'm talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations in Iran traditionally have a carnival atmosphere,
with street vendors hawking fast food and souvenirs. The busiest
vendor Wednesday was a man with a large cooler selling ice cream on
sticks. Asked what he thought of the demonstration, he said,
``Yesterday was better. I sold more ice cream.''

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ President Clinton poked fun at George W. Bush and
boosted Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign Wednesday in
a speech to the Democratic Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't do this because it's not presidential, but I'm
going to do it anyway,'' Clinton said before offering a
tongue-in-cheek critique of the Texas governor's signature slogan,
``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan ``has a great ring to it,'' Clinton said, ``and near
as I can tell, here's what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like you. I do,'' Clinton intoned with an air of mock
seriousness. ``And I would like to be for the patient's bill of
rights. And I'd like to be for closing the gun show loophole. And
I'd like not to squander the surplus and, you know, save Social
Security and Medicare for the next generation. I'd like to raise
the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to do these things, but I just can't. And I feel
terrible about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, told of Clinton's comments during his own visit to
Baltimore, said, ``It's amazing that the president of the United
States would spend time talking about me, even before I get my
party's nomination.'' At another point, Bush said he was
``honored'' by the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech came on the heels of a barbed anti-Bush
introduction from Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante of California, the first
Hispanic elected to statewide office in the nation's most populous
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there is a joke going around the country,''
Bustamante said. ``It's called 'compassionate conservatism. Some
Republicans think that if you put a nice word in front of a mean
word, you can fool people, the way some Texas Republicans think
that all you have to do to get the Latino vote is to speak a little
Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean anything if you don't listen and you don't
help people earn what they want in life,'' he added. ``Calling
yourself a 'compassionate conservative' doesn't mean a thing when
for too many years 'conservative' meant divisive ethnic politics,
mean-spirited policies and selfish corporate greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite persistent accounts of a rift between the president and
vice president, Clinton praised Gore for continuing to advance
ideas developed by the centrist Democratic Leadership Council in
his campaign for the party's 2000 presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this election ought to be about,'' he said. ``Even
commentators on the other side point out that so far he's the only
person who has actually said what he would do if the people gave
him the job, which I think is a reasonably good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenging Republican candidates to explain their positions on
the gun issue, Clinton said, ``There will be clear choices here:
will we have common-sense gun laws or government by the gun
lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore continues to trail Bush by double digits in
hypothetical match-ups in public opinion polls, there was little
sign of panic among members of the council, the organization that
Gore helped found in 1985 following Walter Mondale's disastrous
defeat by Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia compared Bush's performance to the
opening of a new movie. ``You have a great opening week or two, and
then things kind of settle down and it's tested by critics and
history and examination,'' said Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early polls understate Gore's strengths and overstate
Bush's,'' said Al From, the DLC executive director and the
intellectual force behind the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The DLC does not endorse candidates, but, according to From, its
membership overwhelmingly supports Gore over former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, the vice president's sole opponent in the
Democratic contest who has long kept his distance from the DLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been with us since day one,'' said From.

 &HT;    BIG CITIES PUSHING 'Y2K BUG' FIXES TO THE WIRE
 &HT;    Eds: Updates graf 4 with more information on status of Dallas.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

   WASHINGTON _ The nation's largest cities are falling behind in
the race to fix computers before the 2000 date change, with some
saying that even vital services such as water treatment and
telecommunications won't be ready until the final days of the year,
according to a new congressional study.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study being released Thursday by the General
Accounting Office, Boston is the only one of the nation's 21 most
populous cities claiming to be fully prepared to face the ``Y2K
bug.'' That software glitch will cause many older computers to
misread dates ending in ``00,'' possibly causing them to
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21 cities, 10 said they would be Y2K-ready by Sept. 30,
with Dallas expecting to finish by the end of July. The rest said
they would be in compliance between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   While most cities said they have fixed the computers that
control transportation and telecommunications systems, few have
finished upgrading systems that run water treatment, public
buildings and emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   Leaked copies of the report by the GAO, the auditing arm of
Congress, were posted Wednesday on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, the Senate's special Year 2000 Committee will hold
a hearing to discuss the report and gather other information on how
state and local governments are preparing for the date change.
</P>
<P>
   GAO researchers interviewed city officials between June 28 and
July 9 to obtain information about the status of Y2K repairs and to
request supporting documentation.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 cities that reported that they don't expect to be ready
until the last quarter of the year were Los Angeles; Chicago;
Phoenix; San Antonio; Detroit; San Francisco; Baltimore; Columbus,
Ohio; El Paso, Texas, and Washington. While most of those said
they'd be ready by November, Baltimore and El Paso said they
wouldn't be prepared until December.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the nation's capital told the GAO they expected to
be ready by the end of November, but at the moment, Washington is
not Y2K-compliant in the following areas: electric power,
telecommunications, city services and public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The cities expecting to complete their repairs by Oct. 1 were:
New York, Houston, Philadelphia, San Diego, Dallas, San Jose,
Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Memphis and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's Year 2000 Committee, headed by Sens. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah, and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., has been gathering
data for two years and is spurring public officials to work faster
on Y2K problems. While federal agencies are expected to be ready
for the date change, Y2K experts fear that state and local
organizations have waited too long to avert numerous problems.
</P>
<P>
   A recent National League of Cities survey of 400 cities found
that only two-thirds of the cities have made contingency plans to
deal with Y2K-related emergencies.

data for two years and is spurring public officials to work faster
on Y2K problems. While federal agencies are expected to be ready
for the date change, Y2K experts fear that state and local
organizations have waited too long to avert numerous problems.
</P>
<P>
   A recent National League of Cities survey of 400 cities found
that only two-thirds of the cities have made contingency plans to
deal with Y2K-related emergencies.

COMMENTARY: MONEY VS. REFORM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donna Marie McIlwaine was 22 when she died on Feb. 8, 1997. She
is buried in the Chili Rural Cemetery in upstate Scottsville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The managed-care reform legislation that has been the focus of a
furious debate in the Senate was essentially an effort to make it
easier to save the lives of patients like Ms. McIlwaine.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party, flooded with money from the managed-care
industry, gives lip service to the idea of protecting patients, but
then does the bidding of the companies that are the source of all
that cash.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tremendous scandal. No one can seriously argue that lives
are not being lost.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McIlwaine went to the doctor several times in the week
before she died, complaining of pains in her chest and shortness of
breath. According to her family, she was diagnosed with an upper
respiratory infection and ``panic attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she was suffering from pneumonia and a blood clot in
her left lung. Her mother, Mary Munnings, told me Wednesday that
her daughter had been screaming from the excruciating pain before
finally lapsing into unconsciousness and dying at home on a
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   There was no need for her to die. Ms. Munnings said that when
she contacted the office of her daughter's primary-care physician
the following Monday, she learned that Ms. McIlwaine had not been
sent for the laboratory tests that would have properly diagnosed
her condition. She said that when she asked why not, she was told
that ``they couldn't justify'' the tests to her health maintenance
organization.
</P>
<P>
   So we have Donna Marie McIlwaine dead at 22.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the country understands that an unconscionable obsession
with the bottom line has resulted in widespread abuses in the
managed-care industry. Simply stated, there is big money to be made
by denying care. It is now widely known that there are faceless
bureaucrats making critical diagnostic and treatment decisions,
that some doctors are being retaliated against for dispensing
honest advice, that women have had an especially hard time getting
the care they need, and that patients have died because they were
unable to gain admittance to emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called patients' bill of rights in the Senate, sponsored
by the Democrats Tom Daschle and Edward Kennedy, was an attempt to
curb these and other abuses. The managed-care industry wanted no
part of the legislation, which meant the Republicans wanted no part
of it. The Democrats had to virtually shut down the Senate before
the Republican majority would even agree to bring the matter to the
floor for a debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican whip, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, could hardly have
been clearer about his party's desire to avoid the issue. ``I don't
want our members to go through a lot of votes that can be
misconstrued for political purposes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats succeeded in forcing debate on the bill, but they
haven't gotten the patient protections they sought. What occurred
on the floor of the Senate this week was a GOP-sponsored charade in
which one Republican senator after another talked about protecting
the health of patients while voting to protect the profits of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   It was a breathtaking exercise in hypocrisy. It was as if George
Wallace had spoken earnestly about the need to admit black students
to a public school in Alabama while standing in the doorway to
block their entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Some face-saving measures were passed by the GOP majority, but
the essence of managed-care reform was defeated. In the end, it
didn't matter that Mary Munnings had needlessly lost her daughter,
or that a parade of managed-care victims had traveled to Washington
to detail their horror stories, or that organizations representing
doctors, patients and their families had lined up en masse in
support of reform.
</P>
<P>
   All that mattered was the obsession with the profits of the
insurance companies and the HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually substantial improvements will be made in the delivery
of effective and affordable health care to Americans. It will take
years but it will happen. Then the country will look back and
wonder (as we have with Social Security, Medicare and the like) why
anyone was ever opposed.

A SEARCH FOR A MASS MURDERER AND A SWEET SURRENDER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ky., Ill.)   (jw) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ He had promised to take his young daughter fishing on
Sunday, but after several hours out on Galveston Bay, neither Sgt.
Andrew Carter of the Texas Rangers nor Amber Carter, who is 3, had
found much luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``No keepers, anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when his pager went off at 2:30, notifying him to contact
headquarters back in Houston, Carter sensed that he might have a
keeper, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The message was to call Manuela Maturino Karkiewicz, the sister
of a Mexican drifter whom authorities in three states now suspect
of killing nine people in the last two years, six of them in Texas
since October. By June, the fugitive, who was known to authorities
as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, had moved to the top of the FBI's
most-wanted list, and through months of investigation, Carter spoke
periodically to Mrs. Karkiewicz to learn as much about him as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called her from the boat,'' he said in an interview
Wednesday, describing the endgame of a search that involved
thousands of federal and state law-enforcement personnel around the
country. ``At that point, I knew I needed to go to Albuquerque to
meet with her face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   That phone call began a dialogue with Mrs. Karkiewicz and other
members of her family that ended Tuesday morning, when her brother
walked across the international bridge from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico,
and calmly surrendered in El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, at his arraignment on a burglary charge on which
he is being held, the defendant seemed to accept his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can all this be done very quickly so I can say I am guilty?''
he said to Judge William Harmon of the Harris County Criminal
Court, who told him that no plea could be taken yet.
</P>
<P>
   It was only at the arraignment that the authorities learned the
true identity of a man who had eluded capture by using aliases and
disguises and, as his primary mode of travel, freight trains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angel Maturino Resendez,'' the 5-foot-7 defendant, now clad in
the standard issue orange jumpsuit of the Harris County jail, said
when the judge asked his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``So who is Rafael Resendez-Ramirez?' the judge asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``My uncle,'' the prisoner said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered Maturino Resendez, 39, held without bond on a
charge of burglary, arising from a break-in last December at the
house of Claudia Benton, a doctor who was found dead in the bedroom
of her Houston home, an apparent victim of a clubbing and stab
wounds to her back. Officials said they found Maturino Resendez's
fingerprints in her car, which was stolen and recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Devon Anderson, an assistant district attorney, told the court
that if officials could match a sample of Maturino Resendez's
blood, taken during a eight-hour interrogation on Tuesday night and
Wednesday morning, with one taken from the murder scene, the charge
against him would be changed to murder, with the possibility that
he could face a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make a good case excellent,'' Ms. Anderson told
reporters after the arraignment. ``If you have the DNA, it's hard
to deny you didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson said it would be up to the District Attorney John
Holmes to seek a death penalty in the case, which could expand to
include charges that Maturino Resendez killed any of the four other
Texans whose deaths, the authorities say, may involve him.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth murder case in Texas began building Wednesday when the
FBI notified Randal Lee, the district attorney for Cass County in
northeastern Texas, that a palm print from a murder scene had
matched Maturino Resendez.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said it had been found last Oct. 2 after police discovered
Leafie Mason, 87, bludgeoned to death in her home near railroad
tracks in Hughes Springs. That would make her the first of Maturino
Resendez's known victims in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendez is also facing three other murder charges _
one in Kentucky, where Christopher Maier, a 21-year-old junior at
the University of Kentucky, was found dead in 1997, and two in
Illinois, where investigators have linked him to the June 15 deaths
of George Morber, 80, and his daughter, Carolyn Frederick, 52.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy,'' Ms. Anderson said, in response to a reporter's
question about Maturino Resendez's surrender. ``I'm so happy to be
a part of his welcoming committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers were appointed to represent Maturino Resendez, but
they told reporters after the arraignment that until they had time
to meet with their new client to discuss his predicament, they
could not discuss any defense strategy.

HISPANIC WORKERS CHANGING FACE OF SEATTLE'S CONSTRUCTION CREWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISSAQUAH, Wash. _ The radio music drifting from an unfinished
condominium off the Issaquah-Fall City Road was Latin, interrupted
by ads and weather updates in Spanish for the crew hanging drywall.
</P>
<P>
   A few doors down, a crew taping drywall in a condominium closer
to completion broke for lunch. A stew of potatoes and chicken
bubbled in one electric skillet; corn tortillas warmed in another.
</P>
<P>
   Mingling with them, union organizer Jimmy Matta chatted amiably,
passing out flat carpenter's pencils and Spanish-language fliers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scene repeated up and down the Puget Sound region, where
a sizzling economy has created a boom for construction and
construction jobs. Hispanics _ some long-time residents and others
recent arrivals _ are filling many of those jobs, helping to build
the new Seattle area and creating a new and diverse work force.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors are holding safety talks and first-aid classes in
Spanish. The Carpenters Union has begun a push to organize Hispanic
construction workers and has signed up hundreds in nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The changing face of the construction work force has caused
tensions between unions and open-shop contractors, as well as
unions and immigration authorities. The unions believe immigration
agents are trying to bust their organizing drive. Immigration
officials deny that charge.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle are thousands of Hispanic workers, whose lack of
English, willingness to work and sometimes undocumented status may
make them easy targets for abuse. Wages can be below scale _
sometimes little better than minimum wage _ and many jobs have no
health benefits. Wages are sometimes paid in cash, meaning no
worker's compensation premiums are paid to the state and little
help may be available for workers who may become unable to work
because of age or injury.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a good time to be a construction worker. Jobs are
everywhere. It's an employees' market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge demand for workers,'' says Sandra Olson,
executive director of the Construction Industry Training Council,
which teaches construction skills to employees of non-union
contractors. ``Nobody can meet the need, here or nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a strong economy that's making construction
workers scarce. Despite good pay _ a union carpenter working a
residential job in Seattle makes $20 an hour plus benefits _ young
men and women seem to have little interest in construction jobs.
</P>
<P>
   High school students across the country rank construction worker
next to the bottom of 250 occupations, said Olson. Depending on the
survey, students rank only grave digger or itinerate worker lower.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant workers are filling the void. Russians, Koreans and
Bosnians are framing houses, installing pipes and doing other
construction jobs. Canadians fleeing the sour economy in British
Columbia are vying for construction jobs in the Seattle area and
attracting the attention of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no immigrant group is so visible and so dominant as
Hispanics. Estimates vary greatly. Matta, the union organizer, said
Hispanic laborers probably make up 80 percent of the workers who
frame and install drywall, especially at apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The work is physically demanding and the hours long. But the
pay, they said, is good _ much better than other jobs available to
those who can't speak English and may lack the proper immigration
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The drywall workers at the condominium project were getting paid
as much as 14 cents for every square foot installed. A few long
days of hard work could mean a paycheck of $800.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of employment in Washington,'' said Mike Sotelo,
vice president of field operations for W.G. Clark, a large
commercial construction company based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers are likely in the United States illegally. Though
they don't talk about it, employers don't want to know and the
union says it will try to organize them regardless of immigration
status.
</P>
<P>
   Matta, who grew up in a family of Hispanic agricultural workers
in Eastern Washington, started hanging drywall for one reason, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money. I dropped out of school. The fields weren't paying well
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Denis David, who owns Cedar King Lumber in Redmond, a Seattle
suburb across Lake Washington, said his Hispanic work force has
grown from a couple of workers to more than a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   When an older brother makes $40,000 in construction, it gets
noticed, said David, whose company puts on siding and installs
decks in the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   Three union carpenters, all born in Mexico, came to the trade
through family connections. Hugh Montero, 34, had a brother in
construction. For Arturo Pacheo, 34, it was a cousin. Jose Juarez,
28, came north from Mexico to work with an uncle and cousin.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Montero worked in the fields of California with his
mother. Pacheo first came to Washington to pick apples in
Wenatchee. It was the only job he was big enough to do, he said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Construction work offers steady jobs with better pay. Their
union membership also gives them health and pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Construction was a logical choice for Juarez, who did plumbing
and refrigeration repairs in Mexico. ``I'm a man who likes to work
with his hands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some contractors and unions are changing with their work force.
</P>
<P>
   W.G. Clark has safety talks in English and in Spanish and offers
incentives to workers to learn English, Sotelo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern was that as a general contractor we provide safety
for the general job site,'' he said. ``Several years ago at a
safety meeting I looked over to one of the persons next to me who
was Latino and I asked him if he understood what was just said, and
he said no.''
</P>
<P>
   David has been trying to organize first-aid classes in Spanish
to meet job-safety regulations that crews must have a worker
trained in first aid.
</P>
<P>
   He and his main competitor, Chaussee Siding Co., are close to
opening a school to teach workers how to install siding. Bilingual
instruction, he said, will be a must.
</P>
<P>
   The change is the most remarkable inside the Carpenters Union.
Labor unions have traditionally been uneasy if not outright hostile
to low-wage immigrant workers, especially illegal aliens. Unions,
after all, try to protect their members' jobs and wages.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, however, the Carpenters Union in Seattle
launched a drive to organize Hispanic workers. About 500
construction workers have been signed up, said Eric Franklin,
organizing director for the Pacific Northwest District Council of
Carpenters.
</P>
<P>
   The timing has been good for the union. The strong economy has
spurred building. There are also several large public projects,
including new baseball and football stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the union is weak in residential construction.
Organizing Hispanic workers could give the union a foot in the
residential door.
</P>
<P>
   The union has also come to the conclusion that Hispanic workers
are here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no alternative but to organize them. They're back
before the bus (that deported them to Mexico) is. They are a fact
of life,'' Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   The union and some contractors agree that Hispanic workers can
be easily exploited.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, wages handed out to Hispanic drywall installers
are less than what was standard 10 years ago, said Jeff Kelley, a
business representative with the Painters Union.
</P>
<P>
   Workers paid in cash avoid taxes. That may sound like a good
idea to a worker, but cash payments mean no record of employment,
and that means that those hurt on the job might not get worker's
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits can be rare on some job sites. That means no pension or
health care after 20 years of hoisting drywall makes a worker old
at 40.
</P>
<P>
   At one site near Issaquah, workers framing apartment complexes
seem to be entirely immigrant and mostly Hispanic. One young man
was making $8 an hour. A man from Haiti was making $12 an hour for
putting in stairs. No one was getting benefits such as health care.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a group of Hispanic workers had just begun framing a new
building. There were nail guns and splinters, as well as boards
being handled above their heads. But the workers wore tennis shoes
and baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   Worker safety rules require boots and hardhats in such
conditions, according to the Washington Department of Labor and
Industries.

CABLE TV OFFICIALS SAY NET SERVICE `UNDERHYPED' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Cable television companies are so elated with
response to their new high-speed Internet access services that at
least one industry official now thinks the Internet may be
``underhyped.''
</P>
<P>
   As the New England Cable Television Association wrapped up a
three-day meeting here Wednesday, talk about what some now call
``plain old television'' was eclipsed in many quarters by
extraordinary bullishness about the prospects for converting cable
systems to carry Internet and telephone traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I learn about this, the more I believe that the
Internet has been underhyped,'' said Peter Gulla, a senior
marketing official for Road Runner, the Internet-access venture of
MediaOne Group and Time Warner. ``This is a phenomenal change we
are living through.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, MediaOne Group says that 7 percent of the just over 1
million Massachusetts and New Hampshire households that can get
RoadRunner access have signed up, barely a year after the a $1.3
billion regional system upgrade made it available.
</P>
<P>
   The service, available in 126 communities in the two states,
keeps users continually connected and claims to download files up
to 50 times faster than dial-up telephone access. ``This is a
product that people are really seeing a need for,'' Gulla said.
``This solves a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci told conference attendees that by 2001,
upgraded 750-megahertz cable systems that can carry fast Internet
traffic and telephone calls will be available to 90 percent of
Massachusetts cable subscribers. Cellucci vowed to limit the
state's role to ``facilitator, educator and, whenever necessary,
referee'' to avoid stifling innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Edison's joint venture with RCN Corp. is bringing
telephone and high-speed Internet service to six area communities,
and Cablevision Systems expects later this year to roll out its own
version in parts of Boston and nearby Brookline. Bell Atlantic last
month responded by rolling out a competing high-speed product,
called Digital Subscriber Line, in Cambridge and, later this year,
most of metropolitan Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Gulla noted, the percentage of households owning a
computer nationwide has grown from 36 percent to 55 percent, and
the percent of those who go on-line has jumped from 9 to 44
percent. The number of pages on the World Wide Web pages has
exploded from 23,500 to over 4 million.
</P>
<P>
   While cable systems are drawn to Internet-access products as
huge revenue builders, Greg Bicket, general manager for Cox
Communications' systems in southern New England, cautioned that the
move poses ``daunting'' challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Cox has found that to support Internet access and telephony, it
needs to quadruple training for service people and sharply improve
system reliability to avoid ``life threatening'' problems such as
losing 911 access on the telephone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Bicket said, ``We will never go to market with these new
products and technologies if we try to perfect all processes before
launching,'' saying the revenue upside merits going after business
first and working out final bugs later.

 HOUSTON: defense strategy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carter, who turned 32 on Tuesday, did not appear at the
arraignment. He scarcely had the time. Almost overnight, he has
become something of a hero in these parts, which he found
gratifying if not a little embarrassing for someone who sheepishly
admitted he wanted to be a Texas Ranger since he was 5 years old.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Founded 176 years ago by Stephen F. Austin, the
father of modern Texas, the Rangers have played a celebrated role
in history as pursuers of all manner of outlaws, including Sam
Bass, John Wesley Hardin, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. In recent
years, their numbers have scaled back from more than 1,000 during
World War I to the current force of just 107, who serve chiefly as
investigators, assisting other state and local law-enforcement
agencies in difficult cases.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three Ranger sergeants assigned to the Maturino Resendez
case, Carter has been at it the longest, about seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, standing bolt upright in his white Ranger hat
and brown cowboy boots _ boots are required for Texas Rangers on
duty _ he appeared on several national and local morning talk
shows, explaining his role in the case, before downing his first
cup of coffee at his office desk.
</P>
<P>
   No part of his involvement seemed more intriguing than the
relationship he built over the months with Mrs. Karkiewicz as the
authorities baffled by Maturino Resendez's elusiveness sought to
learn whatever they could about their prey.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who is known as Drew, first contacted her several months
ago, he said in the interview, largely to discuss her brother's
habits, his likes and dislikes. Sometimes they spoke by telephone,
he said. Three times he traveled to see her in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Over the months, he said, a bond of respect developed as she
began to trust him, and he began to believe that the bits of
information he was learning about her brother were true.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a very righteous individual,'' Carter said. ``I don't
think she would have turned him in the first day. It was a question
of, one, whether she was completely confident he was the man
accused and, two, what was in his best interests if that happened
to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous efforts to call Ms. Karkiewicz in Ciudad Juarez were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Carter said, she drew other relatives of Maturino
Resendez, some in the United States, others in Mexico, into her
communications with Carter although she remained the principal
conduit to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, he said, it became clear to him that family
members were feeling a growing pressure, based on ``the overall
severity of the case and the publicity'' and that they began to
fear for Maturino Resendez's own safety as the object of the
search.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he said, the fear and the family's trust spurred them
to open a dialogue about surrender. That's what led to the phone
call from the boat.
</P>
<P>
   By late that evening, Carter had reached Albuquerque but still
only expecting, he said, to learn something of Maturino Resendez's
whereabouts from his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``In time,'' he said of his final meeting with Mrs. Karkiewicz,
``the family continued to communicate with her, and it was relayed
back that they wanted to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, when Maturino Resendez walked across the bridge
into the United States, ending one of the country's longest
manhunts, Carter was among the officers waiting to take him into
custody. As the fugitive stepped off the bridge, Carter approached
and the two men shook hands.

AUSTRALIANS SHRUG OFF SETBACKS, SAY THEY'RE READY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUPEN FOFARIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ When captain John Newcombe and his Australian
Davis Cup team arrived at Longwood Cricket Club, site of the
first-ever competition 100 years ago, there was nothing but the
ghosts of Davis Cups past to give any indication of this historic
tie.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past four days, as the Australians practiced, the
splendor which will surround this particular competition has all
come together.
</P>
<P>
   The banners are up. The flags are flying. The bleachers are
freshly painted. The scoreboard is in place. The upper platforms
are in place and decorated with canopies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as Newcombe walked off the court and through the
halls of bleachers and tarpaulin, he took a look around and
realized where he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where it all began 100 years ago,'' he said. ``There
were a bunch of guys battling it out 100 years ago, and here we are
now with another bunch of guys battling it out. I think people will
begin to understand the history of this now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australian team has overcome numerous trials and
tribulations just to get to this point. The day before the start of
the tie, they feel prepared to compete and showed no signs of
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the tie supposed to take place in Australia, but a
formidable squad of world No. 2 singles player Patrick Rafter,
world No. 9 singles player Mark Philippoussis, and a doubles team
of Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge (who haven't lost a Cup match
in 5 1/2 years) were supposed to take the court for Australia.
</P>
<P>
   But the tie, however, will be played in the US, and the injured
Phillippoussis and Woodbridge will be nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a few setbacks,'' Newcombe said. ``But we're
ready to go. The place is all set and we're all set.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe said he believed Rafter has been ready to go since
Tuesday, and 18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt, who will be
Phillippoussis's replacement, has been improving by the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty happy with where we're at,'' Newcombe said.
``Patrick's got himself just where he wants to be and I think
Lleyton just needs to get himself topped off and be ready by
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Cup draws closer, more media and more fans have packed
the sidelines of the courts where the Australians practice. The air
has grown more tense, but the Australians remain jovial, laughing
throughout and teasing or taunting one another as they practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of have the attitude that it's going to be very hard
work,'' Newcombe said, ``but we want to have fun while we're doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, this isn't anywhere like it was in April, when the
Asutralians met Zimbabwe in the first round in Harare.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians lost to Zimbabwe in the first round of the '98
Cup, so reputation was also at stake. This time, with the injuries
the Australians have sustained, the presses won't stop if they
happen to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're experienced at this,'' Newcombe said. ``We know how to
handle pressure, if we feel it. Even Lleyton, although he's in his
first (Davis Cup), has been with us a long time and is sort of
lapping it all up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, while the Americans were occupied with the issue of
whether or not Pete Sampras would play singles, the Australians
were in a festive mood. They celebrated Australian Ken McGregor's
induction into the Hall of Fame last week and they celebrated the
birthday of Sandon Stolle, who replaced Woodbridge on the team.
</P>
<P>
   There is no pressure on their shoulders. They truly are having
fun. They were having a bit of fun with Stolle, too, who wasn't
given a birthday present Wednesday when the team went out to
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll get his birthday present if he plays and wins,'' joked
Newcombe.

LULAC MEMBERS COMPLAIN GROUP LOSING ITS EDGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ More than 6,000 members of the League of
United Latin American Citizens returned to the group's birthplace
this week to celebrate 70 years of desegregating schools, winning
the right of Mexican-Americans to serve on juries, and opening up
swimming pools, public restrooms and lunch counters to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   But as convention delegates debate the predictable issues of
bilingual education, immigration and the U.S. Census count, some
LULAC members are complaining that the country's oldest and largest
Hispanic civil rights group may be losing its edge. Where, they
ask, are all the presidential candidates?
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush, as far as I'm concerned, snubbed the
convention,'' said Ruben Bonilla, a Corpus Christi lawyer and a
former national president of LULAC. ``It would have taken three
hours of his time to fly in and appear at this convention and fly
out. Instead, he's making sandwiches with a New York deli owner and
flying into the Denver airport and speaking a few words of Spanish,
which is a gratuitous insult.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bonilla said LULAC shares the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reveling in the victories of the past seven decades,
he said, the group should be looking ahead, giving Hispanic youth
the tools to compete in new technology fields and demanding notice
from business leaders and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the last time LULAC held a convention in Corpus
Christi, all seven of the announced Democratic presidential
candidates, as well as Republican Jack Kemp, addressed the members.
Last year, at the group's gathering in Dallas, Bush and then-House
Speaker Newt Gingrich spoke, as did House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt, Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Texas gubernatorial
candidate Garry Mauro and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``We cajoled. We threatened. We intimidated,'' Bonilla said.
``If they declined our invitation, we held a press conference
saying they weren't interested in the Hispanic vote. You have to be
arrogant with your power. Otherwise, the politicians say, `We don't
need the Mexican vote. We don't need to go there and talk to them.
We'll just learn a few words of Spanish. We'll hold a `pachanga'
(party). We'll get Emilio to cut another tape.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign press secretary, Mindy Tucker, said the
governor's invitation to LULAC conflicted with a campaign
appointment Thursday in Iowa and his absence from the convention
should not be taken as a slight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He addressed the LULAC convention last year and had a
wonderful visit with them in Dallas,'' Tucker said. ``Now he's
reaching out to Hispanic voters all over the country. And I don't
think it was a gratuitous insult to fly into Denver to receive the
endorsement of several Hispanic elected officials there.''
</P>
<P>
   LULAC's current president, Houston attorney Rick Dovalina,
shrugged off the lack of attendance by Bush and other presidential
hopefuls. All were invited, he said, but Vice President Al Gore and
Arizona Sen. John McCain both were guests at a LULAC banquet in
Washington, D.C., earlier this year. The rest, he said, had
scheduling conflicts with this week's NAACP convention in New York
and the National Council of La Raza conference later this month in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the critics, Dovalina contends, LULAC remains strong and
forward-thinking, and the convention is a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got more than 6,000 people here. We've got more than a
hundred kids at our youth conference,'' he said. ``Jesse Jackson is
here. We've got the U.S. secretary of education, the secretary of
energy, the secretary of the Army, the director of the U.S. Office
of Personnel Management.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 900 councils across the country, ``we're still
the only grass-roots Hispanic organization,'' he said. ``The work
of LULAC is done in the community, in the school boards, on the
city councils. When LULAC speaks, we speak as the people.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he shares some members' impatience to move beyond the
group's civil rights work, the president said it's also important
to remember LULAC's roots. Without LULAC, he points out, there
would be no Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund.
There would be no Head Start program. And there would be no
watchdog on anti-affirmative action legislation and anti-immigrant
initiatives. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Unfortunately, discrimination still exists,'' he said. ``It's
not like the old days, when there would just be a sign on the door,
`No Mexicans allowed.' But it is there.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the group was recently asked to set up a
council in Memphis, Tenn., where residents were frustrated by the
police's response to a wave of killings in the city's Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went there and discovered that there is only one person on
the police force who speaks Spanish, and no one working dispatch
who speaks Spanish,'' he said. ``There is still a lot of
discrimination, but it's not as overt. Now it's more that they are
overwhelmed. They never had a Hispanic population before, and now
they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The LULAC of the future will have to continue to respond to
civil rights issues, even as it shifts its focus toward getting
more Hispanics working on Wall Street and in high-tech companies,
not to mention in the federal government, Dovalina and other
members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard because you have to go back and revisit so many
issues you thought were resolved, and it's scary because there are
some people with a lot of money and a lot of time on their hands to
work on their causes,'' he said. ``That's what's happening with
bilingual education in California and (private school) vouchers in
Texas. Those with a lot of money are organizing and they are very
hard to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Mata, a former district director for LULAC in Houston,
said he would like to see the organization move faster and work
harder on a broad range of issues. But the strength of LULAC is and
has always been at the community level, Mata said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see LULAC do a lot more,'' he said, ``but I'm
not disparaging. The league has gone through all kinds of
struggles, but it still has the edge. We're here today and we'll be
here tomorrow.''

SEATTLE'S SAFECO FIELD HAS A HIT ON ITS HANDS WITH PUBLIC ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If Ries Neimi hadn't been picked to make art for
Safeco Field, he would have known why. Although he scores high as
an artist who works well on public projects, he scores low as a
fan. For Safeco Field, the Seattle Mariners new ballpark that opens
Thursday, being a fan mattered. The art review panel in charge
wanted the artists to love the game, and Neimi couldn't claim that.
</P>
<P>
   He made the cut anyway, the only one of the 11 selected who
doesn't pledge allegiance to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   This feat he accomplished by padding his resume. He took credit
for creating giant baseball-card gates for the non-existent Congo
Caterpillars Stadium in Zaire. He offhandely alluded to the series
of oversized steel jerseys he made in Tibet, in the team colors of
the fictional Khyber Pass League. Under construction, he lied, is
his figure-studded railing for the new floating stadium in Havana
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made us laugh,'' said art panel member Peggy Weiss,
director of Seafirst Gallery, who admitted Neimi might not have
made the first cut if he hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring artists to have their hearts in their subject matter
is unusual, to say the least. Even the pope didn't require
Michelangelo be in a state of grace before painting the Sistine
Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel felt that the ballpark was a sacred place and wanted
the artists to feel that way too,'' said Irene Mahler, art
consultant for the project, who said that one half of 1 percent of
the original $250 million cost of the ballpark _ $1.2 million _ was
spent on art.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Safeco Field can now boast of being the most art
intensive ballpark in the country, which isn't saying much. Nearly
all baseball stadiums are art-free zones. True, Coors Field in
Denver got a lot of mileage in 1994 from ho-hum ceramic arc at the
front entrance with 108 glazed tiles depicting balls of every sort:
``The Evolution of the Ball.'' The idea's cute, but the delivery's
bland enough to be safely ignored after an initial sighting.
</P>
<P>
   Against this solid record of strikeouts, Seattle has a hit on
its hands. A hefty share of the stadium's art has what English
critic Lawrence Alloway called the essential ingredient for public
art, the ability to serve as ``focal point for an undifferentiated
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   If public art speaks only to a select few, argued Alloway, it's
a failure. It must reach across the widest possible spectrum of
tastes, experiences and interests in order to connect.
</P>
<P>
   Another trait separates public artists from those working on
their own projects in their studios: public artists should be able
to compromise, as they are part of a democratic experience in which
a lot of people have a say. In contrast, studio artists have to
hang tough. If word gets out that they're painting in color schemes
and dimensions chosen by a client, they lose face.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field artist Tina Hoggatt knows the difference, which is
why she didn't hesitate to indulge Dorothy ``Snookie'' Harrell
Doyle when she asked for a revision.
</P>
<P>
   A show-stopping shortstop for the All-American Girls' Pro
Baseball League in the 1940s, Doyle is part of Hoggatt's dream
team, a nine-piece set of large, porcelain-enamel-on-steel panels
featuring players in action, drawn from the history of the game and
hanging on the upper concourse.
</P>
<P>
   Now in her 70s, Doyle frowned when Hoggatt showed her the
watercolor from which the panels would be made. ``She told me her
nose is a lot bigger now than it was when she was playing, and that
she'd like to see it more snub,'' Hoggatt said. ``I told her, `You
got it.' She wants a shorter nose, she gets a shorter nose.''
</P>
<P>
   Other featured players are Roy Campanella as catcher, Christy
Mathewson as pitcher, Masafumi Yamamori from the Hankyu Braves in
left field, Buck Leonard of the Negro Leagues at first base, Julio
Cruz at second, Brooks Robinson at third, Bill Lawrence from the
Pacific Coast League in center field and Roberto Clemente in right.
</P>
<P>
   Hoggatt told Mariners designated hitter Edgar Martinez through
an intermediary she had Clemente in right field and asked who else
he'd like to see on her team. ``If you have Clemente, that's
enough,'' he told her. ``I wouldn't want to add any name to his.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Palmer Beecher, who ``never met a baseball she didn't
like,'' rewarded the panel for choosing her with two walls of
fabulously funky baseball quilts, made of license plates, soda
cans, carved and painted wood on facing walls at the southeast
entry of the main concourse. To secure the commission, she listed
100 reasons why she loves baseball, what she calls America's folk
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to eat hot dogs without anyone telling you how bad
they are for you,'' she said. ``You can watch baseball players
pinch each other and spit on the expensive grass. You can
clothespin baseball cards on the wheels of your bike and make
flap-snap sounds. You can see baseball diamonds lit up when you're
in the plane at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Thom Ross has a fan patter to match or beat Beecher's and
Hoggatt's. His cutout, painted steel figures are instantly
recognizable to Mariner fans. To make them, Ross borrowed a news
photo of Ken Griffey Jr. sliding home with the playoff series'
winning run against the Yankees in 1995, blew it up, rearranged the
composition a little, had it fabricated and hand-painted the
results, placed on the northwest entrance of the main concourse
level.
</P>
<P>
   Gu Xiong concentrated not on the game but the crowds it draws.
His 24-foot-long porcelain enamel on steel mural catches the fans
at a moment of maniacal intensity, hanging on the northeast corner
of the main concourse level.
</P>
<P>
   Niemi and Donald Fels opted for a deft brand of instruction.
Niemi's sleek, unpainted steel cutout figures adorn the gates
surrounding the park, illustrating the positions they hold on the
field. His ``Batter's Fence'' shows the trajectories various kinds
of hit balls make after contact with the bat, all labeled with arcs
of motion visible, such as bunts and pop flys.
</P>
<P>
   Fels got the job in part by bringing to the interview a 1958 Los
Angeles Dodgers yearbook autographed by the whole team and
presented to him as a reward for his baseball fanaticism.
</P>
<P>
   His artwork saves the drab facade of the parking garage from
itself. Inset into granite columns are phrases that have entered
the language as baseball-derived metaphors: out of left field, off
base, out of the park. Above them are large baseballs held to
illustrate the positions of different pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Tsutakawa had his idea for a bronze mitt from the
beginning. Appropriately titled ``The Mitt,'' it stands in all its
gleaming bronze splendor at the park's left field entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Lessick wanted to deal with the trading card aspect of the
game. She designed 15 cards relating to the physics and phenomena
of baseball. Although her original plan for vending machines for
the cards didn't make it to Safeco Field, three enlarged versions
of them hang on the northeast entry area.
</P>
<P>
   The art team known as Stable (Linda Beaumont, Stuart Keeler and
Michael Machnic) don't ascribe to the rule that public project
artists need to compromise. To get their piece past the panel, they
strained everybody's nerves and goodwill but prevailed, complaining
all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Was it worth it? Most fans are likely to think so. Above the
southwest entry gates hangs their version of a chandelier: 1,000
whitish yet translucent bats in a swirl of motion. Below the floor
is painted mottled blues for seas, and the staircase leading up to
main concourse level is pale red for beach sand.
</P>
<P>
   Stable pressed upon the panel a metaphor: mariner as seaman as
well as baseball player. Inset into the floor on the main concourse
level overlooking home plate is a compass rose embedded with
baseball quotes.

OBSERVERS SEE RENEWED PROTESTS IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tens of thousands of people marched Wednesday in
Tehran in support of Islamic rule, and security forces arrested
scores of students in a wide sweep that they hope ends the violent
unrest against Iran's conservative rulers.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests and huge rally created a day without clashes, the
first after six days of bloody street fights. And as the quiet
came, students realized another serious if less-obvious blow to
their movement: President Mohammed Khatami, a moderate elected in a
surprise landslide two years ago, never seized the student protests
to push his past promises for progress toward democracy and greater
cultural freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, professionals in Tehran and Iran-watchers in the Middle
East and the United States said Wednesday's arrests and the live
national broadcast of the pro-Islamic Republic march was not likely
to become Iran's Tiananmen Square, and the student movement would
regroup in coming days and weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The makings of a new confrontation may not be too far off. A
senior Iranian official warned Wednesday that those who led the
days of unrest could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those involved in the last days' riots, destruction of public
property and attacks against the system will be tried and punished
as mohareb (those fighting God) and mofsed,'' or those fighting
corruption, said Hassan Rowhani, secretary of the Supreme National
Security Council, Iran's top security body.
</P>
<P>
   Both charges carry a possible death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he said was that those people will be treated as
anti-revolutionaries, which is very harsh,'' Sadegh Samii, a
prominent Tehran publisher, said by telephone Wednesday. ``Everyone
is puzzled here right now. What will be the outcome, we don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Iran's religious leadership, Khatami appeared
on Iranian TV Tuesday night and made it clear that violence would
not be tolerated. His lack of support for the students, said a
Tehran professional, who asked not to be named, ``could make
Khatami a loser in the end. He didn't make a strong enough
statement. He should have done something.''
</P>
<P>
   But the students also lost the reform-minded president as a
supporter at this time, he said, and now they must focus on how to
move ahead without Khatami's backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're walking on the edge. There is a lot of hate here against
the security police for what they did _ throwing the students out
the window, then breaking their arms and legs in the protests,''
the professional said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the skirmishes stop for a while, the underlying problems
in the country won't disappear, analysts said. That, they believe,
will continue to fuel tensions in the country. The largest problems
involve an unemployment rate estimated as high as 25 percent and an
almost daily tug-of-war over what is allowable in public speech,
media and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that there was going to be a total explosion
overnight was wrong,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman, a prominent
American military and security analyst who worked at the US Embassy
in Tehran in the mid-1970s and revisited the country last year.
Cordesman also wrote the book ``Iran In Transition,'' published
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question isn't where they are going to be tomorrow or next
week, but where they will be in six months or a year because a
government crackdown doesn't mean the problems go away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes sprang from the deaths of at least two students and
as many as eight, who were thrown out of their dormitory windows by
security police last Thursday night. It came against a larger
backdrop over the question of what Iran will become: a theocracy
that bases its laws in interpretations of Islam, or a nation that
begins to embrace the principles of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Iran now numbers nearly 70 million people, and more than 60
percent of them are under age 25. Its current paucity of work and
poor public wages harks back to an earlier time, to the late 1970s,
when armed students took to the streets and overthrew the US-backed
corrupt rule of the shah.
</P>
<P>
   There are no indications yet that today's student movement
either wants to overthrow the religious leaders or would have the
power and support to carry it out. Student leaders have issued
eight demands, including the release of political prisoners, the
arrest of the national police chief and the release of the bodies
of the students who were pushed to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of Tehran Wednesday, the government bused in
workers and families of those who died in the eight-year Iran-Iraq
war. Many government workers, according to two people interviewed
in Iran, were told they must attend the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the crowd roared, ``Death to America!'' They carried
pictures of the late revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini and his successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian television carried the two-hour march live and estimated
1 million people turned out for the rally. Reporters working for
Western news agencies put the figure at tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Menashe Amir, the Iranian-born director of the Voice of
Israel-Farsi section, said the arrests of many students Wednesday
would likely slow down the protest movement. One person in Tehran
estimated that hundreds were arrested. Amir said it was impossible
to put a figure on the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students have to plan again, rethink things,'' he said
from his Jerusalem radio studio. ``But no doubt they have passed
the line and they cannot go back on what they have started. I
believe the regime today is much less secure than it was a week
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Amir, whose station receives many calls from people
in Iran, ``it will be a long fight. If the student actions
continue, then general citizens will join them. For the moment,
though, they are afraid.''

UNIONISTS REJECT POWER-SHARING PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a stinging rebuke to British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, the Ulster Unionists formally rejected a compromise
Wednesday that would have led to the creation of a power-sharing
local government in Northern Ireland today (Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   The unionists' refusal to sit in a government with Sinn Fein,
the Irish Republican Army's political representatives, before the
IRA gives up its weapons puts last year's historic Good Friday
Agreement in limbo in the short term. In the long term, it
threatens the entire peace process.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Blair said the prime minister was ``frustrated
and disappointed.'' Earlier this month, Blair had set Thursday as
the latest deadline for progress, and spent an extraordinary amount
of his personal time and energy, including a week ensconced in
Belfast, trying to convince the unionists to join in government
with Sinn Fein first and wait for the IRA's disarming to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair's prestige, personal intervention and last-minute
offers of even more concessions failed to sway the unionists, who
represent middle-class Protestants, the biggest voting bloc in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   However, Blair's desperate, 11th-hour bid infuriated Sinn Fein,
which accused Blair of trying to rewrite the Good Friday Agreement,
which Blair considers his greatest achievement as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   An angry Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein's leader, said his party would
use the courts to oppose any attempt to renegotiate the agreement,
and accused Blair of trying to undermine it. Adams said many
unionists were using the weapons issue as an excuse to avoid
sharing power with Catholics and that, ``for those who may
genuinely want to deal with the issue of guns, they're going about
it the absolutely worst and wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   The British government still intends to try Thursday to form the
12-member cabinet that would oversee the power-sharing government.
But the exercise will likely be a futile one, since the unionists
are expected to boycott the process by refusing to name their
choices for cabinet positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't devolve power to an assembly that doesn't have
cross-community support,'' Blair's Street spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Downing Street officials, meanwhile, said they would probably
pull back legislation, passed by the House of Commons early
Wednesday and sent to the House of Lords, that sought to reassure
the unionists by providing that Sinn Fein would be expelled from
the Northern Ireland Assembly if the IRA failed to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had set Thursday as a deadline for agreement on forming
the local government, and had rushed legislation through the House
of Commons, in an attempt to effect the transfer of power from
London to Belfast by Sunday, ending 27 years of direct rule from
London. But as Blair's spokesman put it: ``We'll take it at a more
leisurely pace now.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's failure to forge, or some would say force, a compromise
was the biggest setback in the peace process since the British and
Irish governments persuaded the bitterly divided parties in
Northern Ireland to sign the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998.
That compromise agreement created the political machinery aimed at
ending some 30 years of conflict that has cost more than 3,500
lives and poisoned relations between Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But that machinery has been kept in mothballs because unionists
and Irish republicans represented by Sinn Fein have been unable to
assuage each other's mutual deep-seated suspicions. The Northern
Ireland Assembly was elected and seated last year but has not had
power devolved back to it. Cross-border agencies overseeing issues
of mutual interest to the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland have
not been formed, either.
</P>
<P>
   The unionists refuse to share power with the republicans until
the IRA begins turning in weapons. Sinn Fein argues that the Good
Friday Agreement does not link power-sharing to disarming and
accuses the unionists of trying to unilaterally renegotiate the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback, there are no obvious indications that the
IRA is prepared to resume its war against the British government.
Most of the limited violence in Northern Ireland in the past year
has been committed against Catholic civilians by Protestant
extremists who oppose the cease-fire declared by major Protestant
loyalist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the political vacuum that has been created by the
stalemate does not bode well for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Blair spoke with his Irish counterpart, Bertie
Ahern, the Northern Ireland assembly's deputy leader, Seamus Mallon
of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party, and
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble emerged from a meeting of his 110-member executive
committee in Belfast to say tersely that his party's position had
not changed. The meeting lasted just 15 minutes, underscoring the
unionist claim that Blair's promises and legislation are
unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not sought, nor will I seek, a change in the party's
policies,'' said Trimble, who as leader of the biggest party in
Northern Ireland would head the local government he is refusing to
create.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble ignored telephoned pleas from Blair, Ahern and President
Clinton to form the power-sharing government first and walk away if
the IRA failed to deliver. Blair's government had drafted
legislation that would throw Sinn Fein out of the new government if
the IRA did not turn in its weapons by next May.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in a final attempt to get the unionists to form the
power-sharing government, Blair offered an amendment that would
provide a specific timetable for IRA disarmament to be set by John
de Chastelain, a retired Canadian general who chairs an independent
commission on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Another amendment, Blair said, would allow the government and
assembly to ``clearly and formally identify'' the political parties
linked to paramilitary groups that do not disarm.
</P>
<P>
   While Trimble and the unionists dismissed the last-minute offers
as vague, Adams lambasted Blair for undermining the Good Friday
Agreement.

   PARIS _ It is not an easy time for a Serbian filmmaker to be
releasing a new movie in the United States, even for a veteran
director like Goran Paskaljevic, who has long opposed Slobodan
Milosevic's regime, who has expressed his shame over the atrocities
committed by Serbian forces in Bosnia and Kosovo, who has been
denounced as a traitor by the official press in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, he remains a Serb, and, as such, he is expected to
throw light on the collective madness that has gripped a good many
of his fellow Serbs of late.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, this was his objective when he began shooting
``Cabaret Balkan,'' his 11th feature film, in Belgrade in the early
spring of 1998. It was still a year before NATO launched its aerial
war against Yugoslavia in the name of saving Kosovo, but
Paskaljevic was already convinced that Milosevic was leading his
nation to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   His movie is about people, not politics, but nonetheless about
people driven to violence and despair by politics. The film's
original title _ ``The Powder Keg'' _ said it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many critics now say the film was prophetic, but it was normal
to me that the powder keg would explode in the end,'' Paskaljevic
said over coffee in the small apartment in Paris that he and his
French wife, Christine, have just occupied. ``I believe it is an
honest testimony of the dark and tragic atmosphere in Belgrade at
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which opens in New York on Friday, was renamed for
the United States because Kevin Costner had registered the title
``The Powder Keg.'' But ``Cabaret Balkan'' also serves it well,
hinting at the dark humor and macabre theatricality of the Serbian
dance of death that Paskaljevic portrays.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which won the International Critics Prize for Best
Film at the 1998 Venice Film Festival, has already been released in
much of Western Europe and, more surprisingly, also in Belgrade and
Sarajevo, where it drew enthusiastic crowds.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, written by Paskaljevic and Dejan Dukovski, is an
adaptation of Dukovksi's play ``The Powder Keg,'' which was well
received in Belgrade in the mid-1990s. But while the play presents
a series of short stories set in Skopje, Macedonia, the movie takes
place in Belgrade in the course of one night, linking the different
tales in the style of ``La Ronde'' and setting them against the
political background of a Serbia sliding into poverty, ostracized
by the world and paralyzed by its own myths.
</P>
<P>
   The sinister mood is set by the slurred opening words of the
master of ceremonies at Cabaret Balkan, who addresses the camera as
if speaking for Serbia to the world: ``Why do you laugh at me? Do
you think I am funny? Do you think I am a freak? That I'm different
from you? Is that why you have come? It doesn't matter. You're
welcome.'' Welcome, he adds with a thin smile, because he has plans
to upset you.
</P>
<P>
   The stories that follow are indeed disturbing, each one ending
in an act of violence, a violence that seems darkly logical in a
context in which tension, frustration and distrust are feeding
feelings of victimization and a desire for revenge. A taxi driver
recognizes a policeman, now crippled by an accident, and sets out
to repay a beating that the policeman once gave him.
</P>
<P>
   Two old friends, sparring in a boxing ring to keep fit, begin
confessing how they have betrayed each other, until one of them
explodes. A young man hijacks a bus and berates some passengers for
their passivity. Another young man is mistaken for a gasoline thief
and is chased by a lynch mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to show that the victim and the executioner nearly
become the same,'' said Paskaljevic, whose last movie, the 1996
English-language ``Someone Else's America,'' was every bit as
sentimental as ``Cabaret Balkan'' is menacing. ``That's our tragic
problem. Most of the Serbian population feel like a victim, which
is wrong. But it is a very strong feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   A stockily built man of 52 with thinning long hair and, on this
occasion, a three-day stubble, Paskaljevic likes to think of
himself as an optimist, but he concedes that this is his most
somber movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot express hope in the film artificially,'' he said.
``Hollywood movies always express hope at the end of the story, but
it is not like that in life. But I do find some hope in some of the
characters, in their humanity, even in their tragic circumstances.
Little gestures. For example, the political scene is the bus scene.
The guy is nice to the old people; he lets them off the bus. He's
nice to the young people, who are kissing each other and don't
care. But he tries to shake up the middle classes and says, `You
need another war to wake up and become rebels.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after another war has brought Serbia its fourth defeat in a
decade, Paskaljevic is more upbeat. He is encouraged by the
anti-Milosevic demonstrations that are beginning to take place in
many Serbian towns, and he believes that the return of university
students to classes in September may accelerate the demise of the
regime.
</P>
<P>
   But he also hopes that the West will support the opposition more
than it did during the 100-day protest movement that shook Serbia
in the winter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't help because, for the American administration,
Milosevic was the strongman of the Balkans who had signed Dayton,''
he said, referring to the agreement that ended the four-year
conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ``It's always easier to deal
with dictators than democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Reared in Marshall Tito's Yugoslavia and trained in the Prague
film school known as FAMU, Paskaljevic has himself had ample
experience of dictatorship. While he made his home in Belgrade, his
films were frequently invited to the Berlin, Venice and Cannes film
festivals, with his deadpan comedy ``Special Treatment'' winning a
Golden Globe nomination for best foreign film in 1980. It also
earned him a two-year ban on making films in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film was an allegory about a dictator, and I was asked by
The Hollywood Reporter whom I meant,'' the director recalled with a
laugh. ``I said, Stalin. And they asked, Tito? And I said, yes,
Tito also. After that, I couldn't get work in Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, he made his first English-language film, ``Twilight
Time,'' starring Karl Malden as an old man bringing up his two
grandchildren. Four more films followed before he worked again in
English in 1995 in ``Someone Else's America,'' starring Tom Conti
and Miki Manojlovic (who is also in ``Cabaret Balkan'').
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing this film in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said
that the two actors infused the movie ``with enough soulfulness to
lend a crude modern fairy tale about immigrants pursuing the
American dream a heartwarming sweetness.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning home from filming that movie in Brooklyn, however,
Paskaljevic felt the need to address the crisis in Serbia. He
obtained a small grant from the Ministry of Culture to make ``The
Powder Keg.'' But his hopes of supposedly guaranteed financial help
from Serbian state television evaporated once he presented the
final screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the film's $1.2 million budget eventually covered by
co-producers in France, Greece, Turkey and Macedonia, he was able
to present it at last year's Venice Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   When Paskaljevic told an Italian newspaper that ``the
totalitarian and intolerant regime of Milosevic'' was destroying
Serbia, however, he was promptly accused of ``infantile treason''
by the pro-government Serbian newspaper, Politika, which also noted
suggestively that other infamous intellectual traitors had been
executed or had committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian authorities then refused to distribute the film, but
the director found an independent theater in Belgrade that was
willing to show it. And it caught on through word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already 250,000 people have been to see the movie in
Belgrade,'' he said. ``Young people treated it like a cult film. My
idea was to shock people, to punch them. But many young people came
out laughing and saying, `Listen, the reality is much worse than
your film.'''
</P>
<P>
   Paskaljevic was particularly pleased by the movie's reception in
Sarajevo, even though, at a post-screening press conference, a
Bosnian journalist asked the director and his actors to state what
each had done during the siege of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Listen, I will answer,''' he recalled. ` ``First of
all, you have no right to ask that because I am not on trial here.
I came with good will, and I am very proud to be a Serb. But I have
to tell you that I am ashamed of what we did in Sarajevo, and I
came to apologize for that. I didn't do it, but somebody did it in
my name.'''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Paskaljevic says he is no less ashamed of what Serbia has
just done in Kosovo, but he also wants to look to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that Serbia wake up and say we are also
responsible for what is happening to us,'' he said. ``We must be
aware of what is happening in Kosovo; we have to face the facts and
look to the future. Our tragic mistake is that we are always
looking to the past. We have to cut ourselves off from our myths of
the past and see where we are today and what is going to be our
place tomorrow. We can only do this through democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   For his next movie, though, Paskaljevic plans to leave the
Balkans far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot make another film in Yugoslavia now,'' he said.
``Even if I could find the financing, I would repeat myself, it
would be `Powder Keg II.' I need a pause, I need distance. So I'm
going to shoot on location in Mexico. Mexico will enable me to meet
a different world. Then I'll go back to Yugoslavia and make another
film.''
</P>
<P>
   And by then, he hopes, it will also be a different Yugoslavia.

ALL-STAR BONANZA BIGGER THAN EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Tourism officials sharply increased their estimate of
the impact of the All-Star Game on the Boston economy Wednesday,
citing the unanticipated success of the John Hancock FanFest and
evidence of higher-than-expected retail sales in and near Fenway
Park on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball had estimated that the game and ancillary
events from Friday through Tuesday would spur $62 million of
spending locally, based on the economic performances in Denver,
Cleveland, Philadelphia and other cities that recently have hosted
the game. Local tourism officials had pegged the financial impact
lower, at about $50 million to $54 million, saying in part they
anticipated fewer people attending events and spending less money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the early returns, I think we can safely say that
the number is going to be much more along the lines of what Major
League Baseball told us to expect,'' said Patrick B. Moscaritolo,
president and chief executive of the Greater Boston Convention &AMP;
Visitors Bureau, who helped bring the game to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A financial performance at about that level would put Boston at
the top among recent host cities. Spending tied to the All-Star
Game has ranged from $28 million in Pittsburgh in 1994 to about $58
million in Denver last year.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reason for the strong performance in Boston is the
increasing popularity of the All-Star Game's FanFest. About 110,000
fans attended the event in the Hynes Convention Center, about 38
percent more than had been anticipated. The event set single-day
attendance records for indoor staging on Saturday, Sunday and
Monday, and records for sales of licensed goods (in excess of
$500,000) and concessions (in excess of $450,000).
</P>
<P>
   ``We had expected a lot from FanFest, and it exceeded our
expectations,'' said Stephen Burgay, vice president of advertising
and public affairs at the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly thought that we'd never get more than 80,000 to
85,000 at FanFest,'' he said. ``People are ecstatic about that.''
</P>
<P>
   It also appears that the well-heeled crowd in attendance at the
game spent more on licensed goods than officials had anticipated.
Moscaritolo cited several conversations with suppliers of goods
licensed by Major League Baseball and concessionaires as strong
evidence that people spent significantly more money than
anticipated on Tuesday, just before and during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that people usually spend $10 to $12 at baseball games
on shirts, uniforms, caps and other souvenirs,'' Moscaritolo said.
``You would expect more at an All-Star Game, but we are hearing
stories from suppliers about people spending an average of $250 at
Twins Enterprises across the street from Fenway Park and in the
booths set up outside of the stadium in the four hours before the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hearing that $700,000 was spent on souvenirs inside the
park itself,'' Moscaritolo said. ``That's a huge number.''

KOSOVARS FINDING IT HARD TO RESTORE LEGAL IDENTITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ It was the ultimate indignity for Kosovo
refugees lucky enough to make it to the border alive, and now it is
shaping up as a bureaucratic nightmare for those who have returned:
the destruction of the ethnic Albanians' personal documents.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the documents have been burned: hundreds of thousands of
identification cards, passports, driver's licenses, automobile
license plates and work records that made up the life history of
the Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Those who made it to Morina Pass in Albania, or to Macedonia,
were forced to hand over all their documents to Serbian police,
reducing the Albanians to officially nameless figures without a
history, either as a people or as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't document anything about ourselves now,'' said Ali
Kelmendi, 39. ``It's like you're not a man anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody in town knows that I worked for 20 years, but I can't
prove it,'' said Kelmendi, who ran a small business before the war.
``It was all in my burned house.''
</P>
<P>
   In a war full of anonymous massacres, mass burials and unmarked
graves, even the survivors were deprived of their sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   Marched in long columns, packed into buses and trucks like farm
animals, and forced to leave Kosovo, virtually all of the refugees
all were subjected to the same parting shot. A card table was set
up at border stations, refugees say, and a gun-wielding Serb
policeman forced them to empty their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   This, the final step in the Serbs' ethnic ``cleansing campaign''
to drive Albanians from the province where they constituted 90
percent of the population, eradicated any record that the Albanians
had lived, learned, worked and owned property in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took everything, and they burned everything'' at the
border, said Naser Gjuka, 40. They didn't leave any chance for us
to prove we are Albanians, or even humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of identity papers is personally unsettling for the
returning refugees, and it also presents a massive complication for
a province struggling toward some kind of order and interim
governance.
</P>
<P>
   Without documents, the government-in-the-making cannot determine
who owns what, who worked where and for how long, and who is
eligible to drive or to receive a pension.
</P>
<P>
   International agencies haven't even begun to address the
problem, since they are still concerned with housing and feeding
Kosovars and helping them form an interim civil administration,
said Susan Manuel, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Mission in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees have registration cards issued at refugee camps in
Macedonia and Albania, but the cards show nothing other than the
fact that the individuals fled and returned to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Pristina's City Hall re-opened this week, but it will be weeks
before the provincial administration is at full force, and much
longer before it begins to assess and credential the population.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the documents have been found, and are under protection
by Kosovo Force (KFOR) soldiers, said Ron Redmond, a spokesman for
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But in many towns, records were completely destroyed, said
Volker Turk, the refugee agency's legal counsel. The only hope may
be convincing bureaucrats in Belgrade to hand over any duplicate
records they have, Turk said.
</P>
<P>
   But agencies here aren't expecting the Serbian government, which
lost total control of Kosovo when the war ended, to cooperate.
``It's a major problem,'' Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
   International officials are hoping most of the documentation
problem will be solved informally. In villages and small towns,
most Albanians knew each other, and knew where everyone lived _
enough, officials hope, to prevent major disputes over property.
</P>
<P>
   Many ethnic Albanians do not want documents issued from
Belgrade, despite the fact that Kosovo is still part of the
republic of Serbia and the nation of Yugoslavia. Passports, for
example, are typically issued by federal governments _ in this
case, the one centered in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovar Albanians, who have long hoped for the right to
travel freely and safely, say they would rather stay forever
tethered to Kosovo than to travel abroad on Yugoslav documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never want to get a Belgrade passport. Belgrade is dead for
me,'' said Shefkinazo Muhaxniri, 63.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anything from those who did this to me,'' said
Gjuka, gesturing toward his burned and looted house in Pec. ``I
don't want their documents now.''

 &HT;    Patients under scalpel
 &HT;    (This is an editorial from Thursday's Atlanta Constitution)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's called the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, but by
the time the U.S. Senate gets done with it, a better title will be
``The HMO Protection Act.''
</P>
<P>
   On amendment after amendment this week, Senate Republicans have
had their way, creating a bill that seeks to limit the rights of
HMO patients, not protect them. Start with who the bill covers.
While Democrats want to protect 161 million Americans who receive
health care through HMOs, most provisions offered by the
Republicans would cover only the 48 million whose managed-care
plans aren't regulated by states.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would let patients sue if they are harmed by an HMO's
denial of care. Patients would have no right to sue for harm under
the Republican bill, and HMOs would be liable only for the cost of
the denied treatment. The GOP version invites insurers to gamble
with the health and lives of patients. An HMO would have little to
lose financially by denying care, because at most it would have to
pay what it should have in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans fault Democrats for giving patients too much
at too high a price. They claim that patient protections will bring
a flood of litigation and drive up health insurance costs, making
it too expensive for small businesses to cover employees and
leaving more Americans with no health coverage at all.
</P>
<P>
   However, those dire predictions are based on little more than
supposition, and haven't been borne out in states that have adopted
pieces of the Democratic proposal. In Texas, for example, health
care overhaul signed into law by Gov. George W. Bush two years ago
gave patients the right to sue HMOs. The law has produced little
litigation and no cost spirals.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to credit the concern of congressional Republicans
for those who might lose their health insurance, since they have
done so little to help Americans who have no coverage. When
Republicans killed Bill Clinton's effort to provide universal
health care coverage in 1994, they said the marketplace would do
the job. If the economy is strong, Republicans predicted, more
people will have jobs and more employers will offer health-care
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has been vibrant through the five years since, yet
more Americans are without insurance now than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of the votes in the Senate have been along
party lines. Noting that lack of compromise, President Clinton has
already announced that he will veto the measure if it comes to his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on the mercies of the marketplace and the HMOs to meet
America's health care needs has not worked and will not work.
Patients need protections. That's what Congress ought to provide.

 &HT;    Time Warner, Sony to refocus CDNow on downloadable music
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time Warner wants to turn online retailer CDNow into
a digital storefront that will let customers download music from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said that the business that can benefit the most
from the Internet is music,'' said Gerald Levin, Time Warner's
chairman. ``It is easy to send music over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   To that eventual end, Time Warner and Sony announced this week
that they would merge their Columbia House music and video club
business with CDNow. Most of CDNow's business currently is as an
electronic storefront for selling regular music CDs that are
delivered by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Levin talked at length Wednesday about the merger with CDNow at
a quarterly financial luncheon with reporters. It is often attended
by Time Warner Vice Chairman Ted Turner, but he was not there this
time.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow, begun by brothers Jason and Matthew Olim, is one of the
largest online retailers of music. But to date, CDNow has just sold
regular music CDs and videos.
</P>
<P>
   Now Time Warner and Sony, which each own one of the top five
record companies, want to take CDNow to a new stage of development.
</P>
<P>
   Levin envisions CDNow as more than a digital record store. It
will also let visitors listen to music samples, check out reviews
and jump to related Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``CDNow will provide an Internet community for music,'' said
Levin. ``We see it as a place to sell and market.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said that his company began a test this week of
downloadable music at its cable TV system in San Diego. The system
is among those Time Warner upgraded to handle digital traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, which may be the first test of its kind, 800
subscribers can download an entire album in 10 minutes. In
addition, the subscribers have been provided with printers that
enable them to download and print out album covers and material
about the music and the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the technology with downloading music is doable,'' said
Levin. ``What we need now is to understand consumer behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, Time Warner is experimenting. It has hired three
research firms that will produce downloadable singles from 23 of
the company's recording artists. The singles will be distributed
through the Internet for free.
</P>
<P>
   There is a catch. The singles are demos that stop working after
30 days. This is a model used by many companies selling software
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't think people get that there is a revolution
going on with the Internet,'' said Levin.

MUTANT PLANTS ON SPACE MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By RON MATUS   The Gainesville Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ When the space shuttle Columbia blasts off
next week, mutants will be riding shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Three dozen genetically engineered plants will be on board as
part of an experiment to determine what makes plants grow poorly
during space travel.
</P>
<P>
   The plants look normal but they have been engineered so that
parts of them turn blue when they adapt to low oxygen levels, lack
of air movement and other stressful conditions associated with life
on a shuttle. Knowing what stresses plants in space _ and fixing
those problems _ is vital because plants will play a big role in
future space travel, providing food and oxygen to humans on board
and recycling waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to really be able to explore away from Earth,
we've got to understand how plants respond to these kinds of
environments,'' said Bill Knott, chief scientist in the biomedical
office at Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle is scheduled for liftoff early Tuesday, just after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment will be the first time transgenic plants _ plants
engineered to include genes from other species _ have been rocketed
into space from Cape Canaveral. The plants have a bacteria gene
added by University of Florida researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The plant at the heart of the project is Arabidopsis thaliana,
an inconspicuous, 2-inch-tall weed with white flowers. Because of
its relatively simple genetic makeup, Arabidopsis has become the
white mouse of transgenic plant research. Its small size makes it
ideal for research aboard cramped shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria gene used in the project is common in transgenic
research. UF researchers ordered it from a catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the gene into the plant is ``like equipping it with
light bulbs,'' said UF professor and molecular biologist Rob Ferl.
``This bulb comes on if condition A exists. This one turns on if
condition B exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferl has worked on the shuttle project with other UF researchers
for more than four years. The project's official name _ Transgenic
Arabidopsis Gene Expression System, or TAGES _ has mythical
overtones, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Etruscans _ people conquered by the Romans in what
is now Italy _ had a myth about a child-spirit named Tages who
arose from a freshly ploughed field to help farmers interpret the
signs of the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ferl said the genetically engineered plant should help
scientists do the same thing with plants in space.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria gene is one of many that researchers call
``reporter genes'' because they mark specific kinds of gene
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Plants, like animals, ``turn on'' different genes in response to
different environmental conditions, such as flooding or drought,
Ferl said. But without reporter genes, it's difficult to find out
which genes were turned on _ and what environmental change
triggered them.
</P>
<P>
   With the reporter gene, all the researchers have to do is apply
a stain to the plant tissues, then look for parts that change
color. The gene produces an enzyme that builds up in different
parts of the plant _ leaves, stems, roots _ depending on the source
of the stress. The dye highlights the enzyme.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia astronauts will harvest plants and apply stain twice
during the five-day mission.
</P>
<P>
   Plants have been a regular part of shuttle flights since the
early '80s and were involved with space flights even before the
shuttle program, said Knott at the space center. Astronauts have
tended to corn, wheat, peas, soybeans, sunflowers and other plants
to see how they grow with little or no gravity. They have had mixed
success.
</P>
<P>
   Like people, plants can get sick during space travel. ``With
microgravity, a lot of things don't occur like they do on earth,''
Knott said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe one problem for plants in space is that their
roots don't get enough oxygen needed for respiration. That produces
a response similar to what happens when plants are flooded.
</P>
<P>
   Ferl has been doing transgenic research for a decade and said
there's still plenty of research to be done with plants in space.
</P>
<P>
   He's proposing another space-travel project with transgenic
plants, this time using a reporter gene from a jellyfish. The gene
makes different parts of the plant glow _ in different colors _
depending on what is bothering them.
</P>
<P>
   If NASA likes that proposal, those plants could be headed to
Mars in 2003.l

SOFTWARE MAKER ORACLE TO EXPAND AROUND BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Oracle Corp., the nation's largest database software
maker, is planning to expand its Boston-area operation, hiring
about 1,000 new employees over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its growth strategy, the company is eyeing sites in
and around Boston to build a campus to house the 975 employees it
now has in the region, plus new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long-term commitment to the area and we are going
to keep growing,'' Jeffrey O. Henley, the company's chief financial
officer, said Wednesday. The consolidated site will be modeled
after a similar campus the company operates in the Washington,
D.C., suburbs, Henley said.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle will join the ranks of a handful of high-profile
technology companies that have opted to expand in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   After a long search for a new location outside its Mountain
View, Calif., home base, Sun Microsystems Inc. settled on
Burlington, Mass., where it recently built a $250 million East
Coast headquarters. Also, Lucent Technologies Inc. _ which develops
and manufactures optical networking equipment _ has said it may
expand the work force at its mammoth North Andover, Mass. plant.
</P>
<P>
   For Oracle, Boston is a natural fit: The company's East Coast
telephone sales headquarters is here, as is one of its largest
development facilities. A 273-person center Oracle operates in
Nashua, N.H. will not be affected by the new campus.
</P>
<P>
   Best-known for its database software, which is used to organize
and manage large amounts of information, Oracle has recently
shifted its focus to Internet and customer service related software
applications for which there is a huge corporate demand.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its strategy to expand into the market for electronic
commerce programs, in March the company acquired E-Travel Inc., for
$35 million in cash. E-Travel, of Concord, Mass., makes software
that allows consumersto book business trips using a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to become an e-business as fast as we can,''
Henley said. A number of large, Internet-based sales sites _
including Amazon.com and Yahoo _ already use Oracle applications.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Henley said the company is still moving forward with
plans to challenge arch rival Microsoft Corp.'s dominance in the
operating systems market.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle in December joined forces with Sun to develop a business
computer that doesn't require full operating systems such as those
Microsoft touts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the partnership, Oracle and Sun will license each other's
software to develop server computers that do not need a full
operating system. The new system is designed to reduce the need for
servers to be loaded with Microsoft's Windows, and would allow
personal computer users to link with the new machines to do things
such as read e-mail and text files.
</P>
<P>
   Henley said the new system should be available by the end of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have responded positively to the company's frenzied
pace of activity in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now they are riding a wave,'' said Bruce Raabe, an
analyst with Collins &AMP; Co., in San Francisco. ``They have kind of
been struggling the last year-and-a-half, but as of late things
have really turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Raabe points out that the company recently posted
four consecutive quarters of earnings improvement, and record
fourth-quarter growth.
</P>
<P>
   For fiscal year 1999, revenue grew 24 percent to $8.8 billion,
while net income climbed 35 percent to $1.3 billion. Fourth quarter
earnings rose 22 percent to $2.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, which trades on Nasdaq, closed at 38 and 1/16 down 5/8.

 &HT;    Time Warner earnings top expectations
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time Warner, the world's largest media company,
earned more than expected in the second quarter, fueled by higher
ad sales at its cable television networks including TNT and
magazines such as In Style.
</P>
<P>
   Net income, including gains, rose to $593 million, or 46 cents a
share, after the payment of preferred dividends, from $101 million,
or 2 cents, a year earlier. It earned 12 cents a share before
gains, double the average estimate of analysts polled by First
Call. It lost 1 cent in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 1.6
percent to $6.63 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Combined cash flow, including results from the company's Time
Warner Entertainment partnership with MediaOne Group Inc., rose 74
percent to $2.02 billion. Cash flow rose 15 percent to $1.25
billion before the gains, which resulted mainly from cable TV
system swaps. Time Warner had a pretax gain of $771 million in the
recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting unit saw revenue
rise to $1.07 billion in the second quarter, up from $906 million a
year earlier. Turner Broadcasting's operating income rose to $235
million, up from $198 million a year ago. Time Warner's shares
closed at $77.31 1/4, up $1.56 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a quarterly financial meeting with reporters here
Wednesday, Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin said the company has
reached a conceptual agreement that will let the media conglomerate
finally regain full control of its powerful film and television
studios.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement concerns Time Warner Entertainment,
which owns Warner Bros. Studio, Time Warner Cable and premium cable
channel HBO. Time Warner owns 75 percent of this partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner would regain full control of Warner Bros. and HBO
while consolidating its vast cable TV assets under the Time Warner
Entertainment umbrella. Senior Time Warner executives expressed
confidence that this will become the framework for a final deal.
</P>
<P>
   Cable operator MediaOne owns 25 percent of Time Warner
Entertainment. Time Warner and MediaOne have long quarreled over
the direction and financial value of the entertainment group. Now
MediaOne is being bought by AT&AMP;T, and the long-distance carrier has
said it has no interest in the entertainment content business.
</P>
<P>
   What AT&AMP;T does want to do is boost its cable TV operations,
which will become the nation's largest after the close of the
MediaOne purchase. AT&AMP;T wants to use its cable systems to offer
high-speed access to the Internet as well as telephone service.
Time Warner wants to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we have a partner in TWE (Time Warner
Entertainment) who agrees that it should become a cable
partnership,'' said Levin.

KASICH DROPS OUT OF GOP RACE, WILL SUPPORT BUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's stranglehold on the
Republican presidential nomination claimed its first victim
Wednesday when Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, dropped out of the race
and endorsed the GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not my time,'' said Kasich, 47, whose poll numbers
nationwide never climbed out of single digits. ``I think you have
got to be mature enough in politics and in life to be able to
accept some disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush accepted Kasich's endorsement and said he will use the
lawmaker, best known for his zeal to cut the federal budget
deficit, on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thrilled that you're part of the team, and I'm glad
you've got your uniform on, because I intend to use you,'' Bush
told Kasich. ``John can connect with a lot of folks around the
country that are looking for a different kind of campaign and a
different kind of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Kasich, who also said he will not seek re-election to
the House, stood side-by-side at an afternoon news conference at
the Ronald Reagan Building, a few block from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich and Bush joked about the possibility of a role for Kasich
in any Bush administration. Kasich was asked if he would be
interested in working for Bush as a Cabinet member or vice
president, but before Kasich could answer, Bush said loudly, ``Of
course he would.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich is being touted in GOP circles as a possible White House
budget director under Bush. In 1997, as chairman of the House
budget committee, he crafted the balanced budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush later declined to discuss Kasich's actual chances for a
post, saying he must first win his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the Texas governor has a double-digit lead over the
expected Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore. GOP pollsters
show him with a huge lead over all remaining Republican rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The Kasich announcement came on a day when Bush was in the
Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore toured Thomas A. Edison High
School in Alexandria, Va., where students demonstrated a computer
software program that enables them to design homes with
architectural precision.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the students' work, Bush quipped, ``I'm looking for a
new house _ a white one.''
</P>
<P>
   At a midday luncheon, Bush addressed 500 members of Northern
Virginia's high-tech community, including America Online Chairman
Steve Case.
</P>
<P>
   The area is among the leading high-tech regions, home to 2,500
technology companies, including MCI Worldcom, America Online,
Oracle Corp. and PSINet, and is also fertile ground for campaign
donations. Bush is said to have picked up $400,000 at the luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   While there he took a jab at Democratic assertions that
America's current economic prosperity is due to the Clinton-Gore
administration's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They no more invented prosperity than they invented the
Internet,'' Bush told the executives.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Kasich accompanied Bush on campaign stop in
Baltimore at ``The Door,'' a faith-based center that teaches
carpentry skills to the unemployed and remodels inner city homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took questions from about two dozen students in a summer
camp program there.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by one child about his religion, Bush said, ``I accepted
Jesus Christ as my savior, and I am a Methodist.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also told them about life in the governor's mansion, his
dog Spot and one of his three cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``His name is Ernie, and he's got six toes on each paw,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wasn't in a joking mood when it came to remarks that
President Clinton made Wednesday in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ridiculed Bush's description of himself as a
``compassionate conservative,'' saying the term refers to GOP
lawmakers who would like to support Democratic ideas on gun control
and education, but cannot and ``feel terrible about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he's surprised Clinton takes the time to talk about
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it amazing that the president of the United States
would spend time talking about me even before I get my parties
nomination,'' he said, with a hint of sarcasm. ``I'm honored and
I'm thrilled that the president takes time out of his busy schedule
to hold press conferences and discuss my candidacy.''

 &HT;    Another profitable quarter for AirTran
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AirTran Airways posted its second straight quarterly
profit on Wednesday, and its chief executive had tough words for
Atlanta rival Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   The discount carrier, which has headquarters in Orlando, Fla.,
but its flight hub in Atlanta, cited improving passenger loads and
internal changes by a new management team.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran posted a second-quarter profit of $15 million, or 22
cents a share, vs. $8.6 million, or 13 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose to $140 million from $124 million, despite a
slight decline in seat capacity.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the third quarterly profit for AirTran since
ValuJet, struggling to recover from a 1996 crash, bought the
carrier and adopted its name. But it followed a $3 million
first-quarter profit, a sign the recovery is gaining strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year the earnings recovery is for real,'' said James D.
Parker of SunTrust Equitable Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The results easily beat Wall Street's estimate _ 14 cents _ and
prompted heavy trading of shares in parent AirTran Holdings, up 158
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said cash reserves, which fell below $25 million
last winter, had risen to $63.2 million at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph Leonard, who
was installed in January and has brought in several other new
executives, said the rebound ``ought to send a clear signal to
Delta that they ought to quit investing in trying to kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It ought to be clear ... that they're not going to be able to
do that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran has accused Delta of illegal predatory pricing by adding
flights and cheap fares on competing routes. Delta denies doing
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said the third-quarter outlook looks ``strong,''
although he cautioned that the second quarter is usually the
airline's best because of heavy traffic on Florida routes.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Ray Neidl of ING Barings Furman Selz said AirTran ``is
still at a point where they have to establish stability and their
position in the marketplace. One or two profitable quarters do not
a turnaround make.''
</P>
<P>
   But Neidl added he has ``much more confidence in the company now
because of the results they are showing.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said he expects a ``neutral'' effect on AirTran from
criminal charges filed in Florida this week against SabreTech, a
maintenance contractor whose mistakes led to the ValuJet crash. The
case will keep the crash, and AirTran's history as ValuJet, in the
news. But it also focuses blame on SabreTech, not the airline.

NEW LOW-RATE AIRLINE IS OFFICIALLY NAMED JETBLUE AIRWAYS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN : Fla, Texas, Ill., Utah)   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is still awaiting federal regulatory approval and
still needs to find a terminal at Kennedy International Airport,
but at least the country's most ambitious new low-fare airline now
has a name.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the proposed start-up carrier that had been using the
name New Air as a place holder for the last six months announced
that it would begin service early next year as Jetblue Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference in lower Manhattan, David
Neeleman, the Airline's chief executive, also outlined the features
that he said would set Jetblue apart from its competitors. They
include fares averaging 65 percent less than those of competing
airlines; the latest computerized reservations and check-in
systems, and 24 channels of live satellite television at every
seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to bring humanity back to air travel,'' Neeleman
said, making one of several pledges that may one day return to
haunt him. He also ``guaranteed'' that Jetblue would never have any
lines when passengers arrive to check in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our low fares will bring passengers in, but our great service
will bring them back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jetblue has attracted a lot of attention because Neeleman, 39,
has managed to raise $130 million from a variety of blue-chip
investors, including the venture capital arm of Chase Manhattan
Bank and the financier George Soros, making the airline the most
richly capitalized new carrier in aviation history. Earlier this
year, he placed an order for 25 new Airbus A320 single-aisle jets
with options for 50 more.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Salt Lake City, Neeleman formerly ran Morris Air, a
low-fare carrier that was sold to Southwest Airlines in 1993. To
help him run Jetblue, which will be based at Kennedy, he has
recruited a number of well-regarded executives from other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Neeleman will not say exactly where Jetblue will fly when it
begins its service next year for fear of alerting competing
carriers. But in exchange for political support in his effort to
get an exemption from rules that limit takeoffs and landings at
Kennedy, he has promised elected officials in New York that one of
the first cities that Jetblue will serve will be either Buffalo,
Rochester or Syracuse. He has also said the airline will fly to
Burlington, Vt., a number of cities in Florida and several dozen
other destinations, including Washington, Dallas, Chicago and Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Neeleman also announced Wednesday that Jetblue had an agreement
with LiveTV, a joint venture of the Harris Corp. and Sextant
In-Flight Systems, to be one of the first airlines to feature
satellite television at every seat.
</P>
<P>
   LiveTV will equip each Jetblue's airplane with a special antenna
that will receive programming from the three satellites that
broadcast the DirecTV satellite television service, which is a unit
of the Hughes Electronics subsidiary of General Motors. For a
charge of $3 or $4 a trip, each Jetblue passenger will be able to
watch any of 24 channels on a five-inch screen.
</P>
<P>
   Neeleman said that passengers would be able to use the service
from the moment they sit down to the moment they leave the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air travel is a maddening thing sometimes,'' Neeleman said.
``This is really going to help us take the edge off it.''

KOSOVARS FINDING IT HARD TO RESTORE LEGAL IDENTITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ It was the ultimate indignity for Kosovo
refugees lucky enough to make it to the border alive, and now it is
shaping up as a bureaucratic nightmare for those who have returned:
the destruction of the ethnic Albanians' personal documents.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the documents have been burned: hundreds of thousands of
identification cards, passports, driver's licenses, automobile
license plates and work records that made up the life history of
the Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Those who made it to Morina Pass in Albania, or to Macedonia,
were forced to hand over all their documents to Serbian police,
reducing the Albanians to officially nameless figures without a
history, either as a people or as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't document anything about ourselves now,'' said Ali
Kelmendi, 39. ``It's like you're not a man anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody in town knows that I worked for 20 years, but I can't
prove it,'' said Kelmendi, who ran a small business before the war.
``It was all in my burned house.''
</P>
<P>
   In a war full of anonymous massacres, mass burials and unmarked
graves, even the survivors were deprived of their sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   Marched in long columns, packed into buses and trucks like farm
animals, and forced to leave Kosovo, virtually all of the refugees
all were subjected to the same parting shot. A card table was set
up at border stations, refugees say, and a gun-wielding Serb
policeman forced them to empty their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   This, the final step in the Serbs' ethnic ``cleansing campaign''
to drive Albanians from the province where they constituted 90
percent of the population, eradicated any record that the Albanians
had lived, learned, worked and owned property in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took everything, and they burned everything'' at the
border, said Naser Gjuka, 40. They didn't leave any chance for us
to prove we are Albanians, or even humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of identity papers is personally unsettling for the
returning refugees, and it also presents a massive complication for
a province struggling toward some kind of order and interim
governance.
</P>
<P>
   Without documents, the government-in-the-making cannot determine
who owns what, who worked where and for how long, and who is
eligible to drive or to receive a pension.
</P>
<P>
   International agencies haven't even begun to address the
problem, since they are still concerned with housing and feeding
Kosovars and helping them form an interim civil administration,
said Susan Manuel, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Mission in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees have registration cards issued at refugee camps in
Macedonia and Albania, but the cards show nothing other than the
fact that the individuals fled and returned to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Pristina's City Hall re-opened this week, but it will be weeks
before the provincial administration is at full force, and much
longer before it begins to assess and credential the population.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the documents have been found, and are under protection
by Kosovo Force (KFOR) soldiers, said Ron Redmond, a spokesman for
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But in many towns, records were completely destroyed, said
Volker Turk, the refugee agency's legal counsel. The only hope may
be convincing bureaucrats in Belgrade to hand over any duplicate
records they have, Turk said.
</P>
<P>
   But agencies here aren't expecting the Serbian government, which
lost total control of Kosovo when the war ended, to cooperate.
``It's a major problem,'' Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
   International officials are hoping most of the documentation
problem will be solved informally. In villages and small towns,
most Albanians knew each other, and knew where everyone lived _
enough, officials hope, to prevent major disputes over property.
</P>
<P>
   Many ethnic Albanians do not want documents issued from
Belgrade, despite the fact that Kosovo is still part of the
republic of Serbia and the nation of Yugoslavia. Passports, for
example, are typically issued by federal governments _ in this
case, the one centered in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovar Albanians, who have long hoped for the right to
travel freely and safely, say they would rather stay forever
tethered to Kosovo than to travel abroad on Yugoslav documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never want to get a Belgrade passport. Belgrade is dead for
me,'' said Shefkinazo Muhaxniri, 63.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want anything from those who did this to me,'' said
Gjuka, gesturing toward his burned and looted house in Pec. ``I
don't want their documents now.''

WAGING A PARTISAN AIR WAR IN HEALTH CARE BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Iowa, Mich., Ohio, Minn., Texas, Wash.)   (jw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On television screens across the nation's capital
this week the images were almost inescapable. One man complains
about more government red tape. A mother worries that soaring
insurance premiums could deny her sick daughter treatment. An
employer frets how health care lawsuits could cost him his small
business.
</P>
<P>
   As Senate Republicans rolled to a string of ground victories
over Democrats on managed care legislation, a barrage of ads like
this one sponsored by the Business Roundtable provided punishing
air support for the Republican offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The television air war, both nationally and here inside the
Beltway, has been a multimillion dollar struggle between several
powerful interest groups, with the insurance industry and private
employers pitted against organized labor and the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the insurers are winning a lopsided spending battle
against the Democratic bill, committing nearly $20 million this
year to the fight _ for advertising, polling and image-polishing _
compared with about $750,000 for the labor-physician coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the Democrats' bill say that the industry's ads,
claiming the bill would strip 1.8 million Americans of health
insurance, misrepresent Congressional Budget Office estimates, a
claim industry aides deny.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance companies and employers are borrowing themes
from the ``Harry and Louise'' advertising campaign that doomed
President Clinton's proposal in 1994 for universal health care
coverage, crusading in television and newspaper ads against the
cost of a Democratic bill, which they say would boost premiums and
increase the ranks of the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   One coalition of managed care companies plans to spend more than
$5 million this year on a multitiered ad and grass-roots campaign.
One ad airing in Washington features a hard-hat worker criticizing
politicians for raising his health care premiums. Another 30-second
spot in Washington says the Democratic bill is a sop for trial
lawyers eager to sue managed-care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   A third ad, running in Iowa and New Hampshire, seeks to convince
presidential candidates campaigning there that regulating managed
care companies receives a lower priority among voters than fixing
Medicare and addressing patients in industry-commissioned polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads are part of a broader political strategy,'' said
Mark Merritt, chief strategic planner for the American Association
of Health Plans, which represents more than 1,000 managed care
organizations. ``The presidential campaign will determine the
legislation in Congress this year. We wanted to get into Iowa and
New Hampshire first to impact that debate.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A separate coalition of employers and insurance companies are
mounting a two-week, $1 million television, radio and newspaper ad
campaign that criticizes the Democratic bill for raising premiums
and swelling the ranks of the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We oppose the ability to sue employers for providing health
insurance,'' said Johanna Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Business
Roundtable, an association of chief executives from the nation's
largest companies. The business groups aired ads in Michigan, Ohio,
Minnesota, Texas and Washington state, whose Republican senators
are regarded as swing votes on issue.
</P>
<P>
   Besides these frontal attacks against the Democratic bill, the
health industry has rolled out a six-month, $10.5 million
television and print ad campaign, featuring six doctors, in an
effort to buff the image of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty bad right now,'' said Roger Bolton, a senior vice
president of Aetna who also heads a coalition of health insurers,
explaining why industry recruited six doctors to say nice things
about managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Democratic bill are counterattacking, but
their ad campaigns pale in comparison. Labor, for example, is
putting $400,000 worth of ads favoring the bill on the air,
primarily in the states of Republicans, some of whom are up for
re-election next year. The American Medical Association is spending
about $300,000 for newspaper and radio ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're being outspent,'' said Dr. Thomas Reardon,
the association's president. ``But the patients are on our side of
this issue. The insurance companies are putting profits ahead of
patients.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The labor and medical association ads contend that the
Republican bill would give insurance companies the final say in
medical decisions, not doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The labor and medical association ads contend that the
Republican bill would give insurance companies the final say in
medical decisions, not doctors. ``One would let doctors make our
medical decision,'' one 30-second AFL-CIO spot says. ``The other
would keep HMO bureaucrats in charge.''  &QL;

JAPANESE LEADERS DEBATE MEANING OF PROPOSED ANTHEM 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan is expected to get an official national anthem
soon, and there's just one problem with it: people cannot quite
agree on what it is about.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the song, ``Kimigayo,'' is a paean to the emperor,
and in some people's minds it is closely linked to the militarism
of World War II and the invasion of other Asian countries. For that
reason the government until now has not ventured to give it
official status.
</P>
<P>
   But Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is now pushing to make it the
official national anthem. And since singing the praises of an
emperor is deemed inappropriate for a democratic, modern Japan, his
government is tying itself in knots reinterpreting the words to
mean just about everything but what they seem to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kimigayo'' is already widely used in place of an anthem _
played, for example, when a Japanese athlete wins a gold medal at
the Olympics _ and its words are themselves not militaristic. It
has roots going back to at least the 10th century, and the
best-known translation is:
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of years of happy reign be thine;
</P>
<P>
   Rule on, my lord, till what are pebbles now
</P>
<P>
   By age united to mighty rocks shall grow
</P>
<P>
   Whose venerable sides the moss doth line.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the words, to ordinary Japanese it is simply a
patriotic song. Still, although the ``kimi'' in ``Kimigayo'' can
mean you, in this context it pretty clearly means your majesty.
Likewise, the ``yo'' means age or era, so the title literally means
``Your Majesty's Era.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the foreign ministry early this year circulated an
English-language leaflet saying the song meant ``The Reign of Our
Emperor.'' But then the government hurriedly recalled all copies of
that leaflet, and last month Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka
said it did not represent the government's understanding of
``Kimigayo.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi weighed in, saying the ``kimi'' in ``kimigayo'' refered
to the emperor as a symbol of the people, and ``yo'' meant country.
Thus Obuchi presumably would translate it as something like ``The
Reign of Our Emperor _ But Only as a Symbol of the People.''
</P>
<P>
   The government then explained in a statement that the song ``is
a prayer for prosperity and peace of a Japan that holds the emperor
as the symbol of Japan and the unity of its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has seemed very convinced by that. The Communist Party
immediately objected that if ``kimi'' meant emperor and ``yo''
meant nation, then the anthem's title meant ``The Emperor's
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If `kimi' means the emperor, it is incompatible with the
principle of the sovereignty of the people, the defining principle
of the constitution,'' one of Japan's leading newspapers, Asahi
Shinbun, said in an editorial protesting the move to give the song
official status.
</P>
<P>
   Even as its meaning gets muddier and muddier, the song itself is
getting closer to adoption as the official national anthem.
Officials are quick to say that foreign countries should not see
that as threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see it as a move toward an assertive kind of
nationalism, but as a confirmation of the status quo,'' said
Sadaaki Numata, the foreign ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign criticism has been moderate, but newspaper editorials in
Singapore and Hong Kong have criticized Tokyo for moving to give
official status to ``Kimigayo'' and, at the same time, to the
hinomaru flag. Like the song, the flag has been widely used but
only now is being made the official national flag.
</P>
<P>
   Critics see both as emblematic of Japan's militaristic past.
Characteristically, the most colorful complaints have come from
North Korea. An editorial in the North's leading newspaper, Rodong
Sinmun, said the real issue was ``the Japanese government's attempt
to imbue its people with militarism,'' and it added:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not difficult to guess what road the schoolchildren will
take in future, after receiving education intended to justify
Japan's past crimes, worshiping hinomaru and singing `Kimigayo.'
Japan is now rushing headlong toward reinvasion of Asia.''

REMOLDING BURROUGHS' TARZAN TO FIT DISNEY'S MODERN MYTHOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending to correct slug; moved earlier as CRITICS-NOTEBOOK)  (Critic's Notebook) 
(bl) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the stunningly animated Disney film ``Tarzan,'' there is
little doubt about the evil tendencies of a big-chinned character
named Clayton: he wants to cage friendly apes, has little respect
for women and likes to shoot first and ask questions later. He
embodies egotistical maleness, a quality that, outside action
films, has become the epitome of contemporary villainy.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, though, the Clayton that Edgar Rice Burroughs
created. In the 1912 novel, Clayton is not an imperialist game
hunter ready to sell Tarzan's apes into slavery. He is Tarzan's
nobly born father.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's transformation of Clayton from extraordinary ancestor
to villainous nemesis is just part of a major revision of the
Tarzan story that has largely gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   The film is likely to become a Disney classic, but along the way
it remolded the ape-man to fit Disney mythology, a mythology that
began to take shape more than 60 years ago and is inextricably
linked to American attitudes toward race, ethnicity and culture.
</P>
<P>
   But before leaping onto those knotted vines, consider the
original novel. However marred it is by racial stereotypes and
occasional banalities, its ambitions are grand and unexpectedly
intelligent. Lord John Clayton is commissioned by Her Majesty's
government to investigate a competing imperial power's ``unfair
treatment of black British subjects'' in a West African colony. The
black natives are being indentured into a form of slavery, and
Clayton is dispatched to see justice done. He is meant to reflect
the noble side of what Kipling called the ``white man's burden.''
He is to enforce the ideals of civilization among the civilized.
</P>
<P>
   But from the very start he sees just how thin that veneer of
civilization is. On the boat that is transporting him, a crew of
``brutal,'' ``coarse'' seamen mutiny and split their captain's head
open with an ax. Clayton is saved by a friend among the crew
members who sends him a ``crude message printed in uncouth
letters'' warning him of the mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The friend does him another favor with far less pleasant
consequences: Clayton and his pregnant wife are dropped off in the
uncharted jungle instead of being killed. Clayton's first vision is
of a fearsome manlike figure in the distance, which turns out to be
a vicious ape, the inverse image of his future son, an apelike
figure who turns into a man.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history, with pulpish smatterings of ``Robinson
Crusoe,'' ``The Jungle Book'' and ``Heart of Darkness'' along the
way. The Claytons die, and their infant son is raised by apes.
</P>
<P>
   But Burroughs keeps beating the drum for one of his main themes:
It is difficult to tell the civilized world _ with its vicious
mutineers, ruthless imperialists and plotting capitalists _ from
the jungle world. The main difference seems to be in surface
manners: Tarzan wipes his ``greasy fingers upon his naked thighs''
after feasting on raw flesh, while in London his cousin Lord
Clayton follows his roasted meat course by dipping his fingertips
in a ``silver bowl of scented water.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise the similarities are rampant. The apes' communal
gatherings are ancestors of the ``forms and ceremonials of modern
church and state.'' The ship's mutineers devour human flesh just as
the jungle cannibals do.
</P>
<P>
   Tarzan, though, finally discovers the differences (partly helped
by what Burroughs imperially thinks of as his ``noble blood''). He
learns to read and write from the picture-book primers he finds in
the Claytons' cabin. He ends up becoming ruler of the apes not by
brute force but by applying strategy, delaying gratification and
using tools. Tarzan masters nature while learning culture; in the
book, his first spoken language is French.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this was stripped away by dozens of other Tarzan films,
but in Disney's version, the transformation is meticulous and
deliberate. Tarzan's father's name is given to a callous blockhead.
Tarzan's laborious and solitary attempts to cultivate his
``higher'' qualities are turned into a lighthearted exploration of
human identity with Jane and her father.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his cynicism, Burroughs left no doubt about
civilization's achievements. But in Disney's version, the apes end
up seeming more sympathetically human than their hunters.
</P>
<P>
   What does this have to do with Disney mythology? Well, animated
Disney films _ from ``Snow White'' to ``Mulan'' _ have almost
always been about outsiders, like Tarzan, seeking a home in an
inhospitable world. These figures are rejected, isolated, alien,
the victims of jealousy, snobbery, banality and hatred. This is why
the ``ethnic'' _ a word that now connotes being outside a
mainstream _ has been such a recurring Disney trope.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every animated Disney film has important ethnic
characters (who often get the best songs): the black crows in
``Dumbo,'' the jazz-playing alley cats of ``The Aristocats,'' the
Italian cooks in ``Lady and the Tramp,'' the Jamaican crab in ``The
Little Mermaid,'' the Gypsy in ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame.''
Sometimes the portraits verge on racial caricature. (James
Baskett's portrayal of Uncle Remus in ``Song of the South'' in
1946, for example, will probably never be released in video form.)
</P>
<P>
   But mainly the ethnic is granted a wisdom that will help the
hero or heroine, a fellow outsider, find acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The real villains are the racists and nativists who reject all
difference and insist on exclusion: the other elephants in
``Dumbo,'' for example, or the narrow-minded Gaston of ``Beauty and
the Beast.'' Despite the right-wing reputation Walt Disney himself
had, the studio's films have long honored a version of melting-pot
liberalism. The outsider is welcomed, the tramp civilized, the
beast turned human, the mainstream transformed.
</P>
<P>
   This theme changed slightly in the 1990s under the influence of
ethnic politics. Why strive to join a middle when the middle should
be asked to respect the margin? Instead of seeking integration,
films were preoccupied with identity and separation. The notion of
a mainstream nonethnic culture seemed to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pocahontas'' presented a declaration of ethnic independence:
the outsider (the intruding white man) was a danger. Similarly
``The Lion King'' celebrated an ethnic culture (the African
``Circle of Life'') that needed protection from outside attack (by
the campy heathen Scar). ``Mulan'' extended the genre by allying
gender-bending feminism with ardent ethnic assertion: the Chinese
repel their invaders with the help of a woman dressed as a man and
men dressed as women.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Tarzan,'' which would seem to be a kind of hybrid of
earlier Disney modes. Like the Little Mermaid and the Beast, Tarzan
is an outsider who yearns to be accepted in a society he seems ill
suited for (even if, in his case, it is not human). He is
heartbroken over his difference from his jungle family, but firmly
declares, ``I'll be the best ape ever,'' an immigrant determined to
earn his credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The path isn't easy. The ape king, who rejects the pale-skinned
human boy, is challenged by Tarzan: ``Why are you threatened by
anyone different from you?'' But then comes acceptance; at the
point of death, the ape king names Tarzan heir: ``Take care of our
family, my son.'' This melting-pot acceptance is then joined with a
``Lion King'' style celebration of a beleaguered ethnicity: taking
care means defending the clan against the alien, white and human
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   But as if holding a finger to the cultural winds, the Disney
team also uses the story to give these ideas an even more
contemporary twist. Tarzan cannot fully oppose the human nor fully
join the apes. He is like the child of a biracial or bicultural
marriage. The ethnic issue is by no means clear; allegiance can be
declared, but it can't be made absolute. The xenophobic ape and the
xenophobic human, with their opposing versions of ethnic supremacy,
are both to be scorned. Ethnic pride must be tempered.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few hints of this idea in ``Pocahontas,'' which
seemed to set up a symmetry between the more extreme Indians and
colonists. But in the end, sides were taken in favor of the
pastoral ethnics. Even in ``Tarzan,'' remnants of this advocacy
remain. The West is hardly held up as a cultural paragon: the movie
ends with the decent humans deciding to remain in the jungle,
swinging through the trees.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Tarzan,'' unlike any other recent-vintage Disney film,
allegiance to a single culture is part of the problem, not part of
the solution: the message is cultural equivalence. This is really
where Burroughs' novel is stood on its post-colonial head. There
are no distinctions to be made. There is no higher wisdom, no
inborn nobility, no human superiority.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Disney myth, which originally celebrated the melting
pot, now honors the latest version of democratic multiculturalism
with Tarzan as its unlikely prophet. This is why Clayton could not
survive in his old form; he would have been a reminder, however
flawed, that there might be some distinctions worth making.
</P>
<P>
   It only looks as if Tarzan remains in the jungle at the movie's
end. Actually, he is right at home.  &QL;

 &HT;    World's biggest company is a matter of dispute
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't get in an argument over which is the world's
biggest company, because you'll have a hard time proving which one
it is.
</P>
<P>
   If you cite Fortune (Aug. 2) as your authority, you can claim it
is General Motors, with 1998 revenue of $161.32 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But if you depend for backup on Forbes (July 26), you can wager
that General Electric is the world's biggest corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is in methodology. Fortune ranks its 500 global
giants by revenue, while Forbes uses a performance formula based on
a combination of sales, profits, assets and market value.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you look at it, 1998 wasn't a happy year for the world's
largest corporations. Fortune's Global 500 group eked out an almost
imperceptible 0.1 percent gain in revenue, while profits sank 2.6
percent _ the first decline since 1992. Excluding a one-time gain
at No. 3 Ford, the group's profits fell 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But 1999 is a different matter. Forbes reports that 11 of the 16
nations that have at least five companies on its 500 list have
economies that are expanding at least 2 percent in real terms, and
with inflation rates below 3 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   Among Georgia-based companies, Home Depot ranks highest on the
Fortune list at 96th place with 1998 revenue of $30.22 billion.
There are no Georgia companies on Forbes' Super-50 list. All the
other companies are listed nation-by-nation.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which sells probably the world's best-known product
and has been known to rank high up on Fortune's global list, came
in last year at 201st place _ unchanged from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   (Incidentally, Business Week came up with still another No. 1
company for its Global 1,000 list, published last week. Ranked by
market value, Microsoft was the biggest in 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Editors of Mutual Funds (August) say in their magazine's
midyear forecast edition that rising interest rates will slow the
bull market in the second half but will not result in a bear
market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Business Week (July 19) says in a special section devoted to
retirement planning that ``making decisions far enough in advance''
is at least as important as building the best plan.

CLINTON SUPPORTS GORE'S CALL FOR LICENSING OF HANDGUN OWNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ President Clinton on Wednesday called for licensing
of handgun owners and said the question before the nation was
``Will we have common-sense gun laws, or government by the gun
lobby?''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council, the
centrist party group he credits with providing the values behind
his administration's policies, he said: ``We ought to take the next
step on licensing people who own handguns to make sure that they
are trained to use the guns and that they should have them, and
that would solve all the loopholes, because if you had a bad
background, you couldn't get a license, you couldn't own one.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton raised the issue in the context of praising Vice
President Al Gore, who called for licensing of handgun owners on
Monday, and said other candidates for president should follow
Gore's example of making specific promises. ``You probably ought to
tell people what you're going to do when you get the job, and then
you would be more likely to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the president appeared to acknowledge the difficulty of
enacting such legislation _ something he said three weeks ago
Congress would not pass _ when he told his audience that his
success in balancing the budget showed ``We can do things that are
not imaginable at the moment if we will have good ideas and work on
them in a disciplined way.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave the vice president another boost when the White
House announced that the president would join in five fund-raising
events for the Gore campaign, one in Arkansas on Aug. 7, and four
in Washington, two on Aug. 10 and two on Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton discussed his latest budget proposal and the need
for the country to tend to the poorest of its citizens, campaign
politics was plainly on his mind. He began his remarks by offering
a dismissive interpretation of ``compassionate conservatism,'' the
term that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the leading Republican
presidential candidate, uses to describe his approach to government
and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said: ``This compassionate conservatism has a great ring
to it, you know. It sounds so good. And I've really worked hard to
try to figure out what it means. I mean, I made an honest effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as near as I can tell, here's what it means: It means, `I
like you, I do. And I would like to be for the patients' bill of
rights, and I'd like to be for closing the gun show loophole, and
I'd like not to squander the surplus and save Social Security and
Medicare for the next generation. I'd like to raise the minimum
wage. I'd like to do these things. But I just can't, and I feel
terrible about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The president also raised another likely Democratic campaign
theme, when he recalled the administration of President George
Bush, the governor's father. ``We may have to remind our fellow
citizens in times to come just what it was like back then _ how
high the unemployment was, how stagnant the wages were, how steeply
growing the inequality was, how fast the social conditions were
worsening.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush himself arrived in Baltimore as the president was
leaving and tying up downtown traffic for 40 minutes. The Texan
visited an inner-city school, where a student asked him if he would
support an increase in the minimum wage. He did not answer but said
that he was worried about ``pricing people out of work.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN _ Back in 1966, the old apartheid government, flexing
its racist brawn, declared that the city's most famous mixed-race
neighborhood would now be a whites-only area and promptly began
bulldozing the houses.
</P>
<P>
   It dumped the residents in faraway shantytowns and tract houses
that, with an extra fillip of cynicism, it had named after the
streets they had been forced off: Hanover Park, Lavender Hill and
so on.
</P>
<P>
   Their lively neighborhood, known for a century as District Six,
was renamed Zonnebloem _ Afrikaans for sunflower.
</P>
<P>
   The name never took root except on official maps, and since
then, almost no one has been shameless enough to build on the land.
Cape Town architects refused commissions on it. It sits, largely
vacant and grassy, prime real estate with lovely mountain and sea
views, only blocks from downtown.
</P>
<P>
   It is dotted with the mosques and churches that the government
did not dare rip down, a technical college and police barracks it
put up to grind its heel into the landscape, and one or two
condominium developments occupied by, as one local put it, ``whites
from the old Rhodesia or upcountry who didn't know any better or
didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, smack in the middle of the wasteland, sits a new museum
that commemorates the old neighborhood. It has gathered a few
knickknacks since opening in 1994: the faded green pushcart a
vegetable man used for 70 years, street signs that a guilt-ridden
white demolition foreman rescued from the rubble, the doors of the
Little Wonder general store.
</P>
<P>
   But its centerpiece is on the floor, covered in scuffed plastic:
a giant map of District Six. Upon it, visitors are encouraged to
take a pen and mark where they once lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, I heard this haunting noise, and it was this man,
sitting on the map, just howling like a dog,'' said Sandra
Prosalendis, the museum's director. ``He went into this Sam Shepard
soliloquy _ they had poured concrete down his plumbing to force him
out. He and three of his daughters ended up in an asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just didn't believe they would be moved. There was one
man _ every day, he made the bulldozer driver a cup of tea. He
thought he'd be spared because of his kindness. But when it came
his turn, they took out his furniture and had his house down in 20
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the tiny streets on the map no longer exist. P.W.
Botha, who was then minister of community development before
becoming president, did to District Six what Haussmann did to Paris
_ smashed boulevards through it regardless of the homes. But his
legacy is not Paris, but dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The museum displays a photo of Richmond Street 35 years ago: a
narrow cobbled street full of barefoot children, thin doorways and
an open sewer. But step out of the Moravian Church, where the
museum is temporarily housed, gaze on the very spot, and all one
sees is bare asphalt and an unfinished rugby field that a local
tree-trimmer uses as a dump.
</P>
<P>
   After putting their Xs on the map, the visitors are encouraged
to write about themselves on sheets of muslin next to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy Days of Ekcard Street,'' Wilmie Moodie wrote. ``I used
to live behind the Avalon Bioscope where we, as children, sneaked
through the paying inlet to watch the movies. Never did anyone
chased us because we never had no money. I am sorry for what was
done through our apartheid era. Keep up, South Africa, keep up. We
will survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Another visitor signed herself this way: ``Rehana Desai,
daughter of Barney Desai. Elected Councilor, District 6, 1962, he
was unable to take his seat as he was a banned person. This exhibit
brings to life all the stories he told us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 40,000 or more residents were scattered, and subdivided
again _ ``Cape Coloreds'' to one area, ``Cape Malays'' to another,
``Indians'' to a third _ many never saw each other again.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Fortune, who works at the museum, remembers the day a
hairdresser she had not seen for decades came in. She went home and
came back with the hot comb she once wielded.
</P>
<P>
   ``No chemicals _ I think she adapted a technique
African-Americans used,'' Mrs. Fortune said. ``It was iron, and the
teeth were all bent, but she still used it.''
</P>
<P>
   Noor Ebrahim, who also works there, showed an exhibit of his
family's pictures. It isn't small: his grandfather, from India,
became a ginger-beer baron, fathered 30 children by four successive
wives and bought each child a house. In 1975 the government paid
Ebrahim's father 1,500 rand (worth about $1,725 at the time) for
his six-room home worth 25,000 rand, and laid it flat.
</P>
<P>
   The area was a slum, but the people who lived there loved it.
One wall is all jazz musicians, some of whom are shown jamming with
American sailors on shore leave. (District Six is soon to become
more famous in a musical, ``Kat and the Kings,'' that opens on
Broadway in August.)
</P>
<P>
   Now there are efforts at restitution. About 2,500 claims have
been made for payment or spots in any low-cost housing that the
local government decides to build in District Six, said Wallace
Mgoqi, the country's Chief Land Claims Commissioner. The
post-apartheid government made itself liable for seizures made by
the old government and has paid out about $9 million for claims
elsewhere in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The removals were, as Faizel Davis of 30 Bruce St. wrote on the
muslin, ``a real tragedy,'' adding, ``I was part of that people,
and it must never, never happen again.''

HILLARY CLINTON CALLS FOR TOUGHER ANTI-GUN LAWS
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Filed in the ``a'' and ``p'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE CENTRE, N.Y. _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told
a group of suburban New Yorkers concerned about school safety that
she favors a more comprehensive gun-control agenda than the plans
favored by the president and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating the same independence from the White House she has
shown in recent remarks on other issues, the first lady took a
harder edge on the gun issue during a stop on the second week of
her ``listening tour'' of New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good proposals out there,'' Hillary Clinton
said at a forum on violence in schools. ``But I think that we ought
to move toward a much more comprehensive anti-gun, gun-control
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, did not give specifics, saying ``Frankly,
anything beyond what is being advocated right now is going to need
more public support.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady made her comments after listening to people
affected by gun violence and hearing from parents in Rockville
Centre, an affluent suburb of New York, who said more is needed to
be done to keep children from having access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   Alice McEnany of Hicksville, Long Island, said she never thought
much about guns until she received a phone call nearly five years
ago telling her that her son, Jason, then a student at the State
University of New York at Albany, had been wounded by a gunman.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1994 a gunman held 37 students and a professor
hostage before Jason, now 24, tackled him, getting shot in the leg
and stomach in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want gun legislation,'' McEnany said. ``I haven't run
across one person who doesn't feel like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnany said she favors legislation that would require guns to
have safety locks, raise the minimum age to own a handgun from 18
to 21 and to require people to wait three days before obtaining a
weapon from a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed such legislation in May but the House defeated
a similar plan last month. Gore, campaigning for the Democratic
presidential nomination earlier this week, proposed measures that
include requiring gun owners to carry photo licenses and limiting
gun purchases to one per month.
</P>
<P>
   After McEnany spoke, Clinton said Americans need to ``stand up
to'' the National Rifle Association. She also mistakenly referred
to Jason as having been murdered, but McEnany quickly corrected
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you like it or not, the NRA gets organized ... they
flood congressional offices with thousands of letters and phone
calls,'' Clinton said of the defeated House bill. ``Because most
citizens think this legislation is so sensible, they don't
understand they need to make their voices heard.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50 parents, educators, and community activists, along with
Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., attended the school violence event
that was held at South Side Middle School. McCarthy, whose husband
was killed and her son wounded by an gunman on the Long Island
Railroad in 1993, has been a staunch gun-control advocate since
being elected to Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The school violence session was part of Clinton's visits to New
York as she decides whether to formally run for the U.S. Senate
seat being vacated next year by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Her position on guns is the latest signal that she would take an
independent course in her bid for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In a high profile break with her husband's policies, for
example, the first lady last week said she considers Jerusalem
``the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, who have resisted congressional
pressure to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, have
never publicly adopted Israel's contention that Jerusalem is the
``eternal and indivisible'' capital of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   During the gun session in Rockville Centre Wednesday, which also
included a discussion about school funding, Clinton said one way to
give more money to New York schools is to ``make sure New York gets
its fair share'' of federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said New Yorkers pay $14.2 billion more in federal taxes
than they receive back in benefits from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   She said shifting that balance would require lawmakers from
large states like Illinois and California to band together with New
York representatives to ensure more populous states York receive
more federal money when Congress considers spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   After the two-hour forum, the first lady briefly met with
hundreds of students and parents who were packed inside the school
gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Her advice to the students was to ``stay away from guns.'' She
told the students that she and President Clinton recently met with
a young boy who accidentally shot his best friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine how you'd feel if you shot your best
friend?,'' she said. ``If you have parents who have guns in the
house, tell them to put in place a safety lock ... or keep the
ammunition separate.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day Clinton met with a small group of health care
professionals and advocates at North Shore-Long Island Jewish
Health Systems in Great Neck, where she heard about their struggles
with managed-care health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady led the Clinton administration's development of a
comprehensive blueprint to overhaul the nation's public and private
health care system in 1993. But her plan was so controversial that
neither the House nor Senate _ then controlled by Democrats _
brought it up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of sorting out to do right now in our health
care delivery system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new Marist College poll showed New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, a likely Republican candidate for Senate, leading
the first lady 47 percent to 41 percent. The poll, released
Wednesday, surveyed 500 likely voters July 11 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage
points. Neither Clinton nor Giuliani has formally declared their
Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election is a year and a half away,'' said Howard Wolfson,
Clinton's spokesman. ``Hillary Rodham Clinton is listening to
people not polls.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the first lady will attend a private fund-raiser at
an undisclosed Manhattan law firm before returning to Washington.
She is expected to return to upstate New York next week.

HILLARY CLINTON CALLS FOR TOUGHER ANTI-GUN LAWS

<P>
   ROCKVILLE CENTRE, N.Y. _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told
a group of suburban New Yorkers concerned about school safety that
she favors a more comprehensive gun-control agenda than the plans
favored by the president and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating the same independence from the White House she has
shown in recent remarks on other issues, the first lady took a
harder edge on the gun issue during a stop on the second week of
her ``listening tour'' of New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good proposals out there,'' Hillary Clinton
said at a forum on violence in schools. ``But I think that we ought
to move toward a much more comprehensive anti-gun, gun-control
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, did not give specifics, saying ``Frankly,
anything beyond what is being advocated right now is going to need
more public support.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady made her comments after listening to people
affected by gun violence and hearing from parents in Rockville
Centre, an affluent suburb of New York, who said more is needed to
be done to keep children from having access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   Alice McEnany of Hicksville, Long Island, said she never thought
much about guns until she received a phone call nearly five years
ago telling her that her son, Jason, then a student at the State
University of New York at Albany, had been wounded by a gunman.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1994 a gunman held 37 students and a professor
hostage before Jason, now 24, tackled him, getting shot in the leg
and stomach in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want gun legislation,'' McEnany said. ``I haven't run
across one person who doesn't feel like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnany said she favors legislation that would require guns to
have safety locks, raise the minimum age to own a handgun from 18
to 21 and to require people to wait three days before obtaining a
weapon from a gun show.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed such legislation in May but the House defeated
a similar plan last month. Gore, campaigning for the Democratic
presidential nomination earlier this week, proposed measures that
include requiring gun owners to carry photo licenses and limiting
gun purchases to one per month.
</P>
<P>
   After McEnany spoke, Clinton said Americans need to ``stand up
to'' the National Rifle Association. She also mistakenly referred
to Jason as having been murdered, but McEnany quickly corrected
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you like it or not, the NRA gets organized ... they
flood congressional offices with thousands of letters and phone
calls,'' Clinton said of the defeated House bill. ``Because most
citizens think this legislation is so sensible, they don't
understand they need to make their voices heard.''
</P>
<P>
   About 50 parents, educators, and community activists, along with
Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., attended the school violence event
that was held at South Side Middle School. McCarthy, whose husband
was killed and her son wounded by an gunman on the Long Island
Railroad in 1993, has been a staunch gun-control advocate since
being elected to Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The school violence session was part of Clinton's visits to New
York as she decides whether to formally run for the U.S. Senate
seat being vacated next year by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Her position on guns is the latest signal that she would take an
independent course in her bid for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In a high profile break with her husband's policies, for
example, the first lady last week said she considers Jerusalem
``the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, who have resisted congressional
pressure to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, have
never publicly adopted Israel's contention that Jerusalem is the
``eternal and indivisible'' capital of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   During the gun session in Rockville Centre Wednesday, which also
included a discussion about school funding, Clinton said one way to
give more money to New York schools is to ``make sure New York gets
its fair share'' of federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said New Yorkers pay $14.2 billion more in federal taxes
than they receive back in benefits from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   She said shifting that balance would require lawmakers from
large states like Illinois and California to band together with New
York representatives to ensure more populous states York receive
more federal money when Congress considers spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   After the two-hour forum, the first lady briefly met with
hundreds of students and parents who were packed inside the school
gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Her advice to the students was to ``stay away from guns.'' She
told the students that she and President Clinton recently met with
a young boy who accidentally shot his best friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine how you'd feel if you shot your best
friend?,'' she said. ``If you have parents who have guns in the
house, tell them to put in place a safety lock ... or keep the
ammunition separate.''
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day Clinton met with a small group of health care
professionals and advocates at North Shore-Long Island Jewish
Health Systems in Great Neck, where she heard about their struggles
with managed-care health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady led the Clinton administration's development of a
comprehensive blueprint to overhaul the nation's public and private
health care system in 1993. But her plan was so controversial that
neither the House nor Senate _ then controlled by Democrats _
brought it up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of sorting out to do right now in our health
care delivery system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new Marist College poll showed New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, a likely Republican candidate for Senate, leading
the first lady 47 percent to 41 percent. The poll, released
Wednesday, surveyed 500 likely voters July 11 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage
points. Neither Clinton nor Giuliani has formally declared their
Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election is a year and a half away,'' said Howard Wolfson,
Clinton's spokesman. ``Hillary Rodham Clinton is listening to
people not polls.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the first lady will attend a private fund-raiser at
an undisclosed Manhattan law firm before returning to Washington.
She is expected to return to upstate New York next week.

BANKS WORRY ABOUT LOSSES ON LOANS AS CHINA REWRITES RULES ON
GUARANTEES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Foreign banks that are fearful of huge losses on
loans they had thought were guaranteed are seeking to restart
deadlocked negotiations with Chinese officials on ways to salvage a
troubled state-owned company that owes $5.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to sort this out,'' Neil McCauley, a senior executive
at Standard Chartered Bank and chairman of the steering committee
for the creditors, said Wednesday. ``Everyone is in close contact
with everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government of Guangdong province, which owns
Guangdong Enterprises, abruptly announced that it would stop making
interest payments on the debt. The provincial government's action
came after the creditors rebuffed a complex proposal to overhaul
Guangdong Enterprises, in which the banks and the government would
have shared the company's losses.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the loans were guaranteed by the provincial government,
the banks demanded that Guangdong repay them by injecting an
additional $1.8 billion of assets into the financially stricken
company.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse underscores the gap between foreign lenders and
government in China. As China sets out to overhaul its corporate
sector, it is rewriting the rules on lending to companies. It is
abandoning old practices that allowed the banks to make cozy deals
with provincial officials while paying little regard to
creditworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   The banks are not accepting the new reality without a fight.
Scarcely a day after Guangdong officials presented their plan to
overhaul Guangdong Enterprises in May, the creditors dismissed it
as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creditors are really being tough,'' said Andy Xie, a
strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Hong Kong. ``But
they're not being realistic. This will go down to the wire, and the
creditors will have to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have not hesitated to take an uncompromising stance
before. Last October, they forced another troubled state-owned
company, Guangdong International Trust and Investment, or Gitic,
into bankruptcy, after it sank under $4.3 billion in debt. Although
the debts of Guangdong Enterprises are even larger, the Chinese
officials say they believe it is worth saving.
</P>
<P>
   Salvaging Guangdong Enterprises is not the same as bailing it
out, however. Under the terms of the provincial government's plan,
the company's main Hong Kong subsidiary would be recapitalized by
the grant of a profitable water business. Also, equity would be
swapped for a portion of the company's debt.
</P>
<P>
   The creditors estimate that the proposal would result in 20
percent to 40 percent losses on their loans. Banks that lent money
to the company's most troubled Hong Kong subsidiary, a food
distribution company, Guangnan Holdings, could end up with losses
of more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creditors disagree with the fundamental premise that the
government and the banks should share the pain equally,'' said a
person involved in the talks. ``They still feel the loans were
guaranteed by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese officials have taken a tough line, analysts say
they cannot afford to alienate the banks. Foreign banks recoiled
after Gitic was thrown into bankruptcy, and they cut off loans and
raised the prospect of a credit shortage in China's already slowing
economy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the provincial government has tried hard to distinguish
its treatment of Guangdong Enterprises from that of Gitic. Although
it stopped paying off the company's debt in January, it continued
making interest payments _ mostly as a good will gesture. The
government also hired Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. to draft a proposal that
would conform with international standards.
</P>
<P>
   Executives involved in the talks said the Chinese official
overseeing the process, the executive vice governor of Guangdong,
Wang Qishan, had taken a political risk in proposing such a
revamping of the debt. The pre-emptory dismissal by the banks put
Wang in an awkward position, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wang Qishan had to sell to party officials in Beijing that he
wanted to do this in a Western way,'' one executive said. ``Then he
got a slap in the face by the creditors.''
</P>
<P>
   China's decision to suspend interest payments is regarded by the
creditors as a way for Wang to reassert his role. In what could be
further pressure, rumors circulated here this week that the Chinese
had prepared a plan to liquidate Guangdong Enterprises _ much as
they did with Gitic. &QL;

SEATTLE'S SAFECO FIELD HAS A HIT ON ITS HANDS WITH PUBLIC ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If Ries Neimi hadn't been picked to make art for
Safeco Field, he would have known why. Although he scores high as
an artist who works well on public projects, he scores low as a
fan. For Safeco Field, the Seattle Mariners new ballpark that opens
Thursday, being a fan mattered. The art review panel in charge
wanted the artists to love the game, and Neimi couldn't claim that.
</P>
<P>
   He made the cut anyway, the only one of the 11 selected who
doesn't pledge allegiance to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   This feat he accomplished by padding his resume. He took credit
for creating giant baseball-card gates for the non-existent Congo
Caterpillars Stadium in Zaire. He offhandely alluded to the series
of oversized steel jerseys he made in Tibet, in the team colors of
the fictional Khyber Pass League. Under construction, he lied, is
his figure-studded railing for the new floating stadium in Havana
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made us laugh,'' said art panel member Peggy Weiss,
director of Seafirst Gallery, who admitted Neimi might not have
made the first cut if he hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring artists to have their hearts in their subject matter
is unusual, to say the least. Even the pope didn't require
Michelangelo be in a state of grace before painting the Sistine
Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel felt that the ballpark was a sacred place and wanted
the artists to feel that way too,'' said Irene Mahler, art
consultant for the project, who said that one half of 1 percent of
the original $250 million cost of the ballpark _ $1.2 million _ was
spent on art.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Safeco Field can now boast of being the most art
intensive ballpark in the country, which isn't saying much. Nearly
all baseball stadiums are art-free zones. True, Coors Field in
Denver got a lot of mileage in 1994 from ho-hum ceramic arc at the
front entrance with 108 glazed tiles depicting balls of every sort:
``The Evolution of the Ball.'' The idea's cute, but the delivery's
bland enough to be safely ignored after an initial sighting.
</P>
<P>
   Against this solid record of strikeouts, Seattle has a hit on
its hands. A hefty share of the stadium's art has what English
critic Lawrence Alloway called the essential ingredient for public
art, the ability to serve as ``focal point for an undifferentiated
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   If public art speaks only to a select few, argued Alloway, it's
a failure. It must reach across the widest possible spectrum of
tastes, experiences and interests in order to connect.
</P>
<P>
   Another trait separates public artists from those working on
their own projects in their studios: public artists should be able
to compromise, as they are part of a democratic experience in which
a lot of people have a say. In contrast, studio artists have to
hang tough. If word gets out that they're painting in color schemes
and dimensions chosen by a client, they lose face.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field artist Tina Hoggatt knows the difference, which is
why she didn't hesitate to indulge Dorothy ``Snookie'' Harrell
Doyle when she asked for a revision.
</P>
<P>
   A show-stopping shortstop for the All-American Girls' Pro
Baseball League in the 1940s, Doyle is part of Hoggatt's dream
team, a nine-piece set of large, porcelain-enamel-on-steel panels
featuring players in action, drawn from the history of the game and
hanging on the upper concourse.
</P>
<P>
   Now in her 70s, Doyle frowned when Hoggatt showed her the
watercolor from which the panels would be made. ``She told me her
nose is a lot bigger now than it was when she was playing, and that
she'd like to see it more snub,'' Hoggatt said. ``I told her, `You
got it.' She wants a shorter nose, she gets a shorter nose.''
</P>
<P>
   Other featured players are Roy Campanella as catcher, Christy
Mathewson as pitcher, Masafumi Yamamori from the Hankyu Braves in
left field, Buck Leonard of the Negro Leagues at first base, Julio
Cruz at second, Brooks Robinson at third, Bill Lawrence from the
Pacific Coast League in center field and Roberto Clemente in right.
</P>
<P>
   Hoggatt told Mariners designated hitter Edgar Martinez through
an intermediary she had Clemente in right field and asked who else
he'd like to see on her team. ``If you have Clemente, that's
enough,'' he told her. ``I wouldn't want to add any name to his.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Palmer Beecher, who ``never met a baseball she didn't
like,'' rewarded the panel for choosing her with two walls of
fabulously funky baseball quilts, made of license plates, soda
cans, carved and painted wood on facing walls at the southeast
entry of the main concourse. To secure the commission, she listed
100 reasons why she loves baseball, what she calls America's folk
art.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to eat hot dogs without anyone telling you how bad
they are for you,'' she said. ``You can watch baseball players
pinch each other and spit on the expensive grass. You can
clothespin baseball cards on the wheels of your bike and make
flap-snap sounds. You can see baseball diamonds lit up when you're
in the plane at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Thom Ross has a fan patter to match or beat Beecher's and
Hoggatt's. His cutout, painted steel figures are instantly
recognizable to Mariner fans. To make them, Ross borrowed a news
photo of Ken Griffey Jr. sliding home with the playoff series'
winning run against the Yankees in 1995, blew it up, rearranged the
composition a little, had it fabricated and hand-painted the
results, placed on the northwest entrance of the main concourse
level.
</P>
<P>
   Gu Xiong concentrated not on the game but the crowds it draws.
His 24-foot-long porcelain enamel on steel mural catches the fans
at a moment of maniacal intensity, hanging on the northeast corner
of the main concourse level.
</P>
<P>
   Niemi and Donald Fels opted for a deft brand of instruction.
Niemi's sleek, unpainted steel cutout figures adorn the gates
surrounding the park, illustrating the positions they hold on the
field. His ``Batter's Fence'' shows the trajectories various kinds
of hit balls make after contact with the bat, all labeled with arcs
of motion visible, such as bunts and pop flys.
</P>
<P>
   Fels got the job in part by bringing to the interview a 1958 Los
Angeles Dodgers yearbook autographed by the whole team and
presented to him as a reward for his baseball fanaticism.
</P>
<P>
   His artwork saves the drab facade of the parking garage from
itself. Inset into granite columns are phrases that have entered
the language as baseball-derived metaphors: out of left field, off
base, out of the park. Above them are large baseballs held to
illustrate the positions of different pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Tsutakawa had his idea for a bronze mitt from the
beginning. Appropriately titled ``The Mitt,'' it stands in all its
gleaming bronze splendor at the park's left field entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Lessick wanted to deal with the trading card aspect of the
game. She designed 15 cards relating to the physics and phenomena
of baseball. Although her original plan for vending machines for
the cards didn't make it to Safeco Field, three enlarged versions
of them hang on the northeast entry area.
</P>
<P>
   The art team known as Stable (Linda Beaumont, Stuart Keeler and
Michael Machnic) don't ascribe to the rule that public project
artists need to compromise. To get their piece past the panel, they
strained everybody's nerves and goodwill but prevailed, complaining
all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Was it worth it? Most fans are likely to think so. Above the
southwest entry gates hangs their version of a chandelier: 1,000
whitish yet translucent bats in a swirl of motion. Below the floor
is painted mottled blues for seas, and the staircase leading up to
main concourse level is pale red for beach sand.
</P>
<P>
   Stable pressed upon the panel a metaphor: mariner as seaman as
well as baseball player. Inset into the floor on the main concourse
level overlooking home plate is a compass rose embedded with
baseball quotes.

PROTESTANTS BALK AT JOINING SINN FEIN IN NORTHERN IRELAND CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Ulster's main Protestant party said
Wednesday night it would not join the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army in government as scheduled on Thursday, a decision
that will halt all progress in the Northern Ireland peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionists, spurned a
series of last-minute appeals and concessions from British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, saying they had failed to sway his party's
members from their conviction that they cannot share power with
Sinn Fein as long as its IRA allies refuse to start disarming.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will have the effect of blocking the transfer of
home rule authority from the British Parliament in London to the
new Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast. The transfer would have
been the most critical step in the peace settlement and the most
convincing evidence that the British province had moved away from
war and towards political resolution of its deep seated conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, aimed at ending 30 years of sectarian violence that
has taken more than 3,200 lives, was signed to worldwide acclaim in
April 1998 but has been put into effect only haltingly since then,
with the dispute over guerrilla disarmament the recurrent stumbling
block.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had insisted that the deadlines for action were absolute
and that failing to meet them would leave Northern Ireland staring
into the ``abyss'' of its violent past. However, Wednesday night
his spokesman said that he would press ahead with finding ways to
revive the stalled process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always acknowledged that the Ulster Unionists have
difficulties with this,'' the spokesman said. ``We still believe
this is the best way forward and will continue to try to persuade
people of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister who is a co-sponsor of
the peace plan, said in Dublin that he was ``gravely disappointed''
by Trimble's action, which he termed a ``mistake of historic
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Mo Mowlam, the British secretary for Northern
Ireland, issued the formal directive for the 108-member Assembly to
meet Thursday to nominate the 10 members of the Cabinet that would
in effect become the new Ulster government. This step has long
posed a challenge for Trimble, who is the new parliament's first
minister, because two of the seats belong to Sinn Fein. Letting the
procedure go forward would formally provide the party its entry
into the government.
</P>
<P>
   The vote totals amassed by the parties during last year's
legislative elections entitle the Ulster Unionists and the moderate
Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party, led by John Hume, the
Nobel Peace Prize laureate, to three seats each. Sinn Fein and the
hard-line Protestant Democratic Unionists led by the Rev. Ian
Paisley have two each.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation now is that Trimble will refuse to name
ministers, thereby putting an end to the plan. Under the terms of
the agreement, the British and Irish governments will then
``suspend'' the entire accord, probably putting it on hold and
subjecting it to at least a summer-long review.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The regional parliament, based on a power-sharing formula that
permits passage of legislation only if it has the support of
representatives of the province's Protestant and Catholic
communities, was the centerpiece of the agreement but now remains
powerless.
</P>
<P>
   Blair scrambled Wednesday to come up with legislative amendments
for Trimble to pass along to a critical meeting of his 110-member
party executive in Belfast on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But he had not stilled Trimble's worries. The Ulster Unionist
leader ended up calling the legislation ``deeply flawed'' and
unfair to his party. The new amendments, designed to address
Trimble's specific misgivings, proposed a timetable for guerrilla
disarmament and a mechanism for identifying and punishing the
specific parties that failed to disarm on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists said they feared that without such
spelled-out restrictions, they could end up sitting in government
with a party that would keep its secret army intact and be able to
resist attempts to expel it for any failure to comply with weapons
turnover pledges.
</P>
<P>
   At the Stormont Assembly building here, Trimble welcomed word of
the amendments but added that the frantic last-minute activity
itself raised troubling questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point that occurs to me,'' he said, ``is the fact that the
government is bringing forward amendments a matter of hours from
its own self-imposed deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the legislation that he had opposed in the House of
Commons on Tuesday night was ``not well thought through, not well
constructed and deeply flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   He then went to the downtown party headquarters for what was
expected to be a lengthy meeting of his executive. But he emerged
after only 20 minutes to announce that the party was sticking to
its policy of ``no guns, no government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have to tell you tonight is that the executive's view
remains unchanged,'' he said. ``I have not sought nor will I seek a
change in the party policy.''
</P>
<P>
   While Blair's 11th-hour wooing of Trimble had little effect on
the Ulster Unionist leader, it angered Sinn Fein. Mitchel
McLaughlin, Sinn Fein's political strategist, said: ``With
Republicans there is a deep, deep anger at the extent to which Mr.
Blair is prepared to subvert the Good Friday Agreement in an
attempt to bribe Mr. Trimble. He did make an effort, and David
Trimble has quite clearly thrown it back in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside party headquarters Wednesday night, members of the
Ulster Unionists said that Trimble's stature had risen because of
his standing up to Blair and to President Clinton, who had called
him during the past week urging him to take the risk for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed he will not compromise the principles of democracy
by letting terrorists sit in government,'' said Arnold Hatch, a
member of the executive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deadlines imposed by Blair and Ahern, the home-rule
legislative powers would have been transferred from the British
Parliament to the Northern Ireland Assembly on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, the head of the Independent International Commission
on Decommissioning, Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada, was to
establish the timetable for disarmament, with the first actual
dismantling of paramilitary arsenals in September.

 &HT;    THE PAST IN PERIL
 &HT;    Antiquities under siege
 &HT;    EDS: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<P>
   A global perspective on pieces
</P>
<P>
   of the past imperiled by looters, time, development, neglect and
other threats.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA
</P>
<P>
   Looters have ransacked four temples in Cambodia's ancient Angkor
complex in recent weeks. At least 10 people, including two police
officers, have been arrested for removing statue heads and a
bas-relief carving of an elephant from the 800-year-old stone
temples.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wave of destruction _ believed to be part of an
international ``loot-to-order'' syndicate that operates out of
Thailand _ occurred despite efforts by more than 400 Cambodian
police to patrol the sprawling temple complex, which includes
Angkor Wat, one of the world's premier cultural monuments.
</P>
<P>
   CYPRUS
</P>
<P>
   The systematic looting of Cypriot antiquities has prompted the
United States to impose an emergency import ban on Byzantine
ecclesiastical and ritual objects from Cyprus. The ban covers a
wide range of 4th- through 15th-century bronze, silver, gold and
ivory objects, which have been stolen in increasing numbers from
archaeological sites and churches on the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. action comes on the heels of an eight-month sting
investigation by German police that resulted in the seizure of $40
million worth of smuggled Cypriot frescoes, artifacts and religious
objects. The enterprise was part of a major looting operation that
authorities believe may have smuggled as many as 15,000 to 20,000
objects out of Cyprus in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The United States imposed a similar emergency ban on
pre-Columbian artifacts from Nicaragua. Earlier import bans cover
ancient artifacts from Guatemala, El Salvador, Peru, Canada and
Mali.
</P>
<P>
   UTAH
</P>
<P>
   Looters broke through a locked iron gate that authorities had
erected to protect a cave near Wendover, Utah, that is thought to
hold evidence of the earliest human habitation in the state. The
intruders dug at least one hole in the floor of Juke Box Cave and
expanded another hole dug before the mouth of the cave was barred
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second attempt at breaking into a sealed prehistoric
cave in western Utah's Danger Cave State Park, which borders the
Bonneville Salt Flats. In 1997, vandals pried apart iron bars in an
effort to enter another cave, one of several that archaeologists
believe may contain evidence of human presence going back as long
as 13,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   EGYPT
</P>
<P>
   The great Cheops pyramid at Giza has been reopened after a
yearlong effort to repair the damage done by tourists. The Egyptian
government has mended cracks, removed graffiti, restored wall
paintings and arrested the damage caused by excessive humidity and
by thousands of visitors trooping through the 451-foot-high
pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   The repairs mark the second time in six years that Egypt has had
to close the pyramid to tourists. To prevent further damage to the
4,600-year-old structure, authorities will limit the number of
people who can tour the pyramid to 300 a day.
</P>
<P>
   SYRIA
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Customs is returning to Syria a priceless set of
1,500-year-old mosaics that had been smuggled into Canada by at
least three different routes, most recently in the back of a truck
crossing the Canadian border last year at Champlain, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 of the multihued limestone and glass panels, which
were looted from the 6th-century city of Aleppo in northern Syria,
are still missing and are presumed to have been sold on the black
market. Syria is planning to display the 8-by-12-foot panels in a
new museum. A brief display of the mosaics in a Montreal museum
this year drew large crowds _ and one museum-goer who was stopped
by authorities when he attempted to make off with the corner of one
of the mosaics.

 &HT;    THE PAST IN PERIL
 &HT;    Grave robbers pursue riches in looting of ancient tombs
 &HT;    EDS: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEIMEBAMBA, Peru _ Lazaro the Looter hardly looks the part of a
grave robber. He is clean-cut, slightly built for his 22 years,
still struggling to grow a manly mustache. He picks nervously at a
beer bottle label as he recounts the misdeeds that have earned him
a rare distinction in Peru's 400-year struggle to protect its
cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Since the time of the conquistadors, countless thousands of
people, rich and poor, Peruvian and foreigners, have looted the
country's archaeological treasures with impunity. Unlike most of
them, Lazaro Mestanza got caught.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the open-air courtyard of a house on Jiron de Verdad
_ the Street of Truth _ he fidgets as he talks, discomfited as much
by gringos' questions as by the presence, in an adjoining room, of
the 200 mummies that now bear silent testimony to the frenzy of
destruction Mestanza and his friends unleashed on their
centuries-old tombs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the stern, watchful eye of the mummies' current custodian,
archaeologist Adriana von Hagen, Mestanza and his companion in
crime, Miguel Huaman, 21, haltingly tell the story of what they now
call the ``miserly mummies.''
</P>
<P>
   It began innocently enough one November afternoon in 1996, when
Mestanza and a friend, taking a break from their chores on a ranch
along the lake, glanced across the waters of Laguna de los Condores
and saw something they had never noticed before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going down to go fishing when I looked up high on the
cliffs and saw what looked like a window and a wall with red
paint,'' says Mestanza. ``We wondered what it could be, so early
the next Sunday three of us decided to climb up and see.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, they used machetes to hack a trail up the side
of the limestone cliffs after reaching the far side of the lake.
Five hours of scrambling through the cloud forest vegetation and
one waterfall later, they found what looked like ``a little
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The field hands had discovered what most archaeologists only
dream about. They had stumbled upon an undisturbed chullpa, a stone
and wood mausoleum built by the Chachapoya, a pre-Inca culture that
flourished along the eastern slopes of the Andes 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, so little is known of these so-called ``lost warriors of
the clouds'' that they are scarcely mentioned in accounts of Peru's
ancient civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the tombs, Mestanza and his friends had to lower
themselves by ropes to a narrow ledge where the tombs were
protected by overhanging rocks. The six-room structure they
encountered was overgrown with vegetation, but in one open window,
a lone bundled mummy _ painted with a simple face _ stood guard.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Inside, undisturbed since pre-Columbian times, lay the remains
of more than 400 men, women and children _ shroud-wrapped skeletons
in wooden coffins, tightly bundled mummies with painted faces and
embroidery _ and thousands of brightly colored textiles, decorated
ceramics and gourds, wooden idols, flutes and feathered
headdresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly incredible to think that there could be a site like
that with such amazing preservation,'' says von Hagen, whose
crusade to save the mummies has made her known throughout the town
as ``the doctor Adriana.'' ``This was probably the biggest _ and
richest _ pre-Inca discovery ever made in this part of Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   When they pushed their way into the tombs that Sunday, however,
Mestanza and his friends had riches of a different kind in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took six pots that first day and wrapped them in plastic
and carried them home,'' he says. ``They were pretty. We planned to
sell them, but we were afraid the patron, the big boss, would take
them away, so we hid them before we got back to the ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, with visions of silver and gold dancing in
their heads, they returned to the cliffside tombs to begin
ransacking them in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started cutting the heads of the mummies off with machetes
to see what was inside,'' Mestanza recalls. But there was no
silver. No gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cut open 10 mummies or so and we didn't find a thing,'' he
explains. ``When we realized we weren't going to find anything
valuable inside them, we started throwing them over the cliff.
Eventually we just gave up on the mummies and took more pots.''
</P>
<P>
   To the ranch hands, the sophisticated, brilliantly colored
textiles were mere rags to be discarded. Knotted cords _
intricately knotted strings called quipus, which archaeologists say
are the closest things to written language that such cultures had _
were merely scraps with no meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their pique over the ``miserly mummies,'' Mestanza and
his companions returned to the tombs several more times, deciding
that the brightly painted clay pots they took would at least
provide some modest return for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In Celendin, four hours away by bus, they sold several pieces
for $3 each _ more than twice what they were paid for a day's work
on the ranch. Similar ceramics routinely sell for several thousand
dollars at auction in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As the looters' secret hoard of pots grew, however, word of the
discovery began to leak. Angered by their deceptions, their
employer, as they had feared, confiscated the pots. Believing that
he intended to sell them himself, Mestanza went to the police _ and
promptly got himself and his friends arrested for looting Peru's
cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the young men who participated in the looting was fined
the equivalent of a year's wages for field hands in Peru's Amazonas
province.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   No action was ever taken against their employer, who eventually
surrendered the artifacts, but as word of the discovery reached the
outside world, the problems at Laguna de los Condores snowballed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People flocked to the site,'' says von Hagen. ``It didn't
matter that it's a two-day drive from the coast over treacherous
mountain roads just to get here to Leimebamba. It didn't matter
that it's still a 10-hour trip by mule from here to the Laguna.
People came anyway. There were hundreds of them. They churned
through the site looking for anything of value. We'll never know
what they carried off. It was impossible to control.''
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, von Hagen and an archaeologist friend formed a
private foundation and set out to rescue what was left of the
site's ancient treasures. One by one they packed the mummies and
their belongings on mules and brought them to town.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, von Hagen's two-story home doubles as a storage
vault for the mummified remains and a laboratory for their
preservation and study. In time, she hopes, the new foundation will
build a proper museum, so that Leimebamba _ now served by a
single-lane road, three telephones and electrical power for only
six hours a day _ will have a legitimate tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tragic to think what was lost,'' she says. ``We know from
what people left behind that these textiles are the most
sophisticated ever produced during this period in this part of
Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will learn a lot from them, but it could have been so much
more.''

 &HT;    THE PAST IN PERIL
 &HT;    Museum's gold would dazzle even Midas
 &HT;    EDS: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Miguel Mujica Gallo discovered his life's passion
at the age of 17. While most teenage boys from Peru's wealthiest
families dreamed of horses and beautiful women, young Miguel
decided all that glittered really was gold.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 70 years, he has unrelentingly pursued his
passion. Since he began collecting pre-Columbian gold in the 1920s,
Mujica has assembled one of the largest privately owned collections
of its kind in the Western world _ more than 10,000 exquisitely
crafted pieces of Peruvian gold, virtually all of it auired, in
person, from looters, grave robbers and the middlemen who sell the
booty of Peru's huaqueros.
</P>
<P>
   Now frail and in failing health at the age of 89, Miguel Mujica
is seldom seen in public, but his heirs say he can still drive a
shrewd bargain when he sees a piece he wants for his family-owned
Gold Museum, which is housed in a vast, closely guarded basement
vault in the family's walled compound on the outskirts of Lima. No
public museum in the country comes close to rivaling the size and
scope of the Mujica gold collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary source of all the gold you see here has been
looting,'' his son, Pedro Mujica, acknowledges matter-of-factly.
``The huaqueros bring their pieces here, to this room, for him to
examine,'' he explains as he ushers visitors into the old man's
inner sanctum _ a trophy room the size of a gymnasium, hung from
floor to ceiling with the heads of elephants, giraffes, lions,
tigers, zebras and buffalo that attest to another of Miguel
Mujica's auisitive passions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now that he is old, scarcely a day goes by that he
doesn't buy a piece _ or at least examine one,'' he says.
``Everybody knows that he is ready to look at a fine gold piece at
any time of the day or night.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the few sellers who gain an audience with the old
man still undergo a time-honored ritual beneath the vacant, glassy
stares of Mujica's stuffed big-game trophies.
</P>
<P>
   The old man sits in his favorite overstuffed chair, built
slightly higher than the other chairs in the room, so there will be
no misunderstanding about the pecking order. At his right hand, a
telephone rests atop a table crafted from the stump of an
elephant's foot. Arrayed around him on dust-covered tables,
autographed pictures of presidents and movie stars serve as
prominent reminders of his stint as Peru's ambassador to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the old man may feign disinterest in the proffered
piece of gold. With thousands of museum-quality artifacts in his
collection, he can afford to be choosy. But his eye is as keen as
the day when, as a teenager, he bought one of his first pieces _ a
crescent-shaped ceremonial knife, a tumi, that is now insured for
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collection is so large now that he only buys choice,
top-quality pieces,'' says the younger Mujica, who, as his father
has aged, has assumed day-to-day responsibilities for the museum
and the family foundation that runs it. ``They always ask a lot,
but he always gets them down. Once a deal is struck, he pays
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years of such hard-nosed bargaining with looters has
produced a collection worth tens of millions of dollars. Hundreds
of glass cases and cabinets display prehistoric craftsmanship that
spans 3,000 years of history and a dozen cultures _ holdings that
are more extensive than those in all of the country's public
museums combined.
</P>
<P>
   Gold isn't the only thing Miguel Mujica has collected during his
lifetime. Other buildings in the family compound house an
eye-popping collection of more than 2,000 pre-Columbian textiles _
and a museum-class collection of military regalia that includes
everything from medieval suits of armor to Simon Bolivar's silver
sword.
</P>
<P>
   But archaeologists say Mujica's unquenchable appetite for
pre-Columbian gold _ and that of others like him _ has devastated
important chapters of Peru's prehistory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of the authentic pieces in the Mujica Gold
Museum have been hauled out of a place on the north coast of Peru
called Batan Grande,'' says Izumi Shimada, a Southern Illinois
University anthropologist who has spent two decades studying the
pre-Inca civilization there _ a culture that built a complex of at
least 50 adobe pyramids and produced gold pieces of unrivaled
craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never know as much as we could about these people
because Batan Grande has been looted so heavily and so
repeatedly,'' he says. ``I personally have counted over 100,000
looters' pits over a 20-square-mile area _ and there are hundreds
of trenches that have been dug with front-end loaders.''
</P>
<P>
   That so much of Peru's archaeological heritage should wind up so
firmly in private hands is a consequence of the country's often
incomprehensible, frequently inconsistent, approach to the
protection of its cultural treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Theft or destruction of what Peru calls the ``national
patrimony,'' anything deemed to be part of its cultural heritage,
has been considered illegal since 1926 _ but private collections of
artifacts, no matter how lavish, are widely and openly tolerated.
In theory, the artifacts still belong to Peru. In practice, the
owner need only register them with the government to retain
possession. The export of artifacts is expressly forbidden, but
those laws, which often require the participation of foreign law
enforcement agencies, are unevenly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Pedro Mujica sees private control of Peru's
heritage as a good thing for the family as well as Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has always believed that the historic value of gold
pieces is greater than gold's intrinsic value,'' he says. ``If it
weren't for my father, many of these pieces would be outside the
country in private collections or melted down, just as the Spanish
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has never sold a single piece from his collection.
He considers it unpatriotic to sell a nation's heritage to
outsiders.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is equally adamant that his collection will never be part
of the public trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would never tolerate government ownership of any of
these pieces,'' says his son. ``He has never trusted the state. And
he never will.''
</P>
<P>
   If the gold itself were the only thing of value, it would not
really be lost. The collection has been open for public viewing
since 1966, when friends convinced Miguel Mujica that hoarding such
artifacts for his private enjoyment was selfish.
</P>
<P>
   Today, thanks to traveling exhibits, portions of the gold
collection have been seen on five continents. The permanent
collection is one of Lima's most popular tourist attractions,
although the $5 admission fee _ stiff by Peruvian standards _ means
that more than 90 percent of the visitors are foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the museum inevitably marvel at the quantity and
variety of gold artifacts crafted by Peru's prehistoric people.
Pedro Mujica's personal favorite is an elaborate gilded human skull
with rose quartz inlays in place of teeth.
</P>
<P>
   But the dazzling array of priceless artifacts affords no
opportunity for anyone to learn anything about the people who
produced the objects, how they did it, or why. The museum employs
not a single archaeologist to catalog or interpret the objects that
Mujica spent a lifetime assembling. There are no plaques to explain
where the pieces came from or their significance. In the absence of
interpretation, the countless cases of pre-Columbian gold bear an
uncanny resemblance to Mujica's big-game trophy room.
</P>
<P>
   And Pedro Mujica concedes that even the catalog of reference
numbers that museum employees once used to identify his father's
auisitions has fallen into disuse. Some items are simply not
numbered at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father knows what all these pieces are, but he has never
written it down on paper,'' he says with regret. ``But all that
information is going to be lost when he is gone.''

 &HT;    THE PAST IN PERIL
 &HT;    Peru's Pre-Columbian cultures
 &HT;    EDS: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peru is the cradle of civilization in South America. Vast
empires with roads, aqueducts and carefully planned major cities
rose and fell there for thousands of years. But unlike the great
civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia, they left no written
record, so people know them today only by the ruins of their cities
and the works of art they left behind. Among the best-known
cultures of ancient Peru:
</P>
<P>
   CHAVIN
</P>
<P>
   1900 B.C. to 900 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Northern and central coast and highlands
</P>
<P>
   The progenitors of Peruvian high culture, they were among the
first to build large ceremonial centers, notably Chavin de Huantar
in the central Andes. They introduced advances in textiles and
metallurgy _ gold, silver and copper.
</P>
<P>
   PARACAS
</P>
<P>
   1300 B.C. to A.D. 200
</P>
<P>
   South coast
</P>
<P>
   Renowned for their superb weaving and pottery, they built a
large burial tomb, or necropolis, on the Paracas Peninsula,
containing the mummified remains of hundreds of people and the most
coveted textiles in all of Peruvian antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   NAZCA
</P>
<P>
   A.D. 200 to A.D. 800
</P>
<P>
   South coast
</P>
<P>
   They left little in the way of architecture, but made up for it
with the gigantic precise figures and geometric designs they drew
on the Nazca plain _ known as Nazca lines. Among them: a 270-foot
monkey and a condor with a 400-foot wingspan.
</P>
<P>
   MOCHE
</P>
<P>
   A.D. 100 to A.D. 800
</P>
<P>
   North coast
</P>
<P>
   Best-known for their artistic genius _ exquisite gold and silver
ornaments and stunningly lifelike portrait vases _ they also built
a powerful empire with canals and cities dominated by adobe
pyramids. Huaca del Sol, towering 135 feet above the desert, was
built with 140 million adobe bricks, making it the largest
structure in pre-Columbian America.
</P>
<P>
   CHIMU
</P>

   Successors to the Moche, they built on the tradition of art and
urban development with several large walled cities on the north
coast. The capital, Chan Chan, was built in 1300. By the time the
Spanish arrived in Peru in the 1500s, Chan Chan's population was
about 50,000 and it covered 10 square miles.

   Starting as a small aristocracy near the Andean city of Cuzco,
the Inca quickly came to dominate much of Peru, thanks to their
administrative skills, military might and a 13,000-mile system of
roads. They built the famous mountaintop city of Machu Picchu, and
elevated craftsmanship of precious metals, textiles and ceramic to
a fine art. They declined swiftly after the Spanish captured Cuzco
in 1533.

   Lost treasures of Peru

   EDS: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
</P>

</P>
<P>
   PUAMAPE, Peru _ Shallow craters march across the hillside _ a
bleak moonscape at the edge of an abandoned fishing village on
Peru's north coast. The scattered pot shards and broken human
skulls are evidence that grave robbers have been busy.
</P>
<P>
   Worlds away, on the auction blocks in New York and London, the
exquisitely crafted 2,000-year-old ceramics and rainbow-hued
textiles of Peru's ancient civilizations are objects of beauty _
and spirited bidding that can reach into the six figures.
</P>
<P>
   Here, hundreds of freshly dug pits and a scattering of human
remains among the drifting sands reveal the darker side of a
booming worldwide market for ancient artifacts. Fresh tracks of
heavy machinery in the soft sand attest that, when it comes to
digging up their ancestors, Peru's huaqueros have graduated from
shovels and picks.
</P>
<P>
   To dig these holes, they used a backhoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was probably the burial ground for a thousand people; now
look at it,'' says archaeologist Thomas Dillehay, scuffing his boot
through a pile of brittle, whitened bones. ``This is the worst
looting I have seen. Before long the bones will be gone too. They
take them and grind them up for animal feed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillehay is bitter. And frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Kentucky archaeologist has devoted his life to
the study of early American peoples. Until he spotted this dimpled
hillside from across the river, no one suspected that there was an
archaeological site here. The discovery came weeks too late. The
wholesale, mechanized looting has ensured that any scientific value
the site might have had was lost before it was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have studied the lifestyle of these people. We could
have learned something about their social structure. At least we
might have known who they were,'' he says. The location is one of
dozens of previously unknown sites Dillehay and his team have found
in the region. But the discovery is bittersweet. ``Anything these
burials might have told us is gone now. In a few more years there
won't be anything left.''
</P>
<P>
   Peru has more than its share of such untold stories. Long before
the Inca, this was the Americas' Egypt. Its rugged coastal valleys
nurtured a succession of cultures so advanced that today a drive
along the Pan American Highway reveals the weathered remains of
their towering earthen pyramids, walled imperial cities, roads and
irrigation systems rivaling those of ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   From Peru's desertlike coastal plains to the Amazon jungles, the
remains of these ancient civilizations _ all thriving cultures long
before Columbus set foot in the New World _ are being obliterated
by a growing global appetite for pieces of the past.
</P>
<P>
   In the final years of the 20th century, Peru isn't the only
country witnessing the wholesale destruction of a cultural heritage
that has survived centuries, even millenniums.
</P>
<P>
   In West Africa, the looting of 500-year-old graves for Djenne
terra cotta figurines has left Mali's inland delta looking like
Swiss cheese. In Cambodia, armed looters use power saws to carve
sandstone statuary out of 12th-century temples at Angkor. Even in
the United States, collectors' thirst for Indian and Civil War
relics _ whetted in recent months by expanded sales of artifacts on
the Internet _ is fueling an epidemic of looting in the nation's
parks and public lands.
</P>
<P>
   But if countries everywhere are bleeding history, Peru is
hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
   Off-road vehicles have made once-unreachable ruins more
accessible. Modern mountain climbing technology has made it easier
to loot the frozen mummies left by the Incas on the highest peaks
of the Andes. Heavy machinery has added new efficiency to the grim
business of grave robbery. And the growing market for pre-Columbian
material worldwide has made looting a way of life for thousands of
Peruvians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buying and selling of illegal artifacts is this country's
second-biggest export business,'' says Jorge Silva, an
archaeologist at San Marcos University in Lima. ``The biggest is
the traffic in illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peru has a well-organized network here for smuggling artifacts
out of the country,'' says Silva. ``They use some of the same
people and some of the same routes that the drug traffickers do.
These smugglers don't bother with the airport. It's easier to drive
a truckload of artifacts across the border to Colombia, Brazil or
Chile. From there, the most beautiful pieces are shipped to Europe
or the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The third-largest country in South America has been looted with
impunity for centuries _ ever since Francisco Pizarro conquered the
Inca in 1533, melted down their gold and silver, and sent shiploads
of it home to Spain. A popular Peruvian folk song, ``The Old
Huaquero,'' celebrates a tradition of grave robbing that spans
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But the wave of looting now sweeping Peru is more insidious. For
precious metals, Pizarro destroyed the Inca empire. For the clay
pots and feathered headdresses the conquistadors would have
considered worthless, today's looters are destroying the last
intact traces, not only of Inca culture, but of earlier
civilizations. The cultural wealth of Peru's past is being
mercilessly mined to remedy today's poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of what is being lost, these amazing New World
cultures will never be as appreciated as the great civilizations of
Egypt and the Middle East,'' says Carol Mackey, an archaeologist at
California State University, Northridge. Her excavations at Chan
Chan, near Trujillo, first revealed the splendor of the
pre-Columbian city whose nine walled palaces are now designated a
world heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archaeological sites are the only way we have to learn about
these people,'' says Walter Alva, Peru's best-known archaeologist
and the director of the Bruning Museum in Lambayeque. ``Looters are
ripping up the pages of our history. How would Americans feel if
someone ripped up the Declaration of Independence?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a site has been disturbed or destroyed, the context which
could tell us about these people is destroyed forever,'' he says.
``Trees and animals may grow again, but once the knowledge from an
archaeological site is lost, the story is goneforever.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the stories of these vanished people _ Moche, Chimu,
Paracas, Chavin _ are known only by what they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists value these artifacts and the context in which
they occur _ things as simple as scraps of fabric, grains of pollen
or soil types _ for the details they can add to the untold stories.
</P>
<P>
   But private collectors and museums covet the intricate gold and
turquoise adornments, charming ceramic portrait vessels cast in the
likeness of real people, and flawless textiles woven in bright,
geometric designs. As the popularity of their craftsmanship has
increased, so have prices. Old is better than gold. Ten years ago,
simple Moche portrait vessels might have fetched a few hundred
dollars at auction. Today, they sell for $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the most likely way to ``harvest'' such treasures
_ whether for science or for profit _ is to dig up the people
buried with them. And these days, when it comes to digging,
archaeologists are in a minority. Whether collectors acquire an
artifact legally or not, it is usually the end result of looting.
</P>
<P>
   At Batan Grande, a huge site in northern Peru that includes the
ruins of more than 50 pyramids, authorities have counted more than
100,000 holes _ graves that looters stripped of artifacts and sold,
through a network of middlemen and dealers, to private collectors
in Lima and abroad. Hundreds of other coastal sites are also
riddled with holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all of our archaeological sites have been looted,''
says Alva. ``Flying over Peru, you can see these huge anthills of
looted sites that have been utterly destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Alva knows firsthand what can be lost, and what it means to
Peru's history. For more than a decade, he has been at the center
of a storm of archaeological intrigue that reads like the script
from some yet-to-be-made Indiana Jones sequel. New chapters of the
script are still being written. In places like Philadelphia, Miami,
New York and Santa Fe, N.M., the stolen gold from a royal tomb of
Sipan continues to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Alva's story began on Feb. 25, 1987, when a midnight call
summoned him to the police station in Chiclay for help in
identifying a hoard of newly confiscated artifacts. He was stunned
by what he saw: bags full of finely crafted objects, hammered gold
and gilded copper ornaments made by Moche craftsmen 1,500 to 2,000
years ago. Police had seized the artifacts from looters in the
nearby village of Sipan.
</P>
<P>
   Alva knew they could have come only from a royal tomb the likes
of which, if it were intact, would provide archaeologists with
unprecedented insights into the mysterious people who inhabited the
region long before the Inca.
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late. In the preceding two weeks, looters
tunneling into the ruins of Huaca Rajada, a cluster of pyramids
near Sipan, had indeed found a royal Moche tomb. As word of the
discovery spread, gold fever erupted in the village. Hundreds of
people swarmed to the pyramid to grab what they could. Fights broke
out over the loot. Police hurried to the village to keep order. A
shootout( ensued. In the melee, one of the looters was killed and
several others arrested. By the time Alva got there, most of the
gold was gone and the tomb was a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Once order was restored, Alva and others excavated the rest of
the site to see what the looters had missed. Despite sporadic
gunfire and threats to their lives, they recovered one of the
richest archaeological finds in Peru's history _ a collection of
Moche art and artifacts that revealed many new details about the
civilization's social order, warfare and ritual sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of objects they unearthed now fill several rooms at
the National Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology in Lima and at
the museum Alva oversees in Lambayeque. But the exhibit still has
empty cases _ space reserved for the missing treasures of Sipan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with all the material initially seized by the police, we
have recovered only a fraction of what was taken,'' says Alva. ``So
much of it has disappeared into private collections in Europe, the
United States and Japan, we may never see it again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of what was taken has found its way into
private hands,'' says archaeologist Christopher Donnan, a 36-year
veteran of Peruvian archaeology who helped arrange funding for the
Sipan excavations.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, who runs UCLA's Moche Archive, should know. In the years
since, he has tracked down and photographed most of the looted
material. Despite objections from fellow archaeologists who say his
dealings with looters and collectors legitimize their crimes, he
wants to learn as much as possible from the scraps of information
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the looted material is still in Peru, but in the
coming years, there is going to be a lot of material turning up
that we will know came from the looted tomb.''

   PUAMAPE, Peru: from the looted tomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Sipan's treasures are already surfacing. And as surely
as the treasures saved offer fresh insights into ancient cultures,
the treasures lost are providing some revealing glimpses of the
workings in today's black market for antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, looted artifacts are exceedingly difficult to track.
Artifacts stolen from a person or institution can be identified by
their previous owners, but the origin of looted pieces is known
only to the looter, who is a player in the illicit traffic. Unless
the looter is caught in the act, prosecution is virtually
impossible. Subsequent owners can claim that the item came from an
existing, and thus legal, collection. It's up to law enforcement
agents to prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Because the importation of objects from Sipan has been illegal
in the United States almost since the first looting incident there,
many of the loopholes have been plugged. The distinctive style of
Sipan's artifacts _ from signature necklaces of gold and silver
peanut shapes to renderings of a ritual executioner known as ``the
decapitator'' _ also makes them readily identifiable.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many of the pieces looted from Sipan were quickly
smuggled out of Peru and sold in countries that, unlike the United
States, do not adhere to the 1970 UNESCO convention on the
protection of cultural property _ the legal basis for U.S. seizures
of Sipan's errant treasures in places as diverse as Sotheby's New
York showroom and the parking lot of a Philadelphia hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the FBI presented Alva with a spectacular gold
backflap, a piece of ceremonial armor, which vanished in the
initial frenzy of looting. FBI agents seized it in Philadelphia
during a sting operation that resulted in the conviction of two
Miami men and the indictment of a Panamanian consul general, who
was charged with smuggling the piece into New York in a diplomatic
pouch. The backflap, which had been hidden in Peru for years, was
brought out only after undercover agents offered $1.6 million for
it.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs last year returned more than 200 Peruvian artifacts
_ including 10 pieces from Sipan _ that were discovered during a
routine inspection at Miami International Airport. Agents checking
a crate labeled ``Peruvian handicrafts'' for illegal drugs instead
found $1.5 million worth of artifacts that were being transferred
from a South American cargo plane to a Zurich-bound flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miami seizure leaves no doubt in my mind that we are
dealing with organized, systematic looting,'' Alva says. ``Those
pieces, which were of the highest quality, represented nine
different Peruvian cultures. It was as if they were assembled to
stock a museum. It shows that entire collections are being
mobilized to meet the increase in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Peru got its treasures back, but such recoveries are
the exception, not the rule. ``What we have recovered is probably
less than 1 percent of the total traffic in Peruvian artifacts,''
says Alva.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the smuggled artifacts in Miami underscores why the
rate of successful prosecutions is so low. Although the shipment
bore an address in Switzerland, whose liberal export and import
regulations make it a favorite point for the laundering of illicit
antiquities, Swiss police declined to take action. And Peruvian
authorities have never located the person in Lima whose return
address was on the crate.
</P>
<P>
   But Alva, who helped U.S. Customs identify the artifacts, says
he thinks the collection was assembled in Lima by a wealthy art
dealer, Raul Apesteguia, who had previously served prison time for
violations of Peruvian antiquities laws.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the customs seizure in Miami, Apesteguia was
shot and killed by masked gunmen at his townhouse in Lima. The
gunmen boldly carted off boxes of pre-Columbian artifacts while
neighbors watched. Peruvian police have made no arrests in that
case either, although local customs agents did intercept some of
the stolen artifacts at Lima International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Lima's high-end art dealers, however, are merely the apex of a
network of buyers, sellers and diggers that reaches deep into
Peru's impoverished countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looting is a way of life for many people here, and the pace of
it is definitely accelerating,'' says Dillehay, who often
encounters grave robbers in the course of his survey work. ``It's
not clandestine like it used to be. On many days, we find them out
here digging in broad daylight.''
</P>
<P>
   To make his point, Dillehay steers his dust-covered Jeep
Cherokee toward the ruins of a crumbling 800-year-old pyramid, the
Huaca Corbacho, which rises starkly out of the surrounding sugar
cane fields. As he pulls up, three looters scamper out of freshly
dug holes and flee across a landscape riddled with foxhole-sized
pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There they go,'' he says, pointing. ``Actually, it's a good
thing that they're running. The ones that are armed usually don't
run.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Although looting is usually conducted by small groups of
huaqueros, Dillehay says, the nearby village of Cayalti is home to
something new in Peru's artifact trade _ a looters syndicate, with
as many as 400 individuals who work assigned territories, share
equipment and swap information about their discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When sugar prices drop and they need money, the men come out
here and dig like hell,'' says Dillehay. ``This site has been
totally butchered. And every hillside in the valley is being
destroyed just like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackey, who has worked for 20 years in Peru, has watched her own
excavations pillaged by looters. Sometimes they wait until
archaeologists are gone for the season. Sometimes they come at
night. And sometimes they don't wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of archaeologists only makes looters more
interested,'' she says. ``They come like pickpockets to a fair.
There are times we've been on one side of a site working while
looters are digging on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people look on looting as a kind of national lottery.
Everyone wants to strike it rich. Discoveries like Sipan keep the
dream alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Any riches, however, seldom trickle down to the local level. In
his auto repair shop in Guadalupe, just off the Pan American
Highway, mechanic Manuel Mora offers a short course in the
economics of illicit artifacts as he leads visitors to a side room,
furnished with a simple cot and shelves of motor oil boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes contain museum-quality ceramics that he accepts as
barter when his customers have no money. Mora's pots aren't for
sale, but he occasionally gives them to family members as wedding
or birthday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Unwrapping crumpled newspapers, he holds up a piece of Moche
pottery adorned with a bird and serpent. Pots like it sell for
$5,000 or more at U.S. auctions. He received it in exchange for
welding an axle on a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   His prized possession is a copper tumi, a ceremonial knife that
would easily bring $10,000 at auction. He received it from the
local police for repairing their patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, they take prisoners from the jail and drive them out
to the ruins,'' he explains. ``They make them dig. When they find
something, the police keep what they find and use it for their own
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even under ideal conditions, Peruvian authorities acknowledge
that putting a stop to looting would be a monumental task. In
reality, even slowing the pace has proved to be impossible _ a
reality that Peru tacitly recognizes every July 28, when entire
families may celebrate Peruvian independence day with a trip to the
country for a picnic, a little looting, and another chance to
strike it rich _ assured that the police will be looking the other
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is immense,'' says Miguel Pazos Rivera, adviser to
the director of the National Institute of Culture, the arm of the
government responsible for protecting Peru's cultural resources.
``We have over 100,000 archaeological sites in Peru that we know
of. But only one-third of the country has even been surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very little is done to control looting,'' he says. ``We don't
have the money or the manpower to deal with it. And lately we seem
to be moving in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Still struggling to recover economically after a decade of
guerrilla warfare waged by the Sendero Luminoso and Tupac Amaru,
President Alberto Fujimori's government has been scaling back the
protection of Peru's archaeological riches.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural institute's staff has been cut by more than half.
And in 1998, a series of presidential decrees undermined Peru's
1926 law that declared all cultural objects part of the national
patrimony. By law, landowners now retain rights to anything,
including ruins and artifacts, found on their property _ just as
they do in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our laws are getting more permissive,'' says Maria Ofelia
Cerro, one of the few advocates for archaeological protection in
the Peruvian Congress. ``There is no control anymore. It is so open
now that sometimes when I'm stuck in traffic, I have people come up
to the car and try to sell me beautiful pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   But she says Peru will never be able to halt traffic in illicit
antiquities by itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the looters,'' she says. ``If you can't eat, you
have to sell something to make money. But the rest of the world
must recognize that it is the collectors _ especially those in
Europe, Japan and the United States _ who are the real looters.
They create the demand. They are feeding the trend. And the result
is that the tragic loss of our heritage is increasing.''

<P>
   of the past imperiled by looters, time, development, neglect and

   CAMBODIA
</P>
<P>
   Looters have ransacked four temples in Cambodia's ancient Angkor
complex in recent weeks. At least 10 people, including two police
officers, have been arrested for removing statue heads and a
bas-relief carving of an elephant from the 800-year-old stone
temples.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wave of destruction _ believed to be part of an
international ``loot-to-order'' syndicate that operates out of
Thailand _ occurred despite efforts by more than 400 Cambodian
police to patrol the sprawling temple complex, which includes
Angkor Wat, one of the world's premier cultural monuments.
</P>
<P>
   CYPRUS
</P>
<P>
   The systematic looting of Cypriot antiquities has prompted the
United States to impose an emergency import ban on Byzantine
ecclesiastical and ritual objects from Cyprus. The ban covers a
wide range of 4th- through 15th-century bronze, silver, gold and
ivory objects, which have been stolen in increasing numbers from
archaeological sites and churches on the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. action comes on the heels of an eight-month sting
investigation by German police that resulted in the seizure of $40
million worth of smuggled Cypriot frescoes, artifacts and religious
objects. The enterprise was part of a major looting operation that
authorities believe may have smuggled as many as 15,000 to 20,000
objects out of Cyprus in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The United States imposed a similar emergency ban on
pre-Columbian artifacts from Nicaragua. Earlier import bans cover
ancient artifacts from Guatemala, El Salvador, Peru, Canada and
Mali.
</P>
<P>
   UTAH
</P>
<P>
   Looters broke through a locked iron gate that authorities had
erected to protect a cave near Wendover, Utah, that is thought to
hold evidence of the earliest human habitation in the state. The
intruders dug at least one hole in the floor of Juke Box Cave and
expanded another hole dug before the mouth of the cave was barred
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second attempt at breaking into a sealed prehistoric
cave in western Utah's Danger Cave State Park, which borders the
Bonneville Salt Flats. In 1997, vandals pried apart iron bars in an
effort to enter another cave, one of several that archaeologists
believe may contain evidence of human presence going back as long
as 13,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   EGYPT
</P>
<P>
   The great Cheops pyramid at Giza has been reopened after a
yearlong effort to repair the damage done by tourists. The Egyptian
government has mended cracks, removed graffiti, restored wall
paintings and arrested the damage caused by excessive humidity and
by thousands of visitors trooping through the 451-foot-high
pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   The repairs mark the second time in six years that Egypt has had
to close the pyramid to tourists. To prevent further damage to the
4,600-year-old structure, authorities will limit the number of
people who can tour the pyramid to 300 a day.
</P>
<P>
   SYRIA
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Customs is returning to Syria a priceless set of
1,500-year-old mosaics that had been smuggled into Canada by at
least three different routes, most recently in the back of a truck
crossing the Canadian border last year at Champlain, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 of the multihued limestone and glass panels, which
were looted from the 6th-century city of Aleppo in northern Syria,
are still missing and are presumed to have been sold on the black
market. Syria is planning to display the 8-by-12-foot panels in a
new museum. A brief display of the mosaics in a Montreal museum
this year drew large crowds _ and one museum-goer who was stopped
by authorities when he attempted to make off with the corner of one
of the mosaics.

 &HT;    THE PAST IN PERIL
 &HT;    Grave robbers pursue riches in looting of ancient tombs
 &HT;    EDS: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEIMEBAMBA, Peru _ Lazaro the Looter hardly looks the part of a
grave robber. He is clean-cut, slightly built for his 22 years,
still struggling to grow a manly mustache. He picks nervously at a
beer bottle label as he recounts the misdeeds that have earned him
a rare distinction in Peru's 400-year struggle to protect its
cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Since the time of the conquistadors, countless thousands of
people, rich and poor, Peruvian and foreigners, have looted the
country's archaeological treasures with impunity. Unlike most of
them, Lazaro Mestanza got caught.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the open-air courtyard of a house on Jiron de Verdad
_ the Street of Truth _ he fidgets as he talks, discomfited as much
by gringos' questions as by the presence, in an adjoining room, of
the 200 mummies that now bear silent testimony to the frenzy of
destruction Mestanza and his friends unleashed on their
centuries-old tombs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the stern, watchful eye of the mummies' current custodian,
archaeologist Adriana von Hagen, Mestanza and his companion in
crime, Miguel Huaman, 21, haltingly tell the story of what they now
call the ``miserly mummies.''
</P>
<P>
   It began innocently enough one November afternoon in 1996, when
Mestanza and a friend, taking a break from their chores on a ranch
along the lake, glanced across the waters of Laguna de los Condores
and saw something they had never noticed before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going down to go fishing when I looked up high on the
cliffs and saw what looked like a window and a wall with red
paint,'' says Mestanza. ``We wondered what it could be, so early
the next Sunday three of us decided to climb up and see.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, they used machetes to hack a trail up the side
of the limestone cliffs after reaching the far side of the lake.
Five hours of scrambling through the cloud forest vegetation and
one waterfall later, they found what looked like ``a little
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The field hands had discovered what most archaeologists only
dream about. They had stumbled upon an undisturbed chullpa, a stone
and wood mausoleum built by the Chachapoya, a pre-Inca culture that
flourished along the eastern slopes of the Andes 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, so little is known of these so-called ``lost warriors of
the clouds'' that they are scarcely mentioned in accounts of Peru's
ancient civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the tombs, Mestanza and his friends had to lower
themselves by ropes to a narrow ledge where the tombs were
protected by overhanging rocks. The six-room structure they
encountered was overgrown with vegetation, but in one open window,
a lone bundled mummy _ painted with a simple face _ stood guard.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Inside, undisturbed since pre-Columbian times, lay the remains
of more than 400 men, women and children _ shroud-wrapped skeletons
in wooden coffins, tightly bundled mummies with painted faces and
embroidery _ and thousands of brightly colored textiles, decorated
ceramics and gourds, wooden idols, flutes and feathered
headdresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly incredible to think that there could be a site like
that with such amazing preservation,'' says von Hagen, whose
crusade to save the mummies has made her known throughout the town
as ``the doctor Adriana.'' ``This was probably the biggest _ and
richest _ pre-Inca discovery ever made in this part of Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   When they pushed their way into the tombs that Sunday, however,
Mestanza and his friends had riches of a different kind in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took six pots that first day and wrapped them in plastic
and carried them home,'' he says. ``They were pretty. We planned to
sell them, but we were afraid the patron, the big boss, would take
them away, so we hid them before we got back to the ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, with visions of silver and gold dancing in
their heads, they returned to the cliffside tombs to begin
ransacking them in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started cutting the heads of the mummies off with machetes
to see what was inside,'' Mestanza recalls. But there was no
silver. No gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cut open 10 mummies or so and we didn't find a thing,'' he
explains. ``When we realized we weren't going to find anything
valuable inside them, we started throwing them over the cliff.
Eventually we just gave up on the mummies and took more pots.''
</P>
<P>
   To the ranch hands, the sophisticated, brilliantly colored
textiles were mere rags to be discarded. Knotted cords _
intricately knotted strings called quipus, which archaeologists say
are the closest things to written language that such cultures had _
were merely scraps with no meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their pique over the ``miserly mummies,'' Mestanza and
his companions returned to the tombs several more times, deciding
that the brightly painted clay pots they took would at least
provide some modest return for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In Celendin, four hours away by bus, they sold several pieces
for $3 each _ more than twice what they were paid for a day's work
on the ranch. Similar ceramics routinely sell for several thousand
dollars at auction in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As the looters' secret hoard of pots grew, however, word of the
discovery began to leak. Angered by their deceptions, their
employer, as they had feared, confiscated the pots. Believing that
he intended to sell them himself, Mestanza went to the police _ and
promptly got himself and his friends arrested for looting Peru's
cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the young men who participated in the looting was fined
the equivalent of a year's wages for field hands in Peru's Amazonas
province.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   No action was ever taken against their employer, who eventually
surrendered the artifacts, but as word of the discovery reached the
outside world, the problems at Laguna de los Condores snowballed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People flocked to the site,'' says von Hagen. ``It didn't
matter that it's a two-day drive from the coast over treacherous
mountain roads just to get here to Leimebamba. It didn't matter
that it's still a 10-hour trip by mule from here to the Laguna.
People came anyway. There were hundreds of them. They churned
through the site looking for anything of value. We'll never know
what they carried off. It was impossible to control.''
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, von Hagen and an archaeologist friend formed a
private foundation and set out to rescue what was left of the
site's ancient treasures. One by one they packed the mummies and
their belongings on mules and brought them to town.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, von Hagen's two-story home doubles as a storage
vault for the mummified remains and a laboratory for their
preservation and study. In time, she hopes, the new foundation will
build a proper museum, so that Leimebamba _ now served by a
single-lane road, three telephones and electrical power for only
six hours a day _ will have a legitimate tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tragic to think what was lost,'' she says. ``We know from
what people left behind that these textiles are the most
sophisticated ever produced during this period in this part of
Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will learn a lot from them, but it could have been so much
more.''

 &HT;    THE PAST IN PERIL
 &HT;    Museum's gold would dazzle even Midas
 &HT;    EDS: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Miguel Mujica Gallo discovered his life's passion
at the age of 17. While most teenage boys from Peru's wealthiest
families dreamed of horses and beautiful women, young Miguel
decided all that glittered really was gold.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 70 years, he has unrelentingly pursued his
passion. Since he began collecting pre-Columbian gold in the 1920s,
Mujica has assembled one of the largest privately owned collections
of its kind in the Western world _ more than 10,000 exquisitely
crafted pieces of Peruvian gold, virtually all of it auired, in
person, from looters, grave robbers and the middlemen who sell the
booty of Peru's huaqueros.
</P>
<P>
   Now frail and in failing health at the age of 89, Miguel Mujica
is seldom seen in public, but his heirs say he can still drive a
shrewd bargain when he sees a piece he wants for his family-owned
Gold Museum, which is housed in a vast, closely guarded basement
vault in the family's walled compound on the outskirts of Lima. No
public museum in the country comes close to rivaling the size and
scope of the Mujica gold collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary source of all the gold you see here has been
looting,'' his son, Pedro Mujica, acknowledges matter-of-factly.
``The huaqueros bring their pieces here, to this room, for him to
examine,'' he explains as he ushers visitors into the old man's
inner sanctum _ a trophy room the size of a gymnasium, hung from
floor to ceiling with the heads of elephants, giraffes, lions,
tigers, zebras and buffalo that attest to another of Miguel
Mujica's auisitive passions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now that he is old, scarcely a day goes by that he
doesn't buy a piece _ or at least examine one,'' he says.
``Everybody knows that he is ready to look at a fine gold piece at
any time of the day or night.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the few sellers who gain an audience with the old
man still undergo a time-honored ritual beneath the vacant, glassy
stares of Mujica's stuffed big-game trophies.
</P>
<P>
   The old man sits in his favorite overstuffed chair, built
slightly higher than the other chairs in the room, so there will be
no misunderstanding about the pecking order. At his right hand, a
telephone rests atop a table crafted from the stump of an
elephant's foot. Arrayed around him on dust-covered tables,
autographed pictures of presidents and movie stars serve as
prominent reminders of his stint as Peru's ambassador to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the old man may feign disinterest in the proffered
piece of gold. With thousands of museum-quality artifacts in his
collection, he can afford to be choosy. But his eye is as keen as
the day when, as a teenager, he bought one of his first pieces _ a
crescent-shaped ceremonial knife, a tumi, that is now insured for
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collection is so large now that he only buys choice,
top-quality pieces,'' says the younger Mujica, who, as his father
has aged, has assumed day-to-day responsibilities for the museum
and the family foundation that runs it. ``They always ask a lot,
but he always gets them down. Once a deal is struck, he pays
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years of such hard-nosed bargaining with looters has
produced a collection worth tens of millions of dollars. Hundreds
of glass cases and cabinets display prehistoric craftsmanship that
spans 3,000 years of history and a dozen cultures _ holdings that
are more extensive than those in all of the country's public
museums combined.
</P>
<P>
   Gold isn't the only thing Miguel Mujica has collected during his
lifetime. Other buildings in the family compound house an
eye-popping collection of more than 2,000 pre-Columbian textiles _
and a museum-class collection of military regalia that includes
everything from medieval suits of armor to Simon Bolivar's silver
sword.
</P>
<P>
   But archaeologists say Mujica's unquenchable appetite for
pre-Columbian gold _ and that of others like him _ has devastated
important chapters of Peru's prehistory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of the authentic pieces in the Mujica Gold
Museum have been hauled out of a place on the north coast of Peru
called Batan Grande,'' says Izumi Shimada, a Southern Illinois
University anthropologist who has spent two decades studying the
pre-Inca civilization there _ a culture that built a complex of at
least 50 adobe pyramids and produced gold pieces of unrivaled
craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never know as much as we could about these people
because Batan Grande has been looted so heavily and so
repeatedly,'' he says. ``I personally have counted over 100,000
looters' pits over a 20-square-mile area _ and there are hundreds
of trenches that have been dug with front-end loaders.''
</P>
<P>
   That so much of Peru's archaeological heritage should wind up so
firmly in private hands is a consequence of the country's often
incomprehensible, frequently inconsistent, approach to the
protection of its cultural treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Theft or destruction of what Peru calls the ``national
patrimony,'' anything deemed to be part of its cultural heritage,
has been considered illegal since 1926 _ but private collections of
artifacts, no matter how lavish, are widely and openly tolerated.
In theory, the artifacts still belong to Peru. In practice, the
owner need only register them with the government to retain
possession. The export of artifacts is expressly forbidden, but
those laws, which often require the participation of foreign law
enforcement agencies, are unevenly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Pedro Mujica sees private control of Peru's
heritage as a good thing for the family as well as Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has always believed that the historic value of gold
pieces is greater than gold's intrinsic value,'' he says. ``If it
weren't for my father, many of these pieces would be outside the
country in private collections or melted down, just as the Spanish
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has never sold a single piece from his collection.
He considers it unpatriotic to sell a nation's heritage to
outsiders.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is equally adamant that his collection will never be part
of the public trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would never tolerate government ownership of any of
these pieces,'' says his son. ``He has never trusted the state. And
he never will.''
</P>
<P>
   If the gold itself were the only thing of value, it would not
really be lost. The collection has been open for public viewing
since 1966, when friends convinced Miguel Mujica that hoarding such
artifacts for his private enjoyment was selfish.
</P>
<P>
   Today, thanks to traveling exhibits, portions of the gold
collection have been seen on five continents. The permanent
collection is one of Lima's most popular tourist attractions,
although the $5 admission fee _ stiff by Peruvian standards _ means
that more than 90 percent of the visitors are foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the museum inevitably marvel at the quantity and
variety of gold artifacts crafted by Peru's prehistoric people.
Pedro Mujica's personal favorite is an elaborate gilded human skull
with rose quartz inlays in place of teeth.
</P>
<P>
   But the dazzling array of priceless artifacts affords no
opportunity for anyone to learn anything about the people who
produced the objects, how they did it, or why. The museum employs
not a single archaeologist to catalog or interpret the objects that
Mujica spent a lifetime assembling. There are no plaques to explain
where the pieces came from or their significance. In the absence of
interpretation, the countless cases of pre-Columbian gold bear an
uncanny resemblance to Mujica's big-game trophy room.
</P>
<P>
   And Pedro Mujica concedes that even the catalog of reference
numbers that museum employees once used to identify his father's
auisitions has fallen into disuse. Some items are simply not
numbered at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father knows what all these pieces are, but he has never
written it down on paper,'' he says with regret. ``But all that
information is going to be lost when he is gone.''

 &HT;    THE PAST IN PERIL
 &HT;    Peru's Pre-Columbian cultures
 &HT;    EDS: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peru is the cradle of civilization in South America. Vast
empires with roads, aqueducts and carefully planned major cities
rose and fell there for thousands of years. But unlike the great
civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia, they left no written
record, so people know them today only by the ruins of their cities
and the works of art they left behind. Among the best-known
cultures of ancient Peru:
</P>
<P>
   CHAVIN
</P>
<P>
   1900 B.C. to 900 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Northern and central coast and highlands
</P>
<P>
   The progenitors of Peruvian high culture, they were among the
first to build large ceremonial centers, notably Chavin de Huantar
in the central Andes. They introduced advances in textiles and
metallurgy _ gold, silver and copper.
</P>
<P>
   PARACAS
</P>
<P>
   1300 B.C. to A.D. 200
</P>
<P>
   South coast
</P>
<P>
   Renowned for their superb weaving and pottery, they built a
large burial tomb, or necropolis, on the Paracas Peninsula,
containing the mummified remains of hundreds of people and the most
coveted textiles in all of Peruvian antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   NAZCA
</P>
<P>
   A.D. 200 to A.D. 800
</P>
<P>
   South coast
</P>
<P>
   They left little in the way of architecture, but made up for it
with the gigantic precise figures and geometric designs they drew
on the Nazca plain _ known as Nazca lines. Among them: a 270-foot
monkey and a condor with a 400-foot wingspan.
</P>
<P>
   MOCHE
</P>
<P>
   A.D. 100 to A.D. 800
</P>
<P>
   North coast
</P>
<P>
   Best-known for their artistic genius _ exquisite gold and silver
ornaments and stunningly lifelike portrait vases _ they also built
a powerful empire with canals and cities dominated by adobe
pyramids. Huaca del Sol, towering 135 feet above the desert, was
built with 140 million adobe bricks, making it the largest
structure in pre-Columbian America.
</P>
<P>
   CHIMU
</P>
<P>
   A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1550
</P>
<P>
   North coast
</P>
<P>
   Successors to the Moche, they built on the tradition of art and
urban development with several large walled cities on the north
coast. The capital, Chan Chan, was built in 1300. By the time the
Spanish arrived in Peru in the 1500s, Chan Chan's population was
about 50,000 and it covered 10 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   CHACHAPOYA
</P>
<P>
   A.D. 800 to A.D. 1450
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern slopes of the Andes
</P>
<P>
   The ``cloud people'' of the upper Amazon basin farmed terraced
hillsides and built stone citadels on the mountaintops, including
what many consider to be Peru's most magnificent _ and least-known
_ ``lost city,'' the fortress at Kuelap, with its 75-foot-high
stone walls.
</P>
<P>
   INCA
</P>
<P>
   A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1550
</P>
<P>
   Most of Peru and parts of Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile
</P>
<P>
   Starting as a small aristocracy near the Andean city of Cuzco,
the Inca quickly came to dominate much of Peru, thanks to their
administrative skills, military might and a 13,000-mile system of
roads. They built the famous mountaintop city of Machu Picchu, and
elevated craftsmanship of precious metals, textiles and ceramic to
a fine art. They declined swiftly after the Spanish captured Cuzco
in 1533.

WITH SUCCESS CLOSER THAN EVER BEFORE, A FEUD RIPS MEXICO'S LEFTIST
PARTY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ He arrived an hour late for a meeting, but
Porfirio Munoz Ledo, one of Mexico's most durable and pyrotechnical
politicians of the left, did not apologize. Instead, he heaped
blame on his driver and several aides who happened to be nearby,
announcing that he intended to fire them all.
</P>
<P>
   The driver and aides adopted a hangdog look that suggested they
had heard such threats from Munoz Ledo before. Indeed, within a
moment he redirected his disdain. A senator from his own party who
had recently criticized him was ``small-minded,'' he said. A local
reporter who called was blasted for asking ``ill-informed'' and
``elementary'' questions.
</P>
<P>
   But Munoz Ledo's most acerbic words were for the man who has
been his closest partner in politics for the last decade,
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, now the mayor of Mexico City. The
two founded Mexico's most important leftist party, the Party of the
Democratic Revolution, in 1989. Now Munoz Ledo has surprised the
party and the public by challenging Cardenas for the nomination for
next year's presidential race. His campaign is so scorching it
seems certain to end in a permanent break between the two men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardenas is stuck in backwardness and dogmatism,'' Munoz Ledo
said in a stentorian boom. ``He runs a terrible city government. He
betrayed his friends who believe in a modern leftist party.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time Mexico's social democratic left, which is led
by the Party of the Democratic Revolution, stands a fighting chance
of both winning a presidential election _ on July 2, 2000 _ and
also taking office. Many Mexicans believe that Cardenas already won
the balloting once, in 1988, but was robbed of the presidency by
fraud. Over the last decade the opposition vote has grown even
more, and reforms pressed by President Ernesto Zedillo created an
independent elections agency that can insure a reasonably clean and
fair vote.
</P>
<P>
   But just when it is within reach of ultimate success, the Party
of the Democratic Revolution has gone on a binge of
self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Under the best of conditions, a victory by the party, which
favors distance from the United States and emphasizes government
social programs over private enterprise, will not come easily. It
splits the opposition vote with another strong contender, the
business-oriented National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the
PRI, which has dominated Mexican politics for seven decades, won a
strong victory in a bellwether election on July 4 for governor in
the state of Mexico, the country's most populous.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the results showed that the Party of the Democratic
Revolution dropped 13 points in that state, which borders on Mexico
City, since elections two years ago when it crushed all opponents
in the capital as Cardenas won the mayor's post.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles in the party began this year when it showed that it
was unable to organize a clean election of its own. In March, for
the first time, the party held a vote among it members to choose
the party president. When the balloting ended in a virtual draw
between two candidates, both cried fraud. The departing president,
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, decided the only way to silence the
squabbling was to annul the election.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cardenas dealt his party a surprise. Without consulting the
membership, he announced on May 26 that he would run as the
presidential candidate for the Labor Party, a tiny leftist group.
Cardenas' own party will not select its candidate until sometime
this fall, so its rank-and-file members were treated to the
uncomfortable spectacle of their maximum leader raising the victory
salute at the convention of another organization.
</P>
<P>
   The party is also struggling against Cardenas' falling
popularity as mayor. In a June poll in Mexico City by the newspaper
Reforma, 57 percent disapproved of his performance and 36 percent
approved. The number of people who doubted his honesty has almost
doubled since the beginning of his term, from 25 percent to 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of the Democratic Revolution was cobbled together out
of leftist factions that Cardenas could unite by the force of his
great personal prestige as the son of the most fondly remembered
former president, Lazaro Cardenas. It has had a hard time moving
beyond its origins as a street-protesting opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are still very immature when it comes to settling
differences,'' said Ricardo Pascoe, a party veteran who is an
official in Cardenas' city government. ``We shout too much. By
definition we are always against everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But the party's image has been especially damaged by Munoz
Ledo's attack on Cardenas. The party celebrated its 10th
anniversary on May 5, and all the press showed the next day were
pictures of the two scowling men turning their backs on each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brilliant'' is the word most frequently used to describe Munoz
Ledo, now 66. As a teen-ager he was a national championship
competitor in oratory, swimming, boxing and ballroom mambo all at
the same time. A tireless reader and mesmerizing speaker, he was a
Cabinet minister twice as well as Mexico's representative at the
United Nations before he broke with the PRI in 1987 to help run
Cardenas' first campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   But those who know Munoz Ledo worry that his intelligence and
vigor are often matched by his self-involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not consider the timing of his party or the nation,''
said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, a senator who worked on Cardenas' 1988
campaign and is now an independent. ``He believes this will be his
last chance to be president. So he grabs the moment, no matter
what.''
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said Munoz Ledo had sniffed at the idea of
running to succeed Cardenas as Mexico City mayor, the second most
powerful job in the country. In his drive for the presidency, he is
on the stump calling Cardenas a liar and a tyrant who corrupted the
party with authoritarian methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardenas is the only anti-democratic candidate in Mexico,'' he
said in an interview. ``He has turned our party into a jitney for a
lot of primitive, small-minded leftist sects who oppose change.''
</P>
<P>
   He raised his index finger to punctuate his point. ``I am a man
of principle. I have to clean up and modernize this party. If the
lying, corrupt people in the party get to power, it will be the
saddest day of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz Ledo's campaign gained him an early jump in national
polls. But most party leaders think his rift with Cardenas is bad
for the party and political suicide for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is crashing his light plane against the aircraft carrier,''
Pascoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Gomez, a congressman who is the party's interim leader,
predicted that the feud would not divide the membership. ``If we
choose our candidate,'' he said, referring obliquely to Cardenas,
``and some other contender doesn't like it and goes his own way,
well, that will be his business.''

   THE PAST IN PERIL
</P>
<P>
   Lost treasures of Peru
</P>
<P>
   EDS: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
</P>
<P>
   By Mike Toner
</P>
<P>
   Photos By David Tulis
</P>
<P>
   PUAMAPE, Peru _ Shallow craters march across the hillside _ a
bleak moonscape at the edge of an abandoned fishing village on
Peru's north coast. The scattered pot shards and broken human
skulls are evidence that grave robbers have been busy.
</P>
<P>
   Worlds away, on the auction blocks in New York and London, the
exquisitely crafted 2,000-year-old ceramics and rainbow-hued
textiles of Peru's ancient civilizations are objects of beauty _
and spirited bidding that can reach into the six figures.
</P>
<P>
   Here, hundreds of freshly dug pits and a scattering of human
remains among the drifting sands reveal the darker side of a
booming worldwide market for ancient artifacts. Fresh tracks of
heavy machinery in the soft sand attest that, when it comes to
digging up their ancestors, Peru's huaqueros have graduated from
shovels and picks.
</P>
<P>
   To dig these holes, they used a backhoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was probably the burial ground for a thousand people; now
look at it,'' says archaeologist Thomas Dillehay, scuffing his boot
through a pile of brittle, whitened bones. ``This is the worst
looting I have seen. Before long the bones will be gone too. They
take them and grind them up for animal feed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillehay is bitter. And frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Kentucky archaeologist has devoted his life to
the study of early American peoples. Until he spotted this dimpled
hillside from across the river, no one suspected that there was an
archaeological site here. The discovery came weeks too late. The
wholesale, mechanized looting has ensured that any scientific value
the site might have had was lost before it was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have studied the lifestyle of these people. We could
have learned something about their social structure. At least we
might have known who they were,'' he says. The location is one of
dozens of previously unknown sites Dillehay and his team have found
in the region. But the discovery is bittersweet. ``Anything these
burials might have told us is gone now. In a few more years there
won't be anything left.''
</P>
<P>
   Peru has more than its share of such untold stories. Long before
the Inca, this was the Americas' Egypt. Its rugged coastal valleys
nurtured a succession of cultures so advanced that today a drive
along the Pan American Highway reveals the weathered remains of
their towering earthen pyramids, walled imperial cities, roads and
irrigation systems rivaling those of ancient Rome.
</P>
<P>
   From Peru's desertlike coastal plains to the Amazon jungles, the
remains of these ancient civilizations _ all thriving cultures long
before Columbus set foot in the New World _ are being obliterated
by a growing global appetite for pieces of the past.
</P>
<P>
   In the final years of the 20th century, Peru isn't the only
country witnessing the wholesale destruction of a cultural heritage
that has survived centuries, even millenniums.
</P>
<P>
   In West Africa, the looting of 500-year-old graves for Djenne
terra cotta figurines has left Mali's inland delta looking like
Swiss cheese. In Cambodia, armed looters use power saws to carve
sandstone statuary out of 12th-century temples at Angkor. Even in
the United States, collectors' thirst for Indian and Civil War
relics _ whetted in recent months by expanded sales of artifacts on
the Internet _ is fueling an epidemic of looting in the nation's
parks and public lands.
</P>
<P>
   But if countries everywhere are bleeding history, Peru is
hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
   Off-road vehicles have made once-unreachable ruins more
accessible. Modern mountain climbing technology has made it easier
to loot the frozen mummies left by the Incas on the highest peaks
of the Andes. Heavy machinery has added new efficiency to the grim
business of grave robbery. And the growing market for pre-Columbian
material worldwide has made looting a way of life for thousands of
Peruvians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buying and selling of illegal artifacts is this country's
second-biggest export business,'' says Jorge Silva, an
archaeologist at San Marcos University in Lima. ``The biggest is
the traffic in illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peru has a well-organized network here for smuggling artifacts
out of the country,'' says Silva. ``They use some of the same
people and some of the same routes that the drug traffickers do.
These smugglers don't bother with the airport. It's easier to drive
a truckload of artifacts across the border to Colombia, Brazil or
Chile. From there, the most beautiful pieces are shipped to Europe
or the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The third-largest country in South America has been looted with
impunity for centuries _ ever since Francisco Pizarro conquered the
Inca in 1533, melted down their gold and silver, and sent shiploads
of it home to Spain. A popular Peruvian folk song, ``The Old
Huaquero,'' celebrates a tradition of grave robbing that spans
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But the wave of looting now sweeping Peru is more insidious. For
precious metals, Pizarro destroyed the Inca empire. For the clay
pots and feathered headdresses the conquistadors would have
considered worthless, today's looters are destroying the last
intact traces, not only of Inca culture, but of earlier
civilizations. The cultural wealth of Peru's past is being
mercilessly mined to remedy today's poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of what is being lost, these amazing New World
cultures will never be as appreciated as the great civilizations of
Egypt and the Middle East,'' says Carol Mackey, an archaeologist at
California State University, Northridge. Her excavations at Chan
Chan, near Trujillo, first revealed the splendor of the
pre-Columbian city whose nine walled palaces are now designated a
world heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archaeological sites are the only way we have to learn about
these people,'' says Walter Alva, Peru's best-known archaeologist
and the director of the Bruning Museum in Lambayeque. ``Looters are
ripping up the pages of our history. How would Americans feel if
someone ripped up the Declaration of Independence?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a site has been disturbed or destroyed, the context which
could tell us about these people is destroyed forever,'' he says.
``Trees and animals may grow again, but once the knowledge from an
archaeological site is lost, the story is goneforever.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the stories of these vanished people _ Moche, Chimu,
Paracas, Chavin _ are known only by what they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists value these artifacts and the context in which
they occur _ things as simple as scraps of fabric, grains of pollen
or soil types _ for the details they can add to the untold stories.
</P>
<P>
   But private collectors and museums covet the intricate gold and
turquoise adornments, charming ceramic portrait vessels cast in the
likeness of real people, and flawless textiles woven in bright,
geometric designs. As the popularity of their craftsmanship has
increased, so have prices. Old is better than gold. Ten years ago,
simple Moche portrait vessels might have fetched a few hundred
dollars at auction. Today, they sell for $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the most likely way to ``harvest'' such treasures
_ whether for science or for profit _ is to dig up the people
buried with them. And these days, when it comes to digging,
archaeologists are in a minority. Whether collectors acquire an
artifact legally or not, it is usually the end result of looting.
</P>
<P>
   At Batan Grande, a huge site in northern Peru that includes the
ruins of more than 50 pyramids, authorities have counted more than
100,000 holes _ graves that looters stripped of artifacts and sold,
through a network of middlemen and dealers, to private collectors
in Lima and abroad. Hundreds of other coastal sites are also
riddled with holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all of our archaeological sites have been looted,''
says Alva. ``Flying over Peru, you can see these huge anthills of
looted sites that have been utterly destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Alva knows firsthand what can be lost, and what it means to
Peru's history. For more than a decade, he has been at the center
of a storm of archaeological intrigue that reads like the script
from some yet-to-be-made Indiana Jones sequel. New chapters of the
script are still being written. In places like Philadelphia, Miami,
New York and Santa Fe, N.M., the stolen gold from a royal tomb of
Sipan continues to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Alva's story began on Feb. 25, 1987, when a midnight call
summoned him to the police station in Chiclay for help in
identifying a hoard of newly confiscated artifacts. He was stunned
by what he saw: bags full of finely crafted objects, hammered gold
and gilded copper ornaments made by Moche craftsmen 1,500 to 2,000
years ago. Police had seized the artifacts from looters in the
nearby village of Sipan.
</P>
<P>
   Alva knew they could have come only from a royal tomb the likes
of which, if it were intact, would provide archaeologists with
unprecedented insights into the mysterious people who inhabited the
region long before the Inca.
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late. In the preceding two weeks, looters
tunneling into the ruins of Huaca Rajada, a cluster of pyramids
near Sipan, had indeed found a royal Moche tomb. As word of the
discovery spread, gold fever erupted in the village. Hundreds of
people swarmed to the pyramid to grab what they could. Fights broke
out over the loot. Police hurried to the village to keep order. A
shootout( ensued. In the melee, one of the looters was killed and
several others arrested. By the time Alva got there, most of the
gold was gone and the tomb was a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Once order was restored, Alva and others excavated the rest of
the site to see what the looters had missed. Despite sporadic
gunfire and threats to their lives, they recovered one of the
richest archaeological finds in Peru's history _ a collection of
Moche art and artifacts that revealed many new details about the
civilization's social order, warfare and ritual sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of objects they unearthed now fill several rooms at
the National Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology in Lima and at
the museum Alva oversees in Lambayeque. But the exhibit still has
empty cases _ space reserved for the missing treasures of Sipan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with all the material initially seized by the police, we
have recovered only a fraction of what was taken,'' says Alva. ``So
much of it has disappeared into private collections in Europe, the
United States and Japan, we may never see it again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of what was taken has found its way into
private hands,'' says archaeologist Christopher Donnan, a 36-year
veteran of Peruvian archaeology who helped arrange funding for the
Sipan excavations.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, who runs UCLA's Moche Archive, should know. In the years
since, he has tracked down and photographed most of the looted
material. Despite objections from fellow archaeologists who say his
dealings with looters and collectors legitimize their crimes, he
wants to learn as much as possible from the scraps of information
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the looted material is still in Peru, but in the
coming years, there is going to be a lot of material turning up
that we will know came from the looted tomb.''

   PUAMAPE, Peru: from the looted tomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Sipan's treasures are already surfacing. And as surely
as the treasures saved offer fresh insights into ancient cultures,
the treasures lost are providing some revealing glimpses of the
workings in today's black market for antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, looted artifacts are exceedingly difficult to track.
Artifacts stolen from a person or institution can be identified by
their previous owners, but the origin of looted pieces is known
only to the looter, who is a player in the illicit traffic. Unless
the looter is caught in the act, prosecution is virtually
impossible. Subsequent owners can claim that the item came from an
existing, and thus legal, collection. It's up to law enforcement
agents to prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Because the importation of objects from Sipan has been illegal
in the United States almost since the first looting incident there,
many of the loopholes have been plugged. The distinctive style of
Sipan's artifacts _ from signature necklaces of gold and silver
peanut shapes to renderings of a ritual executioner known as ``the
decapitator'' _ also makes them readily identifiable.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many of the pieces looted from Sipan were quickly
smuggled out of Peru and sold in countries that, unlike the United
States, do not adhere to the 1970 UNESCO convention on the
protection of cultural property _ the legal basis for U.S. seizures
of Sipan's errant treasures in places as diverse as Sotheby's New
York showroom and the parking lot of a Philadelphia hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the FBI presented Alva with a spectacular gold
backflap, a piece of ceremonial armor, which vanished in the
initial frenzy of looting. FBI agents seized it in Philadelphia
during a sting operation that resulted in the conviction of two
Miami men and the indictment of a Panamanian consul general, who
was charged with smuggling the piece into New York in a diplomatic
pouch. The backflap, which had been hidden in Peru for years, was
brought out only after undercover agents offered $1.6 million for
it.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs last year returned more than 200 Peruvian artifacts
_ including 10 pieces from Sipan _ that were discovered during a
routine inspection at Miami International Airport. Agents checking
a crate labeled ``Peruvian handicrafts'' for illegal drugs instead
found $1.5 million worth of artifacts that were being transferred
from a South American cargo plane to a Zurich-bound flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miami seizure leaves no doubt in my mind that we are
dealing with organized, systematic looting,'' Alva says. ``Those
pieces, which were of the highest quality, represented nine
different Peruvian cultures. It was as if they were assembled to
stock a museum. It shows that entire collections are being
mobilized to meet the increase in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Peru got its treasures back, but such recoveries are
the exception, not the rule. ``What we have recovered is probably
less than 1 percent of the total traffic in Peruvian artifacts,''
says Alva.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the smuggled artifacts in Miami underscores why the
rate of successful prosecutions is so low. Although the shipment
bore an address in Switzerland, whose liberal export and import
regulations make it a favorite point for the laundering of illicit
antiquities, Swiss police declined to take action. And Peruvian
authorities have never located the person in Lima whose return
address was on the crate.
</P>
<P>
   But Alva, who helped U.S. Customs identify the artifacts, says
he thinks the collection was assembled in Lima by a wealthy art
dealer, Raul Apesteguia, who had previously served prison time for
violations of Peruvian antiquities laws.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the customs seizure in Miami, Apesteguia was
shot and killed by masked gunmen at his townhouse in Lima. The
gunmen boldly carted off boxes of pre-Columbian artifacts while
neighbors watched. Peruvian police have made no arrests in that
case either, although local customs agents did intercept some of
the stolen artifacts at Lima International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Lima's high-end art dealers, however, are merely the apex of a
network of buyers, sellers and diggers that reaches deep into
Peru's impoverished countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looting is a way of life for many people here, and the pace of
it is definitely accelerating,'' says Dillehay, who often
encounters grave robbers in the course of his survey work. ``It's
not clandestine like it used to be. On many days, we find them out
here digging in broad daylight.''
</P>
<P>
   To make his point, Dillehay steers his dust-covered Jeep
Cherokee toward the ruins of a crumbling 800-year-old pyramid, the
Huaca Corbacho, which rises starkly out of the surrounding sugar
cane fields. As he pulls up, three looters scamper out of freshly
dug holes and flee across a landscape riddled with foxhole-sized
pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There they go,'' he says, pointing. ``Actually, it's a good
thing that they're running. The ones that are armed usually don't
run.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Although looting is usually conducted by small groups of
huaqueros, Dillehay says, the nearby village of Cayalti is home to
something new in Peru's artifact trade _ a looters syndicate, with
as many as 400 individuals who work assigned territories, share
equipment and swap information about their discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When sugar prices drop and they need money, the men come out
here and dig like hell,'' says Dillehay. ``This site has been
totally butchered. And every hillside in the valley is being
destroyed just like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackey, who has worked for 20 years in Peru, has watched her own
excavations pillaged by looters. Sometimes they wait until
archaeologists are gone for the season. Sometimes they come at
night. And sometimes they don't wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of archaeologists only makes looters more
interested,'' she says. ``They come like pickpockets to a fair.
There are times we've been on one side of a site working while
looters are digging on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people look on looting as a kind of national lottery.
Everyone wants to strike it rich. Discoveries like Sipan keep the
dream alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Any riches, however, seldom trickle down to the local level. In
his auto repair shop in Guadalupe, just off the Pan American
Highway, mechanic Manuel Mora offers a short course in the
economics of illicit artifacts as he leads visitors to a side room,
furnished with a simple cot and shelves of motor oil boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes contain museum-quality ceramics that he accepts as
barter when his customers have no money. Mora's pots aren't for
sale, but he occasionally gives them to family members as wedding
or birthday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Unwrapping crumpled newspapers, he holds up a piece of Moche
pottery adorned with a bird and serpent. Pots like it sell for
$5,000 or more at U.S. auctions. He received it in exchange for
welding an axle on a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   His prized possession is a copper tumi, a ceremonial knife that
would easily bring $10,000 at auction. He received it from the
local police for repairing their patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, they take prisoners from the jail and drive them out
to the ruins,'' he explains. ``They make them dig. When they find
something, the police keep what they find and use it for their own
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even under ideal conditions, Peruvian authorities acknowledge
that putting a stop to looting would be a monumental task. In
reality, even slowing the pace has proved to be impossible _ a
reality that Peru tacitly recognizes every July 28, when entire
families may celebrate Peruvian independence day with a trip to the
country for a picnic, a little looting, and another chance to
strike it rich _ assured that the police will be looking the other
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is immense,'' says Miguel Pazos Rivera, adviser to
the director of the National Institute of Culture, the arm of the
government responsible for protecting Peru's cultural resources.
``We have over 100,000 archaeological sites in Peru that we know
of. But only one-third of the country has even been surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very little is done to control looting,'' he says. ``We don't
have the money or the manpower to deal with it. And lately we seem
to be moving in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Still struggling to recover economically after a decade of
guerrilla warfare waged by the Sendero Luminoso and Tupac Amaru,
President Alberto Fujimori's government has been scaling back the
protection of Peru's archaeological riches.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural institute's staff has been cut by more than half.
And in 1998, a series of presidential decrees undermined Peru's
1926 law that declared all cultural objects part of the national
patrimony. By law, landowners now retain rights to anything,
including ruins and artifacts, found on their property _ just as
they do in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our laws are getting more permissive,'' says Maria Ofelia
Cerro, one of the few advocates for archaeological protection in
the Peruvian Congress. ``There is no control anymore. It is so open
now that sometimes when I'm stuck in traffic, I have people come up
to the car and try to sell me beautiful pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   But she says Peru will never be able to halt traffic in illicit
antiquities by itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the looters,'' she says. ``If you can't eat, you
have to sell something to make money. But the rest of the world
must recognize that it is the collectors _ especially those in
Europe, Japan and the United States _ who are the real looters.
They create the demand. They are feeding the trend. And the result
is that the tragic loss of our heritage is increasing.''

 &HT;    Resignation of Bush aide illustrates management style
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The sudden departure late Tuesday of a top aide
in the George W. Bush presidential campaign offers some clues for a
nation eager for answers about a front-running candidate about whom
it knows relatively little.
</P>
<P>
   Bush demands loyalty, a tight inner circle and quick action when
things are headed in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   It took just 10 weeks for Bush and top adviser Karl Rove to
figure out that veteran campaign spokesman David Beckwith was not
their kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   Word from inside the campaign is that several things contributed
to Beckwith's resignation, the first shakeup in the Bush campaign.
Bush has managed to maintain a close-knit, stable inner circle
since becoming governor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Beckwith took some heat from Rove for comments he
made questioning the value and credibility of the upcoming Iowa
straw poll. The official word from the Bush campaign is that the
Aug. 14 straw poll and the Iowa caucuses next February are
important, well-run exercises in democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith didn't quite toe the company line last week when he
told the Austin American-Statesman, ``This isn't a caucus. A caucus
is bad enough. You sit there for four hours in the fire station.
This is give-up-an-entire-Saturday in the middle of summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment was published Monday. Beckwith was gone on Tuesday.
The lesson was simple: If anyone in the Bush campaign is going to
do any popping off, it will be the candidate himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and campaign officials also were peeved when Beckwith
acknowledged recently that he had played some role in low-balling
how much money the campaign has raised. In the days prior to Bush's
announcement that he had collected more than $36 million, some
newspapers _ relying in part on signals from Beckwith _ reported
the total as $20 million to $23 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told some reporters some incorrect things,'' a Bush
campaign aide said after Beckwith was gone. In Washington late
Tuesday, Bush said Beckwith ``resigned ... over stylistic
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good friend of mine,'' said Bush. ``It just didn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-Beckwith tie goes back to the governor's father.
Beckwith, a former Time correspondent, was press secretary for Vice
President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Bush had moved quickly to get rid of a
spokesperson not to his liking. In his 1994 gubernatorial campaign,
he brought in Deborah Burstion-Wade from Washington to be his link
to the media. She also lasted only a matter of weeks before heading
back to Washington with little explanation.
</P>
<P>
   While his father was in the White House, Bush, then a top aide,
moved in for the kill when doubts cropped up about Chief of Staff
John Sununu's loyalty to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Rove like a compact inner circle. Since taking office
in 1995, they've beaten the odds and managed to keep one. It's
Bush, Rove, Joe Allbaugh, Don Evans and press aide Karen Hughes.
Just beyond that group are longtime friend Clay Johnson and former
aide Al Gonzales, now a Bush appointee on the Texas Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The inside circle plays it close to the vest and takes pride in
keeping top-level information at top levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign was quite pleased with itself when it was able
to keep a prying press corps way off base on the amount of money it
had raised this year. But that pride was overshadowed when Beckwith
became the subject of criticism for misleading reporters about
those numbers.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the question becomes whether a presidential campaign
and _ even more challenging _ a presidential administration can
avoid expanding the base of power and information.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, says Austinite George Christian, former press
secretary to President Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, according to Christian, had an inside group of about 25
people. But a smaller group, usually about four, were in the
``bedroom group'' that had full access to Johnson, even in his
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the tightness is the only way to have discipline,'' he
said.

ECONOMIC SCENE: CUTTING THE TAX ON CAPITAL GAINS TAX  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress is once again flirting with cutting the tax on capital
gains, the profit from selling stocks, bonds and other investments.
House Republicans, led by Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee, have proposed lowering the top rate on
capital gains to 15 percent from 20 percent as part of an $864
billion package of tax cuts spread over 10 years. The goal, its
sponsors say, is to stimulate savings, investment and economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nice-sounding theory. But many economists say it lacks
credible evidence. Joel Slemrod, director of the Office of Tax
Policy Research at the University of Michigan, speaks for many of
his colleagues when he says that the ``idea of cutting capital
gains tax to move the economy significantly is implausible.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of taxes involved, which in typical years hovers
between $20 billion and $50 billion, ``is too small to shift an $8
trillion economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For tax cuts to spur investment, people must save more and then
turn more savings over to corporations for investment in plant,
equipment or research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Alan J. Auerbach, a professor of economics at the University of
California at Berkeley and a former chief economist for the Joint
Committee on Taxation, points out that much current savings is
exempt from the capital gains tax. The tax does not hit pension
funds or other nonprofit organizations. Nor does it affect most
foreigners. Without a new wave of saving, there can be no new wave
of investment.
</P>
<P>
   For this and many other reasons, Auerbach says, ``the impact of
the capital gains tax is highly attenuated.'' Stocks held until
death are exempt from the capital gains tax, which is watered down
even further by being imposed only after investments are sold.
Investors who hold on to inflated stocks get to postpone paying
taxes _ in effect, receiving an interest-free loan from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The capital gains tax, Auerbach says, ``affects investors who
receive most of their profit from capital gains on stocks; but
perhaps half of the nation's investment is financed with equity,
half of the return on stocks comes from capital gains, and half of
all equity is owned by taxable investors.''
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, cutting the tax on capital gains cannot pack
much of a wallop.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach estimates that the proposed tax cut would raise the
profit on investments by 1 percent to 2 percent at most. Too weak
to encourage much future investment, the proposed tax cut would do
little more than provide windfall profit to investors for existing
investments _ hardly, economists say, a smart use of taxpayer
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Fazzari of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute
contends that the case for cutting the capital gains tax depends on
three weak links. First, the tax cut must reduce the cost to
investors of acquiring new plants and equipment. Second, investors
must respond to cheaper capital by investing more. Finally, more
capital equipment must translate into more output. Each of these
steps, he says, is small.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fazzari, a 30 percent cut in the capital gains tax
_ more than Archer is proposing _ would be expected to reduce the
total cost of acquiring plants and equipment by businesses by only
about 2 percent. A 2 percent reduction in the cost of investment
would lead to an increase of about five-tenths of a percent in the
amount of new investment. A five-tenths of a percent increase in
new capital would translate into an increase of about
sixteen-hundredths of a percent in economic output. The economic
effect ``would be minute,'' Fazzari says.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach acknowledges that capital gains tax cuts can alter the
timing of people's decisions to buy and sell stocks and bonds.
Obvious proof was provided in 1986, when investors sold twice as
many securities as expected in anticipation of higher rates that
took effect the following year. But timing mostly affects when the
government collects revenue, not how much it eventually collects.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the tax cut say investors are locked into holding
stocks they would prefer to sell if not for high taxes on profits.
Perhaps so. But this ``lock-in'' effect has almost no effect on
corporate investment. If Archer's tax-cut proposal encourages Harry
to sell his Exxon stock to Sally for $1,000, the sale will not put
a dime into Exxon's coffers.
</P>
<P>
   There remains an issue of fairness. The proposed cut would
overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy. Robert McIntyre, director of
the Citizens for Tax Justice, estimates that the capital gains tax
cut would be worth less than $20 for families earning $40,000 to
$60,000 a year, but worth more than $8,000 for families earning
more than $300,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   If the tax cut would truly bolster economic growth, raising
wages and reducing unemployment, then its skewed impact might be
tolerated. In such case, the best option for Congress would be to
pass the tax cut, reap the economy-wide benefits and find a way to
raise taxes on wealthy families. But if Slemrod, Auerbach and
Fazzari are right, the tax would do little more than enrich the
already rich.

TIME WARNER REVENUES DECLINED ALTHOUGH NET INCOME ROSE TO $575
MILLION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time Warner said Wednesday that its net income rose to $575
million, or 43 cents a share fully diluted, for the second quarter
from $23 million, or 2 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues,
however, declined 2.6 percent, to $3.57 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The pretax profits included $793 million, the company's earnings
from its interest in Time Warner Entertainment, which owns Warner
Brothers, HBO and cable systems. That figure compares with $166
million last year, although the 1999 quarter includes significant
one-time pretax gains, related to selling and swapping some cable
assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers were very strong and solid,'' said John Tinker, an
entertainment analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The company said combined cash flow _ earnings before interest,
taxes and amortization _ for Time Warner and Time Warner
Entertainment, rose 74 percent, to $2.017 billion from $1.160
billion a year earlier. Analysts consider cash flow a better
measure of the performance of indebted companies than earnings
because it excludes interest payments and focuses on the underlying
operations. Revenues, however, rose just 1.6 percent, to $6.63
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gains in cash flow for the company's cable operations included a
one-time $771 million gain from selling and swapping cable systems.
After normalizing for the effects of these gains and other smaller
transactions, Time Warner's cable operations showed an internal
growth rate of 11 percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The company noted that the gains were an accounting benefit as
opposed to a cash benefit since the cable systems were swapped for
other systems that, in the majority of cases, had a lower cost
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's chairman, Gerald Levin, emphasized Wednesday in
meetings with analysts and reporters that the company would focus
heavily on its digital businesses. Richard Bressler now has the
authority to oversee these operations for the entire company. Levin
also said the publishing operations continued to turn in a very
strong performance, as cash flow jumped to $196 million in the
second quarter from $176 million in the corresponding quarter last
year. Publishing revenues rose to $1.15 billion from $1.13 billion
last year. The company cited strong gains at InStyle, and Sports
Illustrated, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Though revenues for the music division fell to $828 million from
$905 million a year earlier, depressed in part by the Japanese
economy, cash flow at the division rose to $101 million from $96
million. Time Warner said the operation benefited from cost
reduction as well as albums from Chere Tim McGraw.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' helped
push cash flow for Turner Broadcasting's film division up 87
percent, to $71 million from $38 million a year earlier. Warner
Brothers's cash flow also increased, rising to $132 million from
$122 million in the comparable quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock rose $1.5625, to $77.3125.

APPEALS COURT GIVES GREEN LIGHT TO SCHOOL PRAYER IN ALABAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ga.)  (jw) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Public-school prayer is more than an abstract
issue of civil liberties in Alabama. For many students it is the
stuff of everyday life, a part of football huddles and weekly
assemblies, and the question of its legality has driven political
campaigns and prompted mass demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   So when a federal appellate court issued a ruling on Tuesday
that permitted students to engage in personal, voluntary prayer in
school, it was front-page news across the state. Suddenly, students
were given a green light by the court to pray all they wanted in
school and to lead other students in prayer, as long as school
officials are not involved.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta allows students to pray on the
public-address system and at graduation ceremonies. They cannot
actively proselytize from the auditorium stage, but as long as
school personnel do not have any direct role they can engage in
most other forms of religious expression, by themselves or with
other students.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ends the latest round of a debate that has swept
through the state since the Alabama Legislature explicitly
permitted student-led voluntary prayer in the public schools in
1993. Michael Chandler, then a vice principal at Valley Head High
School in DeKalb County, in northeastern Alabama, filed suit
against the provision in 1996, contending that any form of prayer
permitted in the schools was essentially a state-sponsored exercise
of religion that should be forbidden under the First Amendment to
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Fob James Jr., then the governor, publicly defended the prayer
provision and made it a central element of his unsuccessful
campaign for re-election last year. He urged a federal judge to
dismiss Chandler's case, arguing in essence that the First
Amendment does not apply to the state.
</P>
<P>
   James' argument failed to impress Judge Ira DeMent of U.S.
District Court in Montgomery, who struck down the provision as
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   James then pledged to ``resist Judge DeMent's order by every
legal and political means, with every ounce of strength I
possess.''
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians also used the decision as a rallying point,
and there were mass demonstrations by public school students around
the state.
</P>
<P>
   At that point the issue was taken up by Alabama Attorney General
Bill Pryor, who filed the appeal of Judge DeMent's ruling that
proved successful on Tuesday. In a unanimous decision, the
appellate court panel wrote that if the state prohibited all forms
of religious expression in school, it essentially fostered atheism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permitting students to speak religiously signifies neither
state approval nor disapproval of that speech,'' the judges said in
their decision. ``The speech is not the state's _ either by
attribution or by adoption. The permission signifies no more than
that the state acknowledges its constitutional duty to tolerate
religious expression. Only in this way is true neutrality
achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pryor called the decision a victory for free
speech and religious freedom. ``Public school students do not give
up their First Amendment rights when they go to school,'' he said,
adding that it was unfair that students could be permitted to read
from secular inspirational books at assemblies but not from the
Bible or other religious works.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Summers, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union
who represented Chandler, said she was shocked at the decision,
calling it ``hideously unprincipled'' and ``unconscionable'' to
allow students to use state facilities to foster religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts are saying, `We'll just have a local option on the
Constitution,' '' she said, `` `and you people down there in
Alabama can go ahead and pray over the intercom all you want, and
if some people there don't like it they can move to California,
where folks don't act like that.' '' Ms. Summers said there was a
good chance the civil rights group would appeal the decision to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said they did not expect much change as a
result of the ruling because teachers rarely interfered with
student-initiated prayer. The Birmingham Post-Herald surveyed a
group of school athletic directors Wednesday, most of whom said
prayers before a game would continue throughout the state _ but
from now on, without the coach.

 &HT;    Health center would extend Morehouse doctors' global reach
 &HT;    By Rachael Kennedy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Morehouse School of Medicine is hoping to expand
its horizons by creating a permanent American-African International
Health Center in Atlanta. This month, the U.S. Senate approved a
bill earmarking $5.5 million for the center and the proposal is now
before the House. Staff writer Rachael Kennedy talked with Dr.
Louis Sullivan, president of the medical school about the center.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What prompted Morehouse to seek this type of large-scale
outreach proposal?
</P>
<P>
   A: Our experience since the school opened in 1975 has been (to
be involved with) projects like this. We worked in Senegal to
create a school of public health and to integrate traditional
healers and the medical system. In Uganda we taught midwives
sanitary techniques and practices. In Zambia, for five years, we
helped an AIDS prevention and education campaign. In Georgia, the
old part of the U.S.S.R., we helped educate health professionals.
Basically, because of our interest in health problems and the
status of people's health in Africa, we recognized the need to have
organized teams instead of continuing on this ad hoc basis. We felt
that what's needed is a center. This has been part of my vision. It
would give us another dimension. I look at this as an extension of
our learning environment and being of great service. It would
enhance the skills of our faculty and students.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What issues would you want to investigate through the center?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're currently working with Bristol-Myers Squibb in several
countries in south Africa on AIDS education, prevention and
treatment. We'd also like to look into heart disease and high blood
pressure in African countries and compare that to African-Americans
in the U.S. We have experience in endocrinology, community
organization, AIDS and high blood pressure, also in a broad array
of other specialities. Our role will be, indeed, to help find and
recruit people to work on specific projects. The magnitude of
health problems people face in Africa is challenging and will
require many people with particular specialities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will Morehouse partner with other organizations that have
international health expertise?
</P>
<P>
   A: Currently we are not partnered with the Carter Center or the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but that is foreseeable
in the future. We have in the past worked closely with Tulane
School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins School of Public Health,
Emory Medical School and Grady Hospital.

NATIONAL PANEL OFFERS PATIENT PRIVACY GUIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A national non-governmental panel on health privacy recommended
11 guidelines Wednesday on protecting patient confidentiality while
ensuring appropriate access to personal medical information.
</P>
<P>
   There is now no federal privacy law for health records. If
Congress does not meet an August 21 deadline for enacting health
privacy legislation, Donna Shalala, the secretary of Health and
Human Services, is supposed to issue privacy-protection rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, people are terribly vulnerable and state laws are
very inconsistent,'' said Janlori Goldman, director of the Health
Privacy Working Group and head of the Health Privacy Project at
Georgetown University. In this state, a comprehensive health
privacy bill introduced by Representative Jay Kaufman of Lexington
is before the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   According to Goldman, one out of six people withhold medical
information or avoid seeking care from a physician because of fear
that the information will be misused. But while patients might
worry how technology makes it easier to spread medical information,
health care professionals and researchers see great benefits from
databases on medical information, such as understanding patterns of
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which included industry groups and advocacy
organizations, recommended that all patient information be kept as
``non-identifiable'' as possible and that any recipients of medical
information be prohibited from re-disclosing that information in
personally identifiable form without specific patient
authorization.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also agreed that all research, not just federally
funded research, should be subject to objective and balanced review
to ensure privacy. Such a requirement is currently met for
federally funded research through individual research facilities'
Institutional Review Boards.
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines backed by the panel included: An individual should
have the right to access his or her own data and the right to
supplement such information, and strong and effective remedies for
violations of privacy protections should be established.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said that computerizing health data should not always be
looked at as the villain in the privacy debate. ``It is exciting in
this day and age that technology exists to protect privacy, not
just to undermine it. We have the capability to remove personal
identifiers from health records,'' she said. In addition,
electronic audits could be used to trace who has accessed a
patient's medical data.

</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK-FILMS (Undated) _ In ``The Killing'' (1956), one of
Stanley Kubrick's earliest feature films, a man talking about his
cronies in a racetrack heist remarks: ``None of these men are
criminals in the usual sense. They've all got jobs and they all
live seemingly normal, decent lives, but they've got their problems
and they've all got a little larceny in them.'' Change ``a little
larceny'' to varying degrees of ``a lot'' and you've got a pretty
good description of Kubrick's entire body of work. Kubrick's new
movie, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' a lugubrious, strangely static work that
he completed shortly before his death in March, is no exception.
The movie stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a wealthy New York
couple who imperil their cushy, bourgeois lives by yielding to the
dark side of their natures. By Michiko Kakutani. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CUNNINGHAM-DANCE (Undated) _ Talking about Merce Cunningham's
choreography can lead to an attack of the nonlinear. Words like
possibility, multiplicity and flexibility burst out like the
unexpected movements in his dances. As Lincoln Center Festival '99
prepares to honor Cunningham with an 80th-birthday celebration this
week, he is, as always, exploring new ways of moving in new
contexts. Theories that explain the premises behind his work
abound. Yet the cerebral and the fantastic have never been at odds
in his half-century of experiments. Once heckled as the high priest
of the dance avant-garde and now acclaimed for the same reason, he
has never failed to show that even the most fully plotted cosmos
can reveal surprising secrets. By Anna Kisselgoff. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BELGIAN-FILMS (Undated) _ This year marked the triumph of the
realist strain in Belgian film, as ``Rosetta,'' directed by Luc and
Jean-Pierre Dardenne (brothers whose previous films include ``La
Promesse'') captured top honors, including the Palme d'Or, at the
Cannes International Film Festival. (While across town ``The
Carriers are Waiting,'' a comedy about a working-class family by a
firsttime Belgian director, Benoit Mariage, played to packed houses
at the Director's Fortnight, a sidebar to the main festival.)
``Rosetta,'' which will open here in the fall, uses a hand-held
camera and a cinema verite style to tell an intense moral fable
about an impoverished young girl's struggle to hold down a menial
job while maintaining shreds of dignity. By Leslie Camhi. (Moved).

<P>
   CABARET-BALKAN-FILM (Paris) _ It is not an easy time for a
Serbian filmmaker to be releasing a new movie in the United States,
even for a veteran director like Goran Paskaljevic, who has long
opposed Slobodan Milosevic's regime, who has expressed his shame
over the atrocities committed by Serbian forces in Bosnia and
Kosovo, who has been denounced as a traitor by the official press
in Belgrade. For all that, he remains a Serb, and, as such, he is
expected to throw light on the collective madness that has gripped
a good many of his fellow Serbs of late. As it happens, this was
his objective when he began shooting ``Cabaret Balkan,'' his 11th
feature film, in Belgrade in the early spring of 1998. It was still
a year before NATO launched its aerial war against Yugoslavia in
the name of saving Kosovo, but Paskaljevic was already convinced
that Milosevic was leading his nation to disaster. His movie is
about people, not politics, but nonetheless about people driven to
violence and despair by politics. By Alan Riding. (Moved). Photo.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOLITUDE-THEATER (London) _ ``Fair enough then. So we're
alone.'' When Dame Judi Dench, playing a grieving veteran theater
actress, speaks the final line of ``Amy's View'' Sunday on Broadway
during the last performance at the Ethel Barrymore Theater of David
Hare's play, the remark may make theatergoers sit up with a start.
Part of the frisson comes from the elegant visualization of those
closing moments, in which cascading sheets of silk prompt a far
more real emotive response than any musical's mechanized scenery
ever could. For that, credit Richard Eyre, the director, and Bob
Crowley, the designer, alongside that rare performer, Dame Judi,
who is never more moving than when she is being most
matter-of-fact. But beyond the simplicity of a scene that works
simultaneously as baptism and requiem, is the stark, declarative
nature of the concluding remarks of Dame Judi's character, Esme
Allen. In just those six unsentimental words, Esme gives voice to a
condition that has been dramatized of late with varying degrees of
urgency and pathos on New York and London stages. By Matt Wolf.

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE-BENJAMIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Some artists bloom young;
others do not find themselves until they are a decade or two into
adult life. George Benjamin, 3, the English composer who is in
residence at the Tanglewood Music Center Festival of Contemporary
Music, beginning on Thursday in Lenox, Mass., where his music will
be featured, has followed both patterns. In his late teens and
early 20s Benjamin produced a quick succession of bold and
beautiful works, full of energy and color, and remarkable also for
their technical finish. Then the flow almost stopped until, as he
entered his 30s in 1990, he emerged again as an even stronger
creative presence, with the same keen ear but a weightier mind. The
Tanglewood programs include pieces from both the youthful
flourishing and later. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL-PARK-OPERAS (Undated) _ A new operatic project could
hardly receive a more auspicious introduction than that to be
accorded over the next five months to ``Central Park,'' a trilogy
of one-act operas by three American composer-librettist teams.
That's why the flak that the project has stirred up among many
people concerned about the future of American opera, especially
American composers, has been so noteworthy. The short operas that
make up the trilogy are linked thematically only in that each story
is set in New York's most famous park. ``Central Park'' will have
its premiere on Saturday evening at the Glimmerglass Opera in
Cooperstown, N.Y. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BAROQUE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Celine Dion singing ``My Heart Will Go
On'' and a Locatelli violin concerto send me to the radio's ``off''
button with equal velocity. A decision about Ms. Dion took about 45
seconds, Locatelli more like 30 years. But the two are annoying for
similar reasons. Ms. Dion makes it easy. The disposable charms of a
momentarily famous pop singer are brief by nature. Yet how has a
love affair with the Italian Baroque _ born of the postwar
long-playing record boom _ gone so wrong? Those of us raised on the
big pieces of the 19th century, a lot of Mozart and a little Haydn
raced to the record stores to hear the latest Torelli and Corelli
from chamber orchestras like I Musici or I Virtuosi di Roma. We
were charmed by the elegance and the certitude. We liked the
absence of bigness for its own sake and the clarity of small string
ensembles in synchrony. With exceptions (Vivaldi is one), I find
this music increasingly difficult to listen to. Saturation?
Perhaps. Near-symmetry, often repeated, numbs the spirit; the
frictionless paradoxically becomes an irritant. This civilizing of
human passions runs like a current beneath the great musical events
of the 18th century, although the best composers, refusing to be so
easily tamed, fought against the tide. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CONDUCTORS-MUSIC (Undated) _ At a time when so many orchestras
and conductors are changing partners, it is good to be reminded of
the artistic benefits of retaining a long-term maestro. One such
reminder comes in the form of a Sony Classical reissue of two
classic recordings by the Cleveland Orchestra under the direction
of George Szell: Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony, recorded in 1959, and
Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, recorded in 1965. These
performances may not induce discophiles to part with their version
of the Prokofiev by Herbert von Karajan or of the Bartok by Fritz
Reiner, but both offer orchestral playing of breathtaking
refinement while challenging the notion that Szell was a dour
taskmaster and an interpretive literalist. By David Schiff.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Most of the recent controversy about
on-line music has been over how it is going to change the
experience of selling and purchasing music, but much more
interesting is the question of how it is changing our experience of
listening to and handling the music. Listening to music on the
Internet is not simply a novel alternative to CD players or a way
to use the computer as a separate but equal stereo system. Nor is
it an opportunity to level the playing field _ as utopians like to
dream _ and allow all musicians, great and small, access to all
listeners mainstream and marginal. It is a key to unlocking the
restrictions that all audio storage media before them have posed to
musicians and fans. The CD was a medium similar enough to a record
that one could still call it an album without being corrected. But
with the Internet, the idea of the album is dead. By Neil Strauss.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JAPANESE-ARTISTS (Annandale-On-Hudson, N.Y.) _ Since the late
1980s, a number of younger Japanese artists have emerged on the
international scene to challenge the old notion that all modern art
from Japan is merely a pale imitation of modern art from the West.
Among them are Yasumasa Morimura, Tatsuo Miyajima, Mariko Mori and
Takashi Murakami, whose goofy, glossy work has found an avid
audience outside Japan. Rooted in Japanese popular culture,
Murakami's art communicates across borders in a media-driven era of
global pop to which fashion, animation, music and electronic
gadgetry from Japan have all contributed. It is now the focus of
``The Meaning of the Nonsense of the Meaning,'' a
mini-retrospective on view here at the Center for Curatorial
Studies Museum at Bard College through Sept. 12. By Edward M.
Gomez. (Moved).
</P>

   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-BONANNO (Undated) _ Joseph Bonanno, the long-retired Mafia
boss (he prefers ``father'') widely known as Joe Bananas, who is
now, at 94, is truly the Really Absolutely Very Last Don.
``Bonanno: A Godfather's Story,'' a two-part film being shown next
Sunday and Monday on Showtime, may well be the highest-level mob
memoir and tutorial (``Mafia is a process, not a thing'') to find
its way to the screen. It is quite certainly the only one ever to
list another acknowledged Mafioso _ Bonanno's son Salvatore, known
as Bill _ as an executive producer. By Ralph Blumenthal. (Moved).

MORGAN STANLEY WON'T FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES IN FORMER EMPLOYEE'S
ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the Wall Street firm that
has been under legal scrutiny since it paid a person involved in
the arrest of a former employee, will not face criminal charges in
the case, the Manhattan district attorney said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement lifts a shadow that has hung over Morgan
Stanley and several of its senior executives since the district
attorney's office began an investigation in May into the securities
firm's conduct in the arrest of Christian L. Curry. Morgan Stanley
acknowledged making mistakes in the matter. Two senior lawyers
there, including the general counsel, resigned last month.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was Morgan Stanley's payment of $10,000 to a
confidential informant who helped set up a police sting operation
against Curry in August 1998, several months after the firm
dismissed Curry, who was working as a financial analyst. Curry, who
is black, was arrested and charged with conspiring to plant fake
racist e-mail messages on Morgan Stanley's computers to bolster a
contemplated discrimination lawsuit. Those charges have since been
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office had pressed Morgan Stanley to
explain why it made the payment to a person who was integral to
Curry's arrest, why it initially failed to inform the authorities
about the payment, why it entered the payment incorrectly in its
accounting records and why it took nine months for the firm to
cooperate fully with the district attorney's office, people close
to the investigation have said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley ``exercised poor judgment'' in its dealings with
Charles Joseph Luethke, the confidential informant, and the
district attorney's office, District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau
said in Wednesday's statement. But the statement attributed Morgan
Stanley's errors to ``inexperience in dealing with law enforcement
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the heart of this case was a concern that a firm like
Morgan Stanley, which has a certain standing in the community, was
not providing full disclosure about an important matter,'' Daniel
J. Castleman, head of the criminal division at the district
attorney's office, said in an interview. ``But at the end of the
day it turned out that no one had unlawful intent, nor was anyone
trying to impede a criminal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley hailed the district attorney's statement as an
exoneration. ``We believe that the only criminal behavior was that
of Curry in his attempts to defraud Morgan Stanley,'' a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm still faces a civil lawsuit, now pending in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan. The suit, filed by Curry in May,
contends that Morgan Stanley discriminated against Curry on account
of race and perceived sexual orientation. The lawsuit also contends
that Morgan Stanley contributed to Curry's false arrest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Benedict P. Morelli, Curry's lawyer, said that he expected
Wednesday's action and that it would have no effect on the civil
suit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, however, cites the $10,000 payment to Luethke as
evidence that Morgan Stanley intended to frame Curry, a contention
that the statement from the district attorney's office does not
support.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's statement also addressed allegations in
the Curry lawsuit that the New York Police Department conducted the
sting operation against Curry after Morgan Stanley promised police
officers money and jobs. The statement said that the allegations
had ``no substance.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Three years ago, as word spread that its software
products could help solve Year 2000 computer problems, a
little-known company called Viasoft Inc. became an overnight Wall
Street sensation. Sales soared, and Viasoft's stock price shot up
nearly eightfold in 1996, the second-biggest percentage gain that
year of any company listed on the three major exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, though, Viasoft paid for that wild ride with
falling revenue, layoffs and _ after a 90 percent decline in its
stock price from a peak of $65.25 in 1997 _ pariah status on Wall
Street. Some customers are worried about Viasoft's future, as the
company discovered when a computer glitch shut down its Internet
site for three days in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our salesman started getting questions about whether we were
closing,'' said Mario Diaz, the company's executive director of
marketing communications.
</P>
<P>
   Such questions make little sense in light of Viasoft's strong
finances and established product line. But they highlight a
quandary faced by many software and computer-service companies that
plunged into the market for Year 2000 solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for all companies is to remake themselves as the
world changes,'' said Joseph L. Bower, a strategy specialist at the
Harvard Business School. ``The difference between Year 2000
companies and something like integrated steel is that it's so
obvious they need to change and the deadline is near.''
</P>
<P>
   The best is yet to come, of course, for a number of businesses
addressing the Y2K problem, the catch phrase for the coding glitch
that threatens to make some computers and equipment malfunction as
they encounter Year 2000 dates. Sales of products ranging from
dried foods to electrical generators are booming as nervous
consumers prepare for the worst, and demand is expected to surge
for services like temporary security guards and backup telephone
operators.
</P>
<P>
   But as major corporate customers wrap up their computer repair
programs, business has been drying up for Viasoft and other vendors
of software tools and services aimed at Y2K solutions. Some smaller
companies have disappeared or, like Peritus Software Services of
Billerica, Mass., have withered to the point of having their stock
delisted by the Nasdaq exchange. Others, like Information
Architects Corp. (formerly Alydaar Software Corp.) of Charlotte,
N.C., have changed their names along with their focus in an attempt
to shake their Year 2000 identities.
</P>
<P>
   Even large, diversified information technology service concerns
like the Boston-based Keane Inc., which Wall Street analysts rate
as excellent long-term investments, have experienced slowing growth
and tumbling share prices lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street doesn't like it when you don't get that strong
year-over-year growth,' said Brian T. Keane, Keane's co-president.
</P>
<P>
   In their effort to convince Wall Street that they are moving
into new territory, companies are reclassifying deals they once
would have called Year 2000 work as software-maintenance contracts
and are emphasizing how many employees have been shifted to other
assignments, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Viasoft has a particularly stiff challenge because it was later
than most to focus on the post-Y2K world. But it also has strong
roots to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1983 by software engineers who saw a
need for tools to help big businesses map and rearrange mainframe
computer programs. The programs, some of them dating to the 1960s,
had become convoluted and almost impenetrable at many companies as
more and more applications were added to them.
</P>
<P>
   Viasoft's software helped clients figure out how the parts
interacted and how to overhaul them to make everything more
efficient, more reliable or easier to update. The company managed
to achieve profitability and a respectable enough growth rate to go
public in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, in retrospect, Viasoft scarcely mentioned its Year
2000 capabilities in the roadshow leading up to its stock offering.
Although company executives realized that its products could locate
date problems in older software, they assumed most investors had
not heard of the coding challenge and that the size of the market
was too unpredictable to make it a major selling point.
</P>
<P>
   As 1995 wore on, though, influential analysts like the Gartner
Group began warning that hundreds of billions of dollars would need
to be spent on Year 2000 work. Viasoft began casting itself as a
Year 2000 player and adapting its products to such work _ and Wall
Street cheered it on.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Cinderella-like predicament loomed from the
beginning: No matter how big and lucrative the Year 2000 market
might turn out to be, everybody knew it would not last much past
midnight of Dec. 31, 1999 _ and that the ultimate challenge would
be to change focus before the party ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it could end with some bumps,'' said Steven D.
Whiteman, Viasoft's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there were bumps on the way up. Viasoft's software
fared well in the competition for locating date problems, but sales
began slowing in late 1997 because Viasoft's product developers
guessed wrong about which repair method customers wanted to use to
fix the faulty dates. The most popular turned out to be a technique
called windowing, which involves inserting snippets of code that
tell computer programs to interpret two-digit years below a certain
number as 21st-century dates. With a window set at 40, for example,
39 would be read as 2039 and 41 as 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Viasoft did not add windowing to its key tools until mid-1998,
and even then, the company concedes, its sales force was unhappy
because it was a ``me-too'' feature with no competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Viasoft was lucky in another way, though. It had acquired a new
product line by then called OnMark that dealt with Year 2000
problems in desktop computers and the networks linking them. The
acquisition was completed just as many customers came to realize
that Year 2000 problems extended well beyond the traditional
mainframes. OnMark was a huge hit and carried the company into the
early months of this year before its sales plateaued.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Whiteman and other senior managers were thinking
about ways to make money in the post-2000 world. As early as late
1996, it acquired repository software called Rochade, a central
holding pen for a company's computer programs, databases and the
tools it uses to write new programs or update old ones.
</P>
<P>
   And Whiteman recruited outside executives with no Year 2000
experience to encourage work on Viasoft's future, including Ruiz, a
former marketing executive at Apple Computer, and David M. Lee, a
product-development specialist at Tivoli Systems, a software vendor
now owned by IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``But everyone was so caught up making Y2K money it was hard to
get people to look ahead,'' said Lee, now Viasoft's vice president
for development. ``We were breaking sales records every quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, last winter, the company began fleshing out a strategy
for shifting to the next wave. Some of it was time-sensitive, like
marketing adaptations of its Y2K tools and services to businesses
that are facing deadlines to convert their financial software to
accommodate the new euro currency.
</P>
<P>
   But most of it rode on convincing Wall Street and customers that
it could get back to its roots: helping big business exploit the
giant, many-layered computer programs that have been around so long
they are known as legacy systems.
</P>
<P>
   Multinationals have just spent billions of dollars to get such
systems through the Year 2000 transition. As Viasoft sees it, such
companies are now more wedded than ever to such systems. The
challenge is to tie the systems more effectively into modern
client-server networks that distribute computing power to desktops.
</P>
<P>
   Viasoft _ and most industry analysts _ think there will be an
especially big market for linking legacy systems into E-commerce
and other Internet applications. Many company Web sites now lack
such links, making them no more than electronic facades covering up
business as usual in the back office.
</P>
<P>
   To sell into that market though, Viasoft will have to complete
its efforts to tie together the Rochade repository and other
products. The company is free of debt and has some cash reserves,
but its stock price has tumbled so far that acquiring missing
pieces will be much more difficult than it would have been in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their stock and cash gave them the opportunity to diversify
much more rapidly than they did,'' said Damian Rinaldi, a software
analyst at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Filling in the product line is only part of the challenge,
though. The new market is expected to be oriented much more toward
services than products, requiring a very different sales culture
than the one that came to dominate Viasoft during the Year 2000
frenzy. So the company is hiring new sales representatives and
retraining old ones used to quick, relatively low-cost sales.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Viasoft, many companies plan to bar changes to
their computer systems in the final months of 1999 to limit the
risk of introducing new bugs. Thus, even if Viasoft's vision is
sound, it may find limited opportunities before early in 2000 to
prove to Wall Street _ or itself _ that its strategy is working.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be damn tough in the software business no matter
who you are for the next six months,'' said Scott McLaren, a
Viasoft salesman based in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteman has no regrets about Viasoft's plunge into Y2K waters,
though. The company's finances are stronger than they were in 1995,
he said, and its customer base has doubled to 1,300, including more
than half of the Fortune 100 companies. Besides, he added, the
experience has enabled Viasoft to broaden its technology horizon
beyond mainframe computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still a little under the weather, but we've taken our
medicine,'' Whiteman said.

FAMILY OF RAIL KILLINGS SUSPECT ASKS FOR PRIVACY

<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico _ As Rafael Resendez-Ramirez faced his
accusers in Houston on Wednesday, his family asked for peace and
quiet from inside his mother's modest home.
</P>
<P>
   One day earlier, some of Resendez-Ramirez's relatives watched
tearfully as he turned himself in to Texas authorities at an
international bridge in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   But since the highly-publicized surrender, with reporters and
photographers flooding their neighborhood, sometimes knocking on
their window, the family has declined to talk to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   About noon Wednesday, the family called Juarez police.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they want is to rest. What I am asking is that you
respect this area,'' Capt. Gabriel Torres said as he pointed at the
front yard.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, voices could be heard inside the house,
sometimes discussing meals. The family members broke their silence
by saying they are upset with some members of the news media for
not respecting their feelings, and for breaking their trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to talk to who I want to talk to, when I'm ready,''
said a woman believed to be Resendez-Ramirez's mother, Virginia
Resendiz de Maturino.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez, who identified himself as in a Houston court
Wednesday as Angel Maturino Resendez, is a suspect in nine slayings
in Texas, Illinois and Kentucky. Wednesday, he was charged with
capital murder in an East Texas case.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez is believed to have traveled by rail between
Mexico and the United States, at times stopping in Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 reporters and photographers from Mexico and the United
States camped Wednesday along Puerto Cabezas, a street in a
working-class neighborhood where some of Resendez-Ramirez's
relatives live.
</P>
<P>
   In the family's driveway Wednesday, a white truck displayed a
saying in Spanish on the dashboard:
</P>
<P>
   ``The signs and miracles that God has made for me urge me to
share them.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor said he heard that family members attended a private
prayer service for Resendez-Ramirez on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Dolorez, a construction worker who passes the home every
day on his way to work, said he wonders how the family is coping
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``God help them,'' he said.

ONLY DALLAS, BOSTON READY FOR Y2K, GAO SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only two major cities, Boston and Dallas, are ready to fend off
the Y2K computer bug, according to a study to be released Thursday
by an investigating arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem is
scheduled to issue the report at a hearing on state and local
readiness. This is the first time the government has surveyed
cities about Y2K readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston should be very proud and feel really good about where
they are,'' said Senator Robert F. Bennett (R-Utah), committee
chair. But not all of the nation's cities are in such good shape,
he warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically (the survey) says we are going to have some
trouble,'' Bennett said. ``Those (cities) that say they are not
going to be all compliant until the fourth quarter (of the year)
are a little optimistic. If anything goes wrong they don't have any
wiggle room.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Boston and Dallas meet all of the criteria for year 2000
readiness of the survey conducted by the General Accounting Office.
Boston still lacks the completion of a contigency plan, the report
says, but city officials said it should be ready by Aug. 15 and it
will be tested on an ongoing basis.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO, an organization that audits and evaluates government
programs at the request of congressional committees, examined the
public utilities, emergency services, telecommunications,
hospitals, transportation, public buildings, and city government
services of the nation's 21 largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Municipalities and companies have spent billions of dollars to
fix software to prevent computer problems when the clock strikes
midnight on Jan. 1, 2000. If not repaired, some computers may
misinterpret the year as 1900 and cause systems to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Since electric companies, water treatment centers, and hospitals
in Boston are privately owned, they were not included in the survey
of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the cities reviewed plan to finish addressing Y2K issues
by Sept. 30. And preparations by the remaining 10 will not be
completed until at least October. El Paso, Texas, and Baltimore,
Md., both reported they will not be ready until December.
</P>
<P>
   The threats of noncompliance are real. Last month, a glitch
during a test of a water treatment facilty in Los Angeles that was
supposedly Y2K compliant caused 4 million gallons of raw sewage to
spill into a park.
</P>
<P>
   Boston began repairing its systems to cope with the Y2K bug in
1995. A year later, the city unveiled plans for major hardware and
software operating system replacements. On Jan. 21, Mayor Thomas M.
Menino signed an executive order making Y2K readiness a priority
for his administration.
</P>
<P>
   A team of senior executives, department heads, directors,
programmers, analysts, staff assistants, and private contractors
have spent ``a significant'' number of hours on the project, said
William J. Hannon, director of the city's management and
information systems.
</P>
<P>
   Among other efforts, city engineers earlier this year bought a
Y2K-compliant computer to control 350 traffic signals downtown,
which they concluded was cheaper than trying to make the old system
ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great tribute to the leadership in Boston,'' said
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, vice chairman of the Y2K committee.
``I wish all of the cities would take this as seriously as
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is as enthusiastic about Boston's progress.
David Eddy, a software consultant and longtime Y2K watchdog, said
the city has patted itself on the back but has given little public
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Places like Dallas, or even Texas as a state, have taken this
much more seriously,'' Eddy said. ``The citizenry wants to be told
that everything is OK, so that is what is being said.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Before the date of this week's critical first
meeting between President Clinton and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel could be set, officials said a complication had to be
overcome: Would it fit into Hillary Rodham Clinton's schedule?
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials negotiating with the White House and the State
Department over Barak's six-day official visit to the United States
starting Thursday were told that the Americans were struggling to
find dates that fit not only into Clinton's calendar but that of
Mrs. Clinton, now playing the unprecedented dual roles of first
lady and likely New York senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told Thursday is good,'' for both the president and
first lady, an Israeli official said. Barak is to meet for several
hours with Clinton Thursday afternoon, and then the prime minister
and his wife, Nava, are to fly to Camp David for an intimate dinner
and overnight stay with the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton will also serve as official hostess for a larger
White House dinner for the Baraks on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Early next week, which was the preliminary window for the Barak
visit, Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to be in New York listening to
residents' concerns as she contemplates a run for the Senate. Mrs.
Clinton's schedule was open Thursday evening, Friday and for much
of the weekend, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The consideration of Mrs. Clinton's calendar in planning for a
meeting with a major international figure is an illustration of
what White House aides said would be a growing challenge over the
next 15 months. They must try to harmonize not only the political
and policy messages of the president, vice president and first
lady, but also manage the complex scheduling and logistics involved
in the presidency and the campaigns of Mrs. Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The visit of an Israeli leader to the United States is often
fraught with treacherous diplomatic and domestic political
undercurrents, but this one is further complicated by the potential
impact on Mrs. Clinton's prospective Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is already a figure of some controversy in Israel
and in the American Jewish community because of her comments last
year favoring Palestinian statehood and her declaration last week _
in direct conflict with her husband's official policy _ that
Jerusalem is the ``eternal and indivisible'' capital of Israel and
that the U.S. Embassy should be moved there from Tel Aviv as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said that Mrs.
Clinton's participation in the events surrounding Barak's visit
will be solely in her capacity as president's wife and not as an
as-yet-undeclared candidate for the New York Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an official first lady role,'' Ms. Berry said. ``She
is hosting these guests here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to be in New York on Thursday to
continue her exploration of a Senate run and to meet with potential
donors to her campaign. She returns to Washington late in the
afternoon to accompany the president and the Baraks to Camp David,
Ms. Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's visit provides a valuable opportunity for
Mrs. Clinton to hear his views first hand on American-Israeli
relations and the Middle East peace process. That knowledge, and
the photographs of the two of them together, could prove priceless
as she prospects for votes and campaign cash among Jewish
constituents in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear to political observers in the United States and
Israel that the president and Mrs. Clinton have differing interests
in Barak's visit. The president wants to advance negotiations among
Israel, its neighbors and the Palestinians and burnish his legacy
as a peacemaker. Mrs. Clinton hopes to deepen her knowledge of
Middle Eastern policy issues and curry favor with an important
domestic political constituency, American and Israeli officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands that the president has a job to do and
the first lady is running for office,'' said James Carville, a
political consultant who advises Clinton and who worked on Barak's
campaign in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``What effect will this have on the Senate race in New York? We
can't know yet because we don't know what the issues are going to
be,'' Carville said. ``If it all goes swimmingly smooth, which it
won't, and there is a very popular agreement that makes everyone
feel good, it will certainly have some impact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``the New York Jewish community is anything
but monolithic.''
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat at the Israeli Embassy in Washington said the timing
of Barak's trip to the United States is propitious not only for
Mrs. Clinton, but for Gore, who is to meet privately with the prime
minister on Thursday and host a luncheon for him on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is facing an unexpectedly stiff challenge from former
Senator Bill Bradley in New York, New Jersey and California, home
of thousands of politically active Jewish voters, the diplomat
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visit fits in perfectly with the American political
agenda,'' he said. ``For Hillary, it's great news.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a senior official of an influential American Jewish
organization, Mrs. Clinton's flirtation with the New York Senate
race has already introduced a significant irritant into relations
between Washington and Jerusalem. Her comments about Jerusalem were
made in a letter to the leader of an Orthodox Jewish organization
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obviously something done for domestic political
consumption, but it was not something the Israelis wanted raised,''
said this official, who did not want his name used or his group
identified. ``The problem for Barak is that he doesn't want a media
conflict with Hillary when he's coming to meet the U.S. president
for first time. It's definitely throwing a spanner in the works.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak is spending part of the weekend in New York, where he is
scheduled to meet with leaders of American Jewish organizations.
Visits with retired Gen. Colin Powell and former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger are also penciled into his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   As for New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, another potential
candidate for the New York Senate seat, ``at the moment every
effort is being made to get a meeting with him,'' said an official
of the Israeli consulate in New York. ``It is obviously customary
to meet with the mayor of New York, but the prime minister's
schedule is still not finalized.''

 &HT;    Kosovars live with anger, sense of loss
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Horror. Hatred. Human resilience. Those
are the elements that scream out from the high drama of the war in
Kosovo and its aftermath. In a land dotted with mass graves, life
just has to be taken a little more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At least 1,500 journalists from around the world have tried to
marshal the facts and present them in a way that makes sense to
readers, viewers and listeners back home. But do the stories really
convey the intensity of the times in this place with its tortured
history? The complete picture is complex, not simple; chaotic, not
neat. And even in Kosovo life is a mosaic, where mundane moments
mingle with powerful ones and laughter is mixed with tears.
</P>
<P>
   Here are gleanings from a reporter's notebook. Mere pieces of a
Balkan puzzle, they are nonetheless slices of the experiences that
you, too, might have found if you had traveled among the people of
Kosovo and neighboring countries in recent weeks:
</P>
<P>
   Where the heart is
</P>
<P>
   Broken dreams are as plentiful as broken windows in the looted
homes and stores of Kosovo, and, as you walk past the blocks of
firebombed buildings in the capital, Pristina, you might wonder why
anyone would want to be here.
</P>
<P>
   Arbrsha Berisha, 25, a painter and sculptor who now works for
CARE International, can tell you how frightening and ugly life had
become by the time the NATO bombing campaign began. You can
understand why she fled to Macedonia during the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Berisha was among the first people to return to Kosovo when
the strikes ended. ``You get used to everything,'' she said with a
shrug. ``It's very hard to keep people from not going back to their
home. Even though I had nothing, I would go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Berisha is four months pregnant and she is happy, she said, that
her baby will be born in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Camping out
</P>
<P>
   Search any newspaper's files and you will find the word Albanian
has appeared far more frequently this year than in previous ones.
The most compelling images of recent months are the photos _
reminiscent of the Holocaust _ showing ethnic Albanian refugees
fleeing Kosovo and later peering out from makeshift camps in
Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The camps are largely empty now. But they had personalities of
their own _ just as different cities and towns do. Some were
prisonlike and mean. One that was not was Cegrane.
</P>
<P>
   The largest camp in Macedonia _ once crowded with more than
40,000 souls, from the ancient to the infant, in its hillside tents
_ Cegrane had the air of an amusement park despite the primitive
conditions and the turmoil so many families had endured before
arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees flowed freely back and forth from the camp to the
adjacent village, also populated by ethnic Albanians. On the dusty
ground between camp and town, entrepreneurs created a bazaar. As
music blared, refugee children bashed into each other with glee on
the bumper cars attraction. At booths, vendors sold fast food and
drinks, fresh peaches, T-shirts, short-wave radios and even little
girls' dresses made of camouflage material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' said Astrit Zekir, 33, a Bingo hall operator so
moved by the refugee crisis that he volunteered to work for CARE,
which managed the camp, ``these are the lucky ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the humanitarian workers at Cegrane had previously
worked in Africa. There, refugees were used to living with nothing.
But at Cegrane, the staff said, the biggest demands of refugees
were for hot showers _ and nail files.
</P>
<P>
   Guilt and innocence
</P>
<P>
   Like most Kosovar Albanians, Arbrsha Berisha favored the NATO
bombing. And, like most, she feared the Serb police, who took her
into custody just before she left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a female,'' she said, explaining her terror at that time.
``It was three hours like three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she said, she had a good neighbor who was a Serb and had
lots of Serb friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbs who were not included in the crime, they can stay,''
said Afrim Aziri, 35, an Albanian who worked as an air traffic
controller in Pristina until Serbs purged Albanians from the staff.
``All those people who were included in the crimes, it is better
for them to go away and stay forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Albanians say the same: Serbs whose hands are clean can
stay. The same is true for Gypsies, also known as Roma, though
Albanians accuse many of them of having been Serb collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   But who judges innocence? Who separates the good from the bad?
</P>
<P>
   University student Uran Ismaili, 19, ticks off the list of his
four Serb neighbors from worst to best. ``There were four families;
now, there are none,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will miss only one, a male nurse. ``Really, I am sad of his
leaving. He was a friend to Albanians. He said Kosovo was his
place,'' Ismaili said. ``But the majority of the Serb people didn't
leave room for him to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Borders and basketball
</P>
<P>
   The gripping stories almost every refugee could tell of border
crossings under harrowing circumstances will be a lasting memory of
this conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Nysret Avdiu, 45, a university professor from Pristina, compared
the experience to being suddenly thrown into the plot of a bad Nazi
movie.
</P>
<P>
   But if border crossings were the topic one minute, the next
moment you might find yourself chatting about basketball. Soccer,
the world's best-loved game, is played here, but basketball is king
in the Balkans, where Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia and
Macedonia field some of Europe's strongest national teams.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that recent demonstrations in Serbia against
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic were triggered when a
critique of his policies was illegally telecast during half-time of
a crucial game between Yugoslavia and France. America's NBA has a
large following, too.
</P>
<P>
   Uran Ismaili, who studies economics at the University of
Pristina, is an avid player and fan. He spent the war as a refugee
in Macedonia and returned home to Kosovo only to discover that his
television had been stolen by Serbs. That was disappointing, he
said, because it meant he would miss watching the NBA Finals. In a
normal week during basketball season, Ismaili watches three
abridged games and one full NBA match by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country I would most like to see is the United States,''
he said, ``because of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Likes and dislikes
</P>
<P>
   Basketball's popularity cuts across all the divisions of this
fractured culture, and if any American could have been an effective
mediator in the conflict, it might have been Michael Jordan. Jordan
is an icon of America who is universally respected.
</P>
<P>
   But another allegiance also seems to cut across all divisions:
Coca-Cola is the real thing here. Even when you couldn't find water
in Kosovo, you could find Coke _ despite the contamination scare
that caused it to be pulled from shelves in parts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, Zoran Jovanovski, 35, the night manager of a hotel
that was filled with Italian soldiers during NATO's bombing
campaign, volunteered that Coke ``is the greatest thing the United
States made.''
</P>
<P>
   But, if there is no controversy about Coke, there is a wide
range of opinions about another product from Coke's hometown of
Atlanta: CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're lying all the time, believe me,'' said Jovanovski,
echoing a view widely shared by Serbs and Serb sympathizers. ``I
called `The Larry King Show' once, and they cut me off immediately.
It was something about O.J. Simpson. Many times I have wanted to
call CNN, but it is difficult to get through.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, he has wanted to call the network to complain
that it is too biased in favor of the Albanians of Kosovo.
Jovanovski does not totally approve of Milosevic but said, ``I
approve of a lot of things from his side.''
</P>
<P>
   The people next door
</P>
<P>
   The civil war in Kosovo was not fought among strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My neighbor burned my house,'' said Veton Novosela, 39, from a
village near Mitrovica. ``We never before had such big problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Urosevac, which Albanians prefer to call Ferizaj, Esad
Sabani, 63, spoke of his best neighbor, a Serb: ``We were neighbors
for a hundred years and our fathers were neighbors. But when he was
leaving Kosovo, they found six machine guns in his car.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling spent
</P>
<P>
   Don't leave home without _ your deutsche marks if you are going
to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   You can forget credit cards, of course, and don't count on
finding a bank open. Officially, the currency in the province,
still technically part of Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia, is the Yugoslav dinar. But, in practice, Kosovar
Albanians don't want to be paid with dinars, a symbol of the
country they want to forget. They prefer German currency.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, decisions must be made about what currency a
rebuilding Kosovo will use. But the international community, which
is already pouring funds into the province, is not keen on the idea
of converting cash into the dinars from Milosevic's central bank in
Belgrade, either.
</P>
<P>
   Guns and graffiti
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there are guns, there is trouble, I think,'' said Fatos
Bajinovci, 19, an Albanian premed student whose family was unable
to escape from Kosovo during the NATO bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of peace, guns are still plentiful in Kosovo
even though peacekeeping troops have recovered some of the caches
of weapons in Serb apartments and required the guerrilla Kosovo
Liberation Army to turn over some of its firepower.
</P>
<P>
   But if the war was fought with guns, it was also fought with
spray cans. Graffiti is everywhere, proclaiming ``UCK,'' the
Albanian initials for the KLA, or ``this is Serbia.'' In English,
there are welcomes for NATO and proclamations that America equals
Nazism. And scrawled everywhere are the crosses with two normal Cs
and two backwards ones, a sign that this is Serbian territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even on my own apartment, that is painted,'' said Uran
Ismaili.
</P>
<P>
   What's for dinner
</P>
<P>
   Eating is not something you take for granted as you travel
around Kosovo. One cafe tells customers it has only cake today and
is out of coffee. Another says it has cheese but no meat. Yet
another says it has no food and can serve only wine, bottled water
and fruit juice, though the staff is munching on big sandwiches in
the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Bafti Muslice, 27, a steelworker, said he returned home to his
village near Gjilan after peacekeeping troops entered the area, but
he decided not to stay. ``In the village even the chickens were
killed so we could not eat,'' he said, explaining his return to
Macedonia where he had stayed during the NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the United Nations reported that food shortages could
be an increasing problem. Some stocks have been looted. Wheat
production is expected to be 50 percent lower than normal. The corn
crop will be 10 percent to 20 percent of its usual level. And 40
percent to 50 percent of the livestock has been killed, the U.N.
said.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet night
</P>
<P>
   Normally, on a Friday night in Pristina, the disco run by Armend
Ramadan and Hazbi Hasani would be hopping. But on this Friday
night, the entire block, an entertainment area once popular with
Albanians, was still. Many of the buildings were burned. All of
them were wrecked.
</P>
<P>
   Working with flashlights, Ramadan, Hasani and others struggled
to clear up the mess in the disco. ``The paramilitaries were
staying in the disco, and they turned on all the water when they
left,'' said Ramadan, so angry he was near tears. He pointed to a
soggy army boot. ``They stole everything. Nobody dared to stop
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, in the still quiet of the weekend evening,
gunshots rang out. Emerging from the shadows, a tense line of
British soldiers patrolled through the street.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a scene you would want to see in your neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Pride and prejudice
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to have an extended conversation with the Serbs
left in Kosovo. If you are traveling with an Albanian interpreter
or driver, you are apt to be suspected of spying. And many people
who will talk do not want to tell you their names.
</P>
<P>
   In whispers, one man said he had spent his whole life working in
a hotel but was about to lose his job because Albanians were taking
over. ``Everything I worked for is lost,'' he said. When asked for
his name, he wrote on a piece of paper and slid it over:
``Branko.''
</P>
<P>
   But across the border in Macedonia, Zoran Jovanovski, who
sympathizes with their plight, speaks more freely. Before the
breakup of Yugoslavia, Jovanovski served in the Yugoslav army in an
artillery unit guarding Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Over coffee one night in Skopje, Macedonia's capital, he
confided that Milosevic is the man most responsible for the
splintering of a country that in his view worked well in Tito's
day. Still, Jovanovski wanted his American listener to understand
why he worries that America and Western Europe have sided so fully
with Albanians in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Jovanovski, who has a genuine smile, is honest about his own
prejudices. Albanians, he said, are dirty and smell bad. He would
not want to live near them or to travel on a bus with them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he denied that the Albanians of Kosovo or those of Macedonia
have any legitimate complaints about their rights not being
protected _ provided they will speak the national language, not
Albanian, and assimilate.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, he suggested, should understand his point. Do they
really want Albanians to form another Muslim nation in Europe?
Jovanovski has heard about white flight from inner cities in the
United States. He believes the U.S. tightly controls immigration to
keep out people who are too different from the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many blacks are in the Senate?'' he asked. ``What language
do they speak? What nationality do they declare?''
</P>
<P>
   The questions were loaded, but the American defended his country
as best he could. And when the conversation had ended, one
difference was clear.
</P>
<P>
   The American believed the horrors of Kosovo could never happen
in his own country. Jovanovski was absolutely sure they could
happen anywhere.

SUSPECT PROVIDING LITTLE INFORMATION IN SLAYINGS, SAY POLICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ky.) 
 
By ERIC HANSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ City police said Wednesday that they obtained no
useful information from accused serial killer Angel Maturino
Resendez about the slayings they are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police from Kentucky would not disclose what they
learned, if anything, from the Mexican drifter previously
identified as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Those same investigators, however, said they have strong cases
against the railway-riding suspect who surrendered Tuesday near El
Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Houston homicide Detective Tom Ladd described his talk
with Maturino Resendez, who is now linked to nine homicides in
Illinois, Kentucky and Texas, as ``interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically just mumbled-jumbled,'' Ladd said Wednesday,
``but as far as making any statements that would implicate himself
or put him deeper into one of our cases, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladd added that even though Maturino Resendez did not give them
a confession, police have enough other evidence against him to
present a viable case in court.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the suspect as cold and moody and as someone
who could be articulate if he chose to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let us know that he wasn't stupid or anything like that,
but he didn't make any great endeavor to impress us,'' Ladd said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston police got the first chance to formally interview
Maturino Resendez late Tuesday afternoon after he arrived in a
Department of Public Safety aircraft from El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   As Texas Rangers were driving him to the Harris County Jail,
they were asked to first bring the prisoner by the HPD
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not an unreasonable request, so he was taken to
HPD,'' Texas Rangers Capt. Earl Pearson said Wednesday during a
news conference at DPS' Houston headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   HPD homicide Capt. Richard Holland said Houston investigators
wanted to interview Maturino Resendez as soon as possible and to
obtain samples of his hair, blood and saliva for DNA tests and
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Warrants for the samples already had been prepared by Harris
County prosecutors in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Holland said he expects those results in a week or so. If
results are positive, capital murder charges would probably be
filed.
</P>
<P>
   Houston police have been on Maturino Resendez's trail since Dec.
17, 1998, when Dr. Claudia Benton was found sexually assaulted,
stabbed and beaten to death in her home in West University Place,
an affluent enclave of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Noemi Dominguez, a 26-year-old schoolteacher, was found beaten
to death in June at her home that borders a railroad track in
southeast Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Lexington, Ky., police investigators also interviewed Maturino
Resendez on Tuesday night, but Sgt. Mark Barnard would not reveal
details.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that Kentucky prosecutors and police already have
compiled an impressive array of evidence in their cases of homicide
and rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strong case with DNA evidence, with a living witness
that positively, absolutely can identify (Maturino Resendez) by
voice and picture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said no firm plans have been made yet by Kentucky officials
to prosecute Maturino Resendez after he stands trial in Texas, but
he is hopeful that it does take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope so just to make a point to everyone that you
don't tolerate this in your community. It has to serve as a
statement to all victims in all cases,'' Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky case stems from an attack on Christopher Maier, 21,
and his 20-year-old girlfriend who were assaulted as they walked
along a railroad track.
</P>
<P>
   Maier was beaten to death and the woman was beaten, raped and
left for dead Aug. 27, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Barnard said he talked Wednesday morning with the woman, who is
studying abroad, and that she was elated about the news of his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is doing well, she is very excited and wishes to be back
in the country,'' Barnard said. ``She is a strong-willed individual
and is absolutely ready to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnard said papers placing a hold on Maturino Resendez were
filed so Kentucky officials could proceed with extradition once
Texas has prosecuted him.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky and Texas are death-penalty states.

SENATE DEFEATS KENNEDY PLAN FOR WIDER INSURANCE RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With partisan passions running so hot that a
Republican leader suggested Senator Edward M. Kennedy was on the
verge of a heart attack, the Senate Wednesday approved greater
insurance protections for breast-cancer patients but defeated
Kennedy's bid to extend similar rights to 161 million Americans
with other medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown over patients' rights grew increasingly rancorous
as Republicans repeatedly rebuffed Democratic efforts to establish
strict federal regulations for the health insurance industry. The
four-day struggle is expected to end Thursday with the Republican
majority passing a scaled-down version of the Democratic plan,
inviting a veto by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Senate voted, 53-47, to defeat a Democratic
measure that would have broadened access to specialized medicine
for members of private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the acrimony, GOP senators denounced the Democratic
initiatives as costly power grabs by out-of-touch Washington
politicians, while Kennedy and his allies depicted Republican
senators as anti-consumer apologists for the insurance industry.
Both parties expect fallout from the debate to linger through the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law of the jungle may be good in the jungle,'' Kennedy
shouted on the Senate floor, ``but we don't accept that in the US
Senate when people in the private sector are being exploited by the
insurance industry.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kennedy ended his remarks, the GOP assistant majority leader,
Don Nickles of Oklahoma, said, ``I'm glad my colleague is settling
down...I was afraid he might have a heart attack on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickles said he was ``getting ready to call Doctor Frist,''
referring to Senator Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican and heart
surgeon, the only physician in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy shot back that the GOP alternative to his proposal would
severely limit access to specialized medicine. ``I couldn't see Dr.
Frist under the specialty care protections in the Republican
plan,'' Kennedy said. ``That's my concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickles, in another attempt at humor, suggested Republicans had
speculated about Kennedy suffering a heart attack. ``We've had a
problem,'' Nickles said. ``If mouth-to-mouth was needed, who was
going to volunteer? And it's very difficult, very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's measure, which was defeated, 52-48, was aimed at
granting physicians rather than insurance managers the power to
determine the medically appropriate care for the 161 million
consumers in private health plans. Kennedy said the program was
intended to curb abuses by ``insurance bureaucrats looking after
the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickles and other Republicans cited non-partisan estimates that
Kennedy's measure would cost $5 billion over 10 years for the
federal government to manage. The GOP critics also argued that
regulating health maintenance organizations should be left to state
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the fray, Senator John F. Kerry rose to Kennedy's defense.
``I remain astonished that Republicans who have spent days and
weeks on the floor of the Senate defending the right to bear arms
aren't willing to join a real fight for a patient's right to see a
doctor,'' Kerry said. He asserted the health care system has ``run
amok.''
</P>
<P>
   All 45 Democrats supported the Kennedy measure but only three
Republicans joined them: Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island,
John McCain of Arizona, and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Democrats supported the plan to expand protections
for women with breast cancer, all 45 voted against the measure
because it killed an underlying amendment they supported. That
amendment would have required insurers to cover the costs of
clinical trials for patients with serious illnesses for whom
standard treatments are not effective.
</P>
<P>
   Under the breast-cancer plan, sponsored by Senator Olympia J.
Snowe, a Maine Republican, insurers would be required to provide
inpatient coverage for patients who have undergone mastectomies if
doctors deem overnight stays appropriate. The policy is aimed at
ending so-called ``drive-by mastectomies'' that have proliferated
under insurance guidelines that classify the procedures as day
surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would cover every women in the ranks of the 161 million
consumers covered by private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   However, Democrats accused the Republican sponsors of hypocisy
because the rest of their insurance protections generally apply
only to the 48 million in self-funded health plans that are run by
the employers' companies rather than the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who assailed the Republican plan on Tuesday, dispatched
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala to Capitol Hill
Wednesday to renew the attack. ``There's no room for compromise
between an absolute sham and a real Patients Bill of Rights,''
Shalala told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides considered the issue so potentially explosive that
they went to extraordinary lengths to try to outfox each other
through a series of arcane parliamentary maneuvers. The scenario
often grew so convoluted that senators responsible for guiding the
legislation through the chamber struggled to grasp its status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mess for even members to understand what the process
is,'' said Senator James M. Jeffords, a Vermont Republican who is
shepherding the GOP proposals as chairman of the Labor and Human
Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The process is expected to grow more complex as Chafee, a
moderate with a long history of crafting compromises with
Democrats, attempts to broker a deal acceptable to both parties.
Chafee's spokesman, Nicholas Graham, said as many as 48 or 49
senators support the compromise plan. But as of Wednesday, leaders
of the major competing plans showed little interest in permitting a
vote on Chafee's measure, as the rules would require.

CHEAP NEWBORN AIDS PREVENTATIVE CITED IN REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For just $3.67, the chances that an infected mother will pass
the AIDS virus to her newborn can be cut by at least half,
according to a new study with profound implications for the
developing world, where up to 50 percent of pregnant women in some
regions carry the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists said the low cost puts an effective AIDS prevention
tool within reach of poor countries like Uganda, where the study
was conducted with $2 million in US funds. Previous anti-AIDS drug
regimens for pregnant women cost from 14 to 200 times more.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, researchers said, is the new regimen's
simplicity. In contrast to existing drug treatments that must be
given twice daily for weeks or months, the new therapy involves
giving a single oral dose of an antiviral drug called nevirapine to
women in labor _ the first time in pregnancy that many women in
poor countries see a health professional.
</P>
<P>
   Within three days of birth, her infant gets a single oral dose
of the drug. An added bonus is that the drug doesn't require
refrigeration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have 800,000 or even a million infected kids being
born ever year,'' said Dr. Brooks Jackson of Johns Hopkins
University, who led the Uganda study. ``If this regimen could be
used worldwide, that's up to 500,000 lives saved a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Crispus Kiyonga, Uganda's health minister, said the results
``provide real hope that we may be able to protect many of Africa's
next generation from the ravages of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Sullivan of the University of Massachusetts Medical
School, who first suggested nevirapine's use to prevent
mother-infant transmission in 1992, predicted the regimen will be
``one of the most important breakthroughs since the AIDS virus was
isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first bit of hope for the developing world,''
Sullivan added. ``And that's what we need _ the sense that, God,
maybe we do have the chance to beat this virus.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS Action, a Washington-based advocacy group, called the
low-cost treatment ``the most significant medical breakthrough in
AIDS since the protease drugs,'' a class of pharmaceuticals that
has transformed AIDS in developed nations into a largely treatable
disease since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the majority of Ugandans ``can afford this regimen,
even if they had to pay for it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sullivan and others called on UNAIDS, the United Nations
AIDS agency, as well as the US government and the World Bank to
make large quantities of nevirapine available without cost to the
poorest nations with the highest AIDS rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that all the concern about developing countries not
having the resources to prevent mother-child transmission has to be
reexamined in light of what we now know,'' said Dr. Anthony S.
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Disease, which funded the Uganda study.
</P>
<P>
   One UNAIDS official said Wednesday that the US government has
invested only about $700,000 in a $10 million pilot project to make
a different and more costly drug treatment available to 30,000
pregnant women in Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   That project is using a three-week course of AZT, the standard
AIDS drug for pregnant women _ shorter than the $700 therapy widely
used in the United States and other developed countries, but longer
and more complex than the new regimen.
</P>
<P>
   This ``short course'' AZT treatment has been controversial in
South Africa and other nations, where health officials have
complained that it consumes too many scarce resources.
</P>
<P>
   Nevirapine, a chemical cousin of the tranquilizer Valium, has
the advantage, scientists said, of staying in the bloodstream and
other tissues for days, allowing it to be given as a single dose.
It also has a potent and immediate antiviral effect, attacking AIDS
virus particles floating in the bloodstream as well as those inside
cells. Unfortunately, it cannot be given alone for long periods
without engendering resistance by the virus, erasing the drug's
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Among 310 Ugandan woman and infants who received nevirapine, the
babies' HIV infection rate was 11.9 percent six to eight weeks
after birth, and only about one percentage point higher at 14 to 16
weeks after birth.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the fact that the rate did not rise more sharply
with time is encouraging, since virtually all the women in the
study breast-fed their infants. The stable rate suggests, he said,
that nevirapine protected to some degree against HIV's transmission
through breast milk immediately after birth, when the milk has an
especially high level of AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison group of 308 women was treated during labor with
AZT, followed by a week of twice-daily AZT for the newborns. The
infection rate in these babies was 21.3 percent at six to eight
weeks and 25.1 percent at 14 to 16 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For ethical reasons, the Uganda study did not include a group of
women and infants who received a placebo, or inert pill. But
studies in Uganda and other developing countries have found
infection rates of 17 to 28 percent among babies in such
no-treatment groups.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the 12 percent viral transmission rate in the
nevirapine-treated infants was 30 to 57 percent lower than babies
without the benefit of some anti-AIDS drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These data are very, very encouraging,'' said Dr. Isabelle De
Vincenzi of UNAIDS, who is overseeing the 30,000-woman AZT project.
``It seems as if this new regimen is as effective as one-month
zidovudine and probably will be cheaper. But we need to be a bit
cautious to see the longer-term followup. And we need to look at
situations where women breastfeed for six months or one year.''
</P>
<P>
   Since nevirapine seems to cause few if any toxic effects, and is
so cheap, some scientists hope it could be given routinely to
pregnant women in regions where HIV infection rates are high,
without the prior expense of blood tests to learn which women are
infected and counseling to help infected women deal with the news.
</P>
<P>
   If such a no-testing strategy is deemed ethical, it may further
lower the cost of delivering nevirapine to high-risk women and
infants.

NEW MEANS FOUND FOR REDUCING AIDS PASSED FROM MOTHER TO INFANT

 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an advance that promises to significantly reduce the
incidence of AIDS among children in developing countries, American
and Ugandan scientists have found a simple new way to help prevent
mother-to-child transmission of the AIDS virus that is less costly
and markedly more effective than the standard therapy in the Third
World.
</P>
<P>
   The new and more practical therapy comes from substituting one
marketed drug, nevirapine, for the standard drug, AZT. The total
cost for the two doses of nevirapine was $4, compared to $268 for
the AZT regimen now used in developing countries and $815 for the
much longer and more complicated course used in the United States
and other developed countries, federal health officials said in
releasing the findings Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new treatment calls for both a mother and her infant to take
nevirapine just one time _ a mother takes a pill once during labor,
and then her baby is fed the drug as a syrup once during the first
three days of life.
</P>
<P>
   Nevirapine has been marketed since 1996 in the United States for
treatment of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and it was remarkably
safe in the study that was conducted by American and Ugandan
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   By age three months, nevirapine had reduced the risk of
mother-to-child transmission of HIV to 13 percent from the 25
percent for the standard course of AZT in developing countries, or
a reduction of 47 percent, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring will continue for 18 months to determine whether
adverse effects show up later in infancy. The monitoring will also
help to determine how many babies will still become infected
through breast-feeding in the first months of life, when such
transmission is highest.
</P>
<P>
   The low cost of nevirapine makes it feasible for wide-scale use
in many developing countries, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who heads the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, predicted in
an interview. His federal agency paid for the study.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Piot, who heads the U.N. AIDS program in Geneva, said
the nevirapine study was ``a major gain'' because it ``approaches
ideal prevention therapy'' for developing countries, where 95
percent of the HIV-infected people live.
</P>
<P>
   But Piot said Wednesday that it would be ``unrealistic to
introduce it on a large scale in developing countries without first
using pilot programs'' because drug therapy is only one part of a
complex effort to prevent HIV. Such pilot studies will begin soon,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most women in developing countries do not know that they are
HIV-infected because testing programs are scarce. ``It is still a
logistical, economic and cultural challenge to develop programs to
encourage HIV testing, counseling and formula as a substitute for
breast-feeding for infected mothers,'' Piot said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   American and Ugandan scientists are planning another study to
determine if it would be more effective to give nevirapine to
mother and infant for longer periods.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a study being conducted in the United States and Europe
aims to determine if adding nevirapine to standard regimens would
further lower the transmission rate of HIV from mother to child.
Fauci said there was no need to change the U.S. recommendations
until more studies are completed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. AIDS program estimates that 1,800 HIV-infected babies
are born each day in developing countries, where most women do not
receive prenatal care. In some areas of Africa up to 40 percent of
pregnant women are infected with the virus, and from 25 percent to
35 percent of their infants will be born infected if therapy is not
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Wide-scale use of nevirapine in developing countries ``could
potentially prevent 300,000 to 400,000 newborns each year from
beginning life infected with HIV,'' Fauci said.
</P>
<P>
   AZT and other anti-HIV drugs have drastically reduced
mother-to-child transmission of the infection in the United States
since 1994, when a federally sponsored study showed that AZT taken
for several weeks could stop mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The American regimen calls for a pregnant woman to take AZT five
times a day, beginning as early as the 14th week of pregnancy and
continuing until labor, when an injection of AZT is given. The baby
is given AZT four times a day for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Because the American regimen was impractical and too costly for
Third-World countries, scientists sought a more affordable therapy
for such areas.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers initially intended to enroll 1,500 women in the
study conducted at Mulago Hospital and Makerere University in
Kampala, Uganda, beginning in November 1997. One part of the study
was dropped in February 1998 after another U.S.-funded study
conducted in Thailand found that AZT used for a shorter period than
in the U.S. was effective in preventing mother-to-child
transmission of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandan study then involved 618 women in their ninth month
of pregnancy who had not taken anti-HIV drugs, along with their 631
infants. Of the 618 women, 308 took AZT and 310 took nevirapine.
</P>
<P>
   The women agreed to accept by random selection either of two
drug regimens. One regimen was single-dose nevirapine therapy for
mother and infant. The other regimen involved taking two AZT pills
at the onset of labor and then one pill every three hours until
delivery. Infants born to mothers who took AZT were given AZT twice
a day during the first week of life.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, 59 infants born to mothers who took AZT and 35
infants born to mothers who took nevirapine were infected.
Statistical tests projected the 25 percent and 13 percent infection
rates, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The three deaths that occurred among mothers who took AZT were
due to AIDS and not the drug, the researchers said. No deaths
occurred among the mothers who took nevirapine.
</P>
<P>
   Infection was the most common cause of adverse events and death
among the infants whose mothers took the two drugs. The adverse
effects and deaths were not deemed drug related.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists learned the findings on Monday at a meeting of a
committee that oversees the safety and effectiveness of such
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Dr. Crispus Kiyonga, the Ugandan health minister,
said Wednesday that the new findings promised ``to protect many of
Africa's next generation from the ravages of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted with support from researchers from the
University of Washington and Johns Hopkins University.
Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals makes nevirapine.

CRITICS CALL CRASH CHARGES A DUBIOUS BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (jw) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Miami-Dade County state attorney says she is
pursuing third-degree murder and manslaughter charges against
Sabretech, a defunct aircraft maintenance company, because its
workers' actions directly resulted in the death of all 110 people
aboard Valujet Flight 592 when it crashed three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no Sabretech workers are being charged with murder or
manslaughter, and the company itself has ceased operations and sold
its assets. No individuals will face jail time, according to the
indictment. And the company cannot be put out of business, because
it already is out of business.
</P>
<P>
   So, some lawyers and legal experts in South Florida wonder, why
prosecute a crime when there seems to be no one to punish?
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Fernandez Rundle, the Miami-Dade County state
attorney, said the point of the charges _ the first criminal
charges brought in the United States in an airline accident _ was
to hold someone criminally accountable for what happened to the
people on that flight, which crashed after takeoff from the Miami
airport on May 11, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Federal safety investigators have determined that workers for
Sabretech improperly packed and labeled used airplane parts, called
oxygen generators, and delivered them to the flight. The generators
sparked a fire in the cargo hold, causing the jet to crash into the
Everglades, investigators for the Federal Aviation Administration
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some responsibility to the victims,'' said Ms.
Fernandez Rundle, explaining why her office was pursuing charges.
``It holds the person who committed the crime accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   But, some lawyers here argue, it really does not hold anyone
accountable, because no individual is threatened with jail time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations don't go to jail,'' said Steve Roof, an adjunct
professor of law at the University of Miami, who specializes in
aviation law.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fernandez Rundle countered: ``The message is also very
important. Any person that violates the law will be held
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that the state handed down its 110-count
indictment for third-degree murder and another 110-count indictment
for manslaughter, federal prosecutors announced a 24-count
indictment against Sabretech and three former employees for
improper handling of hazardous materials. The federal indictment
named Eugene Florence, 37, and Mauro Valenzuela, 30, who were both
employed by subcontractors to Sabretech, and Daniel Gonzalez, who
was then Sabretech's vice president for operations.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on the federal charges, the three men could be
sentenced to a maximum of five years in jail and fined $250,000
each, and the company, which was also charged with improper
handling of materials, could be fined as much as $6 million. The
company also faces a possible, though unspecified fine, on the
state charges. Since it is defunct, any payment would seem
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison with the federal charges, which carry jail time
and fines, the much more ominous-sounding state charges seem to be
less threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Shannon, assistant dean of law at the University of
Florida's Levin College of Law, said the charges seemed to confuse
negligence and criminal intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any criminal charge, there has to be intent, and at the
current time, there isn't any criminal intent,'' said Shannon. ``If
there was proof, if they actually knew that transporting these
canisters was harmful and the canisters would eventually lead to a
fire in the cargo hold, that would be a different issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon and other lawyers here said the charges seemed to be
politically motivated. ``They're in it all for show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Raskin, the former chief of the criminal division of the
U.S. attorney's office in Miami, who is now representing Sabretech
in its criminal case, said the charges would hamper future
investigations of airline disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe any employee would, in his right mind,
voluntarily cooperate with the FAA if he thinks statements will be
used against him'' in criminal courts, Raskin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this was an accident,'' he said of the Valujet
crash.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time that the state attorney's office here
has tried to hold a corporation responsible for a death. The office
filed a murder charge this year against Eller Media Co., which
builds bus shelters, after a 12-year-old boy was electrocuted in a
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   In the Valujet case, employees for Sabretech mishandled and
mislabeled the volatile canisters and failed to fit them with
plastic safety caps, safety investigators found.
</P>
<P>
   The murder charges are warranted, said Ms. Fernandez Rundle,
because ``the acts and omissions in this case are very egregious.
There were deliberate acts that were also committed,'' she said,
including ``falsification of certificates and documents'' as part
of a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Roof, the Miami law professor and a practicing lawyer here,
called the case ``a creative extension of existing law.'' But, he
added, ``I think the prosecutors have a valid charge. They have a
right to charge Sabretech with murder because they believe there
was a reckless intent or reckless disregard for the safety and
well-being of others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is dangerous to criminalize this type of
behavior,'' he said. ``If it is used judiciously, it is not a bad
thing. But this kind of charge will only work if they use it
sparingly. I don't think it would be a good idea to start this kind
of trend.''

REVAMPED CARNOUSTIE WOULD DO HOGAN PROUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Ben Hogan would like the Carnoustie of
1999. His criticisms of 46 years ago about the condition of the
course and lodging have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Carnoustie's Championship Course today has U.S.-style
conditioning, with lush fairways and smooth, fast greens. A modern
sprinkler system and a professional greenskeeper make a course that
a member of Colonial Country Club or Shady Oaks Country Club in
Fort Worth could be proud to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, it is possible now to get a room in Carnoustie with
a private bath.
</P>
<P>
   A modern 85-room hotel opened behind the 18th green just two
months ago, easing Carnoustie's housing dilemma. For the
sentimentalist, the older and smaller Hogan House Hotel across
Links Parade from the 18th green stands as a tribute to the 1953
champion. The Bruce Hotel, spurned by Hogan in 1953, was closed in
1982 and now is divided into condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   After playing host to Opens again in 1968 and 1975, the poor
condition of the course and lack of housing in Carnoustie _ the
same complaints Hogan voiced in 1953 _ caused the venerable layout
to be taken from what the British call the ``rota'' of courses
where their championship is contested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absence was felt keenly,'' said Peter Alliss, the
ninth-place finisher in 1953 who will attend this year's Open as a
broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   Things turned around for Carnoustie beginning in 1985, when the
management of the course was relinquished by the Angus Council and
given to a new Links Trust, similar to one that runs St. Andrews.
The Links Trust hired Carnoustie's first professional greenskeeper
and installed its first sprinkler system. Carnoustie had abandoned
all-natural golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of time and money went into the improvement,'' said Bob
Blyth, a longtime member who plays daily on the Championship Course
to a single-digit handicap.
</P>
<P>
   The Championship Course is still Scotland's toughest.
</P>
<P>
   The bunkers still lie in wait across the sixth fairway and the
yardage book notes ``Hogan's Alley'' to their left. The 16th hole,
where Hogan pronounced the 1953 tournament over, is still the
longest par-3 in Scotland. Barry Burn, the creek that wanders
throughout the course, still traps errant balls. The Spectacles
bunkers stare back at golfers as they move up the 14th fairway.
</P>
<P>
   The twin silos of the grain malting plant that Hogan saw as he
made his way around Carnoustie in 1953 stand guard on the edge of
the course. The railroad tracks behind the ninth green, and the
trains whose whistles Hogan could hear still run from London, just
as in 1953 when the cars were jammed with fans eager to see the
famous American.
</P>
<P>
   A few things have changed. A new bunker 40 yards past Hogan's
Alley has been dug on the sixth hole to catch the longer-distance
drives of today's players. It has been called ``Tiger's Bunker'' in
honor of Tiger Woods, who will succeed Hogan this week as the
most-watched American in the Open.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953 Hogan walked an 18th fairway that was crowded with
spectators who mingled with competitors. This week the crowds will
be packed into bleachers bordering the fairway. Galleries are
expected to exceed 175,000 for the tournament, a more than fourfold
increase from the record gate of 1953.
</P>
<P>
   The few minutes of live radio that John Derr used to flash the
word of Hogan's victory to the United States will be replaced this
year by 18-hole coverage, from the first hole today to the last on
Sunday via satellite to more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan never returned to Scotland after his 1953 triumph. Arnold
Palmer in the 1960s completed the work Hogan started in restoring
the British Open as a major title for Americans. Jet air travel and
satellite television transmissions, plus more liberal qualifying
exemptions, made the British tournament as accessible as most
American events.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal and Ancient embraced big-time marketing for their
Open, switching the final rounds to weekends for greater television
ratings and put up the huge grandstands to accommodate what are now
the biggest crowds in Great Britain, aside from Royal weddings and
funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did other pros follow Palmer to the British Open, but
American weekend golf pilgrims created a tourist industry that
joined the distilleries and woolen mills as one of Scotland's major
economic legs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Scots haven't forgotten Ben Hogan. Carnoustie notes
proudly the immortals who have won the five British Opens played on
its course: Tommy Armour in 1931, the great British star Henry
Cotton in 1937, Hogan in 1953, Gary Player in 1968 and Tom Watson
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legendary players,'' Blyth said of the Carnoustie roll of
champions. ``But Ben Hogan stands above them all.''

TEXAS RANGERS HAVE EVOLVED FROM WILD-AND-WOOLY BEGINNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like others in the 176-year-old elite force, Sgt. Andrew Carter
Jr. wears a Texas Ranger badge fashioned from a Mexican five-peso
coin, and no uniform other than a starched western shirt, boots and
a straw cowboy hat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, his 32nd birthday, Carter brought in one of the
FBI's 10 Most Wanted. And if national news media coverage is any
indication, he added something to the lore of the Rangers with his
apprehension of Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, who is charged with four
murders and suspected in five others.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the times, the rookie Ranger cracked the case with a
cell phone, not a six-gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over, and the guy came in peacefully, so you've got to
hand it to the Ranger for resolving it after the suspect got past
the Border Patrol to kill four more people,'' said historian
Mitchel Roth of Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas,
referring to the detention and release of the suspect last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was a rather anticlimactic ending,'' said Roth, who
specializes in the American West and has written a history of the
Texas Department of Public Safety, to which the 107 Texas Rangers
belong. ``He didn't catch the guy; his family turned him in. In the
past, it would have ended in a wild pursuit along railroad tracks
on horseback, and smoking guns.''
</P>
<P>
   To Roth, the capture of Resendez-Ramirez exemplifies modern
police work rather than Ranger tradition. Others beg to differ,
saying Carter only updated the Rangers' Texas frontier doggedness.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI concentrated on Resendez-Ramirez's wife during the
investigation. Carter nurtured rapport with the suspect's sister in
New Mexico, who was concerned that her brother might be harmed if
he surrendered or if bounty hunters grabbed him for the $125,000
reward, said Mike Cox, spokesman for the Department of Public
Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Carter added news media heat to the pursuit by appearing for
three straight weeks on the Fox TV show, ``America's Most Wanted.''
After the capture, a report on the ``NBC Nightly News with Tom
Brokaw'' contrasted Carter with past Rangers, to whom it mattered
little if the suspect was brought in lifeless and slung over a
saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who wanted to be a Ranger since age 5, was born in
Luling but grew up in the Houston area and earned a bachelor's
degree in business from LeTourneau University in Longview, Texas.
In 11 years with the DPS, he has earned 14 commendations, including
one based on a favorable comment from a ``violator,'' a DPS
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-based Ranger, who was admitted to the force in
September, was fishing when he got a call on his cellular phone
saying that Resendez-Ramirez was willing to surrender _ but only to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's something of a reversal of the image of the old
Ranger, who would shoot first and ask questions later,'' said Cox,
who wrote the two-volume ``Texas Ranger Tales,'' and is working on
a Rangers history. ``These days, it's `Ask questions and talk' _
and shoot only when you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Texas leader Stephen F. Austin launched the legend in 1823
when he hired 10 ``rangers'' to mount punitive raids against
hostile Indians, according to Ben Proctor, a historian at Texas
Christian University in Fort Worth and author of ``Just One Riot:
Episodes of the Texas Rangers in the 20th Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the ragtag frontier force _ who received $1.25 a day
but had to supply their own horses, guns and food _ played a minor
role in the Texas Revolution. But they built a national reputation
for their fighting ability alongside regular U.S. Army troops
during the Mexican War, earning the sobriquet, ``Los Diablos
Tejanos.''
</P>
<P>
   Revived nine years after the Civil War, the Rangers put down
banditry along the Rio Grande and elsewhere. In Brownsville, they
instilled fear by stacking 12 dead rustlers ``like cordwood'' in
the town square, Proctor wrote in an article for ``The Handbook of
Texas.'' Rangers fought 15 Indian battles in 1874 and, with the
U.S. Cavalry, removed the Comanches as a threat to settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``one riot, one Ranger'' legend is traced to 1909
disturbance involving black soldiers in Brownsville. One Ranger, a
larger-than-life character named Bill McDonald, dispatched himself
to quell the situation. (In fact, McDonald made the explosive
situation worse and retired from the force soon afterward, Proctor
wrote.)
</P>
<P>
   Only reluctantly did the Rangers shed 19th century methods.
Their history is marred by a brutal 1914-1919 campaign against
border raids that, getting out of hand, led to the slaughter of
approximately 5,000 Hispanics, Proctor wrote. The excesses prompted
hearings in Austin and a major shake-up of the force.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Rangers became deeply politicized, aligning themselves
with gubernatorial candidates. In 1932, they backed the wrong one.
Miriam A. ``Ma'' Ferguson won the gubernatorial race and purged the
lot, Cox said. In their place, the state's first woman governor
appointed her barber and insurance agent to a scaled-back force.
</P>
<P>
   The agency still had no central communications, crime lab unit
or even someone who could dust for fingerprints in 1935, when
Chicago consultants recommended merging the Rangers with the
Highway Patrol, then under the Highway Department, to create the
modern Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers became an elite force, producing larger-than-life
figures such as Clint Peoples, Joaquin Jackson and Manuel ``Lone
Wolf'' Gonzaullas, charismatic men who knew their jobs but were
less afraid of notoriety than many of their colleagues, said
Christina Stopka, archivist at the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame &AMP;
Museum in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Stopka, for one, sees Carter's ``talking in'' of the man
suspected in nine slayings in three states as consistent with
Ranger lore often overlooked by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   She cited the 1877 capture of John Wesley Hardin by Texas Ranger
John Armstrong, who trailed the infamous outlaw to Florida and
captured him on a train without resorting to force. Then there were
wild oil boom towns tamed by solitary Rangers who succeeded, Stopka
said, ``through sheer force of personality and dogged
determination.''

 &UR; Strom Thurmond  &LR; since 1991, and her parents, who were moving into
an assisted-living facility. Ninety-six-year-old Thurmond, R-S.C.,
is the oldest senator in U.S. history. His estranged wife, who was
Miss South Carolina in 1966 and married shortly thereafter, was
selling such memorabilia as a painting of Strom dressed as a clown.
</P>

   Among the bargains were an autographed picture of the senator

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to
the vacationing teacher with a 401(k) has been wondering lately how
long the good times can last before inflation returns.
</P>
<P>
   A while longer, it appears. According to data released Wednesday
by the government, American consumers may have moderated their
spending but are still on a buying spree. And prices, at least on
the wholesale level, are still going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Sales by stores, gas stations, car dealerships, restaurants and
mail-order outlets _ which account for roughly 40 percent of what
American consumers spend _ were up one-tenth of 1 percent last
month. The gain came on top of increases in the previous two months
that turned out to be even bigger than initially reported.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales other than cars and light trucks, which dipped
after an enormous bulge in May, were up nearly half a percent,
about as much as the month before.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, producer prices for finished goods fell
one-tenth of a percent, the Labor Department reported. And to the
surprise of most forecasters, who had been expecting a small
increase in the ``core'' inflation rate, which excludes volatile
food and energy prices, the index fell instead by two-tenths of a
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got is so much spending, so little inflation,''
said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investor Service.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the good news on inflation, the bond market fell
slightly Wednesday, apparently on worries that increases in
commodity prices at earlier stages in the production pipeline may
eventually lead to higher prices for finished goods. But there are
several reasons to discount those fears, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   One month's numbers are never more than a tiny, and often
unreliable, clue to the big picture. But the contrast between sales
and prices is enough to produce profound cognitive dissonance.
</P>
<P>
   Last quarter, sales at auto dealerships were up more than 8
percent from a year ago, but wholesale prices for passenger cars
fell 1.3 percent last month. The nation's roads are jammed with
sport utility vehicles, vans, pickups and other gas guzzlers, but
gasoline prices dropped three-tenths of a percent. Appliance sales
have been soaring in a hot housing market, but wholesale prices for
dishwashers, dryers and the like were down six-tenths of a percent.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? Even though demand for everything from cellular
phones to fall clothes is growing rapidly, so, apparently, is
supply. And that means that many companies are not in position to
take advantage of the situation by raising prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nearly unmatched vigor of consumer spending hasn't done
much for the pricing power of American companies,'' Lonski said.
``There's more than enough supply to meet the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is lingering weakness abroad producing a gusher of
inexpensive imports, but the United States is awash in retail
outlets, and more megastores and megamalls are being built to add
to the already Darwinian competition among retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The final verdict on inflation is never in, of course. The most
important measure of inflation in June _ the consumer price index,
which covers services like health care, utilities, rent and
education as well as items that people buy in stores _ is not due
out until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the few disquieting notes in the wholesale price
report spotted by the bond market bear watching. In particular,
prices for raw materials _ which include crude oil, ore and scrap,
grain and the like _ were up, reflecting the world economy's
becoming a bit firmer. And prices for intermediate goods like
metals, plastics and chemicals jumped nearly half a percent in
June. Indeed, after falling for 10 consecutive months through
February, raw materials prices have been rising for the last four
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a clear inflection point,'' said William Dudley, chief
economist at Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, raw and even intermediate goods are only the beginning of
a long chain that stretches from mines, farms and oil fields all
the way to gas pumps and grocery stores. The critical question is
whether companies at the end closest to the consumer can pass along
higher input prices, or whether they will have to absorb them by
holding the line elsewhere or taking lower profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That depends on what happens to other costs,'' said Richard
Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities. And so far they
have been restrained. Pay increases, Rippe points out, have
actually been a bit less generous in recent months. Productivity
gains, meanwhile, have been strong. As a result, unit labor costs
have been rising at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in
nonfinancial corporations. At the same time, costs related to
capital _ interest, depreciation and indirect business taxes _ have
been falling.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, consumers show few signs of flagging. Consumer
spending has slowed since last winter, when it was growing at an
annual rate of nearly 7 percent, but it has not slowed very much,
only to about 4 percent. By any historical yardstick, that is still
pretty rich.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are confident enough to spend plenty of time at the
malls because jobs are plentiful. And with a record fraction of the
population working, total wage and salary income rose to more than
$4 trillion in 1998. Even more remarkable, household net worth grew
more than $3 trillion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The gains have kept coming. The latest reading for after-tax
personal income shows that it is almost 4 percent higher than a
year ago. And that is above and beyond inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In short, not much is happening to discourage Americans from
their favorite recreation. That is sure to keep Greenspan and
everyone else scanning the inflation numbers anxiously for hints
that things are not really as good as they look today.

KUBRICK'S MOTIVES LEFT OPEN TO INTERPRETATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Since his death in March, it's been hard to look
anywhere without seeing something about Stanley Kubrick. Words like
brilliant, genius, legendary are the usual adjectives bandied about
to describe the filmmaker, whose final film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' is
being released Friday. Two of his movies are among the American
Film Institute's top 100 films of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the spate of magazine, newspaper and television
articles, a selected number of Kubrick films are being released on
DVD and re-released on video. Like everything else about the
super-secretive Kubrick, we don't get the whole picture. Of
Kubrick's 13 films, including ``Eyes,'' in his 46-year career as a
feature director, only nine were blessed by the filmmaker. The
three he omitted were his first two _ ``Fear and Desire'' (1953)
and ``Killer's Kiss'' (1955) _ and, most glaring, ``Spartacus''
(1960), the film that turned him away from Hollywood. Kubrick's
run-ins with studio executives and with the film's star, Kirk
Douglas, sent him scurrying to England, where he set up shop for
the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spartacus'' has been out on video, and MGM, in a move that
would have confirmed Kubrick's suspicions about studios, went ahead
and released ``Killer's Kiss'' on DVD. They just weren't considered
by the filmmaker part of his legacy. The films he included were:
``Paths of Glory'' (1957), ``Lolita'' (1962), ``Dr. Strangelove or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'' (1964), ``2001:
A Space Odyssey'' (1968), ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), ``Barry
Lyndon'' (1975), ``The Shining'' (1980) and ``Full Metal Jacket''
(1987).
</P>
<P>
   Another stamp Kubrick put on the DVDs is that, unlike most discs
that included lots of extras, all you get for the most part is the
movie. The notable exception is ``The Shining,'' which includes a
``making of'' featurette by Kubrick's daughter, Vivian. It was said
that Kubrick was unhappy about it, but familial pull proved too
strong.
</P>
<P>
   The featurette gives us little more than a glimpse of the
director at work. Kubrick seems to make himself scarce. The only
two times you really see Kubrick in action are during a scene in
which Shelley Duvall misses her cue to run out of the house and
into the snow. The clearly angered director then dresses her down.
Earlier, when Duvall, who seems to be on an emotional roller
coaster, is complaining about something, Kubrick tells an aide,
``Don't sympathize with Shelley. It doesn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   The other is when we see Kubrick on the floor, setting up the
shot. It's the scene in which Jack Nicholson (as Jack Torrance)
tries to get Duvall (his wife) to release him from the storage
room. Intercut is footage from the film so you see what Kubrick was
going for.
</P>
<P>
   What we learn about Kubrick comes more from around the edges. He
is seen typing on a bright yellow typewriter _ presumably rewrites
of the script _ while Nicholson and Duvall learn their lines.
Later, Nicholson says he doesn't bother to memorize his lines until
after he gets them in the morning, implying there are numerous and
extensive rewrites.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to another Kubrick-related release that is raising
some eyebrows. ``Eyes Wide Open: A Memoir of Stanley Kubrick''
(Ballantine; $12). Written by ``Eyes'' screenwriter Frederic
Raphael, the book recounts the nearly two years he and Kubrick
spent creating the script for the Tom Cruise-Nicole Kidman film.
What emerges is a rather strange portrait. Though it's clear that
Raphael has enormous respect for Kubrick, it's also clear the
writer had his misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   Who would get credit for the screening was a sticking point of
Raphael's contract. Originally, Kubrick wanted control over who got
credit. They agreed to leave it up to the Screenwriters Guild.
Kubrick ended up getting co-writing credit.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael describes their encounters early on as a sort of series
of chess matches, with Kubrick always having the white pieces. Many
of their conversations read that way, but that may be merely the
Raphael method of describing them. There is no indication that the
screenwriter/novelist recorded them, so we can't assume they're
verbatim. But given Kubrick's predilection for privacy and
caginess, there is the ring of truth there. Their sparring is both
alternately fascinating and annoying to read. One trait the two men
had in common: Both are a bit overbearing in how smart they think
they are _ perhaps not insufferable but enough to make them, let's
say, less than lovable. All right, geniuses don't have to be
lovable, but everything they think or say isn't profound.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael writes all their conversations in screenplay format as
if they were characters in a movie. In one scene, he writes this
aside: ``F.R. senses that STANLEY is a man trappped in his own web.
He is Odysseus, longing for a wider experience but unable to shake
off his own timidities and obliged to ask others about what he
wishes he knew, or had happened to him. He is the sedentary
wandering Jew, rootlessly rooted within his own defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it an interesting observation of contradictory images or a
way of putting him in his place? How much do we learn about Kubrick
from it? How much about Raphael? It is, again, not the whole
picture.
</P>
<P>
   This book has caused some flap because of Kubrick's insistence
that Raphael excise the Jewish themes in the source material in the
screenplay. ``Eyes'' is based on Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella
``Traumnovelle'' (translated as ``Dream Novel''), which is set in
the turn-of-the-century Vienna of Sigmund Freud. Kubrick insisted
that the story be translated to modern-day New York City and that
the characters be gentiles, although Raphael thought the city was a
perfect place to update Schnitzler's Jewish characters. Some have
seen this as Kubrick _ who was Jewish _ being anti-Semitic. Raphael
explains it by saying the filmmaker ``wanted to escape into myth
and inhabit an alien character who, nevertheless, would be close to
him.'' Meanwhile, throughout the book, he seems fascinated by
Kubrick's Jewishness (or denial of same).
</P>
<P>
   But the decision by Kubrick is in keeping with his films. He has
consistently stripped the ethnicity from his characters. He is
striving for something else. What that is isn't always clear. In
the featurette on ``The Shining,'' Nicholson talks about how actors
strive for years trying to get something real in their acting, and
then there is ``someone like Stanley who says, `Yeah, it's real but
it's not interesting.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnicity _ as it inevitably does _ would only shrink his world.
Kubrick created on a big canvas. His pictures, which happened to
move, were on a grand scale, filled with fascinating abstract
parts. Which is why you can watch his films over and over the same
way you can revisit a great work of art at a museum.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't necessarily make everything Kubrick did great, but
it does make him always interesting _ and that is quite an
accomplishment. At one point while talking to Raphael, the
filmmaker brings up ``2010,'' a poor sequel to his own film. ``Know
what they did?'' he asked. ``They explained everything. They told
you what everything meant. Killed it. You tell people what things
mean, they don't mean anything anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick clearly intended his movies to speak for themselves. I
first saw ``A Clockwork Orange'' at a New Year's Eve screening in
1971 and was fascinated by the audience as much as by the film.
``Clockwork's'' protagonist, Alex (Malcolm McDowell), is the leader
of a futuristic gang. He is without a conscience, a sadist who
revels in stealing, stomping, raping and destruction until he kills
a woman and is sent to prison. There, he is brutally conditioned to
become morally responsible. That leaves him powerless, and his old
enemies take advantage of him. When Alex's violent nature is
restored to him at the end, the audience cheered. They seemed to
enjoy the beatings he administered. The victims were anonymous.
There seemed to be little regard for them as people. Better to be a
reprehensible hoodlum (and human?) than society's pawn, seemed to
be the moral of the film. I'm sure Kubrick saw ``A Clockwork
Orange'' as something more than that. It is more than that. But
what did audiences take away from his films?
</P>
<P>
   I think that lack of commitment was Kubrick's weakness. He may
not have wanted to explain himself, and undoubtedly wanted people
to argue over his films, but he was not writing a novel only a
handful of people would read or painting a picture to hang in a
small gallery.
</P>
<P>
   He worked in a powerful medium, creating larger-than-life images
that are often seen in communal conditions. To me, the greatest
filmmakers have a more humanistic touch without sacrificing their
artistic vision.
</P>
<P>
   There is a bit of irony _ and Kubrick seemed to love irony _
that there is a cry for Hollywood to be more responsible. I doubt
that anyone in the audience that night rushed out of the theater
and went on a violent rampage, but it does beg an age-old question
of artistic responsibility. He was no Bertolt Brecht, who was
committed to changing society, but Kubrick did give us amazing
visions to ponder. He was a major player, but how great will be
debated for a long time. We may never get the whole picture of this
extraordinary filmmaker. &QL;

ISRAELI PARLIAMENT SPARKS CONTROVERSY BY INCLUDING ARAB ON DEFENSE
PANEL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel's new Parliament sparked heated controversy
Wednesday by voting to confirm, for the first time in the nation's
history, an Arab to the committee that oversees the country's
defense establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Hashem Mahmeed, a member of the Knesset from
an Arab village near Tel Aviv, to the foreign affairs and defense
committee set off protests from right-wing members of Parliament.
They charged that Israel's security would be jeopardized by putting
an Arab on a committee that deals with top-secret intelligence and
security matters.
</P>
<P>
   After the Knesset voted 53-1 to approve the appointment of
Mahmeed, 54, and all other members of the body's committees, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak left for a five-day visit to the United States.
Barak, in meetings with President Clinton, other administration and
congressional officials, and American Jewish leaders, is expected
to define his vision of Middle East peace-making.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Likud party, headed by security hawk Ariel
Sharon, as well as three of four members of a small
ultra-nationalist party called Ichud Leumi, or National Union,
boycotted the vote. Only Michael Kleiner of National Union stayed
to vote against the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Arens, a Likud member and former defense minister,
asserted that Mahmeed's participation would ultimately reduce the
oversight function of the committee. Arens said that military
officers would hesitate to disclose sensitive information to a
committee of lawmakers that includes an Arab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would spell the end of any reporting by the defense
establishment to the committee and that means the end of
parliamentary control and oversight of the defense establishment,''
said Arens. ``And that's a very serious development.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Mahmeed's critics say they based their objections to his
appointment on his political views, which have included statements
that empathize with the Palestinian struggle for independence,
rather than on his ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Arens, for instance, questioned Mahmeed's commitment to Israel's
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Mahmeed) does not identify himself with concern for Israel's
defense, for Israel's security,'' Arens said. ``He's made numerous
statements indicating his hostility to the defense establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the controversy highlights an uncomfortable set of questions
that have been simmering in Israel for some time: What role should
Israel's Arabs, who make up nearly 20 percent of the population,
have as citizens of the state? Should they be included as equals in
all realms of society, including those that touch on the country's
security? And can the state be truly democratic if it deprives a
large segment of its population _ one in five Israelis is an Arab _
of rights the majority enjoys?
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, one of the most liberal members
of Barak's Labor Party, hailed Mahmeed's appointment as a positive
step toward full integration of Arabs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Haim Ramon, another left-wing Labor member, labeled ``racist``
allegations that Mahmeed's appointment amounted to a political
payoff to Barak's Arab voters at the expense of Israel's security,
an allegation made by several Likud members.
</P>
<P>
   Barak won the vote of about 90 percent of Israel's Arabs in his
May election victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon said in a radio interview that all parties with at least
five Knesset members received a slot on the foreign affairs and
defense committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want us to exclude the (United Arab List) only because
they are Arabs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Initial security concerns were laid to rest when the head of
Israel's internal security service, Ami Ayalon, said he had no
objection to an Arab serving on the committee. At the time, Likud
member Uzi Landau called Ayalon's decision ``miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Landau charged that Barak was purposely sabotaging
the effectiveness of the Knesset to oversee defense issues because
he wanted to control those complicated issues himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see an attempt to make the foreign affairs and defense
committee basically incompetent,'' said Landau. ``Perhaps Mr. Barak
doesn't want to be under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Barak's One Israel coalition, which is dominated by
the Labor Party, said Ayalon's ruling had convinced them that no
serious security objections stood in the way of naming an Arab to
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have managed to break a historic barrier, which was the
result, among other things, of years of counterfeit preoccupation
with security,'' said Ofer Pines, a member of the special panel who
pushed for the inclusion of an Arab.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Mahmeed, who has served in Israel's Knesset since
1990 from Umm Al-Fahm, a village north of Tel Aviv, said he
believes that the swirl of controversy surrounding him has racial
undertones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think I cannot keep secrets and that I'm dangerous, I'm a
risk for the state of Israel, all kinds of racist sayings,''
Mahmeed said. ``I'm suspect in their eyes all the time, a potential
risk, however I behave. It's very racist.''
</P>
<P>
   He is blunt in his support for a Palestinian state, but adds
that he believes that it is the best path for Israel, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for Palestinian independence, for their freedom and
liberation and I'm against occupation anywhere in the world,
including Israeli occupation,'' he said. ``This is the way to get
out of the cycle of bloodshed _ to bring peace between Israel and
the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for concern that Mahmeed may be privy to sensitive
security data, he said he would voluntarily exclude himself if he
thought a certain session would include information he didn't want
to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see that my conscience does not allow it, I won't
participate,'' he said. ``But I was elected to represent my voters
and that's what I intend to do.''

   TEHRAN, Iran _ After six days of nationwide pro-democracy
protests that deteriorated into violent rioting, massive crowds
staged counter-demonstrations Wednesday in at least two dozen
cities and towns throughout the country, heeding the official call
to praise the Islamic Republic and condemn its enemies,
particularly the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Calm returned to the capital city of Tehran as residents obeyed
official warnings that the government would use all necessary means
to restore order. There were no signs of pro-democracy
demonstrators or baton-wielding vigilantes, no smell of tear gas or
bonfire smoke, no sound of gunfire or ambulance sirens.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face underscored both the fluid nature of Iranian
politics and the ability of Iran's ruling clerics to restore order
by proclaiming a national crisis.
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami made no public appearances Wednesday,
and the students who were angry over delays in his program of
democratic reforms boycotted the day's marches.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the streets belonged to the backers of Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the country's conservative ``supreme leader.'' Chants of
``Death to America'' replaced ``Death to dictators'' over
loudspeakers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, normalcy did not return. Tehran's vast bazaar, the heart
of the capital's commercial center with its thousands of shops and
miles of passages, was closed for a second day so that employees
could march, as were hundreds of shops on many of the main
thoroughfares.
</P>
<P>
   The government blocked all mobile telephone communication in
Tehran in an effort to prevent speedy conversations among students,
journalists and would-be saboteurs, officials said. Even the
country's highest-ranking officials were left without their mobile
phones, as ubiquitous among the clerical ruling class as prayer
beads. An official in the president's office said that the system
would not be operational for two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest erupted last Thursday, after students protested the
passage of tough press laws and the closure of a popular
left-leaning newspaper. The protesters repeatedly praised Khatami
and called for faster progress toward the cultural and democratic
freedoms he has promised, but they did not suggest changing the
Islamic foundation of government.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the regime's determination to staunch the worst
unrest since Iran's 1979 revolution, Khamenei gave a green light to
paramilitary Islamic volunteers, known as the baseeji, to terrorize
and crush the country's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Baseej children must reserve the necessary readiness and be
present at any scene where they are needed to intimidate and crush
the base enemies,'' Khamenei said in a message to the nation that
was read out at rallies across the country. ``It has been two days
now that a group of bandits, aided by certain bankrupt political
grouplets, and with the support and encouragement of foreign
enemies, have engaged in destroying public property throughout
Tehran, creating havoc and intimidating the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Rouhani, a cleric who is the secretary of the Supreme
National Security Council, Iran's top security body, warned that
protesters and rioters under arrest would be tried and punished as
``enemies of the state'' and ``corrupt of the earth,'' crimes that
are punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our revolution needs a thorough cleanup and this will help
advance the cause of the regime and the revolution,'' Rouhani told
a massive crowd gathered at Tehran University, which was also the
scene of six days of student demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Rouhani also warned that the Islamic system would not tolerate
any challenge to the principle of ``velayat-e-faqih,'' by which the
Iranian Constitution gives ultimate authority to one clerical
supreme leader for life. ``The velayat is the symbol of the
nation's might. Insulting the velayat is insulting the nation and
all Muslims,'' Rouhani said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Iran's revolution, demonstrators had
chanted slogans against Khamenei, who controls the country's
security and intelligence forces, the Armed Forces and the
judiciary, as well as radio and television. He therefore wields
much more power than Khatami, the country's popularly-elected
president. Some demonstrators even called for Khamenei to resign.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the ayatollah's forces reigned.
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran, dozens of buses brought in students, workers,
disabled war veterans, old people, children and villagers for a
rally that included speech after speech praising Khamenei and
denouncing the ``hidden hands'' of the United States, Israel and
traitors for causing the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The march and the rally that followed resembled thousands of
similar gatherings that have commemorated important anniversaries
over the course of the revolution. As in those gatherings, the
participants were primarily from the lower classes, the
``oppressed'' as they are called.
</P>
<P>
   No one dared to challenge Wednesday's speakers or the chanting
crowd. Students at Tehran University who led the initial, peaceful
protests boycotted Wednesday's march and distanced themselves from
rioting on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But along the fringes of the counter-demonstration, a quiet
chorus of dissent criticized Wednesday's spectacle. ``Bad, bad,
bad, bad,'' said one women in her sixties, who could clearly be
identified as secular and middle class by her colorful head scarf
and the bits of bleached blond hair that it revealed. ``Write about
it when this crowd sets fire to the whole city!''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Employees in many government and private offices were ordered to
participate in the demonstration; one Army soldier said that his
unit was dismissed Wednesday so that it could march in civilian
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Many Tehran residents did not show up for work, particularly in
the downtown area around the university. That meant that the
usually slow-moving, fume-filled rush-hour traffic flowed with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's state-controlled television broadcast extensive footage
of the demonstrations from two dozen cities and towns including
major urban centers like Tehran and Isfahan and small, remote
places like Yassouj and Naghdeh. All the footage showed huge crowds
of bearded men and black-veiled women punching the air with their
fists and chanting slogans of praise for Khamenei and condemnation
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Television gave the impression that the crowds were massive and
indeed they were. But numbers are relative, and the crowd in Tehran
at least was smaller than others, including the one that gathered
at the same place for Khatami in May 1998 on the first anniversary
of his election. Certainly there was no comparison to the crowds of
more than a million people that came to the streets over and over
during the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Television did not show footage of the people who left the rally
long before it ended or the ice-cream-licking marchers who
preferred window-shopping to chanting.
</P>
<P>
   In the student-led demonstrations of the last few days, there
were plenty of posters of Khatami and none of Khamenei. On
Wednesday, there were plenty of posters of Khamenei; only a few
posters of the president, who is also a cleric, were seen. Many
children, even toddlers in strollers, wore blue paper banners
around their foreheads with the words, ``Khamenei is our leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the security apparatus deployed on the streets on the
last few days disappeared as regular army and police were posted
along the route of the marchers and at the university. Plainclothes
security officers carrying walkie-talkies carefully followed people
who didn't blend in, even following them into shops.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the marchers expressed their willingness to die for
Khamenei. A father and his two young sons wore white funeral
shrouds hand-painted with the words ``Death to America.''
</P>
<P>
   Long cloth banners strung along the university's iron gates
read, ``The blood in our veins is a gift to our leader,'' and
``There is no place for traitors in an Islamic university.''
</P>
<P>
   The chant of a large group of schoolgirls was simple: ``The
rioters should be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the pro-democracy demonstrators had chanted
``death to dictators,'' and ``death to despots.'' But incited by
official statements blaming the United States and other ``hostile''
powers for masterminding the unrest, the pro-Khamenei crowds
Wednesday reverted to a more familiar slogan: ``Death to America.''
</P>
<P>
   There were signs that at least some of the students felt
abandoned by Khatami, who won in a landslide victory in 1997 with
the help of the youth vote. The reformist newspaper Neshat on
Wednesday published a letter from a university student that spoke
of the ``loneliness of the students behind those closed gates. They
were looking for someone who was not there.''
</P>
<P>
   In a front-page column Wednesday, the reformist newspaper
Khordad noted the ``suspicious presence of paramilitary forces''
wearing civilian clothes ``who consider lawfulness an end to their
own existence and do not want to see the country in peace.'' The
column asked why there was not any criticism of this law-breaking
group.
</P>
<P>
   A man standing at a newspaper stand outside the university gates
said, ``What's going on inside is not serious. You'd be crazy to go
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman whose office is close to the university said, ``It is a
good show. That's all it is, a good show.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man watching the demonstration from a side street
said over and over, ``Have patience. Have patience.'' He said he
had seen many things in his long life. ``These are the last days of
this regime.I'm old and experienced. I know what I'm talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations in Iran traditionally have a carnival atmosphere,
with street vendors hawking fast food and souvenirs. The busiest
vendor Wednesday was a man with a large cooler selling ice cream on
sticks. Asked what he thought of the demonstration, he said,
``Yesterday was better. I sold more ice cream.''

ISRAELI, PALESTINIAN TOWNS MIRROR BARAK STRESSES

   HALHOUL, West Bank _ This Palestinian farming town is tired of
waiting for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Halhoul is supposed to be the next West Bank town from which
Israeli troops withdraw and Palestinian forces take control under
the peace process. But for two years hopes for independence have
been on hold in this community north of Hebron, and its 26,000
people have descended into despair over a crippled economy.
</P>
<P>
   Just across a rocky valley, the neighboring Israeli settlement
of Karmei Tzur has also waited for the next phase of the peace
process and worried about its future.
</P>
<P>
   The laboriously negotiated Wye River accord calls for Israeli
troops to withdraw from land around the 450 religious nationalists
who've staked a claim in houses and trailers ringed with barbed
wire. When the troop pull-out happens, they say, they'll be left
vulnerable to attacks by Palestinian militants. They fear attempts
to remove them from land they believe God granted them.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides of this valley know that when Israel's new prime
minister, Ehud Barak, meets President Clinton in Washington
Thursday the futures of their communities and the fate of the
Middle East peace process hang in the balance. How Barak will weigh
the disillusionment of the Palestinians against the fiery ideology
of the Israeli settlers is anyone's guess. But what's certain is
that he will have to find a solution, and soon.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of meetings Barak will lay out his strategic vision,
and is expected to urge the United States to play a less pronounced
role as a peace broker. He is also intent on convincing Clinton
that some time is needed to implement the Wye River agreement.
Clinton worked tirelesly to get both sides to sign Wye and is said
to be anxious to break the long deadlock that occurred under
Barak's predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs time, analysts say, in part because of the domestic
political pressure that will come to bear on him from the religious
right and settlers as his new coalition moves toward
implementation. The question is whether the peace process can
survive another delay.
</P>
<P>
   Halhoul's mayor, Mohammed Milhem, insists it can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see that peace means change,'' said Milhem. ``We
need to see that peace is real, and not an illusion. We've been
waiting a long time. Too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Halhoul has been uniquely frustrated by the stalled peace
process. For two years, it has been on the verge of what
Palestinians call ``liberation'' from the Israeli military control
of the West Bank, which Israel captured in the 1967 Six Day War.
And for two years, it has waited.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, after the signing of the Wye agreemnt, Halhoul
unfurled banners in anticipation of troop withdrawals and a visit
by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. He never came. The official
transfer of the land from shared Israeli-Palestinian control to
full Palestinian control never happened. The banners have been
taken down.
</P>
<P>
   On the terraced hillsides of this fertile valley, peach trees
are weighted down with their harvest and grape vines form canopies
over the brown soil that clings to the craggy slopes.
</P>
<P>
   But farmers can't get their produce to market since Israel
restricts travel on the roads and requires expensive permits and
tariffs for any exports. Laborers who illegally sneak into Israel
to scratch out a living on low-paying jobs want official work
permits. Water wells are contaminated and bone dry.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Milhem, 70, who was born and raised in Halhoul, says that
his community has grown more than just weary of the peace process.
He believes that even when the pull back of Israeli troops happen,
it won't change much in Halhoul.
</P>
<P>
   What he says is most important is the opening of the so-called
``safe passage'' roads which will connect West Bank towns like
Halhoul to the pockets of Palestinian controlled areas throughout
the West Bank and especially in Gaza. The farmers need the broader
markets for export. They also care more about beginning
construction of a commercial port in Gaza, which will open the
market further for international exports. Both of these plans _
safe passage and construction of the port _ were agreed upon under
Wye.
</P>
<P>
   Adnan Heinehan, 39, a Palestinian business man, asks, ``How long
can you wait? The sad truth is that we were economically better off
before the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   From Halhul, heading north on the wide, paved ``bypass road''
that leads to the Karmei Tzur, the growth of the settlement is
visible. Five trailers placed on a hillside sit next to the first
of 40 new foundations being poured. The work is being done hastily
because ``facts on the ground,'' as the settlements are often
called, matter. Settlement leaders fear in the next redeployment
their community will not only be imperiled but possibly evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Karmei Tzur's council, Esti Uliel, said, ``There is
a real possibility we will be left surrounded by Palestinians. . .
. The Palestinian Authority does not want peace. . . . The Wye
agreement is wrong, Oslo is wrong. We can only hope that Israel
will wake up to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has been vague about the further redeployment from roughly
13 percent of West Bank land called for under Wye. Some analysts
believe at least one or two settlements that dot the West Bank
would have to be removed. Palestinians say the settlements are
illegal and that their expansion is a violation of the peace
process. The settlers remain entrenched and defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never leave,'' says Shlomo Neeman, who came nine years
ago as a new immigrant from Russia. ``We believe in the
righteousness of our path.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep mistrust dwells in the valley between the settlers and
Palestinians. But there is an important piece of the history of the
land that binds Palestinian Muslims and Christians with their
Jewish neighbors. All three faiths embrace the prophet Jonah who,
the bible claims, was buried in Halhoul. Tradition holds that
Jonah's tomb is in the central mosque, where a stone shrine
shrouded in black attracts visitors of all three faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Abu Yussef, 91, who has delivered the call to prayer at
the mosque for 50 years, recounted the biblical passages referring
to Jonah being swallowed by the whale and cast out only after he
expressed faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palestine is like Jonah,'' he said. ``It has been swallowed by
the Ottoman empire, the British mandate, Jordanian rule, and the
Israeli army. Now it is about to be cast out to live under its own
government. But it is not the peace process that achieved that, it
is God's promise.''

<P>
   The army announced that it had captured the last remaining
commander of the Shining Path guerrilla group not already in jail
after a patrol spotted him near Huancayo, in the jungles of central
Huancayo Province. Oscar Ramirez Durand, who goes by the nom de
guerre Comrade Feliciano, took over the Maoist group after the
capture of Abimael Guzman in 1992. The group has been in a decline

   A prosecutor sought life sentences for 19 people, including 10
former police officers, accused of being accomplices in the 1994
bombing of a Jewish center that killed 86 people. The prosecutor
said he would be ready to present his case in two months. The

   Ecuador: Emergency Reimposed
</P>
<P>
   Raising the stakes in an increasingly bitter struggle for
dominance, President Jamal Mahuad has reimposed a 60-day state of
national emergency overturned by the opposition-controlled
Congress. With a nationwide transport workers' strike well into its
second week despite a rollback of the increase in fuel prices that
had set off the protests, and with some areas running short of food
and other supplies, Mahuad said ``the gravity of the country's
situation'' required that he be given special powers.

   Jesus Ortega, a close political associate of Mexico City's
mayor, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, was kidnapped off the street
near his home and released several hours later when his wife paid a
ransom of about $1,000. Ortega suffered the ``express'' kidnapping,
a common form of crime in the capital, on the day when Cardenas
opened a campaign to publicize his efforts to reduce crime.

inspectors for the mission after Iraq refused to accept inspectors

   Israel: Arab Named to Key Panel
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli Arab lawmaker was appointed for the first time to the
Israeli parliament's Foreign Affairs and Security Committee,
breaking a longstanding ban on Arab membership. Hashem Mahameed, of
the United Arab List faction, was named to the panel over the
protests of the rightist Likud Party, which called his admission a
security risk.

AMERICAN STILL LEADS AS AN ITALIAN WINS 10TH STAGE OF THE TOUR DE
FRANCE  
(DW)

<P>
   It's all one united Europe now, bound together by open borders
and a mythical common money, so why should French riders in the
Tour de Motherland care so much about winning on July 14, Bastille
Day, the national day of celebration?
</P>
<P>
   They shouldn't. But they do. Desperately. As they all know, a
French victory on Bastille Day can make or revive a career.
</P>
<P>
   But, once again, it was a foreigner who won Wednesday, just as
it has been a foreigner in all but one of the last four years.
Wednesday it was an Italian, the unheralded Giuseppe Guerini, who
rides for Telekom of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   He survived a crash with a spectator who stood in the middle of
the road with less than a kilometer (.6 of a mile) to go to take a
photograph of the approaching leader. The Italian fell heavily, was
helped to his feet by the fan, given a pat on the back and a push,
and steamed on to victory by 21 seconds in Alpe D'Huez, France
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Tonkov, a Russian with Mapei was second, with Fernando
Escartin, a Spaniard with Kelme, third, 25 seconds behind. That was
the same time as Alex Zuelle, a Swiss with Banesto, in fourth
place, and Lance Armstrong, an American with U.S. Postal Service in
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The first Frenchman across was Richard Virenque of the Polti
team in sixth place.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who rode with ease and clarity and received major
help from two American teammates, Kevin Livingston and Tyler
Hamilton, proved, if there remained any doubters, that he has
become a star climber. He also widened his advantage for the
overall leader's yellow jersey. The Texan now leads Abraham Olano,
a Spaniard with ONCE, by 7 minutes 42 seconds, with Zuelle third, 5
seconds further behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour de France, which ends July 25 in Paris, leaves the Alps
Thursday to spend its time in the hills of the Massif Central
before resuming in the mountains, this time the Pyrenees, on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   By winning the 10th stage from Sestrieres, Italy, to the French
resort of Alpe d'Huez, Guerini registered the first success of this
Tour for Telekom, which supplied two of the previous three winners
in Bjarne Riis and Jan Ullrich. Because of injuries, neither
started this year.
</P>
<P>
   Guerini, who was hired during the winter to furnish support for
Ullrich in the mountains, finished in 6:42:31. That was a speed of
32.8 kilometers an hour (20 miles an hour) over three climbs rated
beyond category in difficulty, especially the last 14 kilometers
(8.6 miles) up the 21 hairpin curves to Alpe d'Huez, 1,860 meters
(5,478 feet) high in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Guerini became the third Italian to win at Alpe d'Huez in the
last four years, following Roberto Conti in 1996 and Marco Pantani
the last two years. Just count it as a victory for one Europe.  &QL;

CLINTON TO ATTEND GORE FUNDRAISERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forget all that talk about Vice President Al Gore
distancing himself from President Clinton and establishing his own
bonafides as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   With Texas Governor George W. Bush holding a 2-to-1 advantage
over Gore in the hunt for campaign cash in the 2000 race, the vice
president is turning for help to his party's most prodigious
fund-raiser, the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will headline an Aug. 7 dinner for the Gore campaign at
the Statehouse Convention Center in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   That event and four other fund-raising dinners will be held over
the next two months, marking the first time Clinton has raised
money for Gore since the vice president announced his candidacy and
criticized Clinton's behavior surrounding the Monica S. Lewinsky
affair. Gore said he was ``upset'' by the scandal and thought that
especially as a parent Clinton's behavior was ``inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will host two dinners each night for Gore on Aug. 10 and
Sept. 22 in Washington. The events are expected to fatten the vice
president's campaign coffers considerably, although Gore campaign
officials Wednesday refused to provide estimates. Fund-raisers
featuring Clinton typically bring in $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who raised $18.2 million in the first six months of this
year, trails Bush, who collected $36.3 million. Gore's rival for
the Democratic nomination, former Senator Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, raised $11.5 million, an amount analysts said was
impressive enough to compete effectively with Gore for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Gore campaign and the White House downplayed
the idea that those figures were a factor in getting Clinton on the
fund-raising hustings sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan all along has been to get the fund-raising done as
early as we can,'' said one Gore official. ``You don't want to be
fund-raising while you are in the middle of a primary, and the
primaries are coming up soon.''
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart said the idea of the
president raising money for Gore was discussed as early as the
beginning of the year. ``The president stands ready to help in
whatever way he can. And this is certainly one important way he can
help the vice president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials denied they were sending mixed signals
by emphasizing the vice president's need to establish his own
identity while having the president help raise campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that distancing is our policy,'' the Gore
official said. ``The president has been very supportive of the
president, and we are happy to have him help us in whatever way he
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stu Rothenberg said Gore might be adopting
Clinton's 1996 campaign strategy, in which the president collected
most of his reelection money by the end of 1995. He also said Gore
``got whipsawed'' by Bush and Bradley's fund-raising so far this
year, and he doesn't want to see that happen again.
</P>
<P>
   But, more importantly, said Rothenberg: ``If the president is
going to do this fund-raising with the vice president, it's better
that they get it done earlier rather than later. The later it's
done the more you are reminding people of the close connection
between these two men.''

ARGENTINA AND BRITAIN REINSTATE COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS TO THE
FALKLANDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ The Argentine and British governments
agreed Wednesday to reinstate commercial flights between Argentina
and the Falkland islands for the first time since the two countries
went to war over the archipelago in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, hailed by Argentine officials as a major
diplomatic victory, came after Chile suspended commercial flights
between its city of Punta Arenas and the Falklands in March. The
Chilean move came in protest against the British arrest of the
former Chilean dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, on a Spanish
warrant for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Chile said it would only agree to restore flights to the
Falklands if they included a stop in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wednesday's agreement, monthly flights by the Chilean
airliner LanChile will start up on Oct. 16, with stops in
Argentina. President Carlos Menem said that his 28-year-old
daughter, Zulema, would be on the first flight and that he would
also like to travel to the islands soon.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``The final objective is recuperating our
sovereignty'' over the islands, which Argentina calls the Malvinas.
</P>
<P>
   British officials said the agreement did not resolve the dispute
over which country has the right to the islands, which have been
occupied by British citizens for more than a century. But Argentine
officials said it opens the way to improved ties between two former
enemies, which only restored diplomatic relations in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the start,'' Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella told
reporters in London. ``It's the beginning of a process that has
taken us years to reach.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also allows Argentine citizens to visit the
islands as long as they have a passport and a return air ticket.
Argentines will also have the right to construct a memorial to the
648 Argentine soldiers who died during the war. The two countries
also agreed to cooperate in preserving fish stocks in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Argentines could only travel to the Falklands if
they had dual citizenship and used a non-Argentine passport. On
rare occasions, relatives of the fallen Argentine soldiers were
permitted to go to the islands to pay their respects at a graveyard
for the war dead.
</P>
<P>
   The pact came despite protests over the weekend by 300 island
residents, who burned the Argentine flag. About 2,400 people live
on the islands, most of whom are sheepherders of English and
Scottish descent.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Argentina and Britain have warmed since Menem
and his daughter traveled to London in November and met with Prime
Minister Tony Blair. Ms. Menem delighted many during the visit when
she cried in St. Paul's Cathedral as her father laid a memorial
wreath for the 225 British soldiers who died in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Her tears and her coming visit to the islands are part of a
so-called Argentine ``charm offensive'' to win over the islanders.
Foreign Minister Di Tella has made it a practice in recent years of
sending the islanders Christmas cards.
</P>
<P>
   But the islanders still express resentment toward the Argentines
for invading their islands, and planting land mines that still pose
a danger. British military officers say they hope they can reach an
agreement with the Argentine military to jointly remove the mines.
</P>
<P>
   The early Argentine republic kept a token military force on the
islands, but it was expelled by British forces in the 1830s.

PANEL BACKS RESEARCH   ON STEM CELLS FROM CERTAIN EMBRYOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In a decision that could speed new treatments
for Alzheimer's and other degenerative diseases, a presidential
panel said Wednesday research on stem cells from human embryos
should be eligible for federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   Research using stem cells derived from embryos left over from
fertility treatments should be federally supported, the panel said
_ but not embryos created specifically for research purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Aborted fetuses would be another legitimate source of stem
cells, said the National Bioethics Advisory Commission in a set of
recommendations approved, except for minor tinkering, in a two-day
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations will be forwarded to the White House as part
of a report requested by President Bill Clinton last year.
</P>
<P>
   The White House issued a statement Wednesday afternoon, noting
the NBAC decision and emphasizing that the National Insitutes of
Health is drawing up its own guidelines and oversight mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that research will reveal how the stem cells can be
directed down specific paths to become, for example, nerve cells,
heart muscle cells or insulin-producing cells for treating diseases
like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, diabetes and spinal cord
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-member panel, which held hearings that saw disease
research advocates clash with religious groups on the embryo issue,
also recommends setting up a National Oversight and Review Panel to
review proposed stem-cell research and maintain a registry that
would keep track of all the lineages of cells obtained from human
embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build public confidence and trust and make sure we
go forward cautiously and respectfully'' with the research, said
Harold T. Shapiro, president of Princeton University, who chaired
the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells are so-called ``pluripotential'' cells that are found
within the days-old embryo. They can develop into any type of body
cell, but cannot generate an entire individual. In removing those
cells to generate large quantities of them in the laboratory,
scientists necessarily destroy the embryo.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of funding stem cell research with tax dollars argue
that such an act is forbidden by a 1996 law banning research in
which human embryos are destroyed. The bioethics panel recommended
that an exception be made to the ban, allowing embryonic stem cells
to be derived from embryos remaining from infertility procedures
like in vitro fertilization. In such techniques, more embryos are
created than are returned to the woman's womb to become fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations are certain to be attacked by some religious
groups and members of Congress who argue that stem cell research
violates the embryo ban. Last February, 70 members of Congress
wrote Donna E. Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services,
opposing the research.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, however, indicated in its statement that the
ban could be sidestepped, saying, ``it appears that human embryonic
stem cells will be available from the private sector'' which is not
subject to the federal funding ban. Once those cells have been
taken from the embryo and grown in the laboratory, research on them
would be permissible because the prohibition is against research on
embryos, not on stem cells, according to the NIH and NBAC position.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Jay Dickey, Republican of Arkansas, the sponsor of
the 1996 embryo research ban, said in an interview Wednesday that
he would seek legislation specifying that stem cells are subject to
the embryo research ban. ``The battle is still on,'' he said.

OF CENTRAL PARK THEY SING  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new operatic project could hardly receive a more
auspicious introduction than that to be accorded over the next five
months to ``Central Park,'' a trilogy of one-act operas by three
American composer-librettist teams.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the flak that the project has stirred up among many
people concerned about the future of American opera, especially
American composers, has been so noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   The short operas that make up the trilogy are linked
thematically only in that each story is set in New York's most
famous park. ``Central Park'' will have its premiere on Saturday
evening at the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., which
commissioned it jointly with the New York City Opera, which will
present the production in November.
</P>
<P>
   The third partner in the project was PBS' ``Great Performances''
series, which will videotape the production at Glimmerglass and
broadcast it nationally in the fall to an anticipated audience of
six million.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   This new trilogy, the critics say, has been a librettist-driven
venture from its inception. The librettists, each working for the
first time in opera, are eminent playwrights: Wendy Wasserstein
(``The Heidi Chronicles,'' ``The Sisters Rosensweig''), Terrence
McNally (``Master Class,'' ``Love! Valour! Compassion!'') and A.R.
Gurney (``The Cocktail Hour,'' ``Sylvia'').
</P>
<P>
   The younger-generation composers, Deborah Drattell, Robert
Beaser and Michael Torke, were selected during a later stage of the
planning. It is unfair to compare the relative status of
playwrights and composers: playwrights can have works produced on
Broadway and write film scripts; composers, by and large, have
nothing like that kind of visibility in popular culture. That said,
the pairings in ``Central Park'' would seem to be stacked against
the composers.
</P>
<P>
   What fed this perception early in the two-and-a-half-year
genesis of ``Central Park'' was the fact that the composer
originally brought in to work with McNally, Aaron Jay Kernis, was
edged out of the project when he and the playwright had creative
disagreements. More recently, some ill-advised publicity materials
in which the names of the librettists dwarfed those of the
composers did not help matters.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kellogg, the managing and artistic director of City Opera
and the artistic director of Glimmerglass, a man fired by a desire
to produce opera, including new opera, as vibrant musical theater,
has acknowledged that the venture was ``created backward,'' meaning
that the librettists were hired first. But in a recent conversation
he contested the notion that ``Central Park'' was writer-driven.
</P>
<P>
   ``That perception occurred because the presence of the
librettists in a certain world is so substantial that one might
assume their presence would be large in this other world,'' he
said. ``But all three were intrigued by the idea of giving opera a
shot and were partners in the best sense, rewriting texts with the
composers at hand, often in the same room. `Central Park' has
turned out to be an amazing collaboration, and deeply touching.''
</P>
<P>
   The balance of power between composers and librettists is a
touchy subject. Composers had to fight for control in the early
days of opera, a fight they assumed they had won more than 200
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-18th century, opera was essentially dominated by
librettists. Take the Italian poet Pietro Metastasio, a lapsed
lawyer with an impeccable education, an elegant verse style and
powerful champions. All a new opera needed to attract attention and
an audience was Metastasio's illustrious name on the top of the
placards as librettist, and he always got top billing.
</P>
<P>
   His 27 librettos, lofty creations on serious themes, received
more than 300 different settings by composers with such varying
degrees of recognition today as Porta, Uttini and Handel. And his
librettos kept getting set, though at a dwindling pace, for a good
40 years after his death in 1782.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gluck came along, followed by Mozart, and opera got
``reformed,'' meaning, in effect, that the balance of power shifted
definitively to composers. For example, in his youth Mozart set two
Metastasio texts more or less faithfully. But in his last opera,
``La Clemenza di Tito,'' he boldly had Metastasio's classic
libretto adapted to his own musical needs.
</P>
<P>
   Since then opera has been primarily composer-driven. The proof
is unambiguous: no opera with a good libretto but negligible music
has survived, including dozens on texts by Metastasio. (Ever heard
of Myslivecek's ``Antigono''?) But many operas with hapless
librettos are timeless repertory works. (``Simon Boccanegra'' and
``Il Trovatore'' come to mind.)
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, composers have been losing clout and control,
as John Harbison, whose opera ``Gatsby'' will be given its premiere
at the Metropolitan Opera in December, asserted recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome the big-name librettists to opera,'' Harbison said.
``Stravinsky did a great thing for opera by bringing in Auden, a
major figure, to work on `The Rake's Progress.' But Auden behaved
with the utmost humility. It is important that librettists and the
producers understand that they are in a secondary position. That's
the nature of the beast. My fear is that bringing in prominent
writers will be a marketing ploy rather than a genuine attempt to
improve the quality of the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbison, who saved himself from this struggle by writing his
own libretto, adapted from the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, is
unabashed about his view of a composer's role: ``A composer with
too much respect for a poet and a text, in opera and in song, will
be in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg was glowingly affirmative about the collaborative
process that had led to ``Central Park'' when he presided over a
panel discussion at the Walter Reade Theater in May featuring the
librettists and the composers. They discussed their work together
and introduced excerpts from the operas, performed by singers with
a pianist.
</P>
<P>
   When the co-producers first sat down to talk, Kellogg recalled,
they tossed around some ``pretty wild ideas'': the disappearance of
Amelia Earhart, and an imaginary conversation between the movie
mogul Samuel Goldwyn and Sigmund Freud. Several famous writers were
sounded out, including Anne Rice, Mary Higgins Clark and the
comedian Steve Martin. ``All were interested, but none had time,''
Kellogg said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he approached Ms. Wasserstein, who ``knew nothing about
opera but was very curious''; Gurney, ``who knew opera and was
dying to do it,'' and McNally, an avowed opera buff. All signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Since the playwrights were New Yorkers, a New York theme seemed
appropriate. Central Park as a setting soon became a fixture of the
project. Then the creative team, including George Manahan, the
music director of City Opera, and Stewart Robertson, the music
director of Glimmerglass, and David Horn, the series producer for
music at ``Great Performances,'' examined potential composers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In complete unanimity, without any disagreement at all, we
came up with three American composers,'' Kellogg said at the panel.
Of course, that professed unanimity was not to last.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kernis was reluctant to comment other than to wish the project
and his composer colleagues well. McNally's agent would say only
that the playwright was out of town and ``unavailable for
comment.'' Kellogg also chose not to discuss this aspect of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   When Kernis' involvement in the project was threatened, Ms.
Drattell, in her role as composer-in-residence at City Opera,
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely went to bat for Aaron,'' she said recently. ``You
can see my commitment to my colleagues from my work on `Showcasing
American Composers,''' a valuable City Opera project that in May
presented orchestral and vocal readings of excerpts from six operas
by Americans in various stages of development. ``I was an advocate
for Aaron,'' she added. ``But the collaboration didn't work out.
There is a long history of that in opera. Paul Kellogg is the
general and artistic director, not me. I am not privy to everything
that happened. You will hear 10 different stories depending upon
whom you talk with.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, on May 5, 1998, Kellogg wrote to Jac Venza, the
executive producer of ``Great Performances,'' explaining that all
involved had hoped the work between Kernis and McNally would
succeed: ``As the two progressed in the creative process, however,
it became clear that the libretto as conceived by McNally might
receive more compatible treatment if set by someone else. Both the
commissioning partners and McNally, who describes himself as a
`passionate admirer' of Aaron Jay Kernis' music, regret that this
collaboration will not come to pass and wish to express gratitude
to Kernis for the time and effort he expended in the development of
the current project.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the letter, which was sent to members of the boards
of City Opera and Glimmerglass (and passed on to me by Kernis),
strongly implied that if problems occurred, the composers were the
expendable members of the teams. Kernis, though deeply upset at the
time, moved on. That turned out not to be very hard: soon after
this incident he received an inquiry from the Santa Fe Opera and
also won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize in music for his String Quartet
No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Beaser, who teaches at the Juilliard School and has been called
by some critics a leader of the ``new tonalists,'' was hired to
work with McNally. As an old friend of Kernis, he wanted to make
sure that there had not been any ``gross unfairness'' involved, he
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been uncomfortable otherwise,'' he added. ``I
spoke to Aaron, and my real sense is that this collaboration simply
didn't happen, through no fault of anyone's.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg's letter to Venza at ``Great Performances'' had
suggested that a ``more compatible treatment'' of McNally's
libretto was needed, a phrase that could be taken to mean a more
compliant composer. Yet Beaser said that when McNally approached
him, he had no specific idea for an opera, just the general theme
of Central Park and a keen desire to write a work for the
dramatically vibrant soprano Lauren Flanigan, an artist he admires
tremendously, as does Beaser. Apparently, the playwright decided to
start all over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a good deal of time developing the idea together,''
Beaser added. ``Once Terrence understood that writing a libretto
was different from writing a play, he was extremely open to all the
musical necessities and had a wonderful understanding. I felt like
the composer in the project. The music was prime.'' Far from being
intimidated, he said, he ``valued Terrence's long experience in the
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting opera, ``The Food of Love,'' is focused on Ms.
Flanigan's character, a homeless woman who is often found near the
Central Park Zoo, hoping to find someone who will provide a home
for her child.
</P>
<P>
   Torke gained prominence early in his career as a composer whose
works fused classical and popular elements, though his music, which
has a kind of willfully trashy vitality, has divided critics. With
Gurney he has produced ``Strawberry Fields,'' a story of an elderly
woman, once an avid opera fan, in tenuous control of her mental
faculties, who sits on a park bench awaiting the son and daughter
who are about to move her from her apartment at the Dakota to a
nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drattell, whose music often has a grim cast, might at first
seem an unlikely collaborator for Ms. Wasserstein, whose writing is
wistfully comic and peppered with wisecracks. At the panel, Ms.
Drattell told a story out of school, you might say, about the first
time she read Ms. Wasserstein's libretto, ``The Festival of
Regrets.'' The story concerns a family that participates in a
ritual observance of the Jewish New Year at the Bethesda Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our discussions, I was expecting this serious piece with
one comic character in it,'' Drattell explained. ``But the libretto
was hysterical.''
</P>
<P>
   She panicked, thinking she might be the wrong composer for the
text, and told Kellogg as much. He virtually ordered her back to
her studio to compose the opera. ``I thank Wendy for pushing me,
too,'' she said. ``What I learned was that good humor comes from
sadness. The combination between us worked wonderfully.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the composers profess to be upset with the advertising
for the trilogy, like the brochure for the next City Opera season,
in which the composers' names are left out of the top portion of
the billing, while the librettists' names are in bold black type.
``That's just marketing,'' Ms. Drattell said. ``The librettists are
more famous. Whatever sells is OK by me. I want people to come.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt many will. Inviting popular playwrights into opera is
an exciting idea. What people will be waiting to discover is
whether these noted writers and neophyte librettists have been able
to accept that the music in opera is primary, and whether the
composers have been able to assert themselves in the face of such
high-profile partners.
</P>
<P>
   Beaser said he would be very surprised if, when audiences
finally hear the three operas, they take them in any way as the
works of famous writers and obliging composers. The history of
opera is rife with instances of writers who learned the hard way
that a librettist ultimately has an audience of one, the composer,
and that if the librettist's words, however wondrous, do not
inspire the composer to music, the composer is always right.

 &HT;    Relatives mourn killings at hand of `gentle giant'
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cyrano Marks was known to sit down on the floor for
hours and play with his children. Football in the front yard with
his stepsons and volunteering for school field trips were often
part of his routine.
</P>
<P>
   Why Marks would execute six of the people he claimed to love
most and then kill himself in the small southwest Atlanta house he
shared with them is the question that puzzles family and friends
who knew him as the ``gentle giant'' who never hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Marks' younger sister said she was racked
with grief, not only because she lost her brother, but also because
Deleane Briskey, one of the people killed, was her best friend.
Leon introduce Briskey and her brother two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost seven people I loved that day, not just my brother,''
Sharon Leon said from her home in Riverdale. ``(Deleane) was always
over my house. That's how she and Cyrano met. He was here and she
was here and they clicked. Ever since that day, they were
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police say Marks killed Briskey, her sister Essie Jo
Huguley, and Briskey's children, David Antonio Lucas, 13, Craig
DeCarlo Briskey, 15, Antione DeAndre Lucas, 9, and Torsha Briskey,
16. Minutes after he shot and killed them, Marks turned the 9 mm
semiautomatic pistol on himself and fired, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The lone survivor, 11-year-old Santonio Lucas, was forced to
watch each killing as Marks dragged the child from one room to the
next as he shot each person, police said. The child slipped from
Marks' grasp, briefly hiding in a closet. Marks found him and tried
to shoot him in the head, but the gun jammed, said Atlanta Deputy
Chief C.B. Jackson. Marks ended up shooting the sixth-grader in the
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, listed in good condition at Hughes Spalding Children's
Hospital, has been slowly recounting for police the horror he
experienced Monday morning when Marks awoke the family, assembled
them in a master bedroom and announced his intentions to shoot them
all.
</P>
<P>
   Leon telephoned some of Briskey's and Huguley's relatives
Wednesday and apologized for the devastation caused by her
brother's actions. She said the family members were kind, listening
quietly to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't what may have happened, I don't know why he did
this,'' Leon said, her voice thinning. ``Cyrano was a gentle giant.
All the years we spent growing up together, I never even heard him
raise his voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Lockett, a cousin of Leon's and Marks', said the
39-year-old Marks, who was born and raised in Oakland, Calif., had
been frustrated lately because arthritis was beginning to penetrate
his legs, which were badly damaged in a car accident two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could hardly walk,'' Lockett, 22, said. ``He was having a
tough time financially and he was excited because he had just
gotten a job cutting meat as a butcher's assistant. But the job was
rough on him because he had to stand all day and it left him in
excruciating pain most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks had only worked a short time at a Roadhouse Grill
restaurant as a meat-cutter's assistant. Corporate officials based
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., however, while verifying Marks'
employment, declined comment on his work there or the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Leon and Lockett were preparing for their trip to Oakland, where
they face explaining the ordeal to Marks' mother. Marks' body will
be shipped there Tuesday, Lockett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is very sad and very confused about this whole
thing,'' Leon said. ``The only question my family keeps asking is
what could have triggered this, what could have set Cyrano off?''
</P>
<P>
   Briskey's children were close to Marks, calling him ``stepdad.''
Neighbors said Marks, who moved in with Briskey two years ago,
often played with the kids in the family's front yard. Lockett said
Marks had often expressed his love for Briskey and her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was infatuated with her,'' Lockett said. ``They had their
problems, but there wasn't anything he wouldn't do for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks had even volunteered as a chaperone for field trips at
Usher Middle School where Santonio and his older brother David
Antonio had attended classes, said Usher Assistant Principal Al
Davis. Marks was authorized to take the two boys home from school
if they were sick, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Marks) was Johnny-on-the-spot,'' Davis said. ``He
volunteered, he seemed like a pretty good guy. There was nothing in
his past history that would tell us differently. That's what was so
shocking because he was very active in the school. He was very
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters never indicated there was turmoil in their home,
Davis said. The pair stood out among the 1,019-student at Usher
because they were well-mannered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you needed something to be carried they would carry
it,'' Davis said. ``If you needed attendance cards taken to the
office they would do that. The teachers are really in shock. I have
quite a few of them that are teaching summer school and they're
consoling each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Craig DeCarlo, called ``Carlos'' by the family,
wasn't supposed to be in Atlanta at the time of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year old had arranged to visit his father, Craig Towles,
in Lafayette, Ala., as part of their usual summer routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to meet him at the Greyhound Bus, but he called
Friday to say his mother didn't want him to leave just yet, though
he didn't say why,'' said Towles, 34, who also is Torsha's father.
``We agreed he'd come Monday, but I never heard from him again,''
Towles said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Chambers County had been a haven for Carlos and
Torsha. They spent summers and Christmases with their large
extended family in and around Lafayette, the town where Briskey
grew up and went to high school.
</P>
<P>
   By some family members' count, Briskey and the children had more
than 600 relatives _ named Briskey, Huguley and Towles _ in the
county.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a grandmother and an aunt pored over a photo album
of Briskey and the children. They were deeply mourning for the
mother who ``always was in a good mood,'' the girl ``who loved to
read'' and the boy ``who just loved junk food.''
</P>
<P>
   Towles and other relatives said they never heard Briskey or the
kids complain about Marks. In a recent conversation between Briskey
and Towles, he recalls asking her ``So, when are you going to leave
the Limp,'' his private nickname for Marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me things were OK, and that she was hoping soon to
get to a better house in a better neighborhood, and I think he was
part of that plan,'' Towles said.
</P>
<P>
   Though they were not living under the same roof, Towles approved
of the way Briskey was raising his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She growed them up to respect people and learn and be
careful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they just weren't careful enough.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Campaigning within a few miles of the White House
on Wednesday, the George W. Bush juggernaut swept through the
capital region, picking up $800,000 in contributions, winning the
endorsement of a Republican rival and promising the nation ``a
fresh start after a season of cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor tried to walk the thin line between humility
at not yet having his party's presidential nomination and
confidence that he would win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running with one thing in mind _ I'm running to win,'' he
told more than 500 people who paid $1,000 to have lunch with him at
the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in McLean, Va. ``I intend to become the next
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He later gladly accepted the endorsement of Rep. John Kasich,
R-Ohio, who dropped out of the presidential race on Wednesday. Bush
told Kasich he would ``fit perfectly on my team,'' and ``I intend
to use you.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Kasich said that once Bush officials heard in the last
few days that Kasich planned to abandon his presidential bid, they
sought his immediate endorsement, fueling speculation that Kasich's
ready compliance would make him eligible for a post in a Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich joins a stampede of 122 Republicans of the 223 in the
House who have endorsed the Texas governor. Asked at a news
conference in Washington what Kasich's chances were of becoming
Bush's vice presidential running mate, Bush told reporters: ``They
just increased.''
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raising luncheon attended by executives from the
high-tech industry, Bush discussed his economic philosophy. The
luncheon attracted luminaries such as America Online's chairman and
chief executive, Steve Case, and executives from Network Solutions
and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I know that governments don't create wealth,'' the
governor said. ``Wealth is created by entrepreneurs and dreamers
and doers and people who are willing to risk capital. The role of
government is to create an environment in which entrepreneurship
can flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would encourage the entrepreneurial spirit by
reducing the marginal tax rates, cutting regulations, ending
tariffs, rebuilding the nation's military power and curbing trial
lawyers by enacting ``long-lasting meaningful real tort reform.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Kasich endorsement in Washington, Bush moved on to
Baltimore, where he promoted his belief in church-based programs to
help children avoid lives of crime and drugs. He then attended
another fund-raiser that brought in $400,000, making his total take
for about five hours $800,000. That will be added to the
record-breaking $36 million he already has in his coffers.

HIGH HOPES AND PREDICTIONS OF HIGH SCORES AT BRITISH OPEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain)   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ The world is about to find out if Sergio
Garcia will contend for a major championship at age 19. Or if
Americans will continue their recent dominance at the British Open.
Or if Tiger Woods will win his second major. Or if David Duval,
Colin Montgomerie or Phil Mickelson will win their first.
</P>
<P>
   With the Carnoustie Golf Club in diabolical condition, and with
most players predicting a record-high winning score, the 128th
British Open begins Thursday, and the event could become one of the
most talked about majors in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   There is some controversy, with many players believing that the
course is too severe. There is European pride at stake in this
Ryder Cup year, with the Americans having won the last four British
Opens. There is new charisma in the field in the person of Garcia,
a gifted young talent from Spain, who captured his first victory as
a professional this month and who is expected to be a star for
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too much to think Garcia could win this British Open?
Garcia doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing pretty well; I'm pretty confident,'' said Garcia,
who won the Murphy's Irish Open on July 4 in sensational fashion
when he shot a final-round 64. ``I hope I play a good championship
on this great golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if I keep playing well, the expectations are going to
be high. The sport is not as easy as it looks. But I'm not afraid
to be here. When I was an amateur I was playing all those pro
events because I didn't want to be afraid now.''
</P>
<P>
   The last four Opens have been won by John Daly (1995), Tom
Lehman (1996), Justin Leonard (1997), and Mark O'Meara (1998), the
longest American streak since 1926 to 1930, when Bobby Jones (1926,
'27 and '30), and Walter Hagen (1928 and '29) won five consecutive
British Opens between them. European fans and players feel it is
time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are well overdue,'' said Montgomerie, a native of Scotland,
who will enter the tournament with momentum after winning the Loch
Lomond Invitational last weekend. ``It would be a dream scenario to
win any major, never mind in Scotland.''
</P>
<P>
   With Garcia in the field, Europe has increased its chances to
produce a champion this weekend. Since turning professional after
the Masters, Garcia has tied for third at the Byron Nelson
Invitational, tied for 11th at the Memorial Tournament and tied for
second last week at Loch Lomond.
</P>
<P>
   All this on the heels of a great amateur career, which included
winning the 1998 British Amateur and winning 11 of 17 amateur
tournaments from 1997 through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia hopes to follow in the footsteps of two personal heroes,
Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal, to become Spain's next
major champion. His peers expect him to succeed. Players know
special talent when they see it, and Garcia has it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only known Sergio a short period of time, but I'll tell
you what: he's a breath of fresh air,'' said Greg Norman, a
two-time British Open champion. ``I think it's great to see a kid
with charisma and personality. He fits in. Even though he has that
19-year-old approach, he fits in very well with everybody. He
enjoys himself. He enjoys the people. He enjoys the game. He's the
type of player that Europe definitely needs right now, because some
of the guys my age are getting up there. He can do for Europe what
Tiger did in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But winning this weekend will be difficult for Garcia and
everyone else. With its high rough, narrow fairways and changing
weather conditions, Carnoustie is one of the world's toughest
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Player won at Carnoustie in 1968 with a four-round total of
291, the highest in the last 50 years. Most players expect a higher
winning score this weekend, especially with the forecast calling
for winds at least 15 to 25 miles an hour from Thursday through
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the wind doesn't blow too much, because we're going to
look foolish,'' said Lee Westwood of England, one of the world's
top players and one of Europe's stronger hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Michael Bonallack, secretary of the Open championship
committee, defended the tournament layout at Carnoustie, which has
not played host to the British Open since 1975, when Tom Watson won
the first of his five British Open titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair,'' Bonallack said. ``We are not too worried
about scores, because this is a very difficult course. If you get
difficult wind conditions, they are going to do higher scores but
still a lot lower than anybody else would. As long as the best
player comes out, that is what we would want to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonallack also said he would not be embarrassed by a winning
score of 300 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the best player does it,'' Bonallack said. ``I
don't think they'll mind what score they'll do if they win. One of
the problems is that none of them have played, apart from four
players, an Open championship at Carnoustie. It is a bit of a
culture shock when you come to a course as difficult as this.''
</P>
<P>
   But having seen Carnoustie in practice rounds, the players know
what to expect. It will be difficult. It will be demanding. But in
the end, someone will be the champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you shoot four 72s, I'd take that, sit in the clubhouse and
not hit a shot the rest of the week,'' Norman said. ``I'd probably
end up winning by eight.''

RAIL KILLINGS SUSPECT CHARGED WITH CAPITAL MURDER
</HEADLINE>

By R. A. DYER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Mexican drifter previously suspected in eight
slayings in three states was charged with capital murder in a ninth
killing Wednesday, just hours after he had admitted his guilt in
the burglary of a Houston area home where another woman was fatally
beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, who told the judge during his court
appearance that his name is Angel Maturino Resendez, was charged
Wednesday afternoon in the October beating death of 87-year-old
Leffie Mason of Hughes Springs, about 40 miles north of Longview,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first Texas murder charge against the suspect, who
also is charged with two murders in Illinois and one in Kentucky,
and suspected in five others in Texas. He is believed to have
traveled by hopping freight trains, finding victims living near the
tracks. Investigators have said they have no idea what motivated
the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who lived most of her life within 50 yards of a Kansas
City-Southern rail line that bisects the town of 2,000, was beaten
to death with her antique iron by someone who entered her home
through a window.
</P>
<P>
   Like several other victims whom Resendez-Ramirez is suspected of
killing, she was covered by a blanket after her death. A Houston
police crime lab confirmed that a palm print found on Mason's
window matched that of Resendez-Ramirez, 39.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Hughes Springs case was filed, it is not clear
who will get first crack at prosecuting the Mexican national, who
surrendered Tuesday in El Paso to a Texas Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Wednesday on the Houston burglary charge,
Resendez-Ramirez quietly declared his guilt before state District
Judge William Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can all this be done very quickly, so I can say that I'm
guilty?'' Resendez-Ramirez asked.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration, which came during a 9:30 a.m. court appearance
during which Harmon read him his rights and assigned him legal
counsel, was the second such admission in 24 hours. He made a
similar admission during a probable cause hearing about 2 a.m.,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In neither case was the admission of guilt an official plea,
prosecutors said. And it was unclear whether Resendez-Ramirez was
admitting guilt only to the burglary, or to the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon, at the request of prosecutors, denied bail for
Resendez-Ramirez, although he has been charged in Harris County
only with the burglary of the home of Dr. Claudia Benton, 39.
Benton was raped, beaten and stabbed to death Dec. 17 in her home
in West University Place, a Houston bedroom community.
</P>
<P>
   Benton, a faculty member at Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston, appeared to have fought hard to fend off her attacker: One
arm was dislocated, and she suffered what police described as a
number of defensive wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Fingerprints matching those of Resendez-Ramirez were found at
that crime scene. Police took a blood sample from Resendez-Ramirez
on Tuesday night to determine whether his DNA matches samples found
at the Benton crime scene, or at several other crime scenes where
DNA evidence was found.
</P>
<P>
   Ede Emerick, a Texas Department of Public Safety DNA expert,
said that saliva and hair samples were also taken from
Resendez-Ramirez. She said the DNA analysis should be complete
within a week or so.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said
such evidence should lead to an exceedingly strong case against
Resendez-Ramirez. She said that if DNA evidence links him to the
Houston slaying, prosecutors will probably seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   `If what we know about him is true, and the DNA comes back, then
he's everyone's worst nightmare,'' Anderson said. ``It makes a good
case excellent; you got DNA, it's hard to deny you're the one who
did it. In a murder case, you got a couple of defenses: `I didn't
do it; you got the wrong guy,' or `It was self-defense.' I guess
the third is, `I'm crazy.' I don't know which one he'll pick.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear Wednesday why the suspect, who had
successfully evaded arrest for weeks, chose to surrender in Texas,
which is the nation's most active death-penalty state. He had been
in Mexico, which has been reluctant to extradite suspects to face
trial in capital murder cases.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, Texas has executed 180 people _ more than any other
state. Harris County, where Resendez-Ramirez is being held, has
more death penalty convictions than any other Texas county.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cox, a DPS spokesman, said the suspect may have feared
bounty hunters. A $125,000 reward was offered for his capture. That
money may go to Resendez-Ramirez's relatives, who negotiated his
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Houston police officers, Texas Rangers, West University Place
investigators and detectives from Kentucky interviewed
Resendez-Ramirez well into the night Tuesday. He was told that he
was entitled to legal counsel but declined, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys Allen Tanner and Rudy Duarte were appointed to defend
Resendez-Ramirez. Tanner said he is ``very much'' concerned that it
wasn't until Wednesday, a day after the arrest, that the suspect
was appointed legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced that he's done anything yet; all he's been
charged with is burglary in Harris County,'' Tanner said. ``He
looked very tired, like he's been up all night, and it looks like
he's been questioned or badgered all night long.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' hold on Resendez-Ramirez might mean that Kentucky and
Illinois officials never get to prosecute him.
</P>
<P>
   But in Lexington, Ky., police Sgt. Mark Barnard said he hopes
that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if he gets the death penalty seven times,''
Barnard said. ``I want him in Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings apparently began in Kentucky on Aug. 29 with the
slaying of Christopher Maier, a 21-year-old University of Kentucky
student. He was beaten to death with a large rock while walking
with his girlfriend along railroad tracks. The girlfriend was raped
and beaten, but survived.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the killings have occurred since September. The most
recent were those of a 79-year-old man and his 51-year-old
daughter, found dead June 15 in Gorham, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The other Texas killings were those of a pastor and his wife in
Weimar, about 100 miles west of Houston; the slaying of a
73-year-old woman about three miles from Weimar; and the death of a
26-year-old Houston schoolteacher.

A CONNOISSEUR OF COOL TRIES TO RAISE THE TEMPERATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 18) 
(yn) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Killing'' (1956), one of Stanley Kubrick's earliest
feature films, a man talking about his cronies in a racetrack heist
remarks: ``None of these men are criminals in the usual sense.
They've all got jobs and they all live seemingly normal, decent
lives, but they've got their problems and they've all got a little
larceny in them.'' Change ``a little larceny'' to varying degrees
of ``a lot'' and you've got a pretty good description of Kubrick's
entire body of work _ a cerebral, often brilliant oeuvre that
purveys an insistently Hobbesian view of life as short, nasty and
brutish, and man as a deeply flawed creature decidedly closer to
the savage apes in ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' than that film's
blissful star child.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's new movie, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' a lugubrious, strangely
static work that he completed shortly before his death in March, is
no exception. The movie stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a
wealthy New York couple who imperil their cushy, bourgeois lives by
yielding to the dark side of their natures: they allow malice,
infidelity and sexual jealousy to undermine their Architectural
Digest-perfect existence and to plunge them into a nightmarish
world of violence, betrayal and death.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kidman's character, Alice, cruelly tells her husband, Bill,
about her fantasies of sleeping with other men, while Cruise's Bill
petulantly retaliates by visiting a prostitute and attending a
bizarre orgy conducted by masked men and women. In the course of
his nocturnal peregrinations (which may or may not be part of a
dream), his life is threatened, as is that of a mysterious woman
who tries to save him.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was faithfully adapted from a 1926 novella called
``Rhapsody: A Dream Novel'' by the Viennese writer Arthur
Schnitzler, and it's easy to see why Kubrick was attracted to the
story. The book, which Kubrick first began thinking about in the
late 1960s, not only illustrated many of his notions about the
affinity of movies and dreams, but it also embodied the one great
theme that had preoccupied him throughout his career: the intrusion
of irrationality upon the orderly, daylit world of logic and
reason. Whether it's the perfect crime coming apart (``The
Killing,'' 1956), a madman's delusions triggering a nuclear
apocalypse (``Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love the Bomb,'' 1964) or a writer's inner demons prompting him
to murder (``The Shining,'' 1980), most of Kubrick's characters,
like Alice and Bill, find their best &UR; - &LR; laid plans and fondest hopes
coming horribly unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   As for the supporting characters of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' they
make up a misanthropic gallery of misfits and weirdos every bit as
unsavory as those in ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971) or ``Full Metal
Jacket'' (1987). There's a sybaritic millionaire with an appetite
for illicit sex; a junkie with a deadly predilection for heroin and
cocaine; an obsessed young woman who abruptly declares her love for
Bill; a sinister costume merchant who offers to sell Bill the
services of his teen-age daughter; and of course the Felliniesque
participants at the masked party. It's a collection of people that
underscores Kubrick's deeply cynical view of the world, his
unaccommodated view of mankind as a species driven to distraction
by greed and violence and its own delusions.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is that for all its thematic
affinity with Kubrick's earlier work, it deals with intimate,
emotional material fundamentally at odds with the director's cool,
visual intelligence and lapidary style. There is little erotic heat
between Cruise and Ms. Kidman's characters, and even less of a
sense that they have a 7-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old
marriage _ a fatal flaw in the movie that needs to make us believe
in the couple's shared life together if we are to care about its
possible disintegration. What's more, the masked orgy, much hyped
in advance publicity for the movie, feels more ludicrous than
provocative, more voyeuristic than scary _ an inadvertent reminder
that Kubrick once considered working on a Terry Southern project
called ``Blue Movie,'' about a highbrow director's efforts to make
a big-budget porn film with famous stars.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the failure of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' to convincingly
portray a married couple's psycho-sexual relationship should come
as no surprise, given Kubrick's earlier depictions of sex. In his
previous films, sex has been memorably portrayed as an
all-consuming obsession (Humbert's compulsive pursuit of a
pubescent girl in ``Lolita''), an uproarious sight-gag (the scene
of two planes copulating in ``Dr. Strangelove'') and a brutal
violation (the rape scene in ``A Clockwork Orange''), but it has
never been depicted as a complex, emotional involvement
encompassing love and jealousy and guilt. In ``A Clockwork
Orange,'' the violent punk Alex refers to sex as ``the old in-out,
in-out.'' The Marines in ``Full Metal Jacket'' are repeatedly
exhorted to think of their rifles as women, to sleep with and
caress. And the hero of ``The Shining,'' played by a sneering Jack
Nicholson, dismisses his wife as the ``old sperm bank.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, women occupy a strangely subsidiary role in
Kubrick's movies. ``Dr. Strangelove,'' ``2001,'' ``Full Metal
Jacket'' and his devastating World War I movie, ``Paths of Glory''
(1957), all delineate insistently male worlds, while many of the
director's other films relegate women to subordinate roles as
victims. In ``Killer's Kiss'' (1955), the heroine is a frightened
nightclub dancer trying to escape the clutches of her thuggish
boss; in ``The Shining,'' Shelley Duvall plays a long-suffering
wife who must fend off her maniacal husband with a baseball bat;
and in ``Barry Lyndon'' (1975), the hero marries a woman for her
money and then cavalierly cheats on her with her maids.
</P>
<P>
   The point is not so much that Kubrick is a misogynist, as some
critics have argued, but that he has never paid much attention to
the psychology of his characters, much less relationships between
men and women. Although the director's movies could provide a
Freudian analyst with a field day (from the insistent linking of
sex and death in ``Strangelove'' to the oedipal confrontations in
``Barry Lyndon'' and ``The Shining''), Kubrick has spent his career
ignoring (or avoiding) the very subjects that Schnitzler embraced
in works like ``Rhapsody'' _ namely, the inner lives of people,
their private dreams and frustrations.

OPEN MARKET TO ACQUIRE FUTURETENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Open Market Inc. said Wednesday it has agreed to acquire
FutureTense Inc., a privately held provider of content management
software for the Internet, for $125.25 million in Open Market
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, announced after the stock market closed,
Burlington, Mass.-based Open Market will issue 7.2 million shares
of its common stock for all of FutureTense's shares, plus 1.12
million options that can be converted into Open Market shares, for
a total of 8.39 million shares. Open Market shares closed at 15, up
1/16, on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies said the deal will enable them to reach
medium-sized companies looking for one-stop shopping to create a
more sophisticated and complete electronic commerce site on the
Internet. They plan to provide a range of services, including
content management, marketing, data collection, and on-line
customer tracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies now buy the content and commerce management
pieces separately, while we want to offer a combined solution,''
said Gary Eichhorn, Open Market's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   According to the deal, Eichhorn will continue as chief executive
of Open Market. FutureTense president Ronald Matros will become
Open Market president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Matros said FutureTense, which was formed with $22 million in
venture capital funds over the past four years, considered an
initial public offering but chose to go with Open Market to grow
more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   FutureTense customers include Chase Manhattan Bank, Fidelity
Investments, The New York Times Co., and Lucent Technologies. It
competes against Broadvision Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., and
Vignette Inc. of Austin, Texas, which are much larger companies,
Matros said.

 UNDATED: and frustrations.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, Kubrick's movies are a virtual archive of sophisticated
techniques, designed to dazzle the intellect and delight the eye
while distancing the emotions. Many of his pictures employ a chilly
omniscient narrator, speaking from a vast and glacial remove, and
they also showcase his singular gift for using music as wickedly
ironic commentary: ``Singin' in the Rain'' plays over the assault
scene in ``A Clockwork Orange,'' ``We'll Meet Again'' provides mood
music for the end of the world in ``Dr. Strangelove,'' and in
``Full Metal Jacket'' a bloody shootout with a Vietnamese sniper
concludes with the Americans marching off to the bouncy strains of
the Mickey Mouse song (``M-I-C . . . K-E-Y . . . M-O-U-S-E'').
</P>
<P>
   If Kubrick's characters often emerge as one-dimensional pawns,
then, it is in the service of a larger game with lofty esthetic and
intellectual ambitions. The noirish 1955 film ``Killer's Kiss'' and
the neo-horror movie ``The Shining'' are deliberate efforts to
reinvent genres that routinely rely on stock characters.
``Strangelove'' and ``Lolita'' draw much of their nervous energy
from the director's talent for satiric portraiture. And the hero of
``Barry Lyndon,'' played by the opaque Ryan O'Neal, is deliberately
depicted as a small, iconic figure in a sprawling historical
landscape _ an insignificant knave buffeted by the winds of fate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the bravura pyrotechnics that lent so many of
Kubrick's earlier films their fierce artistry derail the intimate
story laid out in ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' Alice and Bill are not meant
to be caricatures like the blackly comic characters in
``Strangelove'' or faceless cutouts like the astronauts in
``2001.'' They're supposed to be fairly ordinary, albeit
privileged, New Yorkers: a doctor and his wife who live in an
art-filled apartment on Central Park West, yuppies who like to
smoke a little pot before bed.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's slow, stately camera tricks _ more of those famous
tracking shots, more of those precisely lighted tableaux _ do
little to give the audience a palpable feeling for this couple's
daily life: the mundane, the quotidian, the domestic have always
been marginal to this director's interests, and here they
completely elude his camera's unforgiving eye. Scenes of Alice and
Bill getting ready to go to a party or talking about Christmas
presents feel generic and hokey, like a tendentious art house
version of a holiday television commercial. Their flirtations with
other people at a black tie party are mannered to the point of
parody _ as if they were inebriated young singles trolling for a
one-night stand, not a married couple dutifully showing up at a
friend's annual gala. And their subsequent fight over Alice's
confession of lust for a young naval officer feels as stagy and
airless as a scene performed in acting class. Needless to say,
matters are not helped by the fact that much of the pivotal
dialogue from Schnitzler's novel, set in 1920s Vienna, has been
used verbatim in the screenplay, set in 1990s New York.
</P>
<P>
   When the scene moves to Bill's nighttime wanderings, there is no
discernable shift in style to indicate, as Schnitzler's novella
does, that his adventures might be a dream or projection of his
brooding subconscious. Instead of the surreal, phantasmagoric
images that animated ``The Shining'' (blood pouring out of an
elevator, two Arbus-like twins, a nubile woman who morphs into a
hideous crone), we get stylized taxi rides around Manhattan, a taxi
ride out to Long Island and lots of aimless walking through the
streets of Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   The costumed sex party, too, is shot at the same magisterial
pace as the scenes of Alice helping her daughter with her homework
and Bill tending to patients in his office. And while the orgy has
all the elements of a menacing, kinky scenario (men wearing capes
and hoods and masks; women wearing nothing but masks and thongs;
sepulchral music; and several portentous scenes of people engaging
in sex), it is curiously devoid of sexual energy. To get the movie
an ``R'' rating, digital technology was used to add figures that
clumsily shield the acts of copulation from full view, but even
without these additions, the entire orgy sequence feels deliberate
and contrived _ an animatronic set piece that recalls the carefully
choreographed brawl in a mannequin factory in ``Killer's Kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as viewers of Kubrick's films have frequently pointed
out, the notion of man as machine seems to have held an enduring
fascination for the director. One of his future projects,
provisionally titled ``A.I.'' (for artificial intelligence)
concerns a robot boy, and ``2001'' features the computer HAL and
those famous black monoliths, emissaries of an alien life force
that has supposedly overseen the evolution of apes into humans and
humans into some higher form of existence. All are stories that
cannot help but leave the viewer with the suspicion that Kubrick
regarded a mechanized, machine-run cosmos as a distinct improvement
over our messy human realm.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt one of the reasons Kubrick was so fascinated with
machines _ quite apart from his own reported fondness for gadgets,
which enabled him to communicate with the outside world without
leaving his home in the English countryside _ was what one of his
biographers, John Baxter, called his ``morbid rationality.''
Indeed, in anecdote after anecdote, Kubrick emerges as a control
freak _ a ``movie scientist,'' in one associate's words _ who
seemed unwilling to make any move without considering every
possibility and weighing every option. This was a man who would
shoot movies set in New York, Vietnam and small-town America on
painstakingly constructed sets in England, so he could control
every aspect of production. This was a man, according to his
biographer Vincent LoBrutto, who left no detail (including the size
of memo pads) to chance, a man who began research on a possible
movie about Napoleon by having several hundred books on the subject
read and broken down into categories on everything from the
general's food preferences to the weather on the day of a specific
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick is reported to have frequently asked actors to do as
many as 40 or 50 takes of a given scene, and his former
collaborator Michael Herr writes in this month's Vanity Fair that
the director possessed an irresistible penchant for ``pushing his
actors as far beyond a `naturalistic' style as he could and often
selecting their most extreme, awkward, emotionally confusing work
for his final cut'' _ a proclivity most noticeable in Jack
Nicholson's over-the-top performance in ``The Shining.'' Experts
(in cinematic technology and whatever field of knowledge a
particular movie involved) would be relentlessly questioned before
shooting; movie theaters were strenuously vetted for lighting and
sound; and publicity was shrewdly monitored from afar.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear from biographical accounts that this obsession with
detail stemmed, in large measure, from Kubrick's fear, as he told
Herr, that ``if something can go wrong, it will'' _ a theme
reiterated in movie after movie, from ``2001,'' in which HAL, the
``most reliable computer ever made,'' suddenly runs amok, to
``Paths of Glory,'' in which the military system betrays its own
men. When it came to making ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' all this
perfectionism (which would turn an 18-week shoot into a 52-week
marathon) resulted in a film that feels overly studied and stilted.
Not only does Kubrick's formal, Apollonian intelligence suffocate
Schnitzler's intuitive, sensual story, but Kubrick's meticulous,
detail-oriented approach has sucked all spontaneity and passion
from the picture. In the scenes of Cruise and Ms. Kidman arguing or
making love, the viewer can literally feel the strain of their
doing take after take after take.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier pictures, Kubrick slyly dealt with the consequences
of such over-systemization and control _ the proposition, as the
critic Alexander Walker writes in his new book on the director,
``that every perfect system incorporates its own fatal flaw.'' ``A
Clockwork Orange'' was a parable about the human costs of a
government's efforts to use mind-control to stamp out crime, while
``Full Metal Jacket'' limned the dehumanizing effects of military
training meant to turn young men into a war machine.
</P>
<P>
   For a filmmaker so obsessed with these issues, it is a sad irony
that his fear of things going wrong _ and his concomitant mania for
clockwork control _ should have been a major reason for the failure
of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' his final film, as it turned out, and an
unfortunate misstep at the end of a dazzling career.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Safeco Field opens tonight. If it rains, Safeco Field
might close tonight, too. To the baseball-only stadium craze,
Seattle adds Safeco Field, complete with an 11-million-ton
retractable roof. The Mariners christen their new digs tonight with
a game against the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wonderful,'' lifelong Seattle resident Bob Stevens
said Saturday while sitting in a box seat at a Safeco open house.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, 54, was around when Seattle last saw baseball outdoors,
in 1969 when the Seattle Pilots played in Sick's Stadium. The
Pilots left after one season to become the Milwaukee Brewers, and
the Kingdome has held the game hostage indoors since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Safeco features are a hand-operated scoreboard and a
menu that includes clam chowder, broiled salmon sandwiches and
Tully's Coffee _ ``The Official Coffee of the Seattle Mariners.''
Safeco, named after a Seattle-based insurance and financial
services company for a price, will seat 47,155.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, however, the legacy of the Safe, as locals have
dubbed it, might not be that it is the most expensive so far of the
retro ballparks to follow Camden Yards and Ted Turner Field.
Instead, it might be that it served as headquarters for Ken Griffey
Jr.'s pursuit of Hank Aaron's career home-run record. Safeco's
effect on Griffey's chase of 755 is up for debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess, if there is an effect, it would be positive
from the Griffey standpoint, negative from the Hank Aaron
standpoint,'' said Tom Steiger, a physics professor at the
University of Washington. In the Kingdome, where it was 72 degrees
with no wind, Griffey and the Mariners pounded a major-league
record 264 home runs in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Griffey became the youngest player ever to reach
350 home runs. Griffey, 29, has averaged 49.2 homers in his last
five full seasons and is on pace this season to clear 50. Nine more
seasons of 49 home runs, including this one, and he'll be the new
king. In right field, the usual target for the left-handed Griffey,
Safeco measures 326 feet down the line, 12 feet farther than in the
Kingdome. However, Griffey had to clear a 23-foot wall in right at
the Kingdome. Safeco's fence is eight feet high from foul pole to
foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's cool summer nights will be a factor. In July, for
instance, the average low is 54.5 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Steiger said a fly ball travels two more feet for each
additional degree. That means a 410-foot homer at the 72-degree
Kingdome would be a 376-foot fly out on a 55-degree night at
Safeco. But a 10-mph wind can add or subtract 30 feet, Steiger
said. ``My guess is wind will win,'' he said. ``Wind will have a
bigger effect than temperature.''
</P>
<P>
   The team constructed models of the stadium to gauge how and
where the wind will blow in the park. Team official Rebecca Hale
said that in the spring and fall, the wind should often come from
the south, behind home plate. But during the dry summer months,
when the breezes blow from the north and northwest, off Elliott
Bay, the wind would be from left field to right.
</P>
<P>
   That wind would portend ill for right-handed Mariner sluggers
Alex Rodriguez, Jay Buhner and Edgar Martinez. But it should push
some Griffey flies to right into the seats. Team official John
Palmer said that, with those winds, the 326-foot right field ``will
play effectively 286-287... equivalent to Wrigley with the wind
blowing out.'' Griffey, secure in the knowledge that he is the
franchise, hasn't gotten around to conducting any experiments of
his own. ``If it doesn't work,'' he told the Seattle Times,
``they'll fix it for next season. Really, it is no big deal.''
Ironically, Mariners ownership contends that because of cost
overruns to the ballpark _whose approval Griffey helped win by
sparking a thrilling run into the 1995 playoffs _ it might not be
able to hold onto Griffey or Rodriguez, the star shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Financial troubles for the Mariners would fit nicely with
Steiger's advice to Griffey for surpassing 755.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect it to be that big an effect,'' he said about
Safeco. ``(But) if he really wanted to break the record, he should
get traded to Denver.''

 &HT;    Finding ways to stay on top
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves have been making the last five
regular seasons pretty monotonous. Every year from 1995 on, they
have been right where they are now, atop of the National League
East.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it's been a little different.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been a question of when the Braves would stake their
claim on another division title, but how.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they lost Andres Galarraga for the year to cancer
and Kerry Ligtenberg to arm surgery, and even though Greg Maddux
and Tom Glavine struggled during part of the first half, the Braves
posted the National League's best record, 55-34.
</P>
<P>
   Now, before they can make another assault on the postseason, the
health of pitcher John Smoltz (elbow) and catcher Javy Lopez (knee)
should make the second half as interesting as the first.
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager John Schuerholz has said if Smoltz is
unable to play down the stretch, the Braves plan to find their
answers internally. But if Lopez is lost for the season, expect a
significant deal before the July 31 trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get Javy back and Smoltz back, it'll be like making
the best trade we could ever make,'' manager Bobby Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise the second-half moves should be just the usual
tinkering in preparation for the playoffs, with an eye on the
lead-off spot, first base and left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone is healthy and able to play to their full
capacity, I like it as it is,'' Schuerholz said. ``Having said
that, if ever there's a possibility to improve it, going toward the
end of the season, we always try to one degree or another to do
that.... If we were floundering and tripping along and losing games
and losing our place in the standings, I'd answer that differently.
Our team is holding its own and playing well.... Rather than, `Woe
is me,' we've got a lot of guys who decided to suck it up and
understand the difficulties we're facing and play like they needed
to overcome these injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ Free-agent signee and Atlanta Braves All-Star right fielder
Brian Jordan left for Boston with 71 RBIs, seventh in the National
League. He is not the quintessential power hitter, but Jordan has
filled in for Galarraga at the fourth spot in the lineup in his own
way, driving in runs with clutch singles and doubles and scoring a
team-high 62 runs. He also hit 17 home runs, second on the team to
Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``In St. Louis, you knew you had to (get the key hits, because)
once you get late in the lineup, nobody's going to do it,'' Jordan
said. ``Here, there's so much talent, somebody's going to do it,
regardless. That allows you to go out there and just play your
game.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Few people would have predicted that Kevin Millwood would lead
this Braves staff in victories with 11 at the All-Star break and be
the sole Atlanta pitcher in Boston. But in only his second full
season in the major leagues, Millwood has carried the Braves for
stretches when Glavine and Maddux struggled and Smoltz suffered.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he's proudest of so far this season, Millwood
said, ``Being able to pick up a little slack when other things
weren't going real well. Being able to come through when the team
needed me.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike Remlinger has become a steady force in the Braves
bullpen, which is the most solid it has been all decade. Remlinger,
a vital part of the Bret Boone-Denny Neagle deal, leads all Braves
pitchers with a 1.33 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to provide some stability or something they hadn't
had in the past,'' Remlinger said. ``I knew I could do well as a
reliever. I feel comfortable down there. I've tried to help pass on
some of the things I've learned as far as staying under control,
not getting too down or too high. We've got a fit out there I
haven't seen very often. Everybody wants everybody to do well.
There's no jealousy, no, 'I should have his job.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Progressing from the 25th man to make the roster out of spring
training to the starting first baseman against right-handers,
Randall Simon has responded by hitting .307. He is not the Braves'
best run-producer, but he has learned to be more disciplined at the
plate, and the Braves can count on him hitting the ball hard when
he connects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is going to pay more attention to (the big hitters
in this lineup), but by doing our job and helping the team win,
that's really important,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   It might be the unusual suspects who make the Braves feel good
about their postseason prospects. They have helped the Braves
evolve into a scrappy team that has won 16 times in its last
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won ugly, much the way we did in 1995,'' Chipper Jones
said. ``This team has a lot of character.... No one guy has really
carried us. We've got speed. We've got flexibility coming off the
bench, defensive replacements that aren't going to hurt you. All
those things do nothing but help you late in the season.... If
given a healthy Javy and everything stays the same, I feel
confident we can go into October and win it all with the players
we've got in the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his inexperience, John Rocker has converted 17 of 21
saves. Maddux and Glavine have returned to form, combining to win
nine of their last 12 starts. And then there's the experience the
Braves take just from getting through the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of the main starters doesn't pitch as well, it's not
(that) we've not seen that before,'' Remlinger said. ``We know
we'll be OK. That might show some people maybe we are a little
better as a whole than everybody thought we were.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about this team,'' Jordan said. ``We've been
faced with a lot of adversity. Young guys, the bench, Brian Hunter,
Randall Simon, Gerald Williams, they've all stepped up. That's a
true sign of a championship team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your top-gun pitchers aren't going the way they normally
go, you would think, 'Well, the Braves are not going to do
anything,''' he said. ``Here it is _ we're sitting up here at the
top, best National League record. So, when everybody gets healthy,
watch out.''

 &HT;    Carnoustie memory bittersweet for Scottish pro
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH BERWICK, Scotland _ David Huish never won the British
Open, but he would have if the Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club hadn't
changed the rules, a point he makes in wry humor. But hang on until
we get to that part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   David Huish, you say? And who might he be? Well, he is the
professional at North Berwick Golf Club, which runs along between
the town center and the Firth of Forth, and has been for 32 years.
Only job he ever had, only place he ever lived, never played the
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always a club pro, never a tournament pro. I've always
been allowed a lot of freedom to play in tournaments,'' he said. He
had won some of a lesser nature, including the Scottish
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The year 1975 was David Huish's moment in the sun, a comet
flashing across the horizon. The Open was doing its farewell to
Carnoustie, not to return until 1999, although there's a bare
resemblance between the seaside course then and the hayfield it has
become now. Huish had qualified by the skin of his teeth. After the
first two rounds, he led with scores of 69-67, and this is how the
historians recall his run:
</P>
<P>
   ``David Huish, an unassuming pro from North Berwick, was two
shots clear of an awesome galaxy of stars, stealing the hearts of
romantics everywhere. Could this be the first Open win for a
native-based Scot since Willie Auchterlonie in 1893?''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a nightmare, rather than the glorious reveling
it should have been. ``After the first two rounds, I felt I could
play a little bit, but in all your career you've never served any
apprenticeship for something like this. After two days, you're
leading the greatest golf tournament in the world. It was heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``So instead of practicing, I went through the press interviews.
BBC wanted me, then radio wanted me. I was trying to please
everybody. I didn't get away from the course until 8 o'clock. I was
staying in St. Andrews, and when I got back to my hotel, I saw all
these photographers milling around out front and I thought,
`Something must be happening here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out it was me. They had bottles of champagne, wanted
me to pose in all kinds of pictures, shake the bottles, fizz it and
all that. Coming out of the hotel the next morning, they were
waiting for me again. I walked down the street to get away from
them and stopped to look in a store window. I hadn't even noticed
it was a jewelry store, and somebody said, `Are you going to buy
your wife a diamond if you win?' It was too much, a Scot doing well
in Scotland. I had been playing for myself. Now I was playing for
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``My tee time wasn't until 3:15 and I had all that time to kill.
Renton Laidlaw asked me for a radio interview and the first thing
he said was, `Well, David, did you get a good night's sleep?'
</P>
<P>
   ``They finally had to call on two policemen to get me to the
practice ground. People thought I'd been arrested. On the first
tee, I was handed a pile of telegrams this thick.'' He picked up a
tray full of papers on the desk in his modest little office.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the fifth hole, I hit my tee shot in a bunker. I knew it
wasn't a good shot when I hit it, then I heard this voice out of
the crowd, `Come on, David, I didn't come all this way to support
you and see this rubbish!'
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the turning point. It haunted me. I had all of
Scotland on my back, and I shot 76. The next day I shot 80, and of
course it was all over. You finish the tournament and you feel like
a failure. It took me a long time getting over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, straight-faced as could be, he said, ``I have one regret,
the interference of the R&AMP;A Committee in 1892, when they changed
the Open from 36 holes to a 72-hole tournament.'' He hadn't lost
his sense of humor. He's tall and of comfortable construction,
still plays senior events over here. He doesn't dwell on it, but
the return of the Open to Carnoustie brought about the exhumation
of his taste of the nectar, and how it turned to hemlock.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, who would win the claret jug, was still several
shots away after 36 holes, and Jack Newton, Watson's victim in a
playoff, hadn't yet been heard from. Both are here this week,
Watson playing perhaps his last Open, Newton broadcasting for
Australian television after the loss of his right arm, and that's
another story.

 &HT;    Love quietly at No. 3
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Davis Love III's year sums up
professional golf these days. A disappointing season, you say?
Anything to recall other than the amazing backboard chip he holed
at the 16th hole on Sunday at the Masters?
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't David Duval or Tiger Woods winning, nobody seems to
notice a player's performance week to week _ even the world's No. 3
player.
</P>
<P>
   The man from Sea Island is sixth on the PGA Tour money list with
nearly $1.5 million and easily could have four victories. Love has
three runner-up finishes, including one at the Masters, and a
third. In 15 events, he has finished in the top 10 nine times. If
this is a lost season, about 200 other guys on the PGA Tour would
kill to experience it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a couple of chances,'' the 35-year-old Love said,
``but nothing much has happened _ some bad first rounds, some bad
last rounds. I just haven't been real consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Searching the fog that had rolled in off the North Sea during
preparations for the 128th British Open, which began this morning
at the Carnoustie Golf Links, Love could not wait for the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got some history,'' he said. ``It means a little bit more
over here. It's a special place and a special tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Love spent a few days last week at Turnberry and Royal Troon,
combining some pleasure golf with a corporate outing. Seventh last
year at Royal Birkdale, Love enjoyed his best finish in the Open
Championship, closing with a 68 leaving him five strokes off the
lead. He has played Carnoustie a few times, twice during the 1995
Scottish Open, when he had to depart because of illness.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ball hitter by reputation, Love has adopted a lower
trajectory when necessary. It will be mandatory every day at
Carnoustie, with the wind Wednesday freshening to about 20 mph and
predicted to get worse. Love, who when his back is sound has more
length than anyone except Tiger Woods, won't be handicapping
himself as much as other players if he hits an iron or fairway wood
off the tee for accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harder the conditions, the better it is for me,'' Love
said. ``I think there are going to be a lot of long second shots, a
lot of them. It all comes down to making putts. I'll have to
scramble around a lot. If the wind blows, it could get ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnoustie takes even higher priority because of what happened
last month at Pinehurst. Or, rather, what didn't happen. A
pre-tournament favorite who grew up around Pinehurst, Love was
pretty much invisible during a tie for 12th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit the irons very good,'' he said. ``I never really
got a lot of chances at birdie. I was always fighting for pars, and
once you make a bogey it's hard to get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Love likes the overall style of links golf, not long rough so
close to the fairway as the Royal &AMP; Ancient officials have situated
this week, but the overall concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more fair golf compared to our bigger tournaments,'' he
said. ``It's the original golf. What we think is a good golf course
and what they think is a good golf course is completely
different.''
</P>
<P>
   As for matching his miraculous Masters Sunday shot, Love said,
``I might have to bounce one around a bunker or something.

 &HT;    Ryder team deserves pay, O'Meara says
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Mark O'Meara has been blunt with his
opinion about the Ryder Cup. It generates a lot of money, and
O'Meara thinks the players should be compensated. They at least
should be given an amount to be contributed to their favorite
charity.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference Wednesday before the British Open,
O'Meara seemed to reveal what really irks him about the situation _
not getting paid and then being pounded in the media for losing to
the Europeans in 1997 at Valderrama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't lose any sleep over the fact that I lost the Ryder
Cup,'' O'Meara said. ``My wife and kids still like me. Just as if I
didn't win the British Open, they're still going to like me. I
don't think it's fair that fingers be pointed at certain players
unless we didn't act properly. I didn't get paid to play in the
Ryder Cup at Valderrama, and I don't think I should be crucified
because our team didn't play any good. Who cares? So what? Move on.
Forget it. It's not the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, O'Meara flippantly suggested that all the money
raised that week be donated to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys don't mind doing that, do you?'' O'Meara said. ``Give
your salary (to charity) that week?''
</P>
<P>
   One reporter who had reached the limit with O'Meara's financial
emphasis, asked from the back of the room: ``How about if we cover
a corporate outing and get $50,000 for it?''
</P>
<P>
   On the scene
</P>
<P>
   What would a major championship overseas be without a few
American celebrities? At the new hotel overlooking the No. 1 tee at
Carnoustie, actors Michael Douglas and Bruce Willis are staying on
a floor that Michael Jordan has rented for a reported $100,000. . .
. Fred Couples' withdrawal appears to have been more for physical
reasons than lack of motivation. ``I think his back was bothering
him more than he was letting on,'' close friend Davis Love III
said. ``Travel anywhere gets (his back).'' . . . ABC-TV analyst Ian
Baker-Finch, who gets to Atlanta regularly for business, shot a 68
recently at East Lake Golf Club, with four birdies and two bogeys.
He played by the par-70 card used for the Tour Championship last
November. ``It's a wonderful place,'' said Baker-Finch, who is a
member at Atlanta National Golf Club in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   Hang on to those clubs
</P>
<P>
   A roofing contractor who was working at Greg Norman's house in
Hobe Sound, Fla., was accused of stealing his golf clubs recently.
They were returned in time for the British Open, but Norman already
had made up a new set. ``He (the thief) decided to take them to the
local driving range,'' Norman said. ``I don't know what he was
going to do after that. I don't think he realized what he had until
his face was plastered all over the TV screens that he decided to
bring them back.'' The thief returned them to Norman's house with a
story ``that someone else had put them in his car.'' As for the
roof, Norman said the fellow finished it, but he had not yet had
time to check it out. ``It's probably leaky,'' the two-time British
Open champion said. . . . Bill Glasson withdrew from the field
because of his sometimes-inflamed elbow and was replaced by Scott
Watson of England.

 &HT;    GOP MAJORITY REBUFFS AMENDMENTS TO MANAGED CARE BILL
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic attempts to broaden a patients
protection bill were rejected by the Republican-controlled Senate
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A final vote on the bill is expected late Thursday, when
Republicans can offer a substitute for the entire bill. GOP leaders
said their version will contain less expensive alternatives to
Democratic proposals to extend coverage and guarantee access to
specialty care.
</P>
<P>
   In the day's key vote, Republicans rejected an amendment by Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., that would have applied the ``patients'
bill of rights'' to roughly 161 million Americans _ virtually
everyone covered by a private insurance or managed care plan.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-48 vote means protection would be limited to the roughly
48 million people covered by self-insurance plans, generally large
companies which finance their own health care. Such plans are
usually not HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island, Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania and John McCain of Arizona joined the unanimous
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, the Senate voted 53-47 to reject an amendment
by Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., guaranteeing HMO patients access to
speciality care outside their managed care plan. Chafee and Specter
voted with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a heart surgeon and the only physician
in the Senate, said another amendment offered by the Republicans
would provide medically necessary access to specialty care.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans offered several amendments Wednesday aimed at
providing alternatives to Democratic proposals that were rejected
on Tuesday. The proposals addressed access to specialists,
emergency room visits in hospitals outside the HMO, access to
obstetricians and gynecologists, and a tax credit for long-term
care.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats objected that the amendments were weaker versions of
proposals they had previously offered.
</P>
<P>
   On a party-line vote, the Senate approved an amendment by Sen.
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, to require insurers to cover hospital stays
ordered by a doctor after a mastectomy. A similar, but broader,
Democratic proposal was defeated Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats objected that Snowe's amendment eliminated their
proposal that HMOs be required to cover clinical trials of
experimental treatments in some cases.

   DAYTON DAILY NEWS
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Rep. John Kasich finally commanded the
spotlight of a presidential frontrunner Wednesday, but only by
announcing he would leave the race and endorse the true bearer of
that title, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have quit two or three times over the last couple of
months,'' Kasich joked to a throng gathered at the Ronald Reagan
Federal Building for his joint news conference with Bush. ``I would
have gotten all this attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich's energetic but ill-fated campaign for the Republican
nomination officially ended in Columbus earlier in the day, where
he also confirmed that he would not seek a 10th term in Congress
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Westerville Republican said he was ``unbowed'' by his
campaign's failure to gain momentum, and he sounded like he meant
it. Before bringing Bush out to accept his endorsement, Kasich, 47,
pledged allegiance to his ideals and to his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   He told those in Columbus and in Washington that he was warmly
received in the places he campaigned, but he couldn't overcome the
sense, even among voters, that Bush was in the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be honest and I had to assess,'' Kasich said, ``and
the words that I heard were, `Don't go away, don't give it up. This
just isn't your time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The man whose time it is, Bush, gladly accepted the praise of
Kasich, who exudes enthusiasm for his every pursuit. Kasich said he
often heard his own ideas in Bush's speeches and liked the theme of
``compassionate conservativism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had thought that up,'' Kasich said. ``It's exactly
what I am and what he represents. It's the vision (that) we should
stop polarizing. We should stop dividing. We should start pulling
this country together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush joked about putting Kasich to work right away, and when a
reporter shouted a question, asking about Kasich's chances of
landing a job in a Bush Administration or even a spot on the ballot
as a vice presidential candidate, Bush deadpanned:
</P>
<P>
   ``They just increased.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience roared laughter and before it died away a second
question came asking Kasich if he'd be interested. But moving even
more quickly than the ever-kinetic Kasich, Bush leaned into the
mike and answered:
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he would.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich could only laugh, shrug and blush.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich's departure from the presidential race released Ohio's
large GOP delegation from any favorite-son obligations, setting up
a Bush-fest at a Capitol Hill hotel scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
   The event is being organized by Rep. Rob Portman of Cincinnati,
who worked in the senior Bush's White House as an attorney. Nearly
all of Ohio's 13 Republicans in Congress are expected to be there
to endorse the Texan.
</P>
<P>
   Only Rep. Steve Chabot, also of Cincinnati, is said to be
skipping the event, a Republican source said, because in his evenly
split district he needs the fund-raising support of all the
presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, whose wife is expecting their first baby in February,
has not said what he'll do after leaving Congress next year, but he
promised to stay involved in politics in some way. He plans on
returning to Iowa and New Hampshire, the two primary states where
he tried to stoke a presidential bid, in the next few weeks to
thank his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my message is going to be, `I'll be back. There will be
another day.' ''

PROTESTANTS BALK AT JOINING SINN FEIN IN NORTHERN IRELAND CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to refine lead, smooth first 4 grafs, add new 5th graf
on IRA cease-fire. Rewrites 10th graf previous concerning Trimble's
likely refusal to name members from his own party. No pickup.)  (th) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Ulster's main Protestant party said
Wednesday night that it was unwilling to join the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army in government as scheduled on Thursday.
The decision halts all progress in the Northern Ireland peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionists, spurned a
series of last-minute appeals and concessions from British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, saying they had failed to sway his party's
members from their conviction that they cannot share power with the
largely Catholic Sinn Fein as long as its IRA allies refuse to
start disarming.
</P>
<P>
   The Unionists' decision will block the transfer of power over
local affairs from the British Parliament in London to the new
Northern Ireland Assembly in Belfast. The transfer would have been
the most critical step in the peace settlement and the most
convincing evidence that the British province had moved away from
war and towards political resolution of its deep seated conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, aimed at ending 30 years of sectarian violence that
has taken more than 3,200 lives, was signed to worldwide acclaim in
April 1998 but has been put into effect only haltingly, with
disarmament the recurrent stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has refused to disarm, but Sinn Fein, its political
representative, has argued that the guerrillas' cease-fire, now
more than two years old, proves their commitment to nonviolence.
The 1998 agreement contained a general commitment to disarmament
but did not spell out the timing or methods.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had insisted that the deadlines for action were absolute
and that failing to meet them would leave Northern Ireland staring
into the ``abyss'' of its violent past. However, Wednesday night
his spokesman said that he would press ahead with finding ways to
revive the stalled process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always acknowledged that the Ulster Unionists have
difficulties with this,'' the spokesman said. ``We still believe
this is the best way forward and will continue to try to persuade
people of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister who is a co-sponsor of
the peace plan, said in Dublin that he was ``gravely disappointed''
by Trimble's action, which he termed a ``mistake of historic
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Mo Mowlam, the British secretary for Northern
Ireland, issued the formal directive for the 108-member Assembly to
meet Thursday to nominate the 10 members of the Cabinet that would
in effect become the new Ulster government. This step has long
posed a challenge for Trimble, who is the new parliament's first
minister, because two of the seats belong to Sinn Fein. Letting the
procedure go forward would formally provide the party its entry
into the government.
</P>
<P>
   The vote totals amassed by the parties during last year's
legislative elections entitle the Ulster Unionists and the moderate
Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party, led by John Hume, the
Nobel Peace Prize laureate, to three seats each. Sinn Fein and the
hard-line Protestant Democratic Unionists led by the Rev. Ian
Paisley have two each.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation now is that Trimble will refuse to name
ministers from his party, thereby putting an end to the plan. Under
the terms of the agreement, the British and Irish governments will
then ``suspend'' the entire accord, subjecting it to at least a
summer-long review.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The regional parliament, based on a power-sharing formula that
permits passage of legislation only if it has the support of
representatives of the province's Protestant and Catholic
communities, was the centerpiece of the agreement but now remains
powerless.

<P>
   Blair scrambled Wednesday to come up with legislative amendments
for Trimble to pass along to a critical meeting of his 110-member
party executive in Belfast on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But he had not stilled Trimble's worries. The Ulster Unionist
leader ended up calling the legislation ``deeply flawed'' and
unfair to his party. The new amendments, designed to address
Trimble's specific misgivings, proposed a timetable for guerrilla
disarmament and a mechanism for identifying and punishing the
specific parties that failed to disarm on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists said they feared that without such
spelled-out restrictions, they could end up sitting in government
with a party that would keep its secret army intact and be able to
resist attempts to expel it for any failure to comply with weapons
turnover pledges.
</P>
<P>
   At the Stormont Assembly building here, Trimble welcomed word of
the amendments but added that the frantic last-minute activity
itself raised troubling questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point that occurs to me,'' he said, ``is the fact that the
government is bringing forward amendments a matter of hours from
its own self-imposed deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the legislation that he had opposed in the House of
Commons on Tuesday night was ``not well thought through, not well
constructed and deeply flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   He then went to the downtown party headquarters for what was
expected to be a lengthy meeting of his executive. But he emerged
after only 20 minutes to announce that the party was sticking to
its policy of ``no guns, no government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have to tell you tonight is that the executive's view
remains unchanged,'' he said. ``I have not sought nor will I seek a
change in the party policy.''
</P>
<P>
   While Blair's 11th-hour wooing of Trimble had little effect on
the Ulster Unionist leader, it angered Sinn Fein. Mitchel
McLaughlin, Sinn Fein's political strategist, said: ``With
Republicans there is a deep, deep anger at the extent to which Mr.
Blair is prepared to subvert the Good Friday Agreement in an
attempt to bribe Mr. Trimble. He did make an effort, and David
Trimble has quite clearly thrown it back in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside party headquarters Wednesday night, members of the
Ulster Unionists said that Trimble's stature had risen because of
his standing up to Blair and to President Clinton, who had called
him during the past week urging him to take the risk for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed he will not compromise the principles of democracy
by letting terrorists sit in government,'' said Arnold Hatch, a
member of the executive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deadlines imposed by Blair and Ahern, the home-rule
legislative powers would have been transferred from the British
Parliament to the Northern Ireland Assembly on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, the head of the Independent International Commission
on Decommissioning, Gen. John de Chastelain of Canada, was to
establish the timetable for disarmament, with the first actual
dismantling of paramilitary arsenals in September.

 CHINESE SEE U.S. ROLE IN TAIWAN DECLARATION  (jw) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's view of its latest dispute with Taiwan is
colored by deep suspicions about a country that many leaders here
increasingly see as a villain: the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Taiwan's recent announcement that it was taking a
tougher stance toward China, diplomats and scholars here say,
China's international outlook was significantly changed by the
intervention in Kosovo this spring by what Beijing called ``United
States-led NATO.'' One direct outcome of a more aggressive United
States, as China sees it, is greater American interference in the
Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
   How Beijing will respond, beyond its vociferous criticism of
Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui, is still unclear. China's leaders
are likely to mull over the situation for weeks or months before
deciding what action to take.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing already had a deeply negative view of Lee, who startled
the region by dropping the long-standing premise that Taiwan and
the Chinese mainland have been separately governed parts of the
same Chinese nation since the civil war ended in 1949. Instead, he
asserted that a more realistic description of the relationship
between Beijing and Taipei would be ``state to state.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's statement stopped short of an actual declaration of
independence. Nevertheless, it only seemed to confirm Beijing's
suspicions that, despite the formal position of Taiwan's governing
Nationalists that they still want eventual reunification with the
mainland, Lee favors independence, something Beijing has said it
will use military force to block.
</P>
<P>
   Even if some leaders in Beijing recognize the hand of local
Taiwan politics in Lee's latest remarks, the shift comes at a time
when relations between Beijing and Washington are already strained,
making the outlook potentially volatile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lee Teng-hui has badly misjudged the international
situation,'' said Su Ge, a professor at Beijing's Foreign Affairs
College. ``What he has done could threaten stability in the region,
and could even threaten peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese scholars and politicians have taken a more strident
anti-American view since NATO went to war over Kosovo, and not just
because of the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade in May.
</P>
<P>
   To China, Kosovo signified a major turning point in
international diplomacy. When the treatment of an oppressed
minority became the rationale for military intervention, as
Serbia's treatment of Kosovo's Albanians did, China felt vulnerable
on its treatment of its own minorities, namely in Taiwan and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese scholars see the war over Kosovo as a deliberate
effort by the United States to divide Yugoslavia, and to assert a
right to interfere wherever it likes.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent edition of Strategy and Management, a highly
respected Chinese magazine, Zhang Wenmu wrote, ``The problem now
for China and other non-NATO countries is if NATO's scheme to
dismember Yugoslavia is realized, then the United States and its
allies may further apply this model to the Asia-Pacific and other
regions to attack countries that constitute a `threat' to its
global control.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang and others also argue that China increasingly faces danger
on almost all its borders, feeling encircled. They cite a
strengthened defense treaty between Japan and the United States,
proposals in the United States to create a missile defense system
in northeast Asia that could extend to Taiwan, and support for
Tibetan separatists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tibet and Taiwan have always been focuses of international
concern,'' added a selection in the May issue of another prominent
Chinese magazine, International Problems. ``Europe and America
still constantly use pretexts of various kinds to meddle in our
country's internal affairs, and now the Kosovo crisis will help
anti-Chinese currents even more.''
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider, that kind of talk may sound like a conspiracy
theory. But the Communist Party's political culture is rife with
conspiracy, hard to eliminate in a system that still operates in
strict secrecy, with little public accountability.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, it is easy for some Chinese leaders to believe
that Lee's moves are actually directed by Washington, especially
with the role the United States has played protecting Taiwan over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   China will pay close attention to Washington's official response
to Lee's action, searching for any hint of how the United States
would respond to the threat of a military conflict between China
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything depends on the U.S., just as it did in 1996,'' said
a Western diplomat, referring to the confrontation between China
and Taiwan that year, which subsided after President Clinton sent
two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan on Wednesday, Nationalist officials tried to present a
rationale for their redefined position on China, which is being
criticized by political opponents as reckless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded that it is favorable to adopt a stance more
accurate to the reality that exists,'' said Lin Chong-bin, a senior
official in Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, adding that a
special task force spent a year forming the new position.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lin had little answer for the potential risk caused by the
Nationalists' new position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot be responsible for Beijing's behavior,'' he said.

 CLARENCE L. HARRIS, 94; ALLOWED LUNCH COUNTER SIT-IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clarence L. Harris, whose contribution to the civil rights
struggle of the 1960s was that he did nothing at all when four
black college students held the first successful sit-in
demonstration at a dime store lunch counter he managed, died on
Monday in Greensboro, N.C. He was 94 and had spent most of his life
in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   By not serving the students at F.W. Woolworth &AMP; Co.'s store in
Greensboro 39 years ago, but also by not calling the police to
evict them, Harris inadvertently presided at the start of a wave of
effective protest. It quickly spread throughout the South,
reinvigorating a movement that had temporarily stalled in its
campaign against racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy came about when four freshmen at North Carolina
Agricultural and Technical College in Greensboro held a campus bull
session on Feb. 1, 1960, a Monday, and debated the usefulness of
several types of protests.
</P>
<P>
   The four _ David Richmond, Franklin McCain, Ezell Blair Jr. and
Joseph McNeil _ hit upon the idea of a lunch counter protest and
goaded one another to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might as well go now,'' said one of the four, according to
Taylor Branch's history, ``Parting of Waters, America in the King
Years, 1954-63'' (Simon and Schuster, 1988).
</P>
<P>
   The four took up stools at the Woolworth's lunch counter, a
popular eating place at the main crossroads in town, where blacks
could order food to take out but were not permitted to sit down and
eat alongside whites.
</P>
<P>
   A black waitress refused to take the students' order, but at
Harris' instruction no other action was taken. The students sat at
the counter until the store closed, promising they would be back
the next day. They returned with students from several black
colleges in the area.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, there were more than 80 participants, and by the
end of the first week, there were 200. National news organizations
began to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Greensboro sit-in was being copied in many
communities. With business owners hesitant to press charges in the
hope of avoiding embarrassing publicity, the concept moved across
state lines. By the end of February, protests were under way in
more than 30 other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration at the Greensboro Woolworth's continued for
six months, until Harris and the store managers gave in and
integrated the lunch counter.
</P>
<P>
   On the first anniversary of the Greensboro sit-in, The New York
Times described the period that had had been touched off by the
demonstration as a time of ``stand-ins at theaters, kneel-ins at
churches and wade-ins at public beaches'' and declared that taken
together, these activities assumed ``the proportions of a national
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   In his history of the period, Branch noted that the success of
the Greensboro sit-in and those that followed had been assured by
the unanticipated response ``of Woolworth's white managers, who
instead of threatening to have them arrested, foundered in
confusion and embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the black civil rights leadership, the surprise discovery
of defensiveness within the segregated white world turned their
fear into elation,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' view of the event was ambivalent. In an interview with a
North Carolina newspaper last year, he said of the protesters, ``I
was on their side.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand he also spoke of his bitterness about the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cost me $150,000 in lost business,'' he said. ``Wound up
I lost one-third of my profits, and I lost one-third of my salary.
I resented it because I got no help from my company, I got no help
from the city. I got no help from anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris is survived by three daughters, Nancy Carlson of Concord,
N.C., Carolyn Harris of New York City and Patty Barr of West End,
N.C., and a sister, Laura Lupton of Raleigh, N.C. &QL;

 &HT;    Newbill working, waiting for a shot
 &HT;    By Andy Staples
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NBA players are accustomed to training in the finest
facilities available. That's why center Ivano Newbill appreciates
even more the time he spent training at the Cobb YMCA and Walton
High in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Newbill is trying to earn a second tour of duty with the Hawks
at this week's rookie and free-agent camp at Life University. The
three-year veteran hasn't played in an NBA game since April 1998
with Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Newbill has lifted weights at the YMCA and run on
the Walton track. The 6-foot-11 Macon native hasn't missed the
state-of-the-art training in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-tech has nothing to do with it. It's the person on the
machine,'' Newbill said. ``It doesn't matter what machine or what
track you're on. It's in your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbill, who averaged 3.9 points and 5.3 rebounds a game in four
years at Georgia Tech, has made his career doing the little things.
He thinks that will help earn him a roster spot this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also help the team (even) if it's just coming from offensive
rebounds. They have some shooters here,'' Newbill said. ``A lot of
people underestimate the job at hand. It's about freeing people up,
people like Steve Smith and the guys who need to score.''
</P>
<P>
   At the feet of the masters
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Jason Terry is no stranger to legendary coaches.
Before he began playing for Hall-of-Famer Lenny Wilkens, he took
instruction from Lute Olson at the University of Arizona. Of
course, he could hear one a little better than the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference (here) is there's less yelling. Coach
Olson was on you from Day 1,'' Terry said. ``Coach Wilkens makes
his point, and his presence is felt. When he's out there standing
on the sidelines, you know he's watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry said it was obvious from both coaches' records that each
philosophy has its merits. Wilkens is the NBA's winningest coach,
while Olson has won 565 games in 25 years in college.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie first-rounder definitely has a preference, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easier for you to concentrate when you don't have
a guy on you,'' Terry said. ``Lute doesn't yell a lot, but when he
yells, you know what he's talking about.''

 &HT;    AMS banks on IRL safety
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Motor Speedway general manager Ed Clark didn't
flinch when he heard the word he had hoped to avoid but knew was
inevitable _ Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In May, flying debris from an Indy Racing League accident at
Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte killed three fans and injured
others, and a 1998 accident took the lives of fans in a CART race
at Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Clark knew someone would bring up the issue of fan safety at
this weekend's event at AMS, the IRL's Kobalt Mechanics Tools 500.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the Charlotte accident, veteran Indy driver Mario
Andretti and NASCAR's Darrell Waltrip told the Charlotte Observer
that open-wheel cars don't belong on high-banked ovals, because the
cars can go too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what they're talking about,'' Clark said,
``and I say that with the most reverence and respect. They ran
faster at Indy than here.'' Indy's track isn't high-banked.
</P>
<P>
   For this year's Indy 500, qualifying speeds ranged from 220-225
mph on an 11-degree bank. On 24-degree banks at Texas, qualifying
speeds were 204-215 mph. Stats were not available at Charlotte for
1999, but in 1998, the speeds were 191-220 mph. The qualifying
speeds in Atlanta last year were 212-224 mph. Waltrip had said,
``These are steep-banked tracks which weren't intended for cars
running 220 mph. When you put those cars on tracks like Charlotte,
Atlanta and Texas, they can't build the catch-fences high enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, Atlanta Motor Speedway and Texas Motor Speedway and
all Speedway Motorsports Inc. facilities owned by Bruton Smith
immediately took steps to increase spectator safety by raising the
fence separating fans from the track by six feet, to 21 feet, with
an oval-shaped overhang six feet over the track.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the IRL installed tethers on the wheels and suspensions of
all cars in time for the Indianapolis 500 and has continued to use
them.
</P>
<P>
   Smith currently is pushing another idea _ fenders for open-wheel
racers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith tells Racer magazine, ``I don't know where it's written
that you have to have open-wheel racing. It may be that open-wheel
racing is obsolete. Maybe after 80 or 90 years, we ought to say,
'OK, we've had that for awhile, now we need to enclose (the
wheels).' ``
</P>
<P>
   Would fenders make open-wheel cars safer or just enable them to
be bigger billboards for sponsors?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the purist is going to say, 'This is an Indy car; don't
change it,' but I think there are several factors in it,'' Clark
said. ``From a busnt those modest gains. The Metros, with the
second-worst record in league, lost to the A-League Staten Island
Vipers Tuesday in the second round of the U.S. Open Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very big difference between event marketing and
developing sports fans,'' MLS commissioner Douglas Logan said.
``(The Women's World Cup) was a shining hour for our sport, but it
is an event that comes and goes. We are in a very different
situation with regards to where our program is compared to the rest
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, back to reality.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. women set schedule(s)
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's World Cup team could play in not one but two
victory/promotional tours in the coming months, with a possible
conflict almost inevitable. SFX Sports Group, a marketing firm, has
put together an 11-match indoor schedule starting Oct. 22. But that
would run simultaneously to a USSF-sponsored tour of Australia,
Egypt and South Africa. Players' representatives will hash out the
details next week with the USSF as part of regular labor
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Chile kicked out of Copa
</P>
<P>
   Botched penalty kicks continue to plague the Copa America.
Marcelo Salas missed a freebie in regulation, then Mauricio Aros
was denied in the penalty kick round as Uruguay took a 5-3 victory
to settle a 1-1 draw in the semifinals on Tuesday in Asuncion,
Paraguay. Salas hit the crossbar, the sixth time in the tournament
that a playeor Mexico, who played late Wednesday.

<P>
   Transfer talk
</P>
<P>
   Liverpool plans to use roughly $31 million of a new $34 million
partnership deal with British media and hotel conglomerate Granada
Group Plc. to purchase players for manager Gerard Houllier's
overhaul plans. He already has spent some $25 million on
acquisitions this summer. Granada purchased a 9.9 percent stake in
the club, whose value is now estimated at $342.8 million.... Lazio
has had enough of Nicolas Anelka and his agents and has cut off
talks with Arsenal. Lazio's final offer for the 20-year-old French
striker was believed to be $27.6 million.... Bebeto, one of
Brazil's 1994 World Cup stars, is on his way from Botafogo to Toros
Neza of Mexico.... Italian national team goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi
has moved from Juventus to Inter Milan for an estimated $14.78
million.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ WGBH-TV, Boston's publicly funded station, has been
swapping names of contributors with the Democratic Party since
1994, handing over a total of more than 32,000 names despite clear
prohibitions against tax-exempt groups engaging in political acts,
a party official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican House members Wednesday called for a criminal
investigation of the station after learning of a single account of
name-swapping between WGBH and Democrats earlier this year. An
official at WGBH initially downplayed the incident, saying it was a
one-time mistake by new employees who did not understand the rules.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night Jenny Backus, spokeswoman for the Democratic
National Committee, said the party has been sharing donor
information with the public television station for years and to a
much greater extent than WGBH officials had admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Even before that revelation, a House subcommittee canceled
Wednesday's meeting to authorize an additional $525 million in
funding for public broadcasters nationwide, saying the sole Boston
incident was enough reason not to give blanket approval to the
proposed increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard some troubling reports that this may not be an
isolated case,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Representative
W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the House
telecommunications subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday night, the entire system of public broadcasting had
been thrown into jeopardy, as the allegations of wrongdoing
appeared much worse than initially thought.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH vice president for communications Jeanne M. Hopkins said
Wednesday night, ``There's never been any intent to do anything
other than attract support. It is not partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   The revelations come at an inopportune time for public
broadcasters. Republicans, once convinced the public broadcasting
system was partial to the liberal cause, seemed to have largely
changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week a number of Republicans had said they hoped to
increase funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the
umbrella organization of the nation's public broadcasting stations,
including the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public
Radio.
</P>
<P>
   But with the admission that WGBH was so deeply connected to
Democratic politics, the so-called Battle of Big Bird broke out
again. It appeared that Republicans would draw attention to the
link between national public broadcasting and liberal politics once
again.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH, the 44-year-old television station that has built a
national reputation around its educational and cultural
programming, first approached the Democrats about name-swapping in
1993, Backus said.
</P>
<P>
   That first year station officials asked for and were given 5,000
names of Democratic campaign donors whom they could then approach
for donations to WGBH. The next year, WGBH brokered two deals,
asking for a total of 7,800 names in June and July. Also in 1994,
station officials began to ``pay for'' the names by giving names of
their own contributors to the DNC _ a swap that would be considered
routine in a commercial business setting, Backus said.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said WGBH did not implement a policy of refusing to swap
names with political parties until 1994, one year after making its
first deal with the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, WGBH was still ``in a position of needing to give
names because of a prior commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Backus denied the DNC had any knowledge WGBH was breaking
internal and, possibly, federal rules when the exchange occurred.
``When you talk about the direct marketing industry, the mailing
lists go back and forth all the time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and February 1999, WGBH gave a total of about
12,000 names to the Democratic Party, Backus said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Democratic Party began compiling a mailing list last
February, the official in charge of the procedure _ known as the
``list broker'' _ approached 123 different organizations. Of those,
62 groups agreed to share lists.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH was among them _ giving an additional 20,000 names in
exchange for the names of 9,800 Democratic donors, plus the station
received a financial payment for the equivalent of another 10,200
names. Backus said he did not know how much the DNC paid the
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``They approved the request,'' Backus said. ``But if GBH had any
internal restrictions or policies, we had no reason to be aware of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House subcommittee that oversees public
broadcasting were outraged even before they learned that the level
of cooperation between WGBH and the DNC was more extensive than had
been known. Representative Paul E. Gillmor, a Republican from Ohio,
called the incident a ``crass abuse of listeners and supporters,''
and he insisted on a full investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect public broadcasting to be nonpartisan, we expect it
to be above-board, we expect it to be honest. This station is none
of those,'' Gillmor said Wednesday. ``This is a very serious breach
of trust with the supporters of public broadcasting. And I think
you will see an investigation to see how widespread this
reprehensible practice is.''
</P>
<P>
   WGBH officials have for weeks been cooperating with the Internal
Revenue Service, which is likely to investigate whether WGBH still
qualifies for its tax-free status after giving names to Democrats.
But after the DNC provided more details, Republicans are expected
to conduct a wide-reaching investigation into publicly funded
stations nationwide to determine how common the practice is.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said: ``It's not clear there's been a violation of the
law, or anything illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats said they suspected Republicans had hoped to
block public broadcasting funds all along, and they accused the GOP
of exaggerating any possible wrongdoing at WGBH.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems all the sound and fury is aimed at hiding the fact
that once again they're going after public television,'' Backus
said, referring to the 1994 crusade by former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   But even Representative Charles W. Pickering, a Republican from
Mississippi who backs the funding increase for public broadcasting,
said it was ``unfortunate the station did this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings back all the old ghosts and undermines the
credibility and some of the support the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting has established in recent years,'' he said.

 &HT;    Sampras to sit? Don't bet on it
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pete Sampras once was benched in singles, and nobody
thought much of it. It happened in 1992, when Jim Courier was
ranked No. 1 and Andre Agassi had just won Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gorman, the U.S. Davis Cup captain at the time, paired
Sampras with John McEnroe in doubles for the final two rounds, and
they won twice in five sets. Their 6-7, 6-7, 7-5, 6-1, 6-2 win over
Switzerland's Marc Rosset and Jacob Hlasek clinched the victory in
the final, Sampras' first Davis Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to believe that history could repeat itself this
weekend in Brookline, Mass., where the United States and Australia
play their quarterfinal. The event will commemorate 100 years of
Davis Cup, which began on the lawns of the Longwood Cricket Club
with a match between the United States and Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, that's the talk persisting this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to just hop on and play singles and carry the flag is
something I'm sensitive about,'' Sampras said upon arrival at
Longwood, ``and that's why I decided not to play singles.''
</P>
<P>
   But Australian Patrick Rafter, the world's No. 2 player, said,
``I don't think he's come all this way to sit on the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   And nobody else thinks so, either.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who declined to participate in 1998 and in the first
round this year, says he doesn't deserve to play singles. Courier
and Todd Martin, the team loyalists, won the first-round match in
England.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras wasn't with them despite U.S. captain Tom Gullikson's
New Year's Day visit to Sampras' home in Los Angeles to stress the
importance of the centennial celebration to American tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At what price are you going to sacrifice your goals?'' Sampras
asked at the time, reaffirming the No. 1 ranking and Grand Slam
titles as his priorities. ``I can't finish the year No. 1 and play
Davis Cup. The weeks are just impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was envy that changed Sampras' mind.
</P>
<P>
   When Sampras desperately played seven of the final eight weeks
in Europe to save his No. 1 ranking, no one much cared. No American
journalist attended the ATP Tour Championship in Germany, where
Sampras broke Jimmy Connors' record. Puzzled and hurt, Sampras
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Courier went to England, beat Tim Henman and Greg
Rusedski in five sets each and was hailed as a hero. It was one of
the most watched and talked about ties in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Jim and Todd did was an inspiration,'' Sampras said.
Sampras says he doesn't want to ``jump on the bandwagon,'' but it's
not fair to say Davis Cup has held no meaning for him. After the
1992 championship, Sampras came back in 1995 to handle the Russians
in Moscow. He defeated Andrei Chesnokov in five sets and collapsed
in cramps afterward. He returned to win in doubles, then clinched
the championship against Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras also clocked Rafter and Mark Philippoussis in the 1997
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   When Sampras hasn't played, the U.S. team has been downright bad
at times. In 1993, the U.S. team lost a first-rounder to Australia
with Brad Gilbert and David Wheaton. Last year, the Americans were
humiliated 5-0 by Italy, with Jan-Michael Gambill and Justin
Gimelstob playing singles in a semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing would be more embarrassing than losing in the middle of
the USTA's centennial party, with the world's best player on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete's swallowed enough pride,'' Martin said. ``Hypothetically
speaking, if Jim and I play and we lose, what good does that do
anyone here?''
</P>
<P>
   Martin clarified, however, that he wasn't volunteering to step
aside, just saying that he would accept Gullikson's decision
without hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Courier has indicated the same. ``There's no time for any
awkward feelings,'' he said. ``It's time to go out and try to win
three matches before the Australians do.''

WASHINGTON AWAITS BARAK WITH HIGH HOPES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (See also ISRAEL-MRSCLINTON) 
(rk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Buoyed, almost to the point of ebullience by the
prospect of fresh momentum with the new Israeli prime minister,
Ehud Barak, President Clinton and his foreign policy advisers hope
that his visit will be the opening chapter of a comprehensive
Middle East peace settlement that will culminate near the end of
Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of a number of factors, including Barak's quest
for peace with both the Syrians and the Palestinians and the
apparent willingness of Arab leaders to come to the table, have
convinced the administration that it can capitalize on a rare
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Not least in these calculations is the driving interest of
Clinton, after three years of frustration with the former Israeli
leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, to cap his White House career with a
sweeping peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, attending a fund-raising event in Miami Beach on
Tuesday night, admitted as much, saying he was ``eager as a kid
with a new toy'' to welcome Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, expressed
enthusiasm for Barak's interest in the Palestinians, Syria and
Lebanon, saying, ``We want to close the circle of peace in the
Middle East and we want to do it expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts on the Middle East agree that the opportunities for
a settlement are better than they have been. But some caution that
the administration in its eagerness for a deal between Israel and
Syria may be giving short shrift to working out security
arrangements with President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assad is willing to get the Golan Heights back but what is he
willing to pay for that?' in terms of depth of withdrawal of the
Syrian army and other strategic arrangements, asked Robert Satloff,
the executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has also demonstrated that he intends to live up to his
reputation of being his own man. Just before leaving for
Washington, Barak said he wanted the United States to play a
reduced role in the Israeli-Palestinian relationship.
</P>
<P>
   He singled out what he said was the overly intrusive role of the
CIA in monitoring security matters in the Gaza Strip, a task
assigned at the American brokered land for security deal concluded
last fall in Wye, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insisted Wednesday that Barak's
criticism was not unexpected, although the bluntness of its
delivery on the eve of his visit appeared to set some in the
administration on edge.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the American involvement in the
intricacies of enforcing agreements between the Israelis and the
Palestinians was a product of the poor relationship between
Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. The intrusion
could be adjusted easily in the new atmosphere, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's high anticipation for Barak is framed in
part by the historic goals he has set and by what one senior
administration official called the new Israeli leader's desire ``to
break the mold.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessors, Barak was prepared, the official said,
to persuade the Israeli public that it should swallow ``two
wrenching, traumatic decisions'' _ on the shape of a Palestinian
entity and a deal with Syria _ that would determine the future of
Israel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Senior administration officials also are intrigued by the man
himself, whom they do not know well. But they have some glimmers.
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's advisers on the Middle East who knows Barak
from his days as head of Israeli military intelligence and then as
army chief of staff, said that the administration held few
illusions about the kind of peace he was seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man who is tough, curious and also wants to make
peace for his soldiers,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Clinton are scheduled to meet for three hours alone at
the White House residence Thursday afternoon without aides or a
note-taker, according to administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   At that encounter, the president expects to learn how Barak
wants to proceed with negotiations, his advisers said. One of the
key questions here, will be the timetable that Barak envisions and
how the two leaders can mesh their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In his election campaign, for example, Barak told the Israeli
voters that he wanted to get Israeli soldiers out of southern
Lebanon within a year, a pledge that proved popular. Getting the
soldiers out of southern Lebanon is wrapped into the overall
negotiations with the Syrian leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian leader has said twice since Barak's election that he
was prepared to enter into talks with the Israelis, and his foreign
ministry said recently a settlement could be completed in ``a
matter of months.''
</P>
<P>
   In a May letter to Arafat, Clinton set a one-year target for
what are known as final status negotiations on security, territory
and the disposition of Jerusalem. Clinton also wrote that the
United States was prepared within six months of the Israeli
elections to convene a summit meeting for those negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is expected to lay out his ideas on the implementation of
the Wye memorandum, which the Clinton administration is anxious to
see fulfilled but which Barak has indicated may need a slower pace.
</P>
<P>
   In tune with Barak's insistence that the United States step back
from the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, a State Department
official said that Clinton was likely to tell Barak that Washington
would be on hand to diminish the pain of tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak, the five-day visit also entails meeting the American
Jewish organizations and Congress. He is spending less time with
both than some would like. Netanyahu courted these two
constituencies. In contrast, Barak's schedule appears to show
polite deference.
</P>
<P>
   He will meet with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee,
the major lobbying organization in Washington and in New York with
the Israel Policy Forum, a more liberal group and with the
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will stay at Blair House. He and his wife, Nava, are to be
whisked to Camp David on Thursday night for dinner with Clinton and
his wife, Hillary. On Sunday night, about 400 people have been
invited to a White House dinner, a signal that after Netanyahu, the
relationship between Clinton and the Israeli prime minister is back
on track, White House aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is scheduled to meet with the director of central
intelligence, George Tenet, as well as with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, and the
national security adviser, Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
   One outcome of Barak's visit is expected to be a visit by
Albright to the Middle East in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to fly,'' said one of the administration's
senior officials. ``I still find it hard to see Assad and Barak on
the White House lawn but it's coming.''

SPORTS COLUMN: IN SPITE OF ITSELF, THE GRAND OLD GAME CONTINUES TO
THRIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major League Baseball is a survivor. In spite of itself. No
matter how hard officials and owners and lawyers and players try to
undermine its foundation, the game rises above all.
</P>
<P>
   After the devastating labor dispute ended in 1995, Cal Ripken's
remarkable run at Lou Gehrig's consecutive-game streak captivated
the nation's baseball fans and triggered the game's comeback from
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa ignited a booster rocket
of a home run record race that thrust the game onto a higher plane,
capturing the attention of people who weren't even casual fans.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball did not plan either one of those dynamic attractions.
It did plan the festivities that preceded Tuesday night's All-Star
Game, but officials could not have anticipated what became an
indelible memory for anyone who saw it or experienced it. Then
again, as Branch Rickey said, luck is the residue of design.
</P>
<P>
   The spontaneous reaction of 31 former superstars and nearly 60
current all-stars in gravitating toward and crowding closely around
Ted Williams at the Fenway Park pitching mound was one of the most
remarkable scenes baseball, or any sport, will ever see.
</P>
<P>
   Every team should show on its scoreboard before each game the
Fenway lovefest, tears and all. The tape can only be inspirational.
</P>
<P>
   As teams resume their pursuit of division championships or
wild-card spots Thursday night, many can use inspiration. Most can
use additional pitching. Where playoff spots are undecided (that
excludes the American League East and Central and, with apologies
to the Mets, the National League East), pitching will most likely
determine the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Few teams have enough pitching, either in their starting
rotations or in their bullpens, and the needy teams will spend the
next two weeks competing for the established starters who might be
available before the July 31 deadline for trades without waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Those teams in need could only watch with envy an All-Star Game
in which the best hitters in both leagues collected a meager total
of 13 hits, including only two for extra bases. Not only didn't
anyone hit the small ``win $1 million'' sign attached to the fair
side of the right field pole, but no one also was able to hit the
much bigger left field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that friendly, inviting monster of a wall reared its fangs
and frightened the hitters away. It's as if they gave a party for
the best hitters and put on the invitation not BYOB but leave your
bats at home.
</P>
<P>
   After the 21-run, 31-hit slugfest they staged at _ where else? _
Coors Field in Denver a year ago, the all-star hitters hit no home
runs in the 4-1 American League victory for the first time since
the 1990 game. One guess where that one was played. Wrigley Field
in Chicago, like Fenway, a place where home runs are expected to
fly.
</P>
<P>
   But the pitchers, beginning with the indomitable Pedro Martinez,
dominated the Boston game, striking out a nine-inning record 22
batters. One thing about an All-Star Game: second-line pitchers
need not apply. That's the difference between that game and the
ones that will be played the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The contenders will have to use their third, fourth and fifth
starters, not just their first and second ones. That's why most of
them will investigate the possibility of acquiring established
starters like Kevin Appier of Kansas City, Kenny Rogers of Oakland,
Chuck Finley of Anaheim, Livan Hernandez of Florida, Scott Erickson
of Baltimore, Justin Thompson of Detroit, Darryl Kile of Colorado,
Ismael Valdes of Los Angeles, maybe even Andy Pettitte of the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams would like to try for Curt Schilling of Philadelphia
and David Wells of Toronto, but those teams have discovered they
are close enough in the wild-card race to retain the people they
have.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians don't need another starter to win their
division, but they do want another good one for their inevitable
post-season series against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who thought the Atlanta Braves might need another
starter or two, be advised that the deaths of Greg Maddux and Tom
Glavine have been prematurely reported. Maddux and Glavine live,
having solved their earlier problems, and they will show their
resuscitated arms at Yankee Stadium Thursday and Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   If their revival holds for the next 2 1/2 months, the Mets will
realize they squandered the chance they had in the first 2 1/2
months when the Braves' stars had lost their luster. The Mets have
to hope their own starters will become generally more effective the
rest of the season. They need more than Al Leiter to pitch
consistently beyond the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds, in a surprising dogfight with the Houston
Astros in the NL Central, have targeted 32 pitchers as the pool
from which they hope to acquire one.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds better improve if they want to stay with Houston.
Beginning Thursday night, the Astros will have their own form of
inspiration. Their manager, Larry Dierker, returns one month after
brain surgery following a massive dugout seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he thought he would deal with the emotions of his
return, Dierker said Wednesday: ``I think if they do a big ovation
when I come out with the lineup card, that might get to me a little
bit. But by the time we get rolling, it will be like opening day as
the starting pitcher. You get into the game and you forget it's
opening day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won't soon forget Dierker's return. All of baseball
won't soon forget the Ted Williams phenomenon.

RICHARD SIMMONS BACK ON DAYTIME TV WITH `DREAM MAKER' SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ To be honest, it wasn't a dream come true.
Scrambled eggs with Richard Simmons has never been on my big to-do
list. But it's July in Pasadena, where sidewalks are hotter than a
habanero and TV critics can't be choosy about their dining
companions, lest they miss out on the next trend in television
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons hopes the next big idea is embodied in his return to
daytime TV with ``Richard Simmons' Dream Maker,'' an hourlong
wish-fulfillment party that's part ``Queen for a Day,'' part ``This
Is Your Life'' and all maudlin. Beginning this fall, ``Dream
Maker'' will surprise people by granting them their fondest wishes,
from a lavish wedding ceremony to an audience with the pope to help
with in vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   That would be financial help, by the way. Simmons promises
nothing salacious, nothing unseemly. ``There's too much negativity
in television,'' he said, ``This is `Touched by an Angel' _ with
gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a dream can reach the show at www.rsdreammaker.com,
or by conventional mail at P.O. Box 4344, Hollywood, CA 90078.
</P>
<P>
   _ Simmons was the first but hardly the last to dump on Jerry
Springer, the early favorite as most popular whipping boy at this
three-week-long series of press briefings. Wednesday's sessions
were all about new syndicated programming, and the message was as
obvious as a chair across the face: ``Springer bad, we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one mentioned Springer specifically. But everyone
seems eager to suggest that the industry is gradually springing
back from Jerry's bungee jump into the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Radio psychologist Joy Browne, for instance, hopes to fix
problems, not create them, in her new daytime TV show, ``Dr. Joy
Browne,'' also airing this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an unrepentant do-gooder,'' said Browne, who will continue
with her radio show, ``and I really do think there is an
opportunity to show real people how to run their lives better. By
digging a little deeper than television is used to going, I think
we can show you human beings at their most intense, their most
interesting, and hopefully entertain the daylights out of you,
mesmerize you and maybe even educate you.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Louie Anderson hasn't set the bar quite so high. Right out of
the box, the new host of the latest incarnation of ``Family Feud,''
said, ``Richard Simmons is doing a show making dreams come true. So
is he going to get hit by a car in the first episode?''
</P>
<P>
   The sarcastic comedian said initially he wasn't interested in
hosting a game show. ``I wasn't really in the mood,'' he said,
``but I always liked the show. I loved Richard Dawson kissing those
Midwesterners on the lips. It's the most asked question I get. Am I
going to kiss people? Absolutely not. I'll bring them out a snack,
shake their hand, give them a big hug, but there'll be no
kissing.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his expectations, Anderson was more succinct. ``It's got
to be better than some of the s--- I see on TV.''

 &HT;    Less strong, Yanks still dangerous
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves might not be
the best teams in baseball this time around. Unlike last year,
neither is threatening its franchise record for victories.
</P>
<P>
   But the two teams, who start a three-game set in New York today,
still are on pace to reach the neighborhood of 100 victories. It's
just that a few other teams are also joining in. The Braves set a
franchise record with 106 victories last season, while the Yankees
set an American League record for regular-season victories with 114
and swept to their second World Series title in three years.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Braves' starting pitching has been vulnerable.
The Yankees' defense has been wobbly at times, and their lineup has
failed to put up the kind of production it provided last season.
While the Braves cruised into the break winners of eight of their
last 11, the Yankees enter the series having lost five of their
previous eight, including two of three to the Braves' National
League East nemesis, the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've certainly seen what kind of success we've had against
the Mets,'' Chipper Jones said. ``And if they're beating the
Yankees, we obviously have a very good chance to beat the Yankees.
We've got to do it in their back yard, but we've played pretty well
there.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the Braves are ready to fly high if they win
this three-game series in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fall's a long way off,'' Jones said. ``Perfect example is
Cincinnati. They came in here and stunk up the place, and now
they're probably the hottest team in baseball, a team you don't
want to be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees still rank second among American League pitching
staffs with a 4.31 ERA, behind the 4.01 of the Red Sox. The Braves
are first in the National League with a 3.82 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are in the middle of the American League in batting
average at .278 but have the second-best on-base percentage in
baseball at .363. The Braves are ranked near the bottom of the
National League with a .265 batting average but are fourth in both
home runs and total bases.
</P>
<P>
   It should make for an interesting series. The Yankees are still
the defending World Series champion and a team the Braves will
gauge themselves by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' Jones said.

 &HT;    Groups question Coca-Cola's legal tactics
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition Inc. and several other
groups are urging Coca-Cola Co. not to use any ``legal loopholes''
that prematurely undercut plaintiffs' ability to seek class-action
status for their racial discrimination suit against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Both Coca-Cola and attorneys for the four plaintiffs will be in
U.S. District Court in Atlanta today to argue a key issue _ whether
to eliminate the chance of the case ever becoming a class action.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that they are taking ``no position on the merits
of the case,'' the signees of the letter sent to The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution late Wednesday by the Chicago-based
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition urged Coca-Cola to ``abandon the search for
a legal loophole. This seminal case should not be dismissed before
it even starts.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, who plan to seek class-action status, allege a
companywide practice of discrimination against African-American
employees in pay, promotion and performance evaluations. Coca-Cola
denies the allegations. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages
and a court order forbidding further alleged discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The company argues there are too many individual facts and
circumstances among existing and prospective plaintiffs for the
case to be handled as one lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The soft drink company also argues that the plaintiffs have
improperly asked for substantial monetary damages and, at the same
time, a court order requiring Coca-Cola to change its employment
practices. As a result, the company said, the judge should also
dismiss the class-action portion of the suit on those grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorneys say they can seek both remedies
simultaneously. They also argue that no ruling on class action
should occur before the discovery phase of the case _ during which
both sides exchange information _ is completed. The company
recently handed over about 15,000 documents, plus a computerized
employment database, to the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition says Coca-Cola has adopted ``an extreme legal
theory'' in arguing that class-action relief is inappropriate when
plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages. It said such a position
``threatens to foreclose most employment discrimination
class-action lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Rob Baskin said the company doesn't believe
that its position is ``extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coca-Cola Co. is not seeking to deny access to the courts
for anybody,'' Baskin said. ``In this case, the plaintiffs simply
have not met the requirements for class action.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter from the coalition, signed by representatives of four
organizations, says individual plaintiffs seldom can afford to take
on companies as large as Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why the class-action mechanism is necessary, to give
the little guy a chance against a transnational giant like
Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter further states: ``Coca-Cola maintains an image as a
good corporate citizen, committed to fair play and equal
opportunity. Nevertheless, its legal position contradicts that
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us is yet in a position to judge whether Coca-Cola has
discriminated,'' the letter says. ``If there has been
discrimination, let the plaintiffs get about proving it.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter is signed by Janice L. Mathis, general counsel of
Rainbow/PUSH; Roxanne Gregory, general counsel of the Southern
Christian Leadership Council; Ron Daniels, executive director of
the Center for Constitutional Rights; and David E. Honig, executive
director of the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council.

MINIMUM RULES FOR MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Senate is engaging in a debate over managed care
regulation that has more to do with preelection positioning than
reasonable policy making. If senators want to write a bill that
adequately protects patients without being too costly, it should:
</P>
<P>
   --Mandate a strong appeals process, both internal and external,
to protect the patient from arbitrary decisions against essential
care. The rules should stress speed of decision and give the
external appeals group broad authority to decide what is in the
patient's best interests.
</P>
<P>
   --Allow access to specialists for patients with chronic
conditions and insure that even if a company changes plans, such
patients would continue to receive care from the same doctor.
</P>
<P>
   --Mandate coverage of emergency room visits whenever someone has
reason to believe he or she has an urgent and unexpected medical
need. The attending doctors should be in charge and should face no
barriers in communicating with patients.
</P>
<P>
   --Cover everyone who belongs to a health plan in the country,
not just those who have coverage under the federal law that
regulates pensions. Managed care as an industry transcends state
lines, and all plan members ought to benefit from federal
protections.
</P>
<P>
   A bill with all these protections need not include a section
that allows plans to be sued for denying care. If doctors are in
charge and are free to communicate with their patients about what
is best for them, if specialist care is available, and if the
appeals process is strong, patients will almost always get the
medical treatment they need when it can do them some good. They or
their heirs will feel no necessity to go to court for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of a bill with these provisions and nothing more
emerging from Congress this year is exceedingly small. Managed care
is not going to go away. A stripped-down but strong bill to
regulate the plans and protect the patients awaits passage in a
less partisan atmosphere.

MCKESSON SETS COSTLY CHARGES IN RESTATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (af) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   McKesson HBOC Inc. said Wednesday that it would slice $327.4
million from its revenue for the last three fiscal years to correct
accounting irregularities at HBO and Co., a software maker it
acquired in January.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in San Francisco, also said that it
would have to cut $191.5 million from its income from continued
operations for the last three fiscal years. And McKesson said that
it would not meet analysts' earnings expectations of 49 cents per
share for the first quarter, which ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson said it earned $84.9 million after special items, or 31
cents a share, in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999, down from
its original report of $237.1 million, or 84 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``With McKesson, it just goes to prove the theory that where
there's one roach, there is always more,'' said Michael Krensavage,
an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman. ``You get a handle on one
problem and then another roach comes out from under the cabinet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McKesson first announced in late April that it would
have to restate its sales and earnings, causing its stock to fall
48 percent, investors and many analysts had no idea the problems
would be so costly or the ills at HBO so troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   The company had first said in early May that it had found $42.1
million in sales from its HBO unit that had been improperly booked.
Yet, as McKesson's audit committee continued its work, it became
more apparent that the discrepancies in some of HBO's accounts were
deliberate attempts to inflate that company's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Alan Seelenfreund, McKesson's nonexecutive chairman,
said the accounting improprieties were intentionally kept from the
due diligence process when McKesson acquired HBO, a deal valued at
$13.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The problems prompted McKesson to oust several of its top
executives, including its chairman, Charles McCall, and Albert
Bergonzi, the president of McKesson's Information Technology
Business unit, what had once been HBO. Mark Pulido, McKesson's
chief executive, and Richard Hawkins, the chief financial officer,
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even with those headlines, analysts were surprised by the
amount of McKesson's restatement. Of the $327.4 million cut in
revenue, $245.8 million was sliced from 1999's tally, $48.4 million
from 1998, and $33.2 million from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The company reduced its 1999 net income by $152.2 million, or 53
cents a share; 1998's earnings by $25.8 million, or nine cents a
share, and 1997's total by $13.5 million, or 5 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the scope of the restatement, it's amazing,''
said Christopher McFadden, an analyst with First Union Capital
Markets. ``This really shows the problem at HBO was systematic. For
the investors, though, there's really no recourse.''
</P>
<P>
   McKesson announced its restatement figures late Wednesday
afternoon, after the close of trading. Earlier shares of McKesson
had declined $2.0625 to close at $31.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of McKesson's announcement Wednesday, however, was bad.
The company noted that of the $327.4 million in revenue that was
lowered, $160 million of it would be recognized as revenue during
the next several years. While acknowledging that approximately $50
million of those revenue were likely to be unrecoverable, McKesson
said that the remaining $115 million may be eventually recognized
as revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted Monday that while McKesson's HBO unit has a
credibility problem _ primarily along Wall Street _ there did not
appear to be a problem in the fundamentals of the division.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even with the restatement of its earnings, McKesson may
still have repercussions from the problems at HBO. The company said
Wednesday that the U. S. attorney's Office for the northern
district of California and the Securities and Exchange Commission
have started investigations.
</P>
<P>
   And the company may be in for more heat from Wall Street. As
part of its proxy statement, McKesson reported Wednesday that
Pulido's employment agreement would be honored through March 31,
2004. On top of a base salary of $850,000, Pulido also receives
lifetime coverage under McKesson's executive medical plan, office
space and secretarial support.

   Even for the person who longs to ``get away from it all,'' the
South Pole would be too much. Conditions are so harsh at the bottom
of the world that a visitor is trapped on the ice for all but three
months of the year. No planes can land from mid-February to
mid-October: The place is in darkness, with winds howling at 60
miles per hour and temperatures averaging 80 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
   It was here last month that a woman on a National Science
Foundation research project discovered a lump in her breast. It was
here this week that an Air Force cargo plane swooped low into the
maelstrom, after an eight-hour flight from New Zealand, to drop
medicine and equipment by parachute so the woman could begin
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force personnel had a doctor on board in case anyone
suffered frostbite or hypothermia during the few minutes the cargo
door opened. On the ground, the 41 scientists and staff at the
National Science Foundation's Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station
raced to haul in the crates before the contents froze _ a window of
5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The drama focuses the civilized world on the conveniences it
takes for granted and on the fortitude of researchers who give them
up to study in one of the most inhospitable places on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation has three research stations in
Antarctica, where 650 scientists study the depleting ozone, the
melting icecap, the migration patterns of penguins, plate
tectonics, and the secrets of the cosmos. While most researchers do
their work in the summer (November through January), when
temperatures soar to a balmy 10 below zero, a hard core of fewer
than 300 people tough out the winters.
</P>
<P>
   They face not only isolation _ communication is by satellite a
few hours a day _ but risk their lives for their work. In January
an Indian researcher suffered a stroke and was evacuated in
still-decent weather, but two years ago in May a heart attack
victim died at McMurdo Station.
</P>
<P>
   That's dedication. So was this week's air drop. We salute both _
from the warmth and relative ease of a Boston summer.

UNFINISHED BUSINESS IN SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took the better part of a decade for Western leaders to
realize that the primary source of the four Balkan wars in the
1990s was Slobodan Milosevic. Now, after all the blunders and
miscalculations that preceded the war for Kosovo, Washington and
the NATO allies would like to cauterize the cause of so much
suffering and instability.
</P>
<P>
   Their justified postwar goal is to get rid of Milosevic, but
their dilemma is that they may lack the means to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   At present, as thousands demonstrate against Milosevic in towns
and cities across Serbia, the Clinton administration is waging
simultaneous overt and covert campaigns to have him removed from
power. There have been contacts not only with members of the
democratic opposition in Serbia but also with restive members of
the regime and disgruntled army officers.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, Time magazine reported, President Clinton signed
a presidential finding authorizing the CIA to take measures to
bring down Milosevic, including financial help for those in his
government who might turn against him and efforts to locate his
bank accounts abroad and have agency computer specialists divert
their contents to CIA accounts. Also, the US Information Agency has
installed six radio transmitters around Serbia to counter
Milosevic's propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   These schemes to topple Milosevic reflect a wish to avoid the
error made when Washington failed to help the popular uprising in
Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein in the spring of 1991. The
difference is that millions of Iraqis then were ready to risk their
lives to overthrow their tyrant. The Serb opposition to Milosevic,
by contrast, is notoriously soft, unarmed, and divided.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Milosevic suddenly loses his will to rule, the petty,
quarreling leaders of the civilian opposition will have a hard time
supplanting his regime. Nevertheless, the reign of Milosevic has
brought one calamity after another upon Serbs, and they will have
to be the ones to bring about his demise _ so that they may receive
Western funds to rebuild Serbia, end their isolation, and overcome
the shame of his crimes against humanity.

`JAWS' IN A POND _ WHAT A CROCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too often, light summer entertainment can be divided into two
categories: unintentionally dumb (''Wild Wild West'') and
intentionally dumb, which applies to ``Lake Placid.'' Your
enjoyment of the latter depends on your willingness to check your
brain at the box office, and on your ability to prevent your brain
from returning while you're watching the movie. With that in mind,
here's a review that is as by-the-numbers as this film:
</P>
<P>
   1) Although Lake Placid was written by David E. Kelley, who's
currently hot thanks to TV's consistently satisfying ``The
Practice'' and infuriatingly erratic ``Ally McBeal,'' it doesn't
address the ethical or sexual questions that have helped make
Kelley such a big deal. Instead, it addresses the question of what
to do with a 30-foot-long crocodile that has somehow made its way
into a Maine lake. It's also such a brazen ``Jaws'' rip-off that it
even borrows from the famous score; any friendship Kelley has with
Steven Spielberg should be tested by this.
</P>
<P>
   2) It's directed by Steve Miner, whose hack record ranges from
the first ``Friday the 13th'' (not nearly as bad as its reputation
might lead you to believe) to ``Halloween H20,'' one of the worst
movies of 1998. ``Placid'' is a step up from ``H20,'' which is sort
of like saying that 95 degrees is a more comfortable temperature
than 100. It's not one of this year's worst movies, but it may be
the silliest.
</P>
<P>
   3) Bridget Fonda is listed as the lead actress, and that sure
looks like her on screen, but her mannerisms are all Calista
Flockhart's _ she's become Ally McFonda. She even appears to have
lost weight for the role, and Fonda didn't have that much weight to
lose. Because this is Kelley's revisionist-feminist universe of
thin women we're talking about here, Fonda plays a beautiful New
York paleontologist who is sent to investigate a croc attack to get
her out of the way of the other beautiful paleontologist who stole
Fonda's middle-aged boyfriend. At least Fonda gets along with the
beautiful sheriff's deputy in Maine, but c'mon _ where's Camryn
Manheim when you need her?
</P>
<P>
   4) Bill Pullman, who alternates between interesting failures
(''The End of Violence, Zero Effect'') and calculated successes,
gives a bland performance as a fish-and-game warden. Pullman
appears to be playing a variation on ``Jaws' '' Roy Scheider
character, but he's closer to another Kelley creation _ Tom
Skerritt's ``Picket Fences'' sheriff, a guy who would've found a
30-foot crocodile to be a minor annoyance rather than a major
terror.
</P>
<P>
   5) Character actors Oliver Platt (''Bulworth''), as an eccentric
... crocophile, and Brendan Gleeson (''The General''), as a local
sheriff, provide most of the movie's most amusing moments with
their nonstop bickering. Their characters appear to be variations
of ``Jaws' '' Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw roles, although it's
often hard to tell who's playing whom.
</P>
<P>
   6) Betty White appears as a lakeside resident who knows more
about the croc than she's willing to let on. This twist on White's
offscreen animal activism is a much more clever joke than her
foul-mouthed dialogue. Could we please have a moratorium on
profanity-spouting matrons?
</P>
<P>
   7) ``Lake Placid'' has moments of gore that might put off more
sensitive viewers, although if they brave a peek at the screen
they'll discover special effects so hokey that they're more likely
to laugh than cringe.
</P>
<P>
   8) The movie runs a scant 82 minutes, a posterior-friendly
running time that still might make you wonder whether a reel was
missing. Not that it would be noticeable if one was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Placid'' is rated R for violence, gore and strong
language.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Placid 2 on a scale of 1-5
</P>
<P>
   Director: Steve Miner
</P>
<P>
   Stars: Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman
</P>
<P>
   Length: 82 min.
</P>
<P>
   Rated: R

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time, the federal government is
acknowledging that nuclear weapons production during the Cold War
may have caused illnesses in thousands of workers, and the Clinton
administration will announce on Thursday legislation that will
compensate many of them for their medical care and lost wages.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson detailed the legislation
Wednesday in an interview, during which he depicted the workers as
victims of the Cold War and the rush to produce nuclear weapons. He
said that the safety standards, which have evolved since the 1940s,
had been established in good faith, but had since been deemed too
weak to have protected workers.
</P>
<P>
   The workers suffered from cancers and lung diseases after
exposure to beryllium, asbestos, mercury, uranium and other
materials, under safety standards set by the Energy Department and
its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am reversing a policy of denial of compensation,''
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the workers who had actually operated the
government factories were almost all employees of private
contractors and thus were not eligible for the workers'
compensation program that applies to federal employees. And they
were usually unable to collect under state programs because those
were designed for injuries, not occupational illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Energy Department workers at the plants have fallen
ill and have collected workers' compensation, said department
officials, but that compensation program is run by the Department
of Labor on a no-fault basis, requiring only a determination that
the employee was exposed at work. The Energy Department has never
acknowledged the cause of their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration will send legislation to Congress
within weeks proposing compensation for victims of beryllium
disease, a clear-cut case because the weapons program is almost the
only user of beryllium.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials have estimated that compensation for
those exposed to beryllium, some of whom suffer from a chronic,
incurable, obstructive lung disease, will be about $15 million a
year at its peak in a few years, when all those eligible are
expected to have applied. Officials estimate that 500 to 1,000
people have beryllium disease or will develop it. Their
compensation would depend on their lost wages and the extent of
their disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   An undetermined number of families would be eligible to collect
benefits for deceased workers.
</P>
<P>
   The government also will study how to compensate people exposed
to asbestos and radioactive materials. Radiation poses a particular
challenge, because it causes diseases like leukemia and cancers
that also have other causes, and the amount of radiation needed to
cause a disease is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved in the formation of the policy said that
the Energy Department had originally favored including people
exposed to radiation and other threats, but that the White House
had demanded further study. Clinton is expected to announce on
Thursday that the National Economic Council will lead an
interagency study, to be completed by April, on whether other
illnesses should be included.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., has been seeking help for men who
had worked for a company processing beryllium in his district, in
the northeastern area of the state. He said that including exposure
to other hazards might double the cost, to about $30 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Kanjorski said the action represented a major shift in Energy
Department policy. ``It's unique in terms of the department's
normal mode of operating; it wasn't a knee-jerk `No, find ways to
defend against it,' '' Kanjorski said.
</P>
<P>
   The workers are mostly men in their 50s or older who spent
decades in skilled blue-collar employment, from the World War II
Manhattan Project to the present.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,000 workers have already been screened, and at least
5,000 more will be, according to department officials, with
hundreds showing job-related health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Some work or worked at plants, like Oak Ridge in Tennessee, that
date from the World War II effort to build the bomb, others worked
or still work at the Nevada Test Site, near Las Vegas; the Hanford
nuclear reservation, in Washington state; Rocky Flats, near Denver;
the Idaho National Environmental Engineering Laboratory, near Idaho
Springs; Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, and the
Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical &AMP; Energy Workers
International Union, which includes the former Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers union, Richard Miller, a policy analyst, said that
Richardson had ``done an enormous public service by admitting the
department has made people sick in the process of making nuclear
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the White House should have moved immediately to
compensate those made ill by other agents besides beryllium.
</P>
<P>
   Under the administration proposal, people exposed to beryllium
would apply for compensation as if they were federal employees. As
with the state programs, federal workers' compensation limits
payments to medical costs and lost wages; punitive damages are not
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the state systems, the federal system has no statute
of limitations. Kanjorski, for example, said that the Pennsylvania
program required filing within 300 weeks _ about six years _ but
that some people had not developed symptoms in that period. Some
states allow for damages only for people who have missed work,
department officials said, while some victims have incurred medical
costs but are still well enough to work. Other states do not allow
people to file for greater levels of disability as their diseases
progress. And most cap payments for lost wages at well below what
the employees were paid.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Matusick of West Hazleton, Pa., said he began having lung
problems within two months of beginning work at the Beryllium
Corp., in Ashmore, where he worked from 1957 until it closed in
1981. Now, said Matusick, he gets up several times each night to
take cough medicine, and cannot carry a grocery bag or walk more
than a few yards without strain. ``Any little bit of exertion
knocks the heck out of you,'' said Matusick, now 67.
</P>
<P>
   Matusick, who over the years operated furnaces, inspected
beryllium products and did other jobs at the plant, thought of
leaving. ``But where else was I going to go?'' he said. ``Nobody
else would hire you if they took X-rays of your lungs, or they
found out that you worked for the Beryllium Corp.'' He appealed to
Kanjorski for help.  &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Andrew Singleton, a 15-year-old from Denver,
listened to the impassioned oratory on both sides of the gun
control debate in Congress, but he said Wednesday that he seldom
got the sense that the orators understood anything about his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to 15 funerals this year,'' Singleton said,
explaining that all of those people were killed by gunfire, and
many were relatives. None, he said, rated the kind of television
news coverage given to the slayings at Columbine High School in
Littleton, a Denver suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they've all been in the back of newspapers _ in mortuary
ads,'' he said.

said that they, too, wondered if lawmakers truly appreciated the
devastation wrought by gun violence, which they experienced
firsthand as freshmen at Columbine when the shots rang out on April
20 in the shooting that left 15 dead, including the two killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran for our lives,'' Erin said, ``and we lost friends that
we'll never see again.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurel added, ``It hurts so much, and it's not OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The three teen-agers were among a group of about 95 high school
students from the Denver area, including six from Littleton, who
flew to Washington Wednesday and descended on the Capitol to meet
lawmakers and make a case for the kinds of more stringent
restrictions on firearms that Congress has yet to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers said in interviews that they came because the
deaths in Littleton chilled and haunted them; because their
proximity to that killing, in terms of their addresses and their
ages, might give their viewpoints a special clout; because they
wanted to add their voices to the debate, and because they needed
to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   They understood that gun control laws alone were no guarantee of
safer schools, more tranquil streets and fewer killings, they said.
But, they asked, why not try?
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing concerns that such regulations trampled on the Second
Amendment of the Constitution, Rosa Chavez, 17, of Lakewood, Colo.,
asked: ``What's more important: the right for people to bear arms,
or the right of people not to be killed?''
</P>
<P>
   Their visit, conceived as a kind of ``children's march'' on
Washington, was planned by a Colorado gun control advocacy group,
Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic, that was founded in the
aftermath of the Littleton slayings.
</P>
<P>
   That group's president, John Head, a Denver lawyer, ran into two
concerned students from Denver at a conference on children and
violence just a few weeks ago and asked them if they could bring
together a group. Those students, Ben Gelt, 18, and David Winkler,
17, succeeded in drafting nearly 100 of their peers, most of whom
pitched in $250 to supplement the donations that paid for the bulk
of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers have separate audiences on Thursday with both
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. But it is hard to
imagine that either encounter will prove as interesting as a
meeting they had late this afternoon with Rep. Scott McInnis,
R-Colo.
</P>
<P>
   When two competing proposals to require mandatory background
checks on all firearms buyers at gun shows came before the House
last month, McInnis voted for the significantly more lenient
measure. The students are well aware of this, and none too pleased
about it.
</P>
<P>
   They initially held their tongues as they sat on the steps of
the Capitol and listened to McInnis praise them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to sleep every night and I sleep very well when I think
about your generation,'' McInnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Then several of the students grilled him on his vote.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis explained that new laws were not magic bullets, and that
existing laws needed to be better enforced, so that those who
acquired guns illegally felt the sting of touching a hot burner and
learned their lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you turn off the burner, nobody gets hurt,'' said
Jessica Garrett, 16, of Denver, who was arguing that guns be made
less accessible before _ not after _ they were used to injure or
kill people.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis said that lawmakers needed to make sure that they did
not deprive law-abiding citizens of guns. ``I have the right to
protect myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica responded, ``If there weren't violent people with guns,
you wouldn't have to protect yourself.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The students planned to spend an hour or two Thursday afternoon
lobbying lawmakers and said they might even approach the Republican
leaders who would soon be appointing negotiators to reconcile a
Senate juvenile crime bill that contained a strict provision on
sales at gun shows with a House bill that contained no gun control
at all.
</P>
<P>
   All four guns used at Columbine were purchased without
background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The students said that stricter gun control laws would surely
lessen the prevalence of firearms in general.
</P>
<P>
   Of eight students who sat down for an extended interview, six
said they had seen, in their high schools, guns that were not
supposed to be there. Three said that they had had guns pointed at
them, although not at school. One of them, Rosa Chavez, said that
the memory of that experience filled her with anger at lawmakers'
inaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing for them to say they sympathize with our
pain,'' she said. ``It's quite another thing to look down a gun
barrel and think maybe you're going to die.''

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on Wednesday showed they were calling
the shots in the Senate's managed care debate, approving their own
measure on hospitalization for women undergoing mastectomies, and
beating back three more Democratic efforts to strengthen the rights
of patients.
</P>
<P>
   In near party line votes, the Republicans defeated the
Democrats' second attempt in two days to broaden the bill to apply
to all 161 million Americans with private health insurance. The
Senate also killed a measure to ensure patients access to
specialists, and it blocked the Democrats' attempt to require
health plans to cover the costs for clinical trials of experimental
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican unity presented a sharp contrast to the party's
disarray on gun control earlier this spring when the majority party
could not stop Democratic measures from passing. The Republican
leaders held their members in line by making sure that they had
their own proposals on the most emotional issues in the debate over
how to regulate the managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   So a day after defeating a broader Democratic amendment on
women's health measures, the Republicans passed, 55-45, their own
measure to keep insurance companies from forcing mastectomies to be
conducted on an out-patient basis.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republicans on Wednesday introduced a multi-part measure
to guarantee patients emergency room care, as well as access to
specialists and to obstetricians and gynecologists. The action came
after they defeated broader Democratic versions of the same
provisions that would have covered far more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to come up with a good bill,'' said Sen. Bill
Frist, R-Tenn., attributing the Republicans' success to their
willingness to revisit some issues. ``It's working,'' he said.
``That's why we're getting people to stick together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats charged that the Republicans were simply seeking
political protection. Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader, said:
``Yesterday they voted wrong. Today they saw what they did and I
guarantee you they're going to come back today and try to cover
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who were responsible for forcing the Senate to
consider the issue of regulating managed care, stepped up their
efforts to show how their version of the legislation known as the
Patients' Bill of Rights differed from the rival Republican plan.
And they drew support from various doctors' groups.
</P>
<P>
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists came out
in opposition to a Republican amendment giving women direct access
to obstetricians, saying that ``it removes barriers to obstetrical
care while erecting new barriers to follow up care.'' And Doctor
Thomas R. Reardon, the president of the American Medical
Association, appeared at a news conference with a handful of House
Republicans who are doctors and dentists to condemn the Senate vote
Tuesday night against a Democratic plan to give doctors, not
insurance companies, the say over what treatment is medically
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, shouting at times, Sen. Edward Kennedy said
that many of the Republicans' protections were extended only to the
48 million people who get their insurance from large companies with
self-funded plans. Such plans fall solely under federal and not
state regulation, and are often older-style, fee-for-service plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These reforms are supposed to protect patients against HMOs
and insurance companies,'' said Kennedy, D-Mass. ``But people with
insurance coverage with HMOs are not covered by the Republican
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., asked Kennedy how
many New Yorkers would be covered by the Republican bill. ``Four
out of five of the citizens of New York will not be covered under
the Republican program,'' Kennedy replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means four out of five would not get emergency room
coverage,'' said Schumer. ``Four out of five would not get right to
specialists.Four out of five would not get the right to sue.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans countered that the states were better suited to
regulate insurance companies than the federal government. ``This is
about arrogance,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. ``It's about
people thinking we'll decide. We here in Washington think we're
enlightened and know what's best for you.''
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 52-48, the Senate defeated the Democrats' effort to
broaden the Republican bill to cover all Americans with private
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Kennedy became so impassioned that Sen. Don
Nickles, the majority whip, said he feared that Kennedy would have
a heart attack and need to call in Frist, the only doctor who is a
member of the Senate. Kennedy shot back, ``We couldn't get Dr.
Frist under the access to specialists provisions of the Republican
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickles then wondered if Kennedy had been stricken and ``mouth
to mouth resuscitation was needed, who would volunteer?''
</P>
<P>
   In one case on Wednesday, the Republicans did agree to extend
their coverage to all those with private insurance _ the case of
mastectomies.
</P>
<P>
   Just a day after voting down a Democratic amendment that would
have given women an array of protections, the Senate turned around
and by a straight party line vote of 55-45 approved a provision by
Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, that would give all women who undergo
a mastectomy the right to stay in the hospital as long as a doctor
considered it medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave it to the doctor and the patient,'' said Ms. Snowe.
``That's what we're asking to do with patients who have breast
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Snowe's measure also required insurance companies to pay for
a secondary consultation for cancer. But it stopped short of the
assurances that had been in the Democrats' provision that gave a
woman the right to select an obstetrician-gynecologist as her
primary care giver.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, however, the Republicans introduced a
multi-part amendment that would ensure access to emergency rooms
outside of an HMO hospital network. It would also allow, but not
require, a health care plan to consider an
obstetrician-gynecologist as a primary care giver, and it would
give patients more assured access to specialists. In all cases
these protections would apply to 48 million people, not the 161
million the Democrats would cover.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, the Republicans voted down the Democrats' own
provision on access to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is pushing to pass a final bill Thursday night, but
appeared to be on a collision course with President Clinton.
Clinton's aides have said they will recommend he veto the bill if
the Republican version passes.

 &HT;    HBO &AMP; Co. turned sour when fiscal rules changed
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charlie McCall, a good poker player, held the
financial equivalent of a royal flush.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998 he had taken a stagnant health care software firm and
turned it into the U.S. market leader in its niche. Atlanta-based
HBO &AMP; Co., piling up acquisitions, had surged past the
billion-dollar mark in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   It ranked first among Georgia's public companies in 1996 and
1997 in terms of financial performance, as measured by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. McCall, chairman and chief executive officer,
took home a compensation package valued at $52 million in 1997 and
owned shares worth more than $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   But last month came stunning news: McCall, 55, had been kicked
out of the game. He was fired as chairman of McKesson HBOC, created
in January when McKesson, a large drug-distribution company based
in San Francisco, bought HBO &AMP; Co. for about $14 billion. McCall's
firing came as the culmination of what one expert calls a ``massive
fraud'' that McKesson should have uncovered before the merger.
``Their due diligence should have picked it up. You have to take
the responsibility,'' says Howard Schilit, of the Rockville,
Md.-based Center for Financial Research and Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson is not directly blaming McCall, but the company says
the accounting irregularities all took place when he led the former
high-flying Atlanta firm.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson's year-end audit in April found $42 million in sales
were improperly recorded by HBO &AMP; Co. The news drove McKesson
shares down about 50 percent. About $9 billion in value was wiped
out in a day.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson announced Wednesday that a painstaking audit found that
HBO &AMP; Co. accounting problems had caused it to slash more than $325
million off revenue for the last three fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
   Those irregularities have left widespread carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Investor confidence has faltered. More than 50 shareholder suits
have been filed against McKesson. The Securities and Exchange
Commission is conducting an inquiry into the accounting problems,
as is the U.S. Attorney's Office for Northern California. The
Pacific Exchange is also looking into recent options trading
involving McKesson.
</P>
<P>
   Even former company employees are left wondering: How did HBO &AMP;
Co. crash so fast _ in barely over a year? Why did the company sell
out to McKesson in the first place _ after the same deal
disintegrated months before? How did accounting problems come to
haunt the former Wall Street darling?
</P>
<P>
   Former HBO &AMP; Co. employees and industry experts now point to a
series of suddenly urgent market conditions that likely moved HBO &AMP;
Co. toward a deal with McKesson. Financial experts note how loose
accounting rules for software companies may have played a role in
the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, former employees and industry experts are shocked at the
devastation left behind at the company. Chuck Dalton, director of
information services at Atlanta's Northside Hospital, says: ``I
knew all those guys. It's really tough to believe those things
about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They owned health care computing in this country,'' Dalton
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the company lagged behind the competition in 1991, when
McCall came to HBO &AMP; Co. from CompuServe. He quickly realized that
health care was undergoing a revolution as sweeping as that in the
personal computer world. Managed care plans' cost-cutting was
forcing hospitals and doctors to become more efficient and band
together in networks. Up-to-date software, industry execs realized,
could connect medical facilities with financial and clinical
information _ and pay off on a health care system's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   So McCall and HBO &AMP; Co. set out to provide a seamless connection
between health care settings, from hospital to doctor's office to
insurance company to home care agency to patient's bed.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co. owned core software for hospitals, supplying systems
for the financial side _ patient registration, billing, accounts
receivable, budgets _ and for clinical areas such as laboratory,
radiology and pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the company quickly began snapping up other pieces of the
health care market. HBO &AMP; Co. bought about 20 companies since 1993,
covering areas such as home care and managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Through those acquisitions, HBO &AMP; Co. leapfrogged rivals in
revenue and market share. Debt-free, it eventually accumulated more
than $450 million in cash. Market capitalization jumped from about
$100 million in 1991 to more than $13 billion. HBO &AMP; Co. ranked
second among Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies in stock performance _
appreciating almost 1,400 percent _ in the five-year period though
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had unbelievable returns,'' says analyst Charles Trafton
of Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill.
</P>
<P>
   McCall was the anti-Iacocca leader. His executive style was
low-key. Described as a good poker player, he excelled in
one-on-one meetings. Yet the corporate climate was fast-paced, like
all software companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Tarrant, a program manager for HBO &AMP; Co. from 1995 until
late 1998, calls the company atmosphere focused and aggressive. A 3
percent bonus awaited employees at the end of the year when the
company met its goals.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure from Wall Street expectations continued to
grow. How could the 20 percent profit increases be maintained?
</P>
<P>
   Former HBO &AMP; Co. employees believe the company began to realize
that the acquisition strategy would eventually run out of steam.
``They had purchased all the major components'' of health care
software, Tarrant says. ``They couldn't grow by acquisition as much
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the company's goal to provide seamless information
across a health care system remained elusive, experts say. ``HBO
was not successful in integrating all their software pieces,'' says
Rick Skinner of Oregon-based Providence Health System, a huge HBOC
customer. ``Their acquisition pace was so rapid. To make all things
integrated was a tall order, if not impossible. But not everything
has to work seamlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   The system worked more like a jalopy than a Cadillac, Tarrant
says. ``We had these loosely coupled systems.''
</P>
<P>
   A competitor, Mark Braunstein of Atlanta-based Patient Care
Technologies, is more blunt. ``Their core strategy, from a
technological standpoint, is almost insurmountably difficult (with)
the enormous differences of independent systems and technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Another specter on HBO &AMP; Co.'s horizon last year was Y2K.
Hospitals now won't be buying as much software because of the
year-end issue, experts say. ``In late 1999 and 2000, Y2K would be
a liability'' for HBO &AMP; Co., Skinner says.
</P>
<P>
   There was also concern that the Internet could eventually nibble
away at some of HBO &AMP; Co.'s business. In August, the company
invested $10 million in WebMD, a start-up medical Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of stunted growth, Y2K and Internet concerns may
have led McCall to pursue an exit strategy, former employees say.
``A combination of all this _ I'd sell,'' Tarrant says.
</P>
<P>
   Last June came startling news of merger talks with McKesson. The
talks collapsed, and HBO shares plunged. Wall Street didn't like
the fit between software and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem to have any strategic marketing synergy,''
Trafton says. ``The (investment) world said. 'We don't want it to
happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Company employees at the time were also puzzled. They were even
more startled later in October, when the McKesson deal suddenly was
back on the burner. The acquirer was going to be acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they (HBO &AMP; Co. officials) were desperate,''
Trafton says. ``HBO basically sold out at no premium. Something was
obviously wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems included stricter accounting rules that would apply
to all software companies. For years the issue of when to record
software revenue has been problematic. Firms can vary in how
aggressively they record revenue, and different financial people
can have different interpretations of when to book sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``A software transaction is not that clean,'' says Schilit.
``With any software sales, you have complications. Then there are
companies that use very aggressive accounting. Software companies
have accounting tricks at their disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The center questioned how HBO &AMP; Co. recorded revenue in 1997.
With HBO &AMP; Co., Schilit says now, '''You would see a big increase
in the company's unbilled receivables. ... That is a made-up
account, when a company wants to increase its revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co. also recorded revenue early by other tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were absolutely too aggressive,'' Trafton says.
</P>
<P>
   When the firings were announced _ CEO Mark Pulido was allowed to
resign _ McKesson said HBO &AMP; Co's accounting improprieties were
''secretive'' and appeared to be intentionally kept from
(McKesson's) due diligence team during the acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the problems related to contingency sales. Software
contracts between HBO &AMP; Co. and hospitals would be signed, but the
salesman and hospital customer often agreed to a ''side letter''
that stated a contingency for that sale, such as a hospital board
approval, McKesson spokesman Larry Kurtz said. Revenue was
nonetheless recorded at that point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales cannot be recognized until all contingencies are
satisfied, according to generally accepted accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   HBO &AMP; Co. also backdated some contracts to previous quarters,
McKesson says.
</P>
<P>
   The backdated contracts and contingency sales amounted to more
than $120 million in improperly recorded revenue over the past
three fiscal years, McKesson said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can run but you can't hide forever,'' Trafton says. ``This
only works for so long. That's why I'm surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   McKesson says the executives fired ''for cause'' knew of the
improprieties _ or should have known. None of the fired individuals
_ Albert Bergonzi, David Held, Jay Lapine, and Michael Smeraski _
could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   McKesson co-CEOs John Hammergren and David Mahoney would not
speculate on McCall's possible knowledge or involvement. McCall
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McKesson insists its health care information
technology unit will bounce back. Hammergren and Mahoney vigorously
deny rumors the unit is on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Customers such as Skinner and Dalton say they haven't seen
disruption of service. But they wonder about long-term effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're concerned about what it means about McKesson
HBOC's ability to deliver products,'' Skinner says. ``A large part
of the relationship is based on people we've known over the years.
We predominantly use their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, new management will deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant has a long-term perspective. .
</P>
<P>
   ``The acquisition strategy was very well thought out,'' he says.
``But getting caught by accounting regulations is really sloppy. It
really surprised me.''

IGNORING VETO THREAT, HOUSE PANEL VOTES $864 MILLION TAX CUT

(DW) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Ways and Means Committee approved the
largest tax cut in nearly two decades Wednesday night, brushing
aside a veto threat by President Clinton in pursuit of a cherished
Republican goal.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would reduce taxes by $864 billion over the next
10 years, was approved on a party-line vote of 23-13. It now goes
to the full House, where it is likely to come to a final vote by
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation offers a veritable wish list of tax cuts long
sought by Republicans. It would trim personal income tax rates by
10 percent and give an additional break to married couples; reduce
the top rate that individuals pay on capital gains to 15 percent
from 20 percent; phase out the tax on inheritances; cut taxes on
interest and dividend income, and provide deductions for health and
long-term-care insurance. Most of the tax cuts would be phased in
gradually over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was approved after two days of bitter partisan debate
that ranged across topics as broad as how best to use developing
federal budget surpluses and as narrow as a provision, inserted
into the legislation by Rep. David L. Camp, R-Mich., to change
excise tax rules for hunting arrows.
</P>
<P>
   The committee approved several changes to the legislation as
originally offered by its chairman, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas. For
instance, it voted to delay the proposed reduction in the corporate
capital gains tax rate to finance a $3.8 billion expansion of the
tax credit for low-income housing, a proposal offered by Rep. Nancy
L. Johnson, R-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   But on a series of party-line votes, Republicans turned back
amendments offered by Democrats to make clear the differences
between the parties. Among them were amendments that sought to
impose on Congress Clinton's central demand in the battle over how
to apportion projected federal budget surpluses: that tax cuts
should wait until after Congress and the administration have
settled on plans to assure the long-term financial stability of
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a big tax cut,'' said Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La. ``The
Democrats don't want a big tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill is the party's opening bid in what is likely
to be months of maneuvering and negotiation over tax and spending
issues. The Senate Finance Committee plans to begin considering a
10-year tax cut of up to $792 billion next week, and to send it the
Senate floor by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and most Democrats in Congress want to limit any tax cut
to $250 billion over 10 years, and allocate more money than
Republicans to spending programs and to dealing with Medicare's
looming financial problems. But they have said they were willing to
negotiate a compromise, even if serious talks must wait until after
Clinton vetoes whatever tax legislation emerges from Congress this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the bill isn't going anywhere,'' said
Rep. Jerry Kleczka, D-Wis. ``The day will come, probably later this
year, when we sit down with the administration and come up with
something more realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that their plan was realistic and should be the
basis for addressing the nation's long-term problems while checking
the growth of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plenty of money to do everything we want to do if we
do it smart and do it together,'' McCrery said. ``This is not a
choice between cutting taxes and saving Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the bill would disproportionately benefit the
wealthy, leave most government programs starved for funding and
risk a return of big budget deficits. They dismissed the bill as a
political document being used by Republicans to pander to voters as
the election next year nears, which could put control of the House
up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Citing estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, Democrats
said the surplus did not provide enough money to finance the tax
cut, pay the interest costs it would create and deal with the
problems of Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The budget office has projected that the total surplus over the
next decade will be nearly $2.9 trillion, $1.9 trillion of which
will come from excess payroll tax revenues that are earmarked for
Social Security. There is broad bipartisan agreement that the $1.9
trillion portion of the surplus should go only to reducing that
national debt or shoring up the retirement system, leaving $996
billion for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But the surplus estimates are based on the assumption that all
the excess revenues are used to reduce the national debt. But money
that goes to tax cuts reduces debt payments and increases interest
costs for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Lindy L. Paull, the staff director of the Joint Committee on
Taxation, said the increased interest costs stemming from an $864
billion tax cut would be $154.6 billion over 10 years. Kleczka did
the math to make the point that the Republican plan would therefore
leave the government with a $23 billion deficit after 10 years,
without allocating any money for Medicare or for other issues like
education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also cited projections that the costs of the tax cut
would grow rapidly once all its provisions have been phased in a
decade from now. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal-leaning research organization, said the tax bill would cost
$2.8 trillion in its second 10 years, a period in which the
financial squeeze on Social Security and Medicare is expected to be
particularly acute.

 &UR; REVIEW _ &LR;  Let's get one thing straight right off the bat: You can't
actually watch the Austin Powers' movie twice on one battery charge
with Apple's latest PowerBook G3 Macintosh laptop. I know _ I
tried. After seeing last week's full-page Apple ads claiming you
could enjoy a double dose of the International Man of Mystery on
one charge, I hurried off to my local video shop, rented the
Michael Myers movie on DVD and loaded it up on a new PowerBook
running on a freshly charged battery. The first showing went fine.
But when I tried to screen it a second time, after a short
intermission, I got only a little more than halfway through _ the
battery lost its mojo just as Austin hopped into the hot tub with
Alotta Fagina. By Henry Norr

 _ SF CHRON   Merc Frowns on Ad for Its Ex-Columnist 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
It used to be easy for newspapers to identify their competition:
other newspapers.
<P>
   Because of that, newspapers didn't run ads promoting other
newspapers. Why send your readers to the competition?
</P>
<P>
   As more types of media compete to inform and entertain
consumers, some newspapers seem to be defining ``the competition''
more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: The San Jose Mercury News turned down an ad
request from Web financial news publisher TheStreet.com.
TheStreet's ad featured columnist Adam Lashinsky _ the guy who
penned the Merc's Silicon Street column for almost two years but
who joined TheStreet moments before the firm went public this year.
Lashinsky now writes a column with the same title for the online
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need to go without Adam Lashinsky,'' read the ad,
over a mug of the high-tech scribe. ``Join him online, in
real-time, on  &LR; www.TheStreet.com. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   The Merc wouldn't discuss the details; Kate Coleman, the paper's
manager of marketing communications and research, would only say,
``The creative content of the ad didn't meet our criteria.'' She
didn't elaborate on what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   Lashinsky took the rejection in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think it's pretty funny,'' he said. ``I admire them
for having the backbone to say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love those guys,'' he said. ``I love the readers in the
South Bay even more. I'd love to connect with them, but I hand it
to (the Merc) for not taking an ad from a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record: When TheStreet stole, er, hired, San Francisco
Chronicle investment columnist Herb Greenberg last year, The
Chronicle took TheStreet's money, running a similar ad touting the
move.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE NERVE: The online porn industry receives plenty of attention,
both for the money it makes and for the threat it poses to
impressionable youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes New York's Nerve.com and something a little
different: sexual content that makes you think _ sort of a sexy
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   With this more literary form of smut, Nerve aims to appeal to
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attracting men to a Web site about sex is not very

paramour, Genevieve Field. (They're no longer a romantic couple but

</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a shift,'' Griscom said. ``Young women graduate

this kind of material.''
</P>
<P>
   From humble beginnings _ Griscom and Field quit their jobs in
New York's book industry and started Nerve on a shoestring two
years ago _ the site has grown in buzz, stature, visibility and
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Nerve.com just raised $1.5 million from some high-profile angel
investors, like Mitch Kapor, founder of Lotus Development Corp. and
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Louis Rossetto, co-founder
of Wired magazine, and it's looking to raise $10 million from
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   It pays top writers up to $2 a word and has published such names
as Norman Mailer, Camille Paglia, Erica Jong and Joycelyn Elders.
</P>
<P>
   It's breaking even with a projected $2 million in revenue for
this year though Griscom says that like with any good Net startup,
he plans to spend his way back to unprofitability. In May, Nerve
bought San Francisco's Bianca.com, home of the infamous Internet
``smut shack,'' for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   Nerve has signed up advertisers like Amazon.com, CBS Sportsline,
Chickclick and Bantam Doubleday Dell.
</P>
<P>
   It has 750,000 regular monthly readers, co-founder Rufus Griscom
says, and 96 percent of them have gone to college _ and 25 percent
have graduate degrees.
</P>
<P>
   And 40 percent of them are women.
</P>
<P>
   That contrasts with what Griscom calls the fading ``Playboy
era.''
</P>
<P>
   From the 1950s through the '70s, Griscom says, ``Playboy
magazine was a strong cultural influence and was somewhat
revolutionary. ... Today, the Playboy era is ending and we are
indelibly branding a new sexual era. Today, we're much more
attentive to women's desires and women's interests. We're less
homophobic and more women-focused and pansexual than what preceded
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nerve is looking at all sorts of ways to branch out. It already
sells products on its site (``supplies for the thoughtful
hedonist''), from silk pajamas to Twister sets. The addition of
Bianca gives it a foothold in community-building. It's published an
anthology, ``Nerve,'' and has plans for a short film, a television
presence and a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a brand-and-content approach to subject matter, with
applications in every medium,'' Griscom says.
</P>
<P>
   Nerve is even thinking what would be unthinkable for most sex
sites: an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that stocks, sports and sex are the three big
winners in the content space on the Web,'' said Griscom. ``We're
really the only `safe' sex play.''

 _ SF CHRON   Merc Frowns on Ad for Its Ex-Columnist 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
It used to be easy for newspapers to identify their competition:
other newspapers.
<P>
   Because of that, newspapers didn't run ads promoting other
newspapers. Why send your readers to the competition?
</P>
<P>
   As more types of media compete to inform and entertain
consumers, some newspapers seem to be defining ``the competition''
more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: The San Jose Mercury News turned down an ad
request from Web financial news publisher TheStreet.com.
TheStreet's ad featured columnist Adam Lashinsky _ the guy who
penned the Merc's Silicon Street column for almost two years but
who joined TheStreet moments before the firm went public this year.
Lashinsky now writes a column with the same title for the online
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need to go without Adam Lashinsky,'' read the ad,
over a mug of the high-tech scribe. ``Join him online, in
real-time, on  &LR; www.TheStreet.com. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   The Merc wouldn't discuss the details; Kate Coleman, the paper's
manager of marketing communications and research, would only say,
``The creative content of the ad didn't meet our criteria.'' She
didn't elaborate on what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   Lashinsky took the rejection in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually think it's pretty funny,'' he said. ``I admire them
for having the backbone to say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love those guys,'' he said. ``I love the readers in the
South Bay even more. I'd love to connect with them, but I hand it
to (the Merc) for not taking an ad from a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record: When TheStreet stole, er, hired, San Francisco
Chronicle investment columnist Herb Greenberg last year, The
Chronicle took TheStreet's money, running a similar ad touting the
move.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; THE NERVE: The online porn industry receives plenty of attention,
both for the money it makes and for the threat it poses to
impressionable youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes New York's Nerve.com and something a little
different: sexual content that makes you think _ sort of a sexy
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   With this more literary form of smut, Nerve aims to appeal to
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attracting men to a Web site about sex is not very
challenging,'' says Rufus Griscom, who founded Nerve with his
paramour, Genevieve Field. (They're no longer a romantic couple but
still run the business together, Griscom as CEO and Field as
executive editor.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a shift,'' Griscom said. ``Young women graduate

HOUSE NARROWLY DEFEATS INCREASE IN MONEY FOR ARTS AND HUMANITIES
ENDOWMENTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Fla., Calif. Wis.)    By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Wednesday night narrowly defeated a
move to increase spending on the National Endowment for the Arts
and the National Endowment for the Humanities, whose budgets have
been cut and then frozen for four years.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came as the House neared passage of a $14 billion
Interior Department spending bill, after conservatives forced
across-the-board cuts in the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill provides about $7 billion for the Interior Department,
more than $4 billion for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the
Indian Health Service, $1.4 billion for national parks and about
$580 million for cultural heavyweights like the Smithsonian
Institution and the National Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   By a 207-217 vote, the House rejected an amendment to increase
spending on the arts and humanities endowments by $10 million
apiece. Twenty-nine Democrats provided the margin of defeat,
joining 188 Republicans opposing the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The bill freezes money for the endowments at $98 million and
$110.7 million, respectively. The White House had sought $150
million for each. The arts endowment's budget stood at $176 million
in 1992, but was cut and then frozen by Congress, largely at the
instigation of cultural conservatives expressing revulsion at
federal financing for artistic expression they considered immoral
or obscene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a luxury; let's face it,'' Rep. Clifford B. Stearns,
R-Fla., said of the federal support for arts and humanities. ``Many
of us question whether it should even exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., said Congress had declared ``a war
on culture'' ever since Republicans won control of Congress in
1994. ``I'm embarrassed for this House of Representatives. I'm
embarrassed for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The House, which had cut $1.2 billion from the White House
budget request, trimmed the bill again Wednesday by $140 million at
the instigation of the Republicans' staunchest fiscal
conservatives, who intend to freeze or cut money for all federal
agencies this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee, denounced them as ``a hard core of
right-wing militants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a game,'' the leader of that group, Rep. Tom Coburn
of Oklahoma, responded.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn has largely succeeded in his threats to delay or derail
all spending bills in the House this year unless the Republican
leadership bowed to his demands for hundreds of millions of dollars
in cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The House has yet to act on 8 of the 13 spending bills it must
approve this year, although Republican leaders vow to complete them
before an August recess.
</P>
<P>
   The House also debated whether to counteract a controversial
Senate measure favoring mining companies. The Senate measure,
contained in its version of the Interior Department spending bill,
which has yet to pass, overturns a five-acre limit for mine waste
sites on federal land.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the Senate amendment say the Interior Department's
lawyers have unilaterally blocked major mining projects,
threatening to destroy the mining industry. Opponents say the
Senate's bill would allow mining companies to dump thousands of
tons of cyanide-tainted waste freely on public land.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Ziff-Davis May Sell All Or Part of Its Businesses  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Ziff-Davis Inc., the leading publisher of computer magazines, said
yesterday that it may sell off some or all of its businesses as its
majority shareholder, Japan's Softbank Corp., looks to tighten its
focus on Internet-only investments.
<P>
   Glynnis Woolridge, a spokeswoman for the New York firm, said it
is not yet known how any possible move would affect Ziff-Davis' Bay
Area operations, which include the ZDNet online service, ZDTV
cable-television division, magazines such as PC Computing.
Ziff-Davis also produces the giant Comdex computer trade show.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank holds 70 percent of Ziff-Davis' shares. In a separate
announcement out of Tokyo, Softbank said it will scale back its
investments in companies that are not pure Internet plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think Ziff-Davis is a world-class business, but their
strategy is to focus on companies that are purely on the
Internet,'' Woolridge said. ``We don't quite line up with that
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Eric Hippeau, Ziff-Davis chairman and CEO,
strongly suggested a sale is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Softbank's decision to focus on companies that operate
totally on the Internet platform, we have an obligation to our
shareholders, our customers and our employees to consider all
alternatives to our current ownership structure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hippeau added that Ziff-Davis is ``open to the possibility that
different partners and buyers ...offer parts of our company the
opportunity to grow faster if allied with similar businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Softbank said it ``endorsed'' Ziff-Davis' decision to seek
``strategic alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   While Softbank's ultimate intentions are unclear, it's perhaps
telling that the company's press release noted that it is the
largest shareholder in Yahoo, E-Trade Group and ZDNet. Ziff-Davis
was mentioned lower down, in the same sentence as Kingston
Technology, a firm Softbank is abandoning as part of its
divestiture of non-Internet holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank said it will sell its 80 percent interest in Kingston,
a maker of memory technology for personal computers, to Kingston's
founders for $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis said it has hired the investment bank Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter &AMP; Co. to explore possible options, including joint
ventures, alliances, a merger or a sale.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Ziff-Davis retained Morgan Stanley's services in seeking
a possible buyer for ZDMarket Intelligence, a subsidiary that
provides marketing services to tech firms.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis has a current market value of about $1.5 billion and
a like amount of debt. The company's stock price rose 13 cents
yesterday to $14.19, while ZDNet, its Internet tracking stock, fell
31 cents to $23.25.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ZDNet stock has outperformed that of the parent
company has attracted the notice of investors from New York to
Tokyo. &UR;  &LR; Much of Ziff-Davis' growth is now centered on its online
operations.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of advertising pages in Ziff-Davis'
dozen or so computer-related magazines declined more than 21
percent in the first half of the year from a year earlier,
according to market researcher Adscope of Eugene, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is telling us that it doesn't need this many
publications,'' said Adscope's president, Sheila Craven, who
expects more magazine titles to be discontinued amid an increasing
focus on niche subjects like computer gaming.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to ZDTV, which has approximately 200 employees,
said staffers at the broadcast operation see a possible shakeup as
``very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The source noted that Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures owns about a
third of ZDTV, leading to speculation that Vulcan may look to take
complete control in the event Ziff-Davis (or Softbank) chooses to
cut the division loose.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis laid off 350 employees _ 10 percent of its staff _ in
October and closed three magazines, including two in San Francisco.
The company employs about 900 people in the Bay Area.

REWARD DONORS JUST HAPPY SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEIMAR, Texas _ When residents and businesses in this small
farming community dug into their pockets to put up a reward for the
capture of the killer of a local minister and his wife, donors
apparently didn't give a second thought about who might claim the
money.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them still were not giving it a second thought
Wednesday, the day after suspected serial killer Angel Maturino
Resendez surrendered, despite indications the suspect's sister and
other relatives could get a total of $125,000 in reward money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the money was to get him in custody and that
has been achieved,'' said Weimar Police Chief Bill Livingston. ``If
the money goes to his family, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Weimar posted about $35,000 toward the arrest of the
killer of the Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic and his wife, Karen, who
were found bludgeoned to death in their bed May 2. The slayings
stunned the East Texas community of 2,000, whose residents couldn't
even recall a murder in their picture-postcard town, founded by
Czech and German settlers in the 1870s.
</P>
<P>
   The local Hill Bank and Trust Co. first offered a $10,000
reward. M-G Inc., an employee-owned cooperative that runs a feed
store and implement dealership, kicked in $5,000, and an anonymous
group of citizens collected $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, we really don't like the idea that it might go
to his family,'' said Mark Kloesel, M-G's president and the man who
initiated the donation from his company. ``I guess we're stuck
doing it ... but it's hard to see money going to the person who did
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Resendez, previously identified as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, also
is a suspect in at least seven other slayings in Texas, Kentucky
and Illinois. Reward money offered by the FBI and other communities
brings the total to $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kloesel said that when he proposed that the cooperative put up
money toward the capture of the killer of the Sirnics, he did so
hoping to bring an end to the fear and pain in the community. Part
of that effort continued even Wednesday night, as residents
gathered for a ``thanksgiving service'' at the high school football
stadium to remember the Sirnics and give thanks for the capture of
a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Hrcek, one of the employee-owners of M-G, said he isn't
bothered if the money goes to the Resendez family. ``We didn't put
any strings on the money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the money went that extra step to get Resendez to turn
himself in, then it was money well-spent.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has indicated the reward money could go to Resendez's
sister, Manuela Maturino of Albuquerque, N.M., and other relatives
who investigators say were instrumental in convincing the man
alleged to be the railway killer to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino has said any money she received would go toward her
brother's defense in court. But so far, no decision has been made
on how the reward money will be allocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to follow whatever lead the FBI takes,'' Police
Chief Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   But the reward money won't be handed out until law enforcement
agencies that participated in the most massive manhunt in U.S.
history determine all those who played a role in bringing in the
fugitive and what portion of the reward ought to go to each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern here was that people could not sleep at night,''
Livingston said, ``and the people of Weimar put up that money`` to
bring the killer to justice.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if Resendez's family uses the money to hire a defense
attorney, ``That's money the state doesn't have to spend on his
trial,'' Livingston added. ``It's really not that bad a deal.''

 Apple Sales, Profits Keep Growing  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
It's getting to be a habit. Apple yesterday reported its seventh
straight quarterly profit, once again blowing past analysts'
expectations, and company officials predicted ``significant''
growth in the second half of the year.
<P>
   For its third fiscal quarter, ended June 26, the resurgent
Cupertino company reported net income of $203 million ($1.20 per
share), up from $101 million (65 cents) in the same quarter a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The $203 million included an after-tax gain of $89 million from
sales of 10 million shares in ARM Holdings, a British chip-design
company. But even without this one-time windfall, Apple's net
income would have been $114 million (69 cents) _ well above the
forecast of 64 cents per share compiled by First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the quarter increased by 11 percent from last
year's third quarter, to $1.56 billion, while unit sales jumped 40
percent to 905,000. In Japan unit sales nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, International Data Corp. forecasts a worldwide unit
growth rate of 21 percent for the personal computer industry as a
whole this year.
</P>
<P>
   About 47 percent of the units Apple sold _ 487,000 machines _
were iMacs, the futuristic ``all-in-one'' model the company markets
mainly to home and school buyers. Because iMacs, normally priced at
$1,199, cost less than other Apple models, their increasing share
of the company's product mix drove the average Mac selling price
down to $1,683, compared with $1,813 last quarter and $2,129 a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stunning,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst at J.P.
Morgan Securities in San Francisco. ``They are still making a
profit even though their average selling price has dropped like a
rock.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Apple's gross margins increased to 27.4 percent, up
from 25.7 percent in the same quarter last year. Gross margins for
most PC manufacturers have dropped to 20 percent or less as selling
prices have declined.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Fred Anderson, Apple's chief
financial officer, attributed the margin increase to unexpectedly
low prices for memory and microprocessor chips.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Apple ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments of more than $3.1 billion and less than
a day's worth of inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the Power Mac G3, a higher-priced line aimed mainly at
professionals in graphics and publishing, were down slightly for
the quarter, but Anderson said the decline had been expected
following a big spike in the January to March period, when the
blue-and-white machines were first released.
</P>
<P>
   In the current quarter, Anderson said, revenues and unit sales
are expected to increase only slightly, in part because the company
wants to ``manage inventory down'' in preparation for new-product
introductions this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is ``comfortable'' with analysts' estimates that
fourth-quarter earnings will be around 76 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   But for the three months ending December 30, when the new
products should be shipping in volume, he predicted ``strong unit
and revenue growth, both year-over-year and sequentially.''
</P>
<P>
   One new product Apple has promised to release this year is a
``consumer portable'' priced well below the company's current
notebook models. Interim Apple chief executive Steve Jobs is
expected to introduce that machine on Tuesday, during the Macworld
Expo trade show in New York. The product, which was originally
scheduled to ship in the first half of this year, isn't likely to
ship in volume until later in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Long term, Kunstler said, he remains bullish on Apple. ``The big
knock on them was that they were getting cut out of the software
loop,'' as developers concentrated their efforts on the
higher-volume Windows environment. ``But by now they've proved
themselves,'' he said, ``and besides, the focus of software
development is shifting to Web-based applications,'' which can
usually be accessed from any kind of computer.
</P>
<P>
   Apple also announced that its board of directors had approved a
$500 million stock buyback program.
</P>
<P>
   In Nasdaq trading yesterday, before the earnings announcement,
Apple's shares closed up $2.25 to $55.94, a six-year high.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three months, the stock price has soared nearly 60
percent.

 Egghead Whips Up a $400 Million Deal With Onsale  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In a move to bulk up in the face of mounting competition, two
prominent online computer stores announced a $400 million merger
plan yesterday.
<P>
   Egghead.com, the online outlet that's the last vestige of what
was once the nation's largest chain of computer hardware and
software stores, will combine with Onsale, a 5-year-old Menlo Park
company that has pioneered cyberselling techniques such as auctions
and ``cost-plus'' pricing.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, according to the announcement, ``expects
to rank No.1 in traffic among online technology retailers,'' with
total sales for 1999 approaching $500 million. Together,
Egghead.com and Onsale attract some 3 million unique visitors every
month, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, which will have its headquarters in Menlo Park,
will operate under the Egghead.com name and Web address, but
auctions and sales of surplus goods will be carried out under the
Onsale banner. Onsale CEO Jerry Kaplan will be chief executive of
the combined company, while Egghead.com chief George Orban will be
chairman. The board of directors will include four members from
each company plus one director selected mutually.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of yesterday's agreement, Onsale will pay 0.565
a share, or about $12.70, for each outstanding Egghead.com share.
Current Egghead.com shareholders will end up owning approximately
47 percent of the combined company. The deal is subject to approval
by shareholders of both companies and by regulatory authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is part of a rapidly accelerating consolidation trend
among Internet commerce companies. Even before the Egghead-Onsale
deal, this week alone has seen three major combinations: Internet
portal ExciteAtHome bought online shopping firm iMall, online ad
agency DoubleClick Inc. bought ad-management software developer
NetGravity, and online music vendor CDNow merged with Sony and
Time-Warner's Columbia House unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we're seeing so much merger activity is that in
Internet commerce, tremendous advantages accrue to the dominant
players,'' said analyst Derek Brown of Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co. in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he said, the online retailers that attract the
most traffic can negotiate the best prices with manufacturers and
collect the best data about customer preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you aggregate enough buying history, you can start to make
educated guesses about what that individual might want to buy
next,'' Brown said. ``The more data you have, the better the
information so you can make more appropriate suggestions to
customers'' through e-mail or the next time the customer returns to
the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these companies have been struggling with their
current businesses,'' Brown said, in part because ``they have been
targeting similar audiences and offering similar products. That
means they've had to spend a lot to attract customers, and then
they end up competing on price.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year, Onsale lost $5.5 million (28
cents per share) on revenues of $67.8 million, while Egghead.com
reported losses of $12.81 million (50 cents) on $42.27 million in
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question remains whether (by combining) they've developed
enough traction to prosper long term, but they're better off today
than they were yesterday,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Seema Williams, an e-commerce analyst at Forrester Researc in
Cambridge, Mass., was more skeptical about the merger, saying, ``I
don't think we can give it a complete thumbs-up.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, she said, Onsale and Egghead.com are in a business
already known for low margins, and they face a flood of new
competition. In addition to other online technology sales sites
such as ValueAmerica and CDW, she noted, computer-makers who sell
directly to customers on the Web, such as Dell and Gateway, are
expanding their online sales of peripherals and other products.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers such as Sony are showing increasing interest in
setting up their own online stores, bypassing the middlemen
entirely. And just this week, online giant Amazon.com opened a new
store to sell consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also questioned the decision to adopt the Egghead.com
name for the combined business. ``It's a very recognizable brand
for computer hardware and software,'' she said, ``but that's just
the problem _ it'll make it harder for them to establish themselves
in other categories.''
</P>
<P>
   The Onsale name, she said, would have afforded more flexibility.
In recent months, that company has spent heavily to promote its
brand and, in particular, its AtCost sales scheme, under which
products are sold at wholesale prices plus a fixed transaction fee.
That marketing effort, Williams said, largely may go to waste now
that the overall company will operate as Egghead.com and the Onsale
brand will be relegated to secondary status.
</P>
<P>
   In Nasdaq trading yesterday, following the merger announcement,
Egghead.com closed at $11.75, off 31 cents, while Onsale declined
$1.50 to close at $21.
</P>
<P>
   Egghead, which was a pioneer in software retailing, once
operated as many as 250 stores across the nation. But it suffered
under competition first from ``computer superstores'' such as
CompUSA, then from the rise of Internet discounters. In January
1998, it announced plans to close its last 80 brick-and-mortar
outlets, focus on online sales and change its name to Egghead.com.

 BELL _ SF CHRON  
 Pac Bell to Try Again for Long-Distance Permission  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Pacific Bell is expected to reapply with state regulators today or
tomorrow for permission to offer long-distance phone service to
customers in California.
<P>
   This will be the local phone company's second attempt to get
into the lucrative long-distance market after a failed try last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell's initial request was rejected in December by the state
Public Utilities Commission, which said the company had not opened
the local phone market to competition and still retained a monopoly
in California.
</P>
<P>
   But while it handed Pac Bell a defeat, the PUC also provided a
road map for Pac Bell to follow so it could gain approval on its
second try. Pac Bell officials said they have spent the past six
months adhering to the road map and are confident they will get
approval on this go-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked feverishly for six months, and this application
proves we've done everything they've told us to do,'' said Michael
Heenan, a spokesman for Pac Bell. ``We're confident the PUC will
see we've complied with each and every one of the tasks they laid
out for us and we've bent over backward to open our markets to
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Before it can get access to the long-distance market, Pac Bell
must prove it has satisfied 14 federal requirements, including that
it has opened the local phone market to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Pac Bell must show that its computer systems
are capable of handling orders from competitors who want to resell
Pac Bell service.
</P>
<P>
   Many phone companies that want to offer local phone service in
California plan to lease portions of Pac Bell's network and then
resell Pac Bell's phone service under their own brand name. To make
this work, Pac Bell's systems must be able to communicate with the
computer systems of competitors. That way, customers who want to
switch to MCI WorldCom, for example, will be assured they don't
lose phone service or get dropped from directory listings.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell is supposed to test its systems to make sure they are
compatible, but a test plan has yet to be approved by state
regulators, so no testing has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups and competitors say that until Pac Bell can
prove that its systems are compatible and can provide test results
supporting that, it should be prevented from offering long-distance
service.
</P>
<P>
   They criticize Pac Bell for rushing to reapply, saying the
company should at least wait for a test plan to be approved before
asking for permission to get into long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to run before you can walk and not get these
critical systems tested, you're bound to run into problems,'' said
James Peterson, a spokesman for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, MCI and consumer groups have been pushing for a test that
would use an independent third party to gauge how well Pac Bell's
systems work. They want a test similar to one being performed in
New York, where Bell Atlantic is the local phone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need these tests not in a lab setting, but beta tested with
customers in an environment where you can learn,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Severy, director of public policy for MCI WorldCom, said
Pac Bell still controls 97 percent of the market and should wait to
apply until it has proven that competitors have a real chance at
competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we still have no local competition and that's not going
to change until we have decent pricing and have a testing system
that proves competitors can enter the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Costa, a telecommunications analyst with The Utility
Reform Network, said Pac Bell is not ready to be a long-distance
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't even be allowed in the door with this
application,'' Costa said. The market is still not open to
competitors, Costa said, and important issues like the price
competitors will pay to lease parts of Pac Bell's network have not
been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC has scheduled a vote on prices twice but has postponed
taking any action. It's on the agenda again for July 22.
</P>
<P>
   If Pac Bell does win approval from the PUC, the company will
then send its application to the Federal Communications Commission,
which has the ultimate authority to decide if Pac Bell can offer
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the FCC has not allowed a single regional phone company
to get into long-distance. Some industry watchers expect the FCC to
give its first green light to Bell Atlantic, which has applied to
offer long-distance in New York.

 NextCard Files Copyright Suit Against Providian  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In a potentially groundbreaking case that could help determine how
copyright laws apply to Internet advertising, the Web-based credit
card company NextCard is suing card giant Providian for allegedly
copying an online banner display.
<P>
   In a complaint filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, NextCard accused Providian of duplicating key elements
of one of its most effective Web ads, a banner that uses a
descending thermometer to represent falling interest rates.
NextCard says Web surfers have clicked on its thermometer ads some
680,000 times during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   NextCard, the nation's largest exclusively Internet credit card
company, says Providian's ad infringes on its copyrights and
trademarks, and represents unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
   It is asking the court to force Providian, the nation's
ninth-largest credit card issuer, to stop running the ad and pay
unspecified damages. Both companies are based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a subject that's going to be one of the hottest in the
next few years,'' said Burlingame attorney Joseph Cotchett. ``It's
going to spawn more litigation than you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In an interview, NextCard chief executive Jeremy Lent said
Providian apparently is trying to piggyback on his company's
success in building a brand name on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providian's strategy at this point is apparently to deceive
Internet users into thinking they were clicking on to NextCard's
site,'' Lent said.
</P>
<P>
   Lent was Providian's chief financial officer before founding
NextCard several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Providian insists that it is competing fairly on the Internet.
``There are no proprietary rights in banner ads,'' said spokesman
Marc Loewenthal. ``They are attention-getting devices that do not
reflect any original work of authorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Banners are images sold by Web site operators that let users
click directly to an advertiser's own Web site. Banners on the most
popular sites such as America Online sell for as much as $12
million.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, banners are becoming less effective in drawing
traffic from one site to another, as Web surfers learn to ignore
the appeals. Industry studies show that users click through a
banner only about 1 out of every 200 times they view a page.
</P>
<P>
   But &UR;  &LR; just like with TV commercials, the repetition of ads serves
to build the advertiser's brand name.
</P>
<P>
   NextCard officials say they first noticed Providian's ad early
in July on Web sites such  &LR; www.nypost.com,  &LR; operated by the New
York Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The NextCard and Providian ads both feature a thermometer
showing a falling interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   NextCard's ad shows an orange background, asks ``How low does
your Visa APR go?'' and ends with the company's logo. Providian's
ad has a yellow background, highlights the company's introductory 0
percent interest rate and asks ``Looking for the best rate?''
</P>
<P>
   A large body of &UR;  &LR; federal and state law has developed to define
unfair competition and protect business trademarks, copyrights and
proprietary symbols. But legal experts say few precedents show how
the law applies to Internet advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little guidance about banner ads,'' said
NextCard's attorney, Anthony de Alcuaz.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case covering logos, Internet search engine
GoTo.com sued the Walt Disney Co. early this year for setting up
its own site, Go.com, with a similar identifying symbol. The case
is pending.
</P>
<P>
   The law covering traditional marketing sets tough standards for
proving unfair appropriation of trademarks or similar materials.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, for example, a federal jury rejected winemaker
Kendall-Jackson's claim that rival Gallo unfairly copied the the
falling-leaf motif of its popular chardonnay, noting subtle
differences in the appearances of the two products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really tough to say a visual is proprietary,'' said Sam
Alfstad, editor of EMarketer, a service that tracks online
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Alfstad, NextCard's suit could embarrass Providian.
``They're going to look like a `me-too' company,'' he said.

 Q&AMP;A _ SF CHRON   Plugging In When You Take Off 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: My wife and I are going to be vacationing in Europe later this
summer. I'd like to take my notebook computer and use it to e-mail
our kids, friends and co-workers from our various destinations. Two
questions: Will my computer work in Europe without a power
converter? And what kind of plugs and phone jacks will I need?
<P>
   A: European countries have electrical systems different from
ours. But assuming that your notebook computer is a relatively new
model, it should be able to handle anything that Europe can throw
at it, without the need for a power converter. To make sure, check
out the back of the computer. If it has a label that reads
something like ``INPUT: AC 100V-240V'' then you can use it almost
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As to electrical plugs and phone jacks, each country has its own
systems. There are more than a dozen different electrical plugs in
Europe, and a bunch of phone jacks, though the RJ-11 jack that's
standard here in the United States is used in several places,
including Spain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   You can pick up an assortment of international plugs and phone
jacks at any good electrical store and even some large drugstores.
To find out which plugs and jacks are required in a particular
country, check out Steve Kropla's Help for World Travelers Web site
at  &LR; www.kropla.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Outlook on AOL E-Mail
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'd really like to be able to use Microsoft Outlook to manage
my America Online e-mail. Is this possible? And if not, can I set
up AOL to work with some other e-mail program?
</P>
<P>
   A: No and no. AOL maintains a closed e-mail system that can't be
accessed with third-party software. This is in contrast to the
``POP'' system used by almost all Internet service providers, which
lets you connect to your e-mail account using e-mail programs such
as Outlook, Netscape or Eudora. A couple of years ago, AOL
considered making it possible for users to hook up to Outlook, but
the effort never got beyond the beta-testing stage.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you can do, which I've mentioned before, is access
your AOL mail over the Web. AOL NetMail looks very much like the
mail center in AOL's own software. Check it out at
 &LR; www.aol.com/netmail. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Quick Fix
</P>
<P>
   Q: I took my computer to a local computer repair shop for an
upgrade. They increased my memory from 32 to 64 megabytes. Also, to
improve performance from 133 to 400 MHz, they recommended changing
the motherboard. So they installed a new one. After bringing the
computer home, my US Robotics 56K modem couldn't hook me up to my
ISP. When I returned to the shop, they told me that the modem
wasn't of good quality, etc. In order to get my Internet connection
back, the shop changed my modem to a Boca 33.6 Kbps model.
</P>
<P>
   Did I really have to change the motherboard to go from 133 MHz
to 400 MHz? And do you think I got a good deal by having the modem
changed? I think I got shafted somehow.
</P>
<P>
   A: To increase your system to 400 MHz, you probably did need a
new motherboard though you may have been able to get up to 300 or
333 MHz simply by upgrading the processor, which would have been
cheaper. However, you did get shafted on the modem. The problem
with your original modem probably could have been fixed by
dickering with hardware switches or the computer's communications
settings. And even if they had to swap it for another one, they
should have given you a new 56K model.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LINUX UPDATE &QL; 
Judging from the e-mail I've gotten this week, it's clear that fans
of Linux are every bit as rabid as Apple fanatics. They love their
technology, hate Microsoft and have skin about as thin as the
underbelly of an armadillo. When I said in last week's column that
there isn't much mainstream software available for Linux, I got a
raft of angry responses by people wanting to know why I hadn't
mentioned programs like StarOffice, a Microsoft Office-like suite
of applications for Linux made by Star Division Software. OK,
StarOffice is pretty cool, and what's even better, you can download
if for free at &LR;  www.stardivision.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By the way, there's also a free Windows version of StarOffice,
which is compatible with file formats used by Microsoft Office.
It's a great choice for someone who wants a good word processor,
spreadsheet, etc., without having to shell out a dime.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Love your PalmPilot but hate the Graffiti handwriting software?
Switch to Jot, a nifty program from Communications Intelligence
Corp. It lets you use a much more natural writing style than
Graffiti, and you can use the entire screen as a writing surface.
Jot costs $39 and works with most newer models from Palm Computing.
You can buy it online at &LR;  www.pilotgear.com. &LR;

 New PowerBook G3 IS Smashing  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Let's get one thing straight right off the bat: You &LR;  can't &LR; 
actually watch ``Austin Powers'' twice on one battery charge with
Apple's latest PowerBook G3 Macintosh laptop.
<P>
   I know _ I tried. After seeing last week's full-page Apple ads
claiming that you could enjoy a double dose of the International
Man of Mystery on one charge, I hurried off to my local video shop,
rented the Michael Myers movie on DVD and loaded it up on a new
PowerBook running on a freshly charged lithium ion battery pack.
The first showing went fine: The picture ran flawlessly on the
machine's gorgeous 14.1-inch active-matrix screen, and the built-in
stereo speakers did a surprisingly good job with the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But when I tried to screen it a second time, after a short
intermission, I got only a little more than halfway through _ the
battery lost its mojo just as Austin hopped into the hot tub with
Alotta Fagina.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I couldn't come close to the battery life that Apple
claims _ ``up to five hours'' per charge _ even when I wasn't
playing DVDs. I eventually found a description of the test
procedure that produced that result in an appendix to a
``reviewer's guide'' the company prepared for journalists: You have
to start up the computer and launch an application while running on
AC power, set screen brightness to low, unplug the AC power and
then do nothing at all but wait. Under those circumstances,
according to Apple, the battery should last five hours.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is meaningless because most people who spend
$3,499 for a laptop will expect to do something with it, not just
watch its battery run down. But similarly distorted claims about
battery life are standard operating procedure in the notebook
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that Apple's new model really does last longer on
a charge than most Windows competitors. I was able to do real work
for almost four hours on one battery when I wasn't distracted by
movies; when mixing work with power-hungry DVD entertainment, I got
close to three hours.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all there is to like about the new PowerBook. It's
also super fast, thanks to a 400-megahertz PowerPC G3 chip and a
full megabyte of ``backside cache,'' a special kind of memory that
helps the G3 work at maximum speed. Apple also offers a $2,499
version of the notebook, with a 333-megahertz G3, half a megabyte
of cache and a conventional CD-ROM drive instead of DVD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions come with 64 megabytes of RAM plus 8 megabytes of
video memory and an ATI Rage LT Pro graphics chip. (The unit Apple
sent me for testing actually had 128 megabytes of RAM, which would
add about $200 to the price tag.) The more expensive model has a
6-gigabyte hard drive; the other has ``only'' a 4-gigabyte drive.
</P>
<P>
   For this review, I didn't get into the tricky business of
cross-platform performance testing, but on the basis of past tests,
I have no reason to doubt Apple's claims that the new PowerBook
substantially outperforms any PC notebook, as well as all but the
fastest desktop models.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Apple did its tests with Adobe Photoshop and
Macromedia Director, demanding applications generally used only by
graphics professionals. For the more-mundane tasks most notebook
users do on the road _ Web browsing, e-mail, word processing and
other standard office applications _ the G3 is plenty fast, but
then again so are most PC notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the previous PowerBook G3s (Apple's name for all
notebook models since interim CEO Steve Jobs took over two years
ago), the new one manages to run all this hotshot hardware without
making the case uncomfortably hot.
</P>
<P>
   My only complaint about speed: The PowerBook takes more than 20
seconds to wake up from its power-saving sleep mode. Unfortunately,
that's also true of most PC notebooks. I, for one, gladly would
trade several score megahertz of overall CPU speed for some relief
from this annoying delay.
</P>
<P>
   Apple also provides an exceptionally useful set of ports for
peripherals. In addition to a 56-kilobit-per-second modem, a
high-speed Ethernet connector makes it a snap to plug the machine
into the company network when you're in the office.
</P>
<P>
   There also are two video-out ports: an S-video connector so you
can display your presentations or watch DVD movies on a TV or a
VCR, and a PC-style VGA port for connecting to an external monitor
when you're at your desk. You even can use both the built-in
display and an external monitor simultaneously. That means you can
keep your calendar or e-mail program open on the notebook screen
while running your main applications on a larger external monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's traditional keyboard/mouse connector and serial ports
are gone, but they won't be missed because two new ports for the
more modern and industry-standard Universal Serial Bus take their
place. Happily, the company didn't get carried away with change and
drop its SCSI port, as it did on its latest high-end desktop Macs.
SCSI is still the only way to hook up most Mac-compatible external
drives and scanners.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, the new notebook doesn't have
the fast ``FireWire'' ports that the latest desktop Power Macs do.
FireWire is terrific technology, but at this point, its main use is
for connecting digital video cameras, which still cost $900 or
more. If you really want it for your laptop, you can pick up a $249
PC &UR;  &LR; Card add-on called FireWire 2 Go, designed for this PowerBook
by Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also have to turn to third-party vendors if you want a
floppy drive. Unlike other laptop makers, Apple doesn't offer one,
even as an optional extra. And while high-end notebooks typically
have two PC Card slots for add-ons, this model only has one. But
with so many ports and features built in, it's unlikely you'll ever
need more than one slot.
</P>
<P>
   What's most striking about the new PowerBook is its elegant
design, featuring subtle curves, a two-tone black exterior and such
Jobsian touches as a translucent bronze keyboard and a white Apple
logo on the outside of the case that lights up when the machine is
on.
</P>
<P>
   The machine also is about 20 percent thinner and 2 pounds
lighter than Apple's previous notebook effort. The unit I tested,
with DVD drive, weighs 6.3 pounds, not counting the AC adapter and
power cable. The model with CD-ROM weighs 5.9 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with high-end PC laptops with similarly large screens,
those weights actually are pretty low. On the other hand, 6-plus
pounds are still quite a bit to cart around for any length of time.
And with a width of 0.4 inches, a depth of 12.7 inches and a height
(closed) of 1.7 inches, this is no small machine.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Apple pioneered what's now known as the
``subnotebook'' market, with its 4-pound Duo series in 1993. But
the company long since has dropped out of the lightweight race,
leaving it with nothing to match increasingly popular 3- and
4-pound Windows models such as IBM's ThinkPad 570 and Sony's VAIO
505 series.
</P>
<P>
   It's never made sense to pick a Mac notebook just for Apple's
hardware, though. The first question is whether you prefer Windows
or the Mac OS. If the latter is your preference, the new PowerBook
G3 is a choice you won't regret _ provided you can afford its price
and don't mind its size.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want a mobile Mac but not one this big and pricey,
stay tuned _ Apple's new ``consumer laptop'' is expected to be
unveiled next week at the Macworld Expo trade show in New York, and
to hit the store shelves later this summer. How much more compact
it will be than the PowerBook G3 remains to be seen, but it's sure
to be a whole lot cheaper.

KINGS WILL OPEN WITH LONG TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NHL released its schedule Wednesday, and the Kings begin
their 33rd season with a seven-game trip starting Oct. 2 in
Nashville. The home opener is on Oct. 20 against Boston and is
scheduled for the under-construction Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   A big question now is whether talented defenseman Aki Berg will
be with the Kings, and early indications are far from promising.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Berg played last season in Finland after a
contract impasse with the Kings. The situation seems no less murky
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Berg and his agent, Larry Kelly, rejected a contract offer made
by the Kings on Tuesday. About the only thing Kelly and Kings
general manager Dave Taylor had in common Wednesday was their
shared sense of pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received an offer (Tuesday) with very little different from
offers in the past,'' Kelly said. ``Aki is very disappointed.
There's no improvement. The situation, if anything, has taken a
negative turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said, ``We're quite a ways apart on Berg. We made what we
feel was an above-market offer to him and it was rejected. It's
possible he could spend another year in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the Kings are believed to have offered Berg a
one-year contract for $625,000. Taylor would not discuss terms of
this week's offer to Berg, though he did acknowledge it was laden
with ``substantial'' incentives. Kelly didn't go for the
incentives, and is thought to be seeking base salary of between
$300,000 and $500,000 more than what the Kings are offering.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Berg has two contract offers from European teams. So
long as Berg holds off on signing in Europe, the Kings can sign
him, until the start of the NHL season. If the Kings were to sign
Berg after the start of the NHL season, he would be unable to join
the team unless he cleared waivers, highly unlikely for a player
selected third overall in the 1995 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Without Berg, the Kings would enter the season with a corps of
defensemen including Rob Blake, Mattias Norstrom, Sean O'Donnell,
Garry Galley, Philippe Boucher, Jere Karalahti and, if they can
sign him, Frantisek Kaberle.
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti and Kaberle are experienced European defensemen who
have yet to play in the NHL. Taylor said it is possible Kaberle
could sign today, which would enable the Kings to avoid having to
pay a transfer fee to his Swedish League team.
</P>
<P>
   Of entering another season without Berg, Taylor said, ``We'll be
OK, but our preference is to sign Aki because his development is
best served by playing here. ... We're waiting to hear from them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the schedule, the Kings begin the season with a
seven-game trip that takes them to Nashville, St. Louis, Florida,
Tampa Bay, Washington, Calgary and Edmonton. A five-game home stand
follows, beginning with the game against Boston. In the event the
Staples Center is not ready in time, the Kings have booked dates at
the Forum, recently purchased by the team's owners.
</P>
<P>
   Other schedule highlights:
</P>
<P>
   The Kings don't visit Carolina, Ottawa and the New York
Islanders, and New Jersey and Toronto don't visit Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have two seven-game trips, one to start the season and
the other in February, when the Grammy Awards are scheduled for the
Staples Center. The Kings have a seven-game home stand from Feb.
29-March 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' last game before Y2K is Dec. 30 at home against
Edmonton and their first game after it is Jan. 3 in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings complete the regular season April 9 against the Mighty
Ducks at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks open on the road with games Oct. 2 at Dallas and Oct.
5 at Phoenix, and play their home opener Oct. 8 against the Stars.

MARYLAND: SHE'S GOT MOMENTUM,   AND THE NAME TOO  
 KENTUCKY: THE LEAP THAT LEFT   A CHAMBER LOOPY  
 INDIANA: THE `SAFE' SEAT THAT APPARENTLY ISN'T 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another Kennedy is making a move.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. Kennedy's oldest child, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who
for four- and-a-half years has been lieutenant governor of
Maryland, held a fund-raiser at the Baltimore Zoo the other night,
an event widely viewed as her first public step toward a run for
governor in 2002. More than 3,000 of the Democratic faithful showed
up.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start as lieutenant governor _ her early
appearances were awkward, her early speeches scrambled _ Ms.
Townsend is on a political roll. She now comes across in public as,
well, a Kennedy, one quick with the smile, the quip, the clap on
the back, and she has slowly but steadily built a reputation as a
strong advocate of aggressive economic development, better schools,
innovative anticrime measures and community service. By the time
she won election to a second term last fall, she had a job approval
rating pushing impressively toward 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, her name has begun to appear on lists of
possible Democratic vice-presidential candidates for election 2000.
This week she is serving as a co-chairwoman of a Baltimore meeting
of the Democratic Leadership Council, one of the party's most
influential policy groups, whose president, Al From, calls her ``a
model for New Democrats.'' A veteran Maryland pollster, Keith
Haller, says her political development in recent years has been
``quite extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as she moves toward a run for governor, making more
headlines than ever, Ms. Townsend refuses to discuss her political
future. She told The Baltimore Sun the other day that she preferred
to keep the focus on the present and her various policy
initiatives, because ``good policy is good politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But then she added, ``I intend to be around for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   THE LEAP THAT LEFT A CHAMBER LOOPY
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, more than 400 elected Democrats have jumped
over to the Republican Party, many in Southern and border states,
where the Republicans have been most in the ascendancy. The latest
to jump is state Sen. Dan Seum of Louisville, Ky., and his leap, on
Monday, was more than just another embarrassing defection. When he
switched, he changed Kentucky's political history.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of 150 years, Democrats controlled both
houses of the General Assembly, the state's legislature. Not
anymore. Although the House remains in Democratic control, 65-35,
Seum's defection left the Senate, previously with 20 Democrats and
18 Republicans, in a 19-19 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that tie, while a development of historical note, might have
seemed not to change anything of much significance, since
Kentucky's lieutenant governor, Stephen L. Henry, is a Democrat.
Lieutenant governors customarily break ties in state senates, and
so Kentucky Democrats might have appeared assured of keeping a
one-vote edge.
</P>
<P>
   But no. In Kentucky, a constitutional amendment that was passed
seven years ago stripped that power from the lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   So what Seum created with his switch was as much chaos as
history. After the defection, the Senate president, Larry Saunders
of Louisville, a Democrat (is he still the president?), met with
the Republican floor leader, David L. Williams of Burkesville (is
he still the minority leader?), to discuss the upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in uncharted waters here,'' concluded Williams, who
nevertheless gloated a bit about the Democratic defection. ``They
can't pass any legislation if every Republican is present and
voting and against it,'' he said. ``I'd say that gives you a little
leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   THE `SAFE' SEAT THAT APPARENTLY ISN'T
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders figured Indiana's Second Congressional
District was safely in the hands of Rep. David M. McIntosh when
they began mapping ways to retain their six-seat edge in the House
in election 2000. A solid conservative, McIntosh easily won
election to a third term last year, with 60 percent of the vote,
and seemed well positioned to add a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   There was some talk that he might forgo another term and instead
try to unseat the state's Democratic governor, Frank L. O'Bannon.
But there wasn't that much talk.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then Republican leaders in Indiana, sensing that O'Bannon might
be vulnerable after a first term they viewed as only so-so, began
leaning on McIntosh to go after him. They told McIntosh, who has
enjoyed a rapid rise in the House Republican ranks, that he was
better positioned than any other Indiana Republican to whip
O'Bannon.
</P>
<P>
   And so last week McIntosh jumped into the race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The betting is that he has the best shot at winning the
Republican nomination, though not without a challenge or two, and
that he will go on to give the governor a good run. (In recent
years, however, members of the House who have run for governor in a
dozen other states have failed much more often than they have
succeeded.)
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's Republican leaders could hardly be more pleased.
Republican leaders in Washington and in the Indiana Second, though,
are anything but. The seat in the Second, which covers most of the
east-central part of the state, is now an ``open'' seat, the most
vulnerable kind.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who once figured they had no realistic chance at
capturing it, now figure they have not only a good chance but one
that could be crucial to their party's effort to take back the
House. ``I'm not looking forward to this,'' said Virgil Scheidt,
the district's Republican chairman.

SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER CHARGED WITH MURDER IN TEXAS SLAYING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By ERIC BERGER 
and STEVE BREWER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Suspected serial killer Angel Maturino Resendez was
linked to a ninth murder Wednesday, while claiming he had not
expected to face a possible death sentence after surrendering to
Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   After seven hours of questioning and evidence-gathering at the
Houston Police Department that stretched from Tuesday evening into
early Wednesday, police discovered that Maturino Resendez's palm
matched that of a print left on October slaying victim Leafie
Mason's window in the East Texas town of Hughes Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 99 percent sure it was him,'' Hughes Spring Police Chief
Randy Kennedy said Wednesday. ``You can't say you're glad about
something like this, but I'm relieved to know that it's him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cass County District Attorney Randall Lee charged Maturino
Resendez, 39, with capital murder Wednesday, the first murder
charged filed against him in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He is wanted for five other slayings in Texas, two in Illinois
and one in Kentucky, but thus far has only been charged in the
Illinois and Kentucky slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the lead attorney appointed to represent the
defendant, who is also known as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, said his
client was surprised to learn he could get the death penalty if
convicted of capital murder in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was promised he was to be treated humanely if he was
brought to the U.S. and turned himself in, and I don't think
`humanely' means seeking the death penalty,'' said Allen Tanner,
who will be co-counsel with Rudy Duarte. ``He was just told he
would be treated humanely. He interpreted that to mean they would
not try to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the written agreement concerning the surrender
did not mention the death penalty being taken off the table.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendez, who one investigator said appeared to be
``toying'' with police, has sent mixed signals during private
questioning and public court appearances since his surrender
Tuesday at the Texas-Mexico border near El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   In his interviews with Texas Rangers and police from Houston,
West University Place and Lexington, Ky., Tuesday night, officials
said Maturino Resendez was evasive and non-cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Two sources at the questioning said he spoke in Spanish and
English on various philosophical and religious topics, sometimes
making little sense.
</P>
<P>
   He offered no confessions, the sources said, nor did he
explicitly deny taking part in any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he was discussing what he wanted to talk about, he
would talk, but when we wanted to talk about cases he would just
stop,'' said Houston police Lt. Ron Walker. ``As far as I am
concerned it was totally irrelevant ... rambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it did not appear to investigators that he was setting up an
insanity defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no display on his part to make himself insane or
anything like that, he was conscious of what he was saying and
talking about,'' said Sgt. Drew Carter, the Texas Ranger credited
with getting him to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   But by Wednesday morning, a tired-looking Maturino Resendez
acted in court like he wanted to put the whole thing behind him.
</P>
<P>
   In his two appearances, before a magistrate at the Harris County
jail and hours later in front of state District Judge William
Harmon, he softly asked if the proceeding could be done quickly so
he could say he was guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Both remarks were ignored because a plea can't be accepted at
this point.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendez is currently charged in Harris County only
with the Dec. 17 burglary of the Houston-area home of Dr. Claudia
Benton, who was stabbed, raped and beaten to death in West
University Place, an affluent enclave of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After prosecutor Devon Anderson read the probable cause in that
case and outlined the fingerprint evidence that already links him
to the Benton slaying, she asked Harmon to order the defendant held
without bail. Harmon did so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was trying to play us,'' Lt. Walker said Wednesday
of Maturino Resendez's unwillingness to confess to investigators,
then his seeming willingness to plead guilty hours later. ``He
seems very egotistical.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanner, concerned about the several hours Maturino Resendez
spent with police Tuesday, said he was preparing a motion to bar
anyone from law enforcement or the media from interviewing him in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   At about 4 p.m. Tuesday, Texas Rangers took Maturino Resendez
from Hobby Airport to HPD's downtown building for the session.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like many other investigations, the sooner you talk to
someone the more likely you are to get a detailed statement from
him and that was attempted,'' said Texas Ranger Capt. Earl Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Maturino Resendez for two hours Wednesday,
Tanner said his client was tired after the questioning and upset
because jailers had taken his Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get him another Bible,'' said Tanner.
</P>
<P>
   He described Maturino Resendez as a ``very quiet, very religious
man'' who is intelligent and articulate. He added that his client
should get some credit for turning himself into authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner also said he was considering asking for a change of venue
because of the publicity about the slayings, but only if he could
get a guarantee that the trial would be moved to Austin or San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendez, who joined the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list
last month, surrendered after eluding a nationwide manhunt for more
than a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tired of running,'' Carter said. ``Regardless of
anybody else talking with him, and influencing him among his family
or anything like that, ultimately it was Angel's choice to do that,
and he did it voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   A source said Maturino Resendez originally planned to turn
himself in later, possibly Thursday, but pushed it up to Tuesday
morning. That forced Carter, a sister who helped broker the
surrender, Manuela Maturino, the sister's pastor, an FBI agent and
a deputy U.S. Marshal to make an overnight drive from Albuquerque
to El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Mike Cox, a DPS spokesman said Maturino Resendez
may have feared bounty hunters trying to collect the $125,000
reward for his capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to surrender on his own terms,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, at a joint news conference, the FBI and Texas
Rangers sought to present the surrender as the product of a team
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand together as a united front to get through this
thing,'' said Houston FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Don K. Clark, the
leader of the bureau's Operation Train Stop.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clark offered a terse ``No,'' when asked if any
agency deserved more credit than any other.
</P>
<P>
   Asked again Wednesday, he replied, ``I don't care who gets the
accolades for this. A lot of people slept a hell of a lot better
last night than they have in weeks, and I think that's because of
the joint effort, not just the FBI and DPS. This isn't about FBI
and DPS.''
</P>
<P>
   The next procedural step is for prosecutors to obtain the DNA
test results, which could link Resendez-Ramirez to Benton's death
and possibly others.
</P>
<P>
   Blood, hair and saliva samples were collected Tuesday night, and
a DNA profile completed by the Department of Public Safety crime
lab in Houston will take between two and three weeks to complete,
said Ede Emerick, a DPS criminalist.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, however, hope to get the results by next week. If
there is a match, Anderson will have him indicted for the capital
murder of Benton. Maturino Resendez is scheduled to make a routine
court appearance Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, prosecutors here are scheduled to meet next
week with lawmen from around Texas and other parts of the country
to discuss the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was quick to point out that the decision on whether
Maturino Resendez would face the death penalty was up to Harris
County District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr., who was out of the
office Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But several sources said it was unlikely that prosecutors would
not seek the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said a DNA match would help a case that is already
strong: ``If you got DNA, it's hard to deny that you're the one who
did it. I mean, in a murder case you have a couple of defenses _ I
didn't do it, you got the wrong guy, or it was self-defense. I
don't think that's going to be an option here. I guess the third
will be, `I'm crazy.' I don't know which one he'll pick.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Maturino Resendez's possible connection to the June
clubbing death of Noemi Dominguez, 26, in her Houston home,
Anderson said that would also await the DNA test results.
</P>
<P>
   But she said it was likely that evidence from that case could
show up in the punishment phase of a capital murder trial for
Benton's death. Anderson was not sure Wednesday how the Dominguez
case would be handled and said that Holmes would decide.

OUTSOURCING FIRM OPENS NEW FACILITY

   VALENCIA, Calif. _ When U.S. customers call the frequent flier
programs for Lufthansa and Air France, two of Europe's largest
airlines, the person on the other end of the phone is probably in
the second-floor office in a business park here.
</P>
<P>
   And when benefits or training managers order materials from some
of the state's biggest managed care organizations and computer
equipment companies, what they receive will be printed, processed
and shipped from another part of the same company based north of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Although its products and services don't bear its logo,
Bertelsmann Industry Services, Inc. _ headquartered in Valencia
since 1986 _ has quietly become one of the fastest-growing
companies in the booming outsourcing business. The company is the
U.S. arm of Bertelsmann Avarto, the outsourcing services division
of German media giant Bertelsmann AG.
</P>
<P>
   The company will begin production at its newest facility
Thursday. The 105,000-square-foot site in the Valencia Commerce
Center will produce, store, take orders for and ship materials for
two customers, including one of the largest software companies in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of large competitors who do services that we do,
but no one can do the integrated services that we can,'' said Ralf
Bierfischer, president and chief executive officer of Bertelsmann
Industry Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more of the BMW of the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The outsourcing industry, now a staple in corporate playbooks,
helps companies cut costs by letting outside contractors handle
parts of their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist with the
nonprofit Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. ``You do the key
thing you do but let other people do things for you that they are
better at.''
</P>
<P>
   Janitorial work is among the more commonly outsourced
industries, but companies also use outside contractors for tasks
such as customer call centers, manufacturing or computer
programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general rule is that if it's not a core competency, you
should consider it for outsourcing,'' said Richard Chase, professor
of operations management at USC's Marshall School. ``It's the
absolute wave of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann's Valencia operation is riding that wave.
</P>
<P>
   The company had $65 million in sales last year, and over the
past five years it has grown about 40 percent annually. It now
operates three facilities in the Valencia area and employs 450
people; by year's end, it will employ an additional 150 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Bierfischer credits the outsourcing boom for much of that
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Before his company entered the outsourcing service industry in
1996, he said, printing was 100 percent of its business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just three years later, services make up 50 percent of the
company's sales and account for almost all of its revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   Bierfischer said his company's ability to coordinate with other
Bertelsmann offices around the world also plays a role in the
company's ability to net the globe's biggest companies.
</P>
<P>
   The company also benefits from focus, Bierfischer said. It
concentrates on just two industries _ high-tech and health care _
and serves only a handful of clients.
</P>
<P>
   That focus could help the company avoid what Chase said is the
major risk in outsourcing: quality control and integration with a
company's core operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outsourcing has to be tailored to what you need to do,'' he
said. ``It can't be off the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Outsourcing can carry other risks, Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at why jobs are lost, a major reason is that
people decided to downsize or move out of particular noncore
competencies,'' he said. ``For employees, it's job loss.''

MAKING THE BIG LIST AND MAKING A KILLING, TOO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla.)   (jw) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, the addition of a company to the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index has created an almost-riskless opportunity
for speculators to profit.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that hundreds of investment managers will need to buy
millions of shares of a certain stock on a certain day to keep
their indexed portfolios aligned with the benchmark S&AMP;P 500,
speculators follow a simple plan: Buy a company's shares after
Standard &AMP; Poor's announces they will be added and sell them to
index-fund managers a few days later when the stock officially
joins the index. Even the hint that a company might be selected for
the index sometimes sends its shares soaring, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   While speculators have profited from these stock run-ups,
though, little if any tangible benefit has flowed to the companies
themselves _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a few days after Standard &AMP; Poor's announced that
Qualcomm Inc. would be added to the esteemed list of 500
big-capitalization stocks, Qualcomm said it would sell up to 4.6
million shares directly to index fund managers. The offering is
expected to raise more than $600 million for Qualcomm's coffers _
money that otherwise would have been left on the table.
</P>
<P>
   While Qualcomm is benefiting from the idea, however, some small
shareholders are upset that they may lose the quick gain. They had
come to view their company's addition to the S&AMP;P 500, and the price
increase that comes with it, as a reward for having stuck with a
company since it was a small-cap stock.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, several other companies have registered
stock for sale to index fund managers, but Qualcomm, a San
Diego-based wireless communications company, appears to be the
first to reap all of the proceeds itself. Other companies that have
employed a similar strategy _ including Safeway, Electronic Data
Systems and Carnival, the cruise line company _ used the offering
at least in part to allow big shareholders to cash out.
</P>
<P>
   In Qualcomm's case, some big investors love the idea _ even if
it means less of a short-term pop in the stock price. ``It's an
efficient and quick way to raise capital,'' said Jim Hillary, a
senior analyst and portfolio manager at the Marsico Funds group,
which owns Qualcomm shares. ``It requires little management
involvement and no road shows. I'm very happy that management will
be spending its time running the business rather than marketing
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Index fund managers, too, like the idea. ``It should help take
the volatility out of the stocks,'' said George Sauter, who
oversees index funds at the Vanguard Group, the largest seller of
index funds to individual investors. ``I don't know why more
companies don't take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fevered interest in what companies might be added to the S&AMP;P
500 has grown stronger over the last decade, as indexing has grown
in popularity as an investment strategy. Standard &AMP; Poor's
estimates that index funds with roughly $700 billion in assets
align their portfolios to match the performance of its big index.
Two years ago, just $500 billion was linked to the index.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the effect of being added to the S&AMP;P 500 on a company
like Qualcomm, which has a market value of about $22.5 billion.
That is equivalent to about two-tenths of 1 percent of the total
value of the companies in the 500 index, which at June 30 was $11.2
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   For index funds with $700 billion in assets to devote two-tenths
of 1 percent of their value to Qualcomm, they would have to buy
$1.4 billion worth of the company's stock _ or about 9.3 million
shares. That is about 6 percent of Qualcomm's total shares, or
better than three days' worth of recent trading volume.
</P>
<P>
   That demand certainly creates an opportunity for speculators to
profit. Thus, on Friday, the day after Qualcomm was named to the
index to replace Transamerica, which is being acquired by the Dutch
insurance company Aegon, Qualcomm's shares gained 4.5 percent, to
close at $148.75. On Tuesday, after Qualcomm announced that it
would sell shares directly to index funds, its stock price fell
more than $3, to $144.375. Wednesday, the shares closed at
$148.375.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Qualcomm declined to comment on their decision
because the company's stock offering is now in registration at the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The offering mirrors one from Carnival, which in December sold
17 million shares to index fund managers, raising $730 million.
Carnival also allowed a major shareholder, Arison Foundation Inc.,
to sell 2 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Company, the leveraged
buyout firm, sold 17 million of its shares of Safeway Inc. just
after the company was chosen for the index. In August, a General
Motors employee pension plan similarly sold $475 million worth of
its EDS stock. And in June 1998, an offering of stock by managing
directors of Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. followed closely the announcement
of the company's addition to the index. None of the proceeds of
those offerings, however, went to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm, by keeping the proceeds for itself, hopes to
strengthen the company without alienating individual investors.
Many individuals who frequent the Silicon Investor message board
(www.techstocks.com) have groused about losing the short-term gains
that usually come with an addition to the index.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm's precedent could even be a threat to the business of
some investors who closely follow the popular stock indexes. ``You
could argue that they are taking away from the return due to
existing shareholders,'' said Leo Guzman, whose Miami-based
brokerage firm, Guzman &AMP; Co., has made a specialty out of trading
stocks that are added to or deleted from popular stock indexes.
</P>
<P>
   And some message-board participants have questioned whether
additional shares were required to be added to the index.
</P>
<P>
   William Jordan, a spokesman for Standard &AMP; Poor's, says
absolutely not. ``Qualcomm would not have been added to the index
if we did not feel that there was an adequate amount of freely
traded stock in public hands,'' Jordan said. ``There are no
conditions on companies to be added to the index, because we don't
consult the companies prior to their addition.''

INCREASE IN FORD'S EARNINGS TOPS WALL STREET ESTIMATES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ The American automobile market, widely
dismissed a few years ago as too competitive and glutted to be
profitable, carried the Ford Motor Co. to earnings that were better
than expected in the second quarter. Strong U.S. sales of
high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks offset losses
in South America and deteriorating results in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A $146 million one-time charge related to Ford's acquisition of
Volvo's car making operations in March depressed earnings, which
fell 1.8 percent from a year earlier, to $2.34 billion, or $1.89
per share. This was 4 cents better than the consensus estimate of
Wall Street analysts, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the one-time charge, Ford's profits climbed to a
record $2.48 billion, or $2 a share, from $2.38 billion, or $1.91 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Booker, Ford's vice chairman and chief financial officer,
predicted the good times would continue in the company's core
American market. ``I don't foresee a major decrease in demand
taking place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the positive results, Ford shares fell 56.25 cents, to
$52.9375 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have suffered
in recent months as higher interest rates have caused investors to
worry that cars might become less affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's second-quarter sales rose 13.4 percent, to $42.28 billion
from $37.3 billion, mainly because of the $6.5 billion Volvo
acquisition but also because of rising sales of its own brands. The
gain appeared large enough to make Ford bigger than DaimlerChrysler
A.G. but not big enough to displace General Motors as the world's
largest corporation in terms of sales.
</P>
<P>
   This week's issue of Fortune magazine ranked GM first on its
Global 500 list, followed by DaimlerChrysler and then Ford. But the
rankings included the merger of Daimler-Benz and the Chrysler
Corp., which took place in November, but not the Ford acquisition
of Volvo cars, which was concluded in March.
</P>
<P>
   GM spun off its auto parts unit, Delphi Automotive Systems, in
late May, which will shave its annual revenues by about $6 billion.
But crippling strikes a year ago in Flint, Mich., cost the company
up to $10 billion in sales, and labor experts predict that
experience will not be repeated this year, allowing GM's sales to
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   With GM scheduled to release its second-quarter figures next
Tuesday, its officials declined to discuss Wednesday which company
was bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been reviewing for more than a year how it might spin
off its automotive parts business, Visteon Automotive Systems. The
company has not made any decisions, partly because it is
negotiating a new national labor contract; the United Automobile
Workers union's contracts with Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler expire
on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several alternatives on Visteon, and we haven't
decided on any direction yet,'' Booker said in an interview
Wednesday, adding that, ``We believe we have some time to sort out
what is the best alternative, whether it's continue as it is, a
partial spinoff or some other alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Visteon, which has begun reporting its results separately even
though Ford still owns all of it, announced Wednesday that it had
earned $282 million after taxes in the second quarter, up 17
percent from a year earlier. Sales rose 7 percent, to $5.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's overseas operations, once highly profitable, fared worse
in the second quarter. In Europe, where fierce competition and
stagnant demand have most automakers struggling, profits shrank to
$89 million from $310 million a year earlier, although $125 million
of the drop came from the one-time Volvo charge.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Ford acknowledged for the first time that it
might not be able to turn around its European operations this year,
as officials had previously predicted. ``Although Volvo Car will
contribute to operating earnings in 1999, it will be a challenge
for Ford to achieve its full-year 1999 milestone for Europe, which
is to grow earnings compared with 1998,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Continued economic troubles in South America, particularly
Brazil, also hurt Ford. The company lost $120 million in the region
in the second quarter, reversing a $14 million gain a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's profitability allowed the company to build its cash hoard
to $23.96 billion, up from $22.28 billion a year earlier, despite a
string of recent, small acquisitions in addition to the Volvo deal.
</P>
<P>
   The key to that profitability lay in North America, where
automotive operations produced $1.97 billion in after-tax earnings,
an improvement of $314 million from the second quarter of 1998,
when sales were also strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember analysts' asking Ford Europe if they wanted to
withdraw from North America,'' in the early 1980s, said Scott
Merlis, a managing director at Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc.
``Times change.''

AARP SETS UP A TAXABLE SUBSIDIARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired Persons named a chief
executive Wednesday to a new taxable subsidiary. The start of the
unit ends a long-running dispute with the Internal Revenue Service
and clears the way for the nonprofit organization to enter new
business ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement highlights the blurring of lines between
nonprofit and for-profit entities as well as the challenges facing
the association, which has 33 million members but had revenue
growth last year of less than 1 percent, at a time when 9,000
people a day are turning 50 and becoming eligible to join.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Zaleznick, who was the association's general counsel from
1990 to 1997, was named chief executive of AARP Services, a wholly
owned unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this restructuring will allow us to be able to speak
more clearly to our members,'' he said, ``and make us an even more
relevant organization to our members.''
</P>
<P>
   The association and the IRS agreed last month to settle a
dispute dating to 1985 over which income from marketing deals with
insurance companies, banks and other corporations was taxable and
which was tax exempt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the group paid $135 million in taxes to settle a
dispute covering profits earned from 1985 to 1993, but several
issues remained unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, it has paid $15 million annually to the IRS Under
the settlement, the taxes for the last five years were set at $52
million, and the AARP will receive a $23 million refund, Zaleznick
said. That indicates that profits from its taxable activities
averaged almost $30 million a year in those five years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the royalties that insurance companies,
banks and others pay to use the association's name and logo in
marketing their services and products will remain tax exempt, he
said. Royalties last year totaled $68.6 million, up 10.5 percent,
from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By creating the unit, the association hopes to add value to its
royalty arrangements, which by law must involve only a broad right
to use the organization's name and logo. By creating the taxable
subsidiary, the association can charge fees to refine its huge
mailing list so that only people likely to want an offer would be
contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Albert R. Rodriguez, a tax lawyer in Los Angeles, said the
settlement illustrated the benefits to nonprofit groups in drawing
clear lines around their activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``As that line becomes blurred,'' he said, ``it becomes
increasingly important for organizations to know when they are
acting in a taxable activity and when they are not taxable. And
remember, when you are willing to pay taxes, you can pretty much do
whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   The association paid its president, Horace B. Deets, $402,147 in
salary and contributions to his retirement plan last year.
Zaleznick's pay was not disclosed, and he said that it would not
appear on the association's Form 990 tax return, which is a public
document, because he will be employed by the subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The taxable subsidiary could go directly into businesses, such
as insurance, that are now handled through royalty agreements, but
Zaleznick said that was not part of the subsidiary's business plan.
</P>
<P>
   The association was founded 40 years ago by Leonard Davis, a New
York insurance salesman, who teamed up with Ethyl Percy Andrus, a
California school teacher. Consumer advocates began challenging the
association in the 1970s, saying it charged exorbitant rates for
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Postal Inspectors recommended indictment of the
association on charges of misuse of nonprofit postage rates to sell
commercial insurance. No indictments were handed up, but the
association paid $2.8 million in civil penalties to settle the
case.
</P>
<P>
   A ``60 Minutes'' segment in 1978 examined the association and
prompted such thorough reforms that Charles R. Morris, author of
``The AARP,'' (Times Books, 1996), said he set out to write an
expose of the association but came away convinced that ``after an
awful start they had become squeaky clean.''

BOEING EXPECTING SOLID SECOND-QUARTER NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What a difference a year makes.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. is expected to report a healthy 85 percent jump
in second-quarter net income per share Thursday from the same
period a year ago, fueled in part by more productive operations,
according to a recent financial survey.
</P>
<P>
   The largest airplane manufacturer in the world boosted its
performance by untangling the snags in its production lines that
dogged it in 1998, according to analysts. Boeing executives are
also doing a better job of controlling costs, including trimming
employment rolls, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are slowly but surely getting the system working again
after they threw sand in the engine,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst
who tracks Boeing for JSA Research Inc., based in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were predicting that before the markets open Thursday,
Boeing would announce that its net income reached 48 cents a share
in the second quarter, up from 26 cents a diluted share a year ago,
according to a survey of 14 individual estimates by First Call
Corp., a Boston-based research firm. The expected results would
represent a slight drop from the first quarter, when Boeing
reported earning 50 cents a share. The estimates ranged from 41
cents to 51 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing hasn't solved all its problems, however. Wall Street
experts were waiting to see if the company would lower costs by
tapping more outside contractors and continuing efforts to
streamline internal operations.
</P>
<P>
   When the company released its first-quarter earnings in April,
it also warned investors that commercial margins were projected to
fall slightly for the rest of 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the company's chief financial officer, Deborah
Hopkins, said that was because of the mix of planes delivered to
customers. A higher percentage of next generation 737s, Boeing's
least profitable plane, will be in the delivery mix, and fewer
747s. Boeing is cutting production of the 747, which is the
company's most profitable plane.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, expect those margins to rise in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm assuming they will get those margins up far enough,'' JSA
Research's Nisbet said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Boeing also warned that although the company expects
to deliver a record 620 commercial planes this year, its deliveries
will fall to about 480 in 2000. At the time, the company said that
it had not changed its previous projection that revenue will fall
$9 billion in 2000 _ from $58 billion this year to $49 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And investors have yet to embrace Boeing stock, according to
First Call Corp.'s analysis. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1
representing a strong recommendation to buy and 5 to sell, Boeing
received a 2.7 from surveyed analysts. That falls above the
recommendation of 2.1 that the 6,000 stocks covered by First Call
received on average.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to give a clearer picture of its efforts to
trim costs and boost performance Thursday when it unveils a new
system designed to measure its progress. Executives plan to use the
so-called value scorecard to weigh whether to kill or repair
products and services that aren't making money. Investors will also
be able to use the score card to measure Boeing's performance.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company has declined to provide many details of the
model. But Hopkins has promised to explain the concept in briefings
with reporters and analysts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have already begun welcoming the expected good news,
pushing Boeing's stock price up to 47|, the highest point since
July 22, in trading Wednesday. The company's shares rose on a day
when the Dow Jones industrial average declined 26.92 points.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of shares also jumped to 7 million, up from a volume
of 5.5 million recorded in trading the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the company's stock is up 46 percent since the end of
1998. The jump stands in contrast to last year, when Boeing's stock
was the worst performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.

COUPLE CHARGED WITH ENSLAVING GIRL FOR 9 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A woman who investigated child abuse complaints for
New York City was arrested Wednesday with her husband and charged
with forcing a teen-age Nigerian girl into servitude for nine years
in the Bronx, federal law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that the couple, originally from Nigeria, had
also forced two other Nigerian girls into servitude, but that they
had returned to Africa after being sexually assaulted by the
woman's brother. Child welfare investigators had even visited the
family's home in 1992 investigating a sexual assault, but had
apparently determined that nothing was amiss.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the latest in a series of incidents involving
illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States and forced
to work in servitude. Often, the victims are reluctant to go to the
authorities for fear of being deported.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said that the woman arrested Wednesday,
Ifeoma Udogwu, in her 30s, and her husband, Prosper Udogwu, 48,
tricked a 13-year-old girl from Nigeria into coming to the United
States in 1989. The couple told her she would attend trade school,
become a seamstress and be able to live a better life, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   But once the girl, who was not named by law enforcement
officials, arrived in the United States, the couple, who now have
four children, terrorized her into working as their maid and baby
sitter in their house without paying her, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the couple seized the teen-ager's passport,
forbade her to speak to anyone outside the family, barred her from
using the phone, threatened to deport her and harm her family and
beat her when she disobeyed orders. At one point they forced her to
work a night shift at fast food restaurants and confiscated her
paychecks, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, when the woman was 22, she demanded her freedom and
was beaten, the authorities said. Neighbors who heard her screams
alerted the police, officials said, adding that a friend of the
family pressured her into not pressing charges. She then went to
live with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Then, four months ago, someone whom law enforcement officials
would not identify told the FBI about the woman's ordeal, prompting
an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers denied the charges against the Udogwus at their
arraignment Wednesday night. The lawyers said that the girl was not
mistreated, had attended school in the Bronx and was even taken on
a family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Falk, a spokeswoman for the Administration for
Children's Services, said that Ms. Udogwu worked as a case worker
in the Bronx between 1989 and 1998. Last year, she was promoted to
child evaluation specialist, Ms. Falk said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Ms. Udogwu's office in the South Bronx declined to
answer questions Wednesday. Ms. Falk said she knew of no previous
investigations into Ms. Udogwu's own family by the child welfare
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Udogwu was suspended without pay, effective immediately,''
Ms. Falk said. ``The matter is under investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said they noticed the poor treatment the African girl
received at the house.
</P>
<P>
   Myles Singleton, 28, a neighbor, said the family ``seemed like
very nice quiet people'' but said it was clear the girl did not
attend school and was treated badly. ``Originally people thought
she was their daughter,'' he said, ``but you realized when they
treated her in such a degrading way that she wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Odogwus, who moved to Elmsford in Westchester County last
year, were arraigned on charges of immigration fraud and
involuntary servitude last night in federal court in Manhattan. If
convicted, Udogwu could face up to 35 years in prison and Mrs.
Udogwu up to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   At the couple's arraignment Wednesday night in federal court in
Manhattan, defense lawyers attacked the credibility of the Nigerian
girl's story and argued that she was well treated, and that Odogwu
was deceived by the girl's family into believing that she was his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   They said the family allowed the girl to attend Evander Childs
High School in the Bronx and Mercy College and even took her with
them to Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that she went to school and they taught her how to
drive belies the picture provided in the complaint,'' said Joel S.
Cohen, a defense lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer M. Moore argued that the
girl was allowed to attend school only after neighbors began asking
questions.
</P>
<P>
   She asked Magistrate Douglas F. Eaton to hold the couple without
bail because they posed a risk of flight and could try to
intimidate the girl. Eaton set bail for both at $10,000 cash and
also required Udgowu to post a $300,000 bond. Both were still in
custody as of early Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say that the girl's nine years of servitude began
with what seemed a generous offer. Thirteen at the time and working
as a baby sitter for Ms. Udogwu's sister in Nigeria, she was told
that if she went to the United States she could immediately attend
trade school, learn to sew and live a better life, officials say.
When Udogwu's sister told the girl's parents of the generous offer,
they agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After the girl was taken to the U.S. Embassy in Lagos in June
1989 and presented as Udogwu's daughter, she was given a visa. Her
servitude began immediately after she arrived at Kennedy
International Airport in August 1989, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx house, Ms. Udogwu told her she would be responsible
for all household chores, including cooking, cleaning, yard work,
laundry, and caring for and feeding the children, and that she
would not be paid, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was told that if she did not obey their orders she
would be stripped naked and sent back to Africa, investigators
said. Clothes that Mrs. Udogwu said belonged to the last girl from
Nigeria were shown to the young girl, officials said, adding that
she was told that the last girl the family employed had been sent
back to Africa naked.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sliver of truth in the family's warning. Law
enforcement officials said the couple had brought a 10-year-old
girl to their home from Nigeria during the 1980s. That girl, they
said, was sexually assaulted by Ms. Udogwu's brother, Gregory
Ezeonu, and sent back to Nigeria after she set the house's basement
on fire. Exact dates for the assaults and fire were not available
Wednesday, although the brother was convicted of sexual assault in
1992.

LIGHT TRUCKS PRONE TO TIP, SAFETY TESTS FIND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   (jw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Federal regulators said Wednesday that nearly 100
tests on a dozen automobiles showed that the sport utility vehicles
and the pickup trucks sometimes tipped up on two wheels during very
sharp turns but that the cars almost never did.
</P>
<P>
   The tests, performed on a track in Ohio under the supervision of
engineers for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
were part of a broad effort to figure out why sport utility
vehicles and pickups are several times more likely than cars to
roll over.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is taller, heavier and more rigid, an SUV or a pickup
is more than twice as likely as a car to kill the driver of the
other vehicle in a collision. Yet partly because these so-called
light trucks roll over so often, their occupants have roughly the
same chance as car occupants of dying in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The highway safety agency said it planned to seek public comment
later this year on whether to start distributing information to the
public on vehicle stability. The agency already rates vehicles, on
a scale of one to five stars, for the protection they provide
dummies in crash tests; any data on vehicle stability would
supplement this.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers oppose any release of such additional data, which
would put an unwelcome spotlight on SUVs and pickups, the vehicles
that bring them most of their profits. The manufacturers contend
that it is hard to design a test that accurately reflects a
vehicle's tendency to roll over, and that bad driving is often a
factor in that kind of accident.
</P>
<P>
   The government already requires warning stickers on all but the
largest SUVs, telling drivers that their vehicles will not perform
like cars and are more prone to turning over. The largest, heaviest
models, particularly those that are less tall, roll over less
often. But they inflict far more damage in collisions with other
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Federal research has found that 92 percent of rollover accidents
occur when a tall vehicle sideswipes a shorter one or hits a curb,
a guard rail or another low object, or when a vehicle runs along
the side of the road and has surfaces of different traction under
different wheels.
</P>
<P>
   There remains a vigorous debate between automakers and safety
advocates over how often drivers encounter such obstacles because
they are driving badly, as opposed to simply swerving to avoid
other traffic problems. Nobody has found a safe, cost-effective way
to test vehicles' tendency to roll over when ``tripped'' in these
ways.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators said they had not done enough tests to draw any
conclusions about specific models, although in the tests that were
performed the Ford Ranger pickup and the Chevrolet Tracker SUV were
particularly prone to tipping.
</P>
<P>
   All the vehicles were equipped with outriggers, which resemble
bicycle training wheels, to make it virtually impossible for them
to actually fall on their sides or flip over. In only two tests,
both on the Ranger, did a vehicle tip so far that only the
outriggers prevented it from falling over.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Martin, a spokesman for General Motors Corp., which makes
the Tracker, said the extra weight of the outriggers would have
made that model more prone to tip because it is a fairly small,
light sport utility vehicle. And Jennifer Flake, a spokeswoman for
Ford Motor Co., said two decades of Ford tests had found no problem
with the Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   All the vehicles tested were made by GM, Ford or
DaimlerChrysler. The tests involved driving the vehicles in
patterns whose turns were so sharp that, when viewed from above,
they would look like fishhooks.
</P>
<P>
   Eight tests were done on each of three cars, three sport utility
vehicles, three pickups, two full-size vans and a mini-van. In all
seven cases when a vehicle tipped up sharply on its side, it was a
sport utility vehicle or a pickup truck, the agency noted, adding
that this was ``consistent with real-world crash data.'' Five of
these cases involved the Ranger, and the two others the Tracker.
</P>
<P>
   There were 14 additional cases when a vehicle tipped up only
slightly, which the agency defined as two wheels in the air but one
of the wheels no more than two inches off the ground. Four of these
cases involved the Tracker, two cases each the Ford Explorer and
Chevrolet Tahoe sport utility vehicles and the Chevrolet Astro and
Ford E-150 Club Wagon full-size vans, and one case each the Ranger
pickup and Chevrolet Lumina sedan.

FINALLY, THE MARKET IS BEGINNING TO REWARD APPLE FOR BEING THE

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Buoyed by impressive sales of its iMac consumer
machine, Apple Computer Wednesday said that it had earned $114
million in its fiscal third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The results were 5 cents stronger than the 64 cents per share
analysts had expected, according to First Call. That marked the
seventh consecutive quarter the Cupertino, Calif. computer maker
has been profitable under a turnaround executed by the company's
cofounder and acting chief executive, Steven P. Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, the computer maker said it had shipped 487,000
of its heavily advertised and colorful iMac computers, helping to
generate total revenues of $1.56 billion. That was an 11 percent
increase over the $1.4 billion in sales reported for the same
quarter last year when the company earned $101 million, or 65 cents
per share.
</P>
<P>
   Net results for the quarter, which were reported after the close
of trading, included an $89 million after-tax gain from the sale of
10 million shares of ARM Holdings PLC., a chip design company.
</P>
<P>
   The strong showing for the quarter mirrored a recent surge by
the company's stock, which closed the day at $55 3125 on volume of
5.6 million shares. In after-hours trading, the stock dipped
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, analysts said, was that the results were
achieved at a time of vicious price cutting in the rest of the
personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enormous pricing pressure occurring in the PC part of
the market, and the irony in Apple's case is that they don't make a
PC,'' said Charles Wolf, a computer industry analyst at Warburg
Dillon Reid in New York. He was alluding to the fact that Apple's
machines do not use either the Windows operating system or a
processor from the Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days,'' Wolf said, ``they were criticized for not
making a PC compatible, but at this moment in time it's actually a
blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when analysts asked in a conference call today if Apple
would respond to the free-PC trend begun this month by several
Internet service providers, including the Microsoft Corp.'s MSN and
America Online, Fred Anderson, the company's chief financial
officer, sounded skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear that most customers would want to be locked in
to a three-year I.S.P. contract, but it bears monitoring,'' he
said. ``So far we haven't seen impact on our iMac sales.''
</P>
<P>
   The iMac accounted for 54 percent of the 905,000 computers Apple
shipped during the quarter, up from 42 percent a year ago.
Moreover, despite the shift to the lower-priced iMac, the company
increased its gross margins to 27.4 percent for the quarter, up
from 26.3 percent in the previous quarter, in part because of
lower-than-expected microprocessor and memory prices.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's strong showing for its third quarter also set the stage
for the company's widely rumored introduction next week of a
low-cost portable computer known in the industry as the P-1.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Anderson spent much of the conference call dodging
analysts' questions about the financial impact of the P-1, which is
expected to be priced between $1,200 and $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the computer industry expect the machine to have
an impact on Apple's bottom line similar to that the iMac has had,
forcing other computer makers to alter their strategies.
</P>
<P>
   There are some indications, however, that the effort to develop
a system that will take the curvy iMac styling into the portable
market has placed serious strains on Apple's otherwise nearly
flawless product development operation.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry analysts said they expected Jobs to make other
announcements at the company's annual Macworld event in New York
City next Wednesday. The company is late to the low-cost
light-weight portable market, and Apple will need to find something
to differentiate it from products made by Sony, Toshiba, Sharp, IBM
and others.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility widely discussed on a number of World Wide Web
pages devoted to tracking rumors about the company is a wireless
network connection.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Anderson did say that while he believed that revenue
in Apple's fourth quarter might not be as strong as he had
originally hoped, he was comfortable with analysts' earnings
estimates of 76 cents.
</P>
<P>
   That led many analysts to conclude that the company would
beginning shipping its consumer portable, which may be dubbed the
iBook, later in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson did say that he expected strong ``double digit''
revenue growth during the Christmas quarter and that the company
expected to be shipping its four product lines _ consumer portables
and desktops and professional portables and desktops _ in volume at
that time.
</P>
<P>
   Apple had strong growth in market share during the quarter,
Anderson said. The company had 11.5 percent of the retail and mail
order computer sales in the United States during the first two
months of the quarter, according to PC Data, a market research
firm, compared with 6.3 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Separately GFK, a market research firm, reported that the
company's share in the Japanese market had jumpt to 13.1 percent
from 7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced that it planned a $500 million stock
repurchase program, but would not give details on timing.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Talking about Merce Cunningham's choreography can
lead to an attack of the nonlinear. Words like possibility,
multiplicity and flexibility burst out like the unexpected
movements in his dances.
</P>
<P>
   As Lincoln Center Festival '99 prepares to honor Cunningham with
an 80th-birthday celebration this week, he is, as always, exploring
new ways of moving in new contexts.
</P>
<P>
   Theories that explain the premises behind his work abound. Yet
the cerebral and the fantastic have never been at odds in his
half-century of experiments. Once heckled as the high priest of the
dance avant-garde and now acclaimed for the same reason, he has
never failed to show that even the most fully plotted cosmos can
reveal surprising secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who turned 80 on April 16, is no stranger to Lincoln
Center, and ``Ocean,'' his magnificent opus in the round, was a
highlight of the current festival's first season in 1996. The four
performances that the Merce Cunningham Dance Company will share
with invited friends from Wednesday through Sunday (except
Thursday) at the New York State Theater have been conceived as even
more of a joyful and special event.
</P>
<P>
   To honor Cunningham is to pay tribute to one of the great
iconoclasts in 20th-century art. To do it through his work,
reaching back 40 years, is to show how he changed dance and jolted
us out of old viewing habits.
</P>
<P>
   One of the guests will be Mikhail Baryshnikov, who will appear
every night on stage with Cunningham in a seven-minute work aptly
called ``Occasion Piece.'' On opening night only, the New York City
Ballet will revive ``Summerspace,'' a sea-breeze beauty of a
masterpiece that Cunningham created for his own company in 1958 to
a score by Morton Feldman with Robert Rauschenberg's memorable
pointillist backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Cunningham restaged ``Summerspace'' on toe for City
Ballet, which is breaking into its season in Saratoga to perform at
the festival for the first time. Now that Cunningham's
once-baffling juxtaposition of unrelated movements is familiar to
virtually all students in dance composition class, ballet companies
may no longer find his rhythmic phrasing so different from their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the celebration will show through two New York premieres,
``Biped'' and ``Pond Way,'' dance for Cunningham remains a
challenge with still more doors either to open gently or batter
down.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain poetic satisfaction in Cunningham's return to
the State Theater, the scene, in 1965, of his biggest succes de
scandale. Performing as part of a week of American modern dance,
the Cunningham company caused an uproar with a now celebrated
piece, ``Winterbranch.''
</P>
<P>
   What was perceived as an assault on the audience was, as we now
know, a somewhat cerebral examination of different ways to fall
down. Yet the point was that the lighting by Rauschenberg, then the
newly crowned king of Pop Art, left the dancers in near obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham himself had a flashlight on stage, but it was a
larger light beamed at the audience and the grating high-decibel
sound of La Monte Young's sound score, graphically suggesting wood
scraped against glass, that provoked the outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Bombardment of the senses is nothing new to Cunningham. He has
often told us that many things happen at the same time in the
universe and will do so again through ``Biped.'' In a decade when
MTV has caught up with Cunningham's collage of fragmentary images
and when theme parks create virtual reality denizens in haunted
houses, Cunningham is still turning discontinuity into art.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Biped,'' live dancers meld with what look like
virtual-reality figures projected on a front scrim and at the rear
of the stage. Yet there is a twist. The animated bodies and
abstract shapes are not, strictly speaking, computer generated.
Their movement derives from choreography that Cunningham created,
not from a computer image but with very real dancers in a studio.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers wore knoblike sensors on their joints that through
``motion capture'' technology, sent digital information to two
multimedia artists, Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar. They in turn
used computer software to create the large animated designs that
moved at the same time as the live performers.
</P>
<P>
   To see ``Biped'' as just another mixed-media event is to forget
that the genre was pioneered on a large scale by Cunningham and
John Cage, his influential music director, who died in 1992. In the
1960s, Cunningham and his dancers generated sound when they passed
in front of photoelectric cells set up on stage in ``Variations
V,'' which also used film.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders whether Cage, as the epitome of the rules breaker
among American composers, and Cunningham, as his dance counterpart,
did not later come to miss the volatile reactions to such pieces.
In 1966, when ``Variations V'' was performed at the Theatre des
Champs-Elysees, the site Diaghiliev chose for his ``Rite of
Spring'' premiere in 1913, the French art world in hip silk outfits
filled the house.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's sensibility, close to that of the contemporary
painters, from Abstract Expressionists to Pop artists, was familiar
to this audience. The sight of Cunningham thrashing on the floor in
a plastic bag in another piece, ``Place,'' was par for the course.
</P>
<P>
   Yet obviously the art world did not quite fill the house, and
the booing that erupted would have continued for some time had not
Eddie Constantine, of all people, jumped up from his seat and
berated the hecklers. An American character actor who specialized
in gangster roles in French films, Constantine was a dance lover
and his wife a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   The heroic battles are over for Cunningham. Today he is
respected worldwide as one of the century's great artists, not an
auteur with a singular point of view, but a choreographer who made
us reconsider an entire art form. The purity of his choreography
has a clean classical beauty that still startles by its eruptions
of unexpected rhythms and images.
</P>
<P>
   Not the first to abandon narrative, Cunningham was nonetheless
the first to rid the stage of a central focus. To see his dancers
facing different directions and moving autonomously, often
overlapping in independent units, is to see space as an abstract
painter might.
</P>
<P>
   Not every viewer is at ease with the way Cunningham uses music
as an element that coexists with the dancing rather than as a
springboard for choreography or its support. Nor does everyone
agree that predictable structures automatically restrict
choreography. The satisfying aspect of this purist vision is that
it can make for truly theatrical pieces, ranging from the antic to
the lyrical.
</P>
<P>
   For this special engagement at the festival, the choreographer
is breaking his rule about never inviting guest artists into his
company. The State Theater is a large house to fill, and
appearances by Baryshnikov, a fervent Cunningham fan, will not
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year age gap between the two performers is not greater
than that between Cunningham and his young and increasingly
virtuosic dancers. The audience will presumably see Baryshnikov and
Cunningham on stage together, but the idea that each might dance
simultaneously although independently is not new to Cunningham
watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cage, Cunningham has believed that the multiplicity of
events in life can translate into analogous multiple possibilities
on stage. Art could operate in the manner of life: Cage and and
Cunningham borrowed this idea from Ananda K. Coomeraswamy, an
internationally known scholar who was attached to the Fogg Art
Museum at Harvard in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The discontinuity they saw in life encouraged Cage and
Cunningham to free themselves from orthodox ways of composing music
and dance. Cunningham still uses chance procedures as a tool, and
tosses coins to determine which movement will follow which and how
many dancers will be on stage. This is not an end in itself. As
early as 1955, he wrote that the use of chance methods was not ``a
position I wish to establish and die defending.'' It was rather, he
said, ``a present mode for freeing my imagination from cliches.''
</P>
<P>
   He felt a ``similar freedom'' when he gave up ``a dependence
upon the note-for-note procedure'' in music. Cunningham went
further than choreographing without music or not dancing ``to''
music. It is common lore that music is so dissociated from the
dancing in the Cunningham repertory that the dancers hear the music
in a piece for the first time only at its premiere.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions. The City Ballet orchestra will use an
arrangement for Feldman's score that is fixed and without the
choices that the composer originally offered to musicians during
performances. ``Occasion Piece'' will use a known score by Cage,
``Music for Marcel Duchamp, 1947,'' played by the pianist Stephen
Drury.
</P>
<P>
   The score that the experimental British composer Gavin Bryars
has written for ``Biped'' uses conventional instruments, a
departure from the usual range of whirs to gurgling water at
Cunningham concerts.
</P>
<P>
   A score, like decor, is considered by Cunningham one of several
separate elements that come together with movement on stage. The
sound may be modified from night to night and the choreographer has
been known to change the order of sections in a dance.
</P>
<P>
   None of this makes for linear viewing, but that is the point.
The discontinuity reflects the choreographer's belief that
``anything can follow anything,'' a Zen-inspired acknowledgment of
the randomness in life.
</P>
<P>
   One movement is thus also equivalent to another in the
choreography, which raises the issue of meaning in Cunningham's
work. ``Winterbranch'' looked sinister under its original dark
lighting. But the same choreography's focus on falling bodies
resembles a formal experiment when it is seen under bright lighting
as part of the performances (with segments from various pieces)
that Cunningham calls Events.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cunningham dancers have suggested that some repertory
pieces do carry a specific meaning. But in a recent chat in his
studio in Greenwich Village, Cunningham insisted that it was all in
the eye of the beholder. Actually, he preferred to talk about
cooking and the macrobiotic diet (``grain and bean'') that he has
been on for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   As Cunningham recalls, it all began when Cage was walking down
14th Street, visibly affected by rheumatoid arthritis and ``Yoko
Ono popped out of a limousine and said, `You must go on a
macrobiotic diet.'''
</P>
<P>
   When asked nonetheless if there was specific meaning in his
work, Cunningham said there was none ``in terms of subject,''
adding emphatically, ``I don't make things that are specific.''
</P>
<P>
   If each piece varies in mood and atmosphere, that is because the
movement he explores is colored by the context in which it is
presented _ namely by the kind of decor and sound that has been
added.
</P>
<P>
   Four decades after founding his company in 1953, he remains
committed to the idea that a choreographer, a set designer and a
composer should work separately, guided only by a hint of formal
concept. ``We don't tell each other what to do,'' he insists and
the end result he seeks is a risk, not a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   A scenario in such circumstances strikes him as puzzling if not
quaint. ``When Cage and I divided the music and the dance,
everything became so free and precise. That is why I really pursued
the use of chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Movement phrases and steps put together through chance
procedures also precluded any hint of narrative, in his view. ``I
want to leave as much open as possible to the spectator,'' he
reaffirmed, but movement is his springboard and his prime concern.
</P>
<P>
   The Dadaist spirit that ran through much of his repertory of the
1960s has yielded, for the most part, to intricate dancing that
requires a level of highly virtuosic technique. The company's
dancers must move quickly and lightly through extreme shifts of
rhythm and speed. ``I seem to be interested in complexity and
change,'' Cunningham said simply.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the modern-dance pioneers of the 1930s, Cunningham has
remained open to any kind of idiom, and he has used the clarity and
articulation of ballet for his own purposes. Asked why he now
prefers ballet-trained dancers in his company, he replied with the
delight in dancing that has never left him: ``I want someone with
legs. I need that; it's the way I think.''

NO SUSPENSION FOR PHILLIPS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain, Neb., Calif., Fla.)   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawrence Phillips, the running back with a history of
off-field violence, will be assessed a ``substantial fine'' when he
returns to the National Football League but will not face
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue met for an hour Wednesday with
Phillips, who was the most valuable player of the recently
completed NFL Europe season. Phillips rushed for 1,021 yards in
eight games for Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   The league said in a statement that Tagliabue told Phillips
``that as a result of past misconduct, he will be subject to a
substantial fine this season.'' The amount of the fine will be
determined later, and will probably be based on the amount Phillips
would be paid for one or more games.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' future fine was triggered by his no-contest plea last
February to a charge of misdemeanor battery for striking and
threatening a woman at a Florida nightclub. Since he was not with
an NFL club at the time of the plea, he could not be disciplined by
the league. He was sentenced to six months' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NFL's violent-crime policy, which was instituted
before the June 1998 nightclub incident, players who are convicted
of or plead no-contest to a violent crime must undergo counseling
and may be suspended without pay. Tagliabue has not yet suspended
any player under the violent-crime policy.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said Wednesday that he had taken Phillips' past
actions into consideration in deciding on the punishment.
</P>
<P>
   While a star at Nebraska in 1995, Phillips was found guilty of
assault for dragging a girlfriend down a flight of steps and
punching her in the head. He received a year's probation, violated
it in 1996 when he was arrested on a drunk-driving charge, and was
jailed for 23 days. In 1997 he pleaded no-contest to threatening
the police after another woman said he had assaulted her. No
assault charges were filed, but four lawsuits resulting from the
incident were settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Rams took him as the sixth overall pick in the 1996
draft, they cut him late the next season. The Dolphins picked him
up late in 1997, but dropped him after the night-club incident.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was not the kind of All-Star Game that gave you so
many great plays that your eyes wanted to pop out. It was just hard
basketball. Lots of fun. Too much defense.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's inaugural Women's National Basketball
Association All-Star Game, won by the West, 79-61, before a sellout
crowd of 18,649 at Madison Square Garden, was not mesmerizing, but
that didn't seem to bother the fans.
</P>
<P>
   True to the vibe of the league, none of the stars really stuck
out. They just blended together, showing their skills when they got
the chance but not forcing it. The game's most valuable player,
Lisa Leslie, had 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few players could've received this award, and they chose
me,'' Leslie said. ``I think it was great. It was a lot of fun. I
just want to say thank you to all the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what this game was: a gift to the fans. From the start,
the players seemed more concerned with whether the fans, especially
the children, were enjoying the game.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the play was not stellar, the players were satisfied
with the fact that it was enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   As it ended, the Western Conference All-Stars _ who had the more
marquee players _ held off a surging Eastern Conference team, going
on one final spurt. ``I thought it was a wonderful game, especially
since we won,'' West Coach Van Chancellor said. ``Our defense was
300 percent better than I expected for an all-star game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty players Vickie Johnson, Kym Hampton and Teresa
Weatherspoon scored 8, 5 and 3 points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The heralded rookie Chamique Holdsclaw left the game midway
through the second half with a chip fracture of her left index
finger. The injury did not seem too serious, but Holdsclaw will be
re-examined by her Washington Mystics team doctors Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The game did not have the glitz normally associated with
all-star games.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the crowd was teeming with energy and emotion. Whitney
Houston rocked with her rendition of the national anthem.
Celebrities like Tyra Banks, Gregory Hines and Spike Lee along with
Nets point guard Stephon Marbury and six members of the U.S.
women's soccer team, including Mia Hamm, kept the fans clapping.
</P>
<P>
   The players did their part, too. They raised the roof with their
mock shoulder presses. Some danced a step or two while waiting to
be introduced. But from the start, it was understood that this was
more about children's giddiness than glitz, more about fun than
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   As the starters were introduced, hundreds of children stood at
half court and slapped the hands of the players. During the
timeouts, youngsters were integrated into the game. Some dressed as
mascots and trotted around the court. The halftime show featured
dancing for youths representing their WNBA teams.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball was shaky at the start. The East seemingly came
out with jitters and the West jumped out to a 17-2 lead. The East
was able to get back into the game from that point, getting as
close as 2, at 31-29, by the four-minute mark.
</P>
<P>
   A host of stars _ some well-known, others lesser known -
performed well early. Leslie, the West center, scored 8 points in
the half. Shannon Johnson, a 5-foot-7-inch ball of energy from the
Orlando Miracle, led the East with 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, with the exception of some whirling by West
point guard Ticha Penicheiro, the players seemed reluctant to go
for too many fancy plays.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that both sides didn't seem loose for most of the half
sometimes made for sloppy play, which is not unusual for an
all-star basketball game. But some of the mistakes were more
evident because of it was generally a low-scoring half. The West
led 43-29 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   But the half still had its thrills. Cynthia Cooper went coast to
coast for layups. Sheryl Swoopes showed her trademark speed,
streaking down the court for easy scores. Weatherspoon threw
no-look passes, but several East players failed to finish.
</P>
<P>
   A dropped pass here, a missed layup there. A few air balls. That
is how it went.
</P>
<P>
   And uncharacteristic defense, too.
</P>

PANEL VOTES TO END RACE-BASED APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE AND DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Those who once were on opposite sides of Boston's
desegregation battles now stand shoulder to shoulder to support
abandoning race-based school assignments, arguing the city has
changed and needs to move beyond the polarizing debates that have
preoccupied the public schools for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The School Committee Wednesday night voted 5-2 in favor of
Superintendent Thomas W. Payzant's recommendation to eliminate race
as a factor in deciding where students go to school, a move that
would officially end the desegregation efforts that began with
busing in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, those who once defined themselves as either
foes or advocates of busing stood together at City Hall, a
multihued portrait of a changed city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take that picture,'' State Senator Dianne Wilkerson
(D-Roxbury) said at a press conference. ``I defy you to scan your
files from the 1970s and you will never find a picture _ I
guarantee you _ from the 1970s of people gathered to talk about
education and schools in Boston who look like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different (picture) from 1974 because Boston is a
different place. We're not done, but we're on our way, and the only
way to do that is to be in a room together.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Lisa McGoff Collins, who fought the 1974 order that
would have bused her to go to school with blacks, sounded equally
out of character. She likes the fact that her children now attend a
multiracial school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Busing has made me a better person,'' said Collins, whose
fight against it was chronicled in J. Anthony Lukas's book,
``Common Ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made it easier for me to communicate with people of all
races. My kids have no fear of culture,'' she said. ``We feared
other cultures and that was wrong. My kids are getting along with
everyone and I think that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics Wednesday warned Payzant's new assignment plan would
lead to the same segregation the 1974 court order tried to
eliminate. Payzant's change in the assignment plan, they said, was
merely caving in to a recent lawsuit filed by a small group of
white students who said it discriminated against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not against the school system saying let's spend more time
on education and less time fighting cases in court,'' said Charles
Willie, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who
was one of two chief authors of the assignment plan that has been
in place until now. ``I am against rolling over and letting anyone
who brings a frivolous lawsuit change their policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the day was most notable for the changes of heart on
display.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who strongly supported desegregation until recent
years now say the city's demographics have changed so much that
geography _ not race _ will produce diverse schools. When busing
began, the city's public schools were about 60 percent white. Now,
15 percent of students are white, 85 percent are minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an absolute proponent of the educational value of
diversity, but I think there are many ways to achieve it,'' said
Neil Sullivan, a father of four Boston public school children, who
helped draft the old assignment system. ``You start to think about
it in geographic terms rather than racial terms. Other than West
Roxbury and Readville, it's very hard to go into a white
neighborhood and not reach some population of color within a mile
radius . . . that just wasn't true before.''
</P>
<P>
   The new assignment plan will not mean a return to neighborhood
schools as existed in 1974. The system will still offer parents a
choice of where to send their children, and therefore, there will
still be many students traveling on buses to school.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than considering race, however, schools will look at what
number the parents pulled in the school-choice lottery, whether
there are siblings at the school, and how close a student lives to
a school. The change affects only children in transition grades,
those in which they have to change schools, and any new arrivals to
the Boston system.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said that without looking at race, how close a
student lives to a school will become more of a factor. Therefore,
they worry, students in neighborhoods with few schools, such as
Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester, will have to go to schools in
other neighborhoods. They will have no option but to fill seats in
underchosen _ and lesser _ schools in other neighborhoods, although
five new schools are scheduled for those neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race is being blamed for the failure of the School Committee
to improve all schools up until now,'' Willie said. ``The source of
this is the few people in Boston who have never been able to accept
desegregation.''
</P>
<P>
   Payzant acknowledged that although the schools are 85 percent
minority, some neighborhoods in the city such as Roxbury and West
Roxbury are not as diverse. But, he said he is not concerned that
some schools ``may be a little more white or a little more students
of color'' because there is so much diversity within children's
cultures today.
</P>
<P>
   And, he noted, over time he hopes ``the quality of schools will
change'' the makeup of those communities, giving every child a good
school near home.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Boston changed, but the School Committee has
changed. In 1974, it was so recalcitrant that US District Judge W.
Arthur Garrity Jr. issued a court order to enforce school
desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to see we are ready for some transition and
there are some cooler and calmer heads at the table now than anyone
would have believed,'' Wilkerson said. ``We went to court (in 1974)
because it was the last resort and all else failed. The overriding
thing Thursday from parents is, `We think we can work this out. If
we can't, let's go to court, but let's not start in court.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if white families who fled the city in fear of busing
would now return and flood the system, Mayor Thomas M. Menino
replied: ``If families choose to come back to the city that's an
added bonus. People will be watching us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson said she has been talking to parents of different
backgrounds and they're clear about where they want to take the
conversation: away from race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to focus on two things: equitable schools and quality
schools, not race,'' said Ajibola Osinubi of Dorchester, who has
three children in Boston schools. ``I always said to people, `What
difference does it make if you are white or black and can't read?
Race is not a common factor there.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Reverend Bruce Wall, a longtime leader in the black
community: ``It's what's at the end of the bus ride that's most
important.''

BOSTON, ONCE A SYMBOL OF TENSIONS ON BUSING, MOVES TO END IT

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the most powerful symbol yet that the era of
race-based busing is ending in America, the Boston School Committee
voted Wednesday night to drop race as a factor in deciding which
school a child attends. The vote will effectively end in 2000 the
last vestiges of the city's busing integration program, 25 years
after its violent inception tarred Boston with a reputation for
northern racism and school bus strife.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's vote of 5-2 completed a neat historical circle:
In 1974, a federal judge found that Boston's de facto school
segregation discriminated against black children and ordered the
busing. Wednesday night, the committee voted under pressure from a
pending federal lawsuit that argues that the current system
discriminates against white children.
</P>
<P>
   City authorities who encouraged the vote said they acted out of
awareness that here and nationwide, affirmative action programs and
other school admissions systems that take race into account have
lost again and again in recent court challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why now and why tonight?'' asked Boston Schools Superintendent
Thomas Payzant. ``The immediacy is certainly there because of the
claim that has been filed in court that this plan is
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then,'' he added, ``There is the tenor of court decisions
around the land, with respect to use of race in student assignment
plans,'' including a federal appeals court's decision in November
that struck down racial preferences at the prestigious Boston Latin
School, a public school.
</P>
<P>
   The legal impetus for the school committee's decision here came
from a suit filed by a parents' group called Boston's Children
First and several white parents. They contended that under the
current system, known as ``controlled choice,'' their children's
choices were in fact limited by the racial parameters allowed at
each school.
</P>
<P>
   The racial make-up of Boston's schools has changed a lot since
busing began, in part due to the white exodus that busing spurred,
as well as the city's overall transformation into more of a mixture
of Hispanic, Asian, black and white. Only 15 percent of Boston
public school students are white, compared with 60 percent in the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Payzant said that studies indicate that among Boston's 64,000
pupils, dropping the race criterion for assignments will probably
mean that only about 500 will end up assigned to schools that were
lower on their list of preferences; another 500 are likely to get
schools they preferred more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to have a drastic impact in terms of the
composition of schools citywide,'' Payzant said. The impact will
come, however, in the daily lives of certain parents and children,
which was the concrete issue driving the white parents' lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the issue of principle. ``What we have is a
classic case of discrimination,'' said Chester Darling, the white
parents' lawyer. ``It's not reverse discrimination, it's
discrimination _ on the basis of the awarding of a benefit, or the
withholding of a benefit on the basis of color. They color-coded
kids and the white kids were shorted.''
</P>
<P>
   Darling and his clients will go to court July 29, and he said
they will demand that the system be changed in time for the fall
term.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the many reflections of how much things have changed
since 1974, city officials expressed a deep desire Wednesday to
keep the debate over schools out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by two dozen parents and community leaders at an
afternoon news conference, Mayor Thomas Menino said ``Today we are
united in our belief that a lengthy court battle over assignment
policies would only further distract us from our most important
challenge: raising the level of excellence for every student and
every school, all 129 schools in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Menino recalled the turbulent '70s.
Among those present was Lisa McGoff Collins, whose busing
experiences as a frightened, angry teen-ager in the white
Charlestown section of the city were described in J. Anthony Lukas'
``Common Ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Collins was a strong opponent of busing then, and now, still
in Charlestown, she has three children of her own in the city's
public schools. She praised the way busing has made her children
much more comfortable with other races and cultures than she was
growing up in insular Charlestown, and said she had been happy with
the level of school choice.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, asked if busing had been a failure, she said it was
``sort of a failure, but it just took 23 years to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Menino and Payzant discouraged reporters from second-guessing
the decisions of the 1970s, pointing out that Boston is different
from the polarized city it was then.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the pupils in Boston's public schools are 49 percent
black, 26 percent Hispanic, 15 percent white, 9 percent Asian and
less than 1 percent American Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's busing system began when U.S. District Court Judge W.
Arthur Garrity Jr. ruled that the schools had been intentionally
segregated, and students were bused so that the enrollment in each
school would more closely reflect the racial makeup of the city.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the schools were deemed sufficiently integrated to
allow the court-ordered busing to be ended. Similar decisions have
come down in cities nationwide in recent years. In 1989, Boston's
court-ordered busing was replaced by the controlled choice system,
in which the city was divided into three big zones and students
were allowed to choose among about 27 schools in their zone, as
long as all the schools remained adequately integrated. Race became
one of several factors, along with proximity, sibling preference
and the luck of the lottery, that determined a pupil's school
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the architects of that system, Michael Alves, an
educational planner at Brown University, worried Wednesday that
abruptly doing away with racial criteria for school assignments,
and the city's gradual move toward sending virtually all children
to neighborhood schools, would lead to re-segregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do the kids go who don't have a neighborhood school?''
he asked. ``They have to wander the town to find a school that no
one wants. In this case, it is mostly African Americans and
Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't live near a school you want, you probably won't
get in,'' he added. And that's an important point for a city where
not all racial groups can live where they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Willie, who also helped develop the controlled choice
plan, said he was concerned that changing the school plan ``is
going to take us back to the tensions of years ago and
court-ordered education.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``There's not going to be any time for school
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Citywide Parents Council also said they were
worried that the shift to neighborhood schools would reduce their
range of choices, though city officials promised it would not.
</P>
<P>
   But there seemed to be one area of strong consensus among
parents, politicians and educators: a desire to focus on school
improvements instead of on race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what's at the end of the bus ride that's important,''
said the Rev. Bruce Wall, a black minister.  &QL;

TV GIVES SEX IN NEW YORK A BAD NAME
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that HBOs ``Sex and the City'' has unexpectedly become a
national hit, people across America are getting a weekly glimpse at
dysfunctional New Yorkers engaging in humanity's most brutal mating
rituals. It's gratifying that outsiders care enough to pay
attention to our parochial obsessions. But what is this doing to
the city's image?
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Seinfeld,'' another unexpected hit in the heartland,
``Sex and the City'' is a show about four only-in-New-York
narcissists _ in this case, four narcissistic Tinker Bells with
attitude. Their view of the world beyond downtown Manhattan was
summed up in a recent interview by the show's fashion guru,
Patricia Field, the owner of a boutique in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the girls in this show just aren't going to wear
miniskirts with high heels,'' she said. ``No one in New York
dresses like that.'' The show's star, Sarah Jessica Parker,
elaborated the point by explaining why the four women in the show
never wear stockings, even in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one I know wears them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyfriends seems to be equally dispensable in this world. One of
the characters, Charlotte, is a traditionalist who frets about not
finding a man because she doesn't want to grow old alone. But her
fears are dismissed by Samantha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweetheart, we're all alone, even when we're with men,'' says
Samantha, who exults in her string of casual affairs. ``Slap on
some armor and go through life like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The only male in New York who almost gets through their armor is
Mr. Big, a smug, smarmy oaf to whom Ms. Parker's character is
unaccountably attracted. The rest of the city's men don't even rise
to his low level. Some are faithless cads. Some are not rich enough
or interesting enough. The rest are hopeless in bed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a grotesque picture of New York, but it's funny because
there's a certain emotional truth to it. Some critics _ New York
men, for instance _ would argue that the local men aren't all such
losers. But the dating pool often looks that way to women.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics _ New York women, for instance _ would argue that
the city's women aren't really so crude and tough. But they can
seem intimidating. At certain moments in the show, when another guy
has been mercilessly rejected, I'm reminded of a first date I had
with a successful executive in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   We sat down in the restaurant, and she ordered a Bass Ale. ``I'm
sorry,'' the waiter replied. ``We don't carry Bass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh.'' She frowned. ``Then I'll just have a glass of water.''
</P>
<P>
   I ordered a glass of house wine, but I didn't especially enjoy
it. I wondered if it made me seem too ... undiscriminating. I also
wondered if there might eventually come a delicate moment late one
evening at her apartment when I would see that frown again and hear
her say, ``Oh. Maybe you should go home after all.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the date was a bit strained, and there were no more
dates. I blamed her, although it could have been my fault: by
obsessing on her Bass-or-nothing philosophy, maybe I was the one
being too picky. Or maybe we were both to blame.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it seemed obvious that excessive pickiness was a
local epidemic. I went on to obtain scientific proof by analyzing
random samples of personal ads in New York magazine and in the city
magazines of Boston, Baltimore, Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison with singles in other cities, New Yorkers
described fewer of their own traits in the ads, but they listed
nearly twice as many criteria for any potential date. One New York
woman required a man who played polo (and was over 5-foot-10). The
prototypical New York ad was the one beginning: ``Not willing to
settle? Neither am I!'' It could have been taken out by any of the
singles in the HBO show.
</P>
<P>
   When New York's uncompromising men and women meet in the social
battlefields of Manhattan, the result is a lot of veterans on both
sides who are too scarred and toughened to ever get along with each
other. Their best hope is to look for love outside the Manhattan
singles scene, out among men who aren't jerks and women who aren't
armored _ out there in the quaint communities where you can still
see high heels and stockings.
</P>
<P>
   But now that last hope is endangered. Now that the genial souls
out there have seen ``Sex and the City,'' how many of them will
ever risk going out with anyone from here again? After watching
even one of the episodes, how can they respect us in the morning?

URBAN BEEKEEPERS DEFY LAW FOR HIVES AND HONEY

 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The setting _ the rooftop of a brownstone on West
113th Street in Manhattan _ hardly evoked the lazy bee-hum of
rusticity. Looming to the north was the brick bulk of Butler
Library at Columbia University. To the southeast jutted the
latticework scaffolding of the ever-unfinished Cathedral of St.
John the Divine.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the swirl of bees hanging around two honeybee hives
formed a cloud about the heads of four of the brownstone's
inhabitants, Jill Laurie Goodman and her three children, urban
beekeepers all. ``Just look at them,'' Ms. Goodman said proudly of
her bees, as if she were acknowledging a blue-ribbon Charolais
steer at the county fair. ``Aren't they amazing?''
</P>
<P>
   If pigeon-fancying was the rooftop recreation of choice during
the ``On the Waterfront'' era, urban beekeeping is poised to become
a hot new bull-market avocation. Two summers ago, David Graves, a
veteran bee master who was on the roof helping Ms. Goodman tend the
hives, knew of just one beehive in the five boroughs: now he is
aware of 13 hives in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx. And city
beekeepers claim that there could be twice that number.
</P>
<P>
   But few beekeepers reveal their presence because, under the New
York City Health Code, the activity is illegal. Section 161.01 bans
keeping animals that are ``wild, ferocious, fierce, dangerous or
naturally inclined to do harm.'' An offender could be fined up to
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``By nature, bees are wild, and people are in danger of being
stung,'' pointed out John Gadd, a spokesman for the city's
Department of Health. ``And for those who are allergic to bees,
it's a &UR;  &LR; life-or-death issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many other beekeepers, Graves _ a veteran hive master
from Becket, Mass., who introduced Ms. Goodman to bee &UR;  &LR; mania two
summers ago _ contends that honeybees rarely sting when they are
away from their rooftop hives, which are locked and inaccessible to
pedestrians. ``A ban on bees is like a ban on nature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graves has become the Johnny Appleseed of New York beedom. Four
days a week, the 49-year-old farmer visits New York to sell
home-produced honeys, jams, jellies and maple syrups from his
Berkshire Berries cart. For six years he has been a fixture in the
Greenmarkets at Union Square and the World Trade Center and on West
77th Street at Columbus Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, to increase the supply of his signature offering,
New York City Honey, Graves began establishing hives on buildings
owned by sympathetic New Yorkers. He maintains the hives, trains
the owners to be beekeepers and gives them some of the honey as
rent. The rest goes into his golden bottles, emblazoned with
yellow-and-blue labels proclaiming his product ``Bee-licious.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Health Department plans any queen-bee busts is
unclear. Last month the agency faced the rage of a group called New
York City Friends of Ferrets when it adopted a list of more than
150 animal species deemed unfit for urban living.
</P>
<P>
   As for honeybees, the Health Department ``has no idea what it's
talking about,'' said Peter J. Solomon, a Manhattan investment
banker and former deputy mayor for economic policy and development,
who has kept bees for 21 years at various country homes. ``It's
ridiculous to say they are dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some bee authorities concur. ``I disagree with the city's rating
of the bees as a threat, though I can understand the city's
concern,'' said Dr. Michael S. Engel, an entomologist at the
American Museum of Natural History. ``Honeybees won't hurt you
unless you grab them, or go after their hive. They are docile and
just want to go about their business of gathering pollen and
nectar.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Engel contended, no ban ``can get rid of bees as a
threat in New York'' because the city is home to millions of
indigenous bumblebees, sweat bees and wood-boring carpenter bees,
none of them raised by humans. Beyond that, yellow jackets are more
dangerous than honeybees, Engel said, adding, ``Wasps are
aggressive hunters looking for the kill.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the allergy question, ``If people are allergic to bees,
they shouldn't be beekeepers, but that shouldn't mean that other
people can't be beekeepers,'' said Ms. Goodman of Morningside
Heights. ``Some people are allergic to peanuts, but that shouldn't
stop stores from selling peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, but why beekeeping? ``After you do it, everything
else in life is calm,'' said Solomon, the investment banker. ``Let
me tell you, 40,000 bees will teach you the power of concentration
and patience.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the Big Apple? ``I suppose I had some leftover farming
yearning from the '60s,'' said Karen Lamberti, who has a hive on
the roof of her East Harlem brownstone at 101st Street between Park
and Lexington Avenues. ``This is a way to do a bit of farming in
the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have culinary motives. Carl Redding, 35, hopes for ``a
New York honey harvest for our Spicy Honey Chicken,'' he said. The
dish is a specialty of his Harlem establishment, Amy Ruth's
Restaurant. With Graves' help, Redding ensconced a hive on the roof
of the restaurant, at 113 W. 116th St. near Lenox Avenue, and tends
the honeybees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think it's important to teach kids from our
neighborhood about farming,'' said Redding, who was the chief of
staff for the Rev. Al Sharpton before the restaurant industry
beckoned, ``so they'll know that honey is made in hives, and not in
the supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goodman, a 50-year-old lawyer who is the counsel to the New
York State Judicial Committee on Women and the Courts, decided that
apiculture was the bee's knees after she happened upon Graves' farm
stand at the Greenmarket. She noticed his demonstration beehive
carrying the sign: ``We are very gentle. We'd like to share our New
York City honey. Do you have a rooftop?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goodman was intrigued. She then consulted her husband,
Melvin Jules Bukiet, 45, a writer whose most recent novel is
``Signs and Wonders.'' ``I said I could think of nothing more
terrifying, but this seemed to be a fascinating terror,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now she and her children _ Madelaine, 15, Louisa, 13, and Miles,
11 _ have set up a second beehive, their own, and enjoy beekeeping
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great because you can leave your tensions behind,'' Ms.
Goodman said. ``Honeybees are truly amazing creatures when you get
to know them. We have such a complex relationship with them: we
care for them, and provide them with a home, but we have no idea
where they go. They have this whole mysterious life out there in
the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Less theoretically, her daughter Madelaine volunteered, ``If you
spend time with them, they're furry and really cute.''

REGULATORS TO INVESTIGATE BID FOR BRITISH PUBS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain)   (jw) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British regulators waded into a takeover brawl
Wednesday for the 3,500 British pubs of Allied Domecq PLC, ordering
an investigation of a bid by Whitbread PLC that had already been
endorsed by Allied's board.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise order, made by the Trade and Industry Ministry,
delayed Whitbread's possible takeover of Allied for at least three
more months and increased the chances that a rival bid by Punch
Taverns Group Ltd. might succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Allied's shareholders are set to vote on the competing bids at a
special meeting on July 23. But, said Ben Maitland, an analyst with
Sutherlands Ltd., a brokerage house, ``I really can't see any
rational investor voting for Whitbread.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the investigation sent Whitbread's shares tumbling 3.7
percent, to 929 pence, or about $14.40. Allied's stock dropped 2.9
percent, to 575.5 pence, or about $8.92. But shares in Bass PLC
which is backing Punch with an offer to buy 650 of the 3,500 pubs
if its bid succeeds, rose 14 pence, 1.5 percent, to 938.5 pence, or
$14.54.
</P>
<P>
   Since half of Whitbread's offer for the pubs is in stock, the
fall in its share price further lowered the value of its bid.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Punch has made a sweetened all-cash offer of
2.925 billion pounds ($4.353 billion) to outbid Whitbread, but
Allied's board said it would urge shareholders to opt for
Whitbread's 2.84 billion pounds ($4.40 billion) offer.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Byers, the government minister in charge of competition
issues, said he ordered the investigation because of concerns about
retail and brewing competition. British law limits the number of
pubs owned by brewers like Whitbread, which makes its own beer.
Whitbread had pledged to complete its bid by Aug. 2, but the
regulators' inquiry could take until Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Allied's board had said it was endorsing the Whitbread offer
because it had fewer risks and would be completed quickly.

`NEW WOLVES' NOT EXACTLY DANCING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe it's just the ``w'' word _ wolves.
</P>
<P>
   The reintroduction of the nearly extinct Mexican wolf into the
American Southwest has initiated an emotional argument that seems
to go way beyond the paltry numbers involved. The wolf is a
creature able to stir passion; the species has such a dark hold of
human imagination that rational debate may be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Bass has entered the circle with the credentials to be
fair. The Texas native _ from deep in the heart of often-militant
opposition to wolves _ is a conservationist and a hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The author has set the ambitious goal of being both journalistic
and literary in ``The New Wolves'' (Lyons; $18.95). He has made his
166-page book readable and enlightening, though a few lapses weaken
the vivid picture he has painted.
</P>
<P>
   Bass does a good job of setting up the situation before the
return of Mexican wolves to Eastern Arizona's Blue Range: The
slaughter of the wolf and other predators paralleled the killing of
bison and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Bass introduces biologists and volunteers inspired by the idea
of reintroduction, interviews a ranching couple who favor holistic
management, making no attempt to kill predators, and a gadfly who
believes the program is doomed to failure, another example of
questionable government planning.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nowhere does Bass interview the ranchers who would just as
soon kill the wolves on sight because they pose a threat to
livestock on the parched and often overgrazed land. Bass does note
that each rancher losing any of his herd will be compensated and
that the losses would surely be minimal. He is sympathetic to the
wolves' plight; however, the views of detractors whose voices must
be heard in an open-minded forum are nowhere in these pages.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the author shows a delicate touch. Describing the
release of the wolves into the wild, he writes, ``Their eyes carry
more than ours do.'' He provides fine profiles of the beasts and
their territories. But he falls into the role of a mystic, and it
can be grating.
</P>
<P>
   He gets so carried away that he resorts to extravagant metaphors
that are unnecessarily intrusive: ``Do the increases in rumors
reflect that the wolves are already there, or do the increases in
rumor compress to a point of saturation, a density of desire in the
air, that is finally sufficient to lure and welcome wolves back
into that land, as a weather system rolls from a high-pressure area
into a low, or as the tides follow the moon and the Earth?''
</P>
<P>
   Come on.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Bass has sketched the basic details of the story
and there's a lot of good writing. But readers will find the book
not a meal but an appetizer. A wolf would need more. Our rating: HH
{ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If ever there were a true recreational mecca, Colorado's Rocky
Mountains fit the bill. For a memorable trip to the ``backbone of
the world'' without many on-trail Sig Alerts, two titles could
steer you in the right direction:
</P>
<P>
   Different problems limit the appeal of Gerry Roach's
``Colorado's Indian Peaks: Classic Hikes and Climbs'' (Fulcrum;
$16.95). Triathlon types will be the main audience. Weekend
warriors better stay at home; there are no hikes for beginners.
</P>
<P>
   The Boulder, Colo., author is a world-class mountaineer who has
climbed Mount Everest and was only the second climber to scale the
highest peak on every continent. He has climbed all of Colorado's
14,000-plus-feet pinnacles and displays an expert knowledge of the
region described in the 180-page no-nonsense guidebook.
</P>
<P>
   The topographic maps are good and directions concise for the 21
trailheads, 29 hikes, 49 peaks and 127 routes. But there's another
number _ one, as in (begin ital)the(end ital) big question: What is
special about this region? The mediocre black-and-white photos
certainly don't show it. A couple of descriptive pages _ not
flowery, but informative _ would be helpful. Every area is unique
in some way; if not, why travel so far to get there? Our rating: HH
</P>
<P>
   Maurizio Valerio has compiled a list of the best outdoor
businesses in ``Top Rated Rocky Mountain Adventures''
(Picked-By-You Guides; $18.95). Ratings are based on service,
knowledge and performance. Categories include big-game and bird
hunting, fly-fishing and other angling, wilderness adventures and
whitewater trips.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some major gaps in the 278 pages. The author has
failed to include any price information; these kinds of trips could
be fabulous, and fabulously expensive. Maps are also inadequate.

FORMING THEIR OWN CORPORATION, UMPIRES INC., UMPIRES THREATEN TO
QUIT SEPT. 2  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying that tensions were ``at an all-time high and
the relationship between Major League Baseball and umpires at an
all-time low,'' the umpires' union leader said that 57 of the 66
major league umpires met in Philadelphia Wednesday and resigned
from their jobs, effective Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips, the head of the union, who talked about the
tensions and the relationship, said the umpires signed letters of
resignation at an unprecedented midseason meeting. He said he would
forward the letters to the American and National league offices
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under a clause in their collective bargaining agreement with the
leagues, the umpires stand to collect $15,475,000 in termination
pay, Phillips said. The termination pay scale runs from $150,000
for a 10-year umpire to $400,000 for an umpire with 20 or more
years of service.
</P>
<P>
   The 57 umpires, he also disclosed, signed contracts with Umpires
Inc., an organization that he said was incorporated in the last few
weeks and will provide umpiring services. Phillips said some or all
of the nine umpires who did not attend the meeting may also resign
and join Umpires Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the loss of their regular umpires for the final month
of the regular season and the post-season, the leagues presumably
would have to negotiate a contract with Umpires Inc. to gain the
services of the same umpires or hire non-union and amateur umpires,
as they have during previous work stoppages.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, the executive vice president for baseball
operations in the commissioner's office, said the umpires' action
was ``a unilateral attempt to escalate'' matters between baseball
and the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   It is, he said, ``reflective of the way this thing has
progressed over the last several weeks,'' adding, ``We won't allow
this or any other development in this relationship to threaten a
game or games this season.''
</P>
<P>
   A fight between baseball officials and the umpires has been
brewing since early this year. Phillips said the recent three-day
suspension of Tom Hallion, a National League umpire, for bumping a
player had nothing to do with the umpires' action.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips ticked off a list of grievances that, he said, led to
Wednesday's action: Threats of dismissal, the suggestion that
baseball officials have created accountability on the part of
umpires, the strike zone issue, the dispute over pay for umpires in
the games between the Baltimore Orioles and the Cuban team,
``having amateurs in team offices monitoring pitches by television,
the hiring of amateur umpires to supervise at the minor league
level and to make a determination of the careers of professional
umpires and the fact that some of these amateurs have scabbed in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan to have the umpires removed from the jurisdiction of
the league offices and be centralized in the commissioner's office
might be a factor, Phillips said, ``but we really don't know what
that plan is.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of change would be a subject for negotiation for a new
labor contract. The current agreement expires Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped to begin negotiations well before the existing
contract expired,'' Alderson said by telephone from Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said many of the umpires wanted to strike, but their
labor agreement has a no-strike clause that says the umpires agree
to arbitrate disputes during the life of the agreement. He said he
advised them that they could resign, and that was the course they
chose.
</P>
<P>
   It is a move obviously designed to put the umpires on the
offensive and the leagues on the defensive. The leagues can ignore
Umpires Inc. and seek umpires elsewhere, but that procedure always
has undermined the leagues' bargaining position in work stoppages.
Before too many games have been played, managers and players, not
to mention fans, have complained that the replacement umpires are
incapable of performing the jobs and the regular umpires are
needed. Phillips said the umpires' action is not a threat to
strike. ``A strike is a union-sponsored withholding of services,''
he said by telephone from Philadelphia. ``This, in fact, is a
resignation of their position and their signing with another
corporation to provide services.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpires, Phillips added, ``want to continue working as
umpires, but they want to feel good about themselves and would
rather not continue as umpires if they have to continue under
present circumstances. They feel in the past seven months or so,
they have been humiliated and denigrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if baseball could try to negotiate a new contract to keep
the umpires working past Sept. 2, Phillips said, ``That's an
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   In yet another development, Phillips said 220 of the 228 minor
league umpires voted to form a union with him as their lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minor league umpires are considering a work stoppage at
this time,'' he said. &QL;

EX-LAWYER MAKES RECORD CATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ Practicing law. Growing lemons and avocados in
Ventura County. Raising rice and operating a duck-hunting club in
Northern California. The hectic schedule was interfering with
hunting and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something had to go,'' said Roger Borrell, 60, of Somis. ``So
I closed the law firm.''
</P>
<P>
   With the workout he's gotten on the water lately, it might be
easier for Borrell to go back to trying cases.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, shortly after anchoring his private boat
for the night off Santa Rosa Island, he boated a pending-world,
all-tackle record California halibut that would tilt the scales at
58 pounds, 6 ounces when officially weighed some four hours later
in Channel Islands Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to 25 annual angling days around the Channel Islands,
the avid outdoorsman's heaviest halibut to that time was a
43-pounder, followed by a number weighing more than 30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fish was different,'' Borrell said. ``It was a different
fight. The other fish were like bringing up a dead weight. This one
didn't want to come up early on. I wasn't sure if it was a a
halibut or a (traditionally tougher-fighting) white seabass.''
</P>
<P>
   That's really saying something for a man of Borrell's
proportions, all 6-foot-5, 290 pounds of him. Gaffing the fish was
another story for Borrell's brother Robert, 57, of Camarillo, who
is no pipsqueak himself at 6-3, 240.
</P>
<P>
   Halibut usually come up in horizontal fashion, but this one
breached the surface headfirst, making it difficult to gaff the
specimen's slender profile. There's a reason they're called
flatfish.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Borrell downplayed the skill of hooking his hefty halibut
and credited the gaffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can really hook a record fish,'' he said. ``It's just
a matter of sheer luck _ right place at the right time. But after
you hook it, you can't make any mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good chance to make a mistake. It's tough to gaff
something so skinny, and it was biting and snapping and snarling.
But my brother did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   The catch came at cocktail hour on June 26 on the second day of
a three-day outing. The flattie was fooled on a live squid, a
}-ounce leadhead with a 3/0 hook and 25-pound line _ a classic
setup for white seabass, the evening's target species. So it was a
surprise that a halibut took the bait. Usually Borrell aims for
flatfish with a sliding egg sinker and a larger single hook or
treble hook.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-inch brute proved too long for the livewell and the fish
box, so a 150-quart ice chest was employed for the job.
</P>
<P>
   A glut of California halibut has been caught recently, most
notably the 57.6-pounder taken June 6 off Santa Rosa Island by Will
Akins of Grover Beach. It was more than 4 pounds heavier than the
standing world-record 53\-pounder caught nearly 11 years ago by
Russ Harmon, owner of Cisco's Sportfishing in Oxnard. Halibut
weighing more than 30 pounds are not uncommon. And John Whalen of
Capistrano Beach took a pending-world, 4-pound-line-class record,
28.6-pound flattie on June 9 in Dana Point Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The big catches have anglers and biologists wondering.
</P>
<P>
   With all the squid congregating around the Channel Islands,
halibut are sure to follow their favorite food, Borrell believes;
and the more halibut, the more big halibut.
</P>
<P>
   Stands to reason, says Cal State Northridge biology professor
Larry G. Allen, who also feels the cooler waters driven into the
region by La Nina might be an element attracting more halibut.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, both Borrell and Allen said, halibut are enjoying
the residual effects of the gillnet-ban initiative that went into
effect in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Borrell's big catch came during a couple of unproductive days in
which he only caught two fish; they just happened to be personal
bests. One day earlier, he nailed a 39-pound white seabass on
fresh-dead squid and 20-pound line at Anacapa Island, bettering his
previous mark for the species by five pounds. &QL;

TOURING SUBURBS, MRS. CLINTON IS SILENT ON COMMUTER TAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE CENTRE, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton steered clear
Wednesday of a political dispute that has pitted New York City
against its suburbs this year, declining to say whether she
supported the repeal of the payroll tax that commuters have paid to
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the first lady said the ``larger issue'' was that the
state does not receive its fair share of assistance from
Washington, creating a higher tax burden for residents. Mrs.
Clinton made her remarks on the second day of a tour through the
city's suburbs as she prepares for a possible race for Senate next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters from New York's populous and politically important
suburban communities had long resented the tax. Although Mrs.
Clinton was clearly familiar with the commuter tax, she declined
twice to state her opinion on the issue. It has caused considerable
discomfort for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City, her
potential Republican opponent, who pleaded unsuccessfully with
Albany lawmakers to keep it in place.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton did embrace an argument advanced by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat who is retiring after 2000, that the
state pays more in taxes to Washington than it gets back in federal
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very interested in seeing what could be done to make sure
that New York got more of its fair share in federal support,
because I think that would help some of the taxing problems that
really are an important issue here,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   She made her remarks during a brief news conference at the end
of the first of two ``Listening to New Yorkers'' forums she held on
Long Island Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a forum that focused on gun control, an issue that Democrats
believe will be important in next year's congressional races, Mrs.
Clinton joined Democrats in harshly criticizing the National Rifle
Association for its success this year in blocking further
restrictions on the purchase of guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very clear example of the way the public allows a
small, dedicated group to determine federal policy and really
determine whether or not we're going to be as safe as we could be
in this country,'' she said.  &QL;

WORKING MOTHER REGAINS CUSTODY OF TWO CHILDREN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Florida appeals court Wednesday overturned an earlier decision
that had denied a Miami lawyer and mother primary custody of her
two children because she worked long hours.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, the lawyer, Alice Hector, will regain
primary custody of her two young girls from her former husband, Bob
Young.
</P>
<P>
   Young, an architect who had been unemployed for several years,
had argued that he should be given custody of the two girls because
he had spent more time with them than his former-wife, who often
worked late as a partner at Steel, Hector &AMP; Davis, a Miami law
firm. Ms. Hector's uncle is a partner of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Green, Young's lawyer, said Wednesday that Young would
try to appeal the decision. ``I know the court worked hard on this
decision,'' she said, ``but we think it is very wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Young nor Ms. Hector could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Seven judges on the 10-judge appeals panel ruled Wednesday that
the trial court that had originally heard the custody battle had
been correct when it awarded primary custody of the girls to Ms.
Hector.
</P>
<P>
   The majority disagreed with Young's contention that the trial
court had favored awarding the children to Ms. Hector simply
because she was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Young had argued that the trial court had discriminated against
him and all stay-at-home fathers. ``Dads can be moms, too,'' he had
said last year.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, when the appeals panel overturned the trial
court's decision, Ms. Hector had said that she believed that the
three-man panel took a hard stand against her simply because she
was a mother pursuing a challenging career. She insisted that
despite her demanding job, she spent more time with the two girls
than her former husband did.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ms. Hector quit her job at Steel, Hector and opened
her own small firm so that she could work more flexible hours.
</P>
<P>
   Young is a senior program director at the YMCA of Greater Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The majority on the appeals court said that the trial court was
correct when it relied on evidence suggesting that Ms. Hector had
been a constant and dominant influence in the children's lives,
while Young had not. When the two girls were very young, Young had
been away from home for months at a time, settling business matters
and hunting for gold believed buried in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, Young had been a volunteer at the girls'
school, founded a Brownie troop and coached the soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   The three judges who dissented Wednesday were the same three who
had ruled against Ms. Hector last year. In his dissent, Alan R.
Schwartz, the chief judge of the Third District State Court of
Appeals, said, ``there was no question'' that the trial court's
decision had been ``dictated by the evil of gender bias.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said that if the genders of the ``hard-working and
high-earning lawyer and the stay-at- home architect'' had been
reversed, ``the male attorney's claim for custody would have been
virtually laughed out of court.''

TIME FOR TUNA SHUFFLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY BRIGHTENBURG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ With the albacore action heating up, fishing
fanatics are out in force. The long-finned species arguably gets
anglers the most frenzied _ and frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   To minimize anguish and maximize success, follow these rules of
etiquette. Call it the tuna shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely can it be predicted when or where the nomadic albies will
hit. Therefore, they are usually discovered when one fish strikes a
trolled tuna feather and the rest of the school follows it to the
boat as it is reeled in. This is when things start getting crazy _
and when problems can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Make certain all tuna feathers that aren't hooked up are reeled
in posthaste; don't assume the crew will reel them in. Unattended
lines can break off those connected to fish or other lines
subsequently cast.
</P>
<P>
   On the slide _ when the boat is put into neutral to allow the
school to catch up to it _ toss your line off to the side, not
directly over the stern, to avoid cutting off the angler with the
right-of-way who is fighting the trolled fish. Ask the crew if
you're uncertain what direction to throw.
</P>
<P>
   Most often rods should be brought to the bait tank, not left at
the rail to wreak havoc with hooked-up anglers. Wait your turn for
bait and be careful not to poke the deckhand in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Fish with the wind in your face. When the wind is to your back,
the line goes under the boat and all you catch is another line or
the propeller.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly, follow your line. ``No angle, no
tangle,'' as the deckhands would say. That is, keep the line
straight in front of your rod to reduce the chance of fouling
another line. That often means shuffling up and down the deck,
ducking under and going over other rods in quick procession. But
don't get ``albacoritis'' _ tunnel vision so bad you can only see
for leading your fish; you could crash into others and cause an
injury or, worse, a lost fish. Instead, firmly but as politely as
possible state, ``Coming down,'' ``Over,'' or ``Under,'' as you
weave up and down the rails.
</P>
<P>
   When the fish is first spotted, call out ``color'' to alert the
deckhand for gaffing. As the tuna comes to gaff, keep its head in
the water to ease the deckhand's job. As the fish comes over the
rail, put the reel in free-spool so that if it wriggles off the
gaff and back into the brine the tightened drag won't snap your
line. &QL;

TIMES SQUARE TO FEATURE WRESTLING RESTAURANT

 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just when it seemed that Times Square could not get
more crowded, the World Wrestling Federation and a major accounting
firm are squeezing into the district, which has become a
kaleidoscope of tourists, neon signs, entertainment centers and
corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF closed a deal Wednesday to create a massive, $25 million
theme restaurant with more than 600 seats in the old Paramount
Theater site at the northwest corner of 43rd Street and Broadway,
where 50 years ago Frank Sinatra crooned for hysterical teen--age
fans. Singers may perform on this restaurant's stage, but the
entertainment will center on wrestling matches between the WWF's
stars, like Stone Cold Steve Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extraordinary entertainment complex that I believe
will be the most spectacular site in Times Square,'' said Robert
Gries Jr., who heads the investment group that is developing the
complex with the WWF. ``We expect to open at the beginning of
November.''
</P>
<P>
   And next week, Ernst &AMP; Young, one of the largest accounting and
advisory firms in the world, is expected to sign a deal to build a
1.1 million-square-foot office tower a block away, at the southwest
corner of 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue, according to city and
state officials and real estate executives.
</P>
<P>
   That deal comes as an 855,000-square-foot headquarters for the
news agency Reuters is beginning to rise on the north side of the
street, and Conde Nast Publications is moving into 4 Times Square,
the new 1.6 million-square-foot tower across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times Square is about to burst,'' said C. Bradley Mendelson, a
real estate broker at Insignia/ESG who worked on the deal with the
WWF.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the summer, the E-Walk entertainment complex is to
open on the north side of 42nd Street near Eighth Avenue, while
Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum and the 25-screen AMC Entertainment
cineplex on the south side should open a month or two later. The
National Basketball Association is negotiating to open NBA City, a
theme restaurant, at a site farther north on Broadway, and
PricewaterhouseCoopers, another accounting firm, is negotiating
with developer Douglas Durst for a space on 42nd Street and the
Avenue of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six years ago, many New Yorkers avoided Times Square,
which was overrun with hustlers, peep shows and T-shirt shops.
Today it is jammed with cars, office workers and an estimated 25
million tourists a year, a recipe for pedestrian gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   The three new office towers will add about 10,000 office workers
to the mix. A street-front studio for ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America'' will open in September, potentially creating the same
kind of tie-ups that have been generated by the MTV studios on
Broadway between 44th and 45th Streets, where cheering fans often
form blockades.
</P>
<P>
   The city and the Times Square Business Improvement District are
developing plans to deal with the problem, although no one expects
a solution anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're succeeding in making Times Square more attractive,''
said Brendan Sexton, president of the BID, ``but we definitely need
more sidewalks.''
</P>
<P>
   That accountants and wrestlers are moving to Times Square
illustrates how safe the area has become. Still, there are
financial risks.
</P>
<P>
   Gries and the World Wrestling Federation bought control of their
nearly completed space in the Paramount Building from Planet
Hollywood, the now-beleaguered chain of theme restaurants. Planet
Hollywood had spent more than $13 million building the space for a
live music venue called Sound Republic before it ran out of money.
According to people involved in the deal, Planet Hollywood sold the
space Wednesday for less than $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gries, an investment banker, prefers to call the WWF project an
entertainment complex with good food rather than a theme
restaurant. But he expects to capitalize on the popularity of the
WWF, which broadcasts its weekly matches to 120 countries and
tallied up $500 million in retail sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in addition to the restaurant, the complex would
include a retail store, an interactive arcade and a theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We not only have a signature property on the most trafficked
corner of Times Square,'' Gries said, ``but the demographics of the
WWF fit in perfectly with the people who are coming to Times
Square.''

ADVERTISING COLUMN: LINCOLN LOOKS TO SELL CAR TO A YOUNGER MARKET
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Ill., Fla., Mass.) (rk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ When American car lovers thought of luxury
cars years ago _ long before Lexus came along to steal boomers'
hearts from BMW, which had won them over from Mercedes-Benz _ they
envisioned Cadillacs and Lincolns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lincoln is embarking on a new campaign trying to make it so
again, though with a twist: it has designed a car that looks and
drives like a European or Japanese sport sedan, and it plans to
advertise it with scenes that could easily have been shot in
Europe. The ads for the model, though, proclaim, ``American
Luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, a division of the Ford Motor Co., is pinning its hopes
on the Lincoln LS, which Detroit has nicknamed the Baby Lincoln. It
isn't the usual soft-steering, bench-seated road barge that Lincoln
has been known for, but a smaller car that could easily be mistaken
for a BMW. ``It is a product that's going to change the face of
Lincoln long term,'' Mark Hutchins, president of the Lincoln
Mercury division, said.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers think of Lincoln and Cadillac, the General Motors
marque, as once-great luxury brands that were allowed to fall from
grace. And they are divided over whether Lincoln's strategy, like
Cadillac's before it, can redeem the brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Lincoln and the problem with Cadillac is that
when you buy a BMW, you're getting prestige along with a pretty
good car,'' said Jack F. Trout, president of Trout &AMP; Partners, a
marketing strategy firm based in Greenwich, Conn. ``Lincoln is not
a prestigious brand.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that the move to sell a smaller Lincoln, like GM's
attempt to sell the Catera, a small Cadillac, three years ago, will
fail to draw the younger clients who both automakers crave as many
of their loyal, gray-haired customers slip past their best
car-buying days.
</P>
<P>
   Others, while skeptical that Lincoln will succeed, applaud the
plans. ``Overall, it is a sensible move,'' said C.B. Bhattacharya,
associate professor of marketing at Boston University. ``They have
no choice if they want to keep the brand alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln executives said they studied earlier moves and mistakes
by Cadillac to plot their attack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Cadillac, similarly alarmed at the steady slide of its
sales, brought out the Cadillac Catera. The car, imported from
Germany, failed to win over car buffs as a serious alternative to
an entry-level Mercedes or BMW.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to get past Cadillac's stodgy image, the Catera's
initial campaign featured a cartoon duck. Then, as it tried to draw
women buyers, it ran a spot showing Cindy Crawford in a black
leather dominatrix getup _ an ad that was pulled only after the
wife of a GM executive complained. Soon, the duck disappeared, too.
Catera sales have been slower than hoped.
</P>
<P>
   James F. Rogers, Lincoln Mercury's vice president for marketing,
said Lincoln was taking a different tack. First, it designed a
``new from the ground up'' car, one winning praise from buff books
like Motor Trend and Automobile. It also named the car the Lincoln
LS, to link it closely to the primary brand _ rather than
distancing it as Catera did.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, he said, Lincoln was not going to trivialize the
purchase of a product which starts at $32,000. ``That means no
ducks,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   While Cadillac bet on a small luxury car, Lincoln was
experimenting on a different front, where it enjoyed some success _
drawing younger buyers into showrooms to see Navigator, its giant
sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln's sales, which stood at 231,660 in 1990, then slipped to
141,476 by 1996, have since crept up, according to Ward's Auto
Infobank, to 187,121 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigator, which was introduced in July 1997, was helping
sales and turbo-charging profits _ and perhaps more important,
lowering the average age of Lincoln buyers. The average Navigator
buyer is 50 years old, while the average buyer of a Continental is
64 and the average buyer of a Town Car is 68.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Lincoln's strategy, Cadillac panicked. It
scrambled to borrow a sport utility from other GM divisions _ the
GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Tahoe _ slapped on some leather and a
fancier grille and called it an Escalade. Cadillac's managers were
so worried about losing the rank of the best-selling luxury brand
to Lincoln that they even falsified sales numbers to hold onto the
title at the end of last year, a scandal the division admitted only
in May.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, both brands adopted the same overall strategy, but
reversed the order of vehicle introductions _ which could help
Lincoln, according to Bhattacharya. ``That makes the task a little
easier,'' he said. ``It would've been much harder for them to go
from the existing Town Cars to a luxury sport sedan.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln isn't taking any chances. It is spending ``very
significantly more'' introducing the LS than it spent to introduce
the Navigator two years ago, Rogers said. Trade publications
estimate the figure to be $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, by Lincoln's longtime agency, Y&AMP;R Advertising, part of
Young &AMP; Rubicam, are set to begin Saturday during coverage of the
British Open golf tournament on ABC. The splashiest spot is 60
seconds of sophisticated, surreal, vaguely European images. A
pianist appears, then the camera pulls back; the image turns out to
be on a CD being pushed into the player in an LS. A couple listen
as they drive along, but another pullback shows them to be tiny
beings on a chessboard, in a game being played on a train.
</P>
<P>
   An LS passes the train, which _ another pullback _ turns out to
be a model train. Finally, the car appears again, on winding roads
in what could be the mountains of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to TV and print ads, Lincoln arranged an unusual
sponsorship with Advance Publications' Conde Nast magazine group.
</P>
<P>
   Its staff assembled ``City Source,'' a guide to events in New
York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco, Berlin and
London, stuffed solely with ads for the Lincoln LS.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast then mined its data bases for subscribers to Vogue,
GQ, Vanity Fair, Wired and its other magazines, looking for those
matching the desired audience _ college graduates 30 to 54 years
old with a household income of at least $75,000. The 1.2 million
subscribers with similar demographics will receive the City Source
supplement with August issues of their magazines.

EX-LAWYER MAKES RECORD CATCH
</HEADLINE>
 FISH WEIGHT IN FOURTH GRAPH-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ Practicing law. Growing lemons and avocados in
Ventura County. Raising rice and operating a duck-hunting club in
Northern California. The hectic schedule was interfering with
hunting and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something had to go,'' said Roger Borrell, 60, of Somis. ``So
I closed the law firm.''
</P>
<P>
   With the workout he's gotten on the water lately, it might be
easier for Borrell to go back to trying cases.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, shortly after anchoring his private boat
for the night off Santa Rosa Island, he boated a pending-world,
all-tackle record California halibut that would tilt the scales at
58.6 pounds when officially weighed some four hours later in
Channel Islands Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to 25 annual angling days around the Channel Islands,
the avid outdoorsman's heaviest halibut to that time was a
43-pounder, followed by a number weighing more than 30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fish was different,'' Borrell said. ``It was a different
fight. The other fish were like bringing up a dead weight. This one
didn't want to come up early on. I wasn't sure if it was a a
halibut or a (traditionally tougher-fighting) white seabass.''
</P>
<P>
   That's really saying something for a man of Borrell's
proportions, all 6-foot-5, 290 pounds of him. Gaffing the fish was
another story for Borrell's brother Robert, 57, of Camarillo, who
is no pipsqueak himself at 6-3, 240.
</P>
<P>
   Halibut usually come up in horizontal fashion, but this one
breached the surface headfirst, making it difficult to gaff the
specimen's slender profile. There's a reason they're called
flatfish.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Borrell downplayed the skill of hooking his hefty halibut
and credited the gaffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can really hook a record fish,'' he said. ``It's just
a matter of sheer luck _ right place at the right time. But after
you hook it, you can't make any mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good chance to make a mistake. It's tough to gaff
something so skinny, and it was biting and snapping and snarling.
But my brother did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   The catch came at cocktail hour on June 26 on the second day of
a three-day outing. The flattie was fooled on a live squid, a
}-ounce leadhead with a 3/0 hook and 25-pound line _ a classic
setup for white seabass, the evening's target species. So it was a
surprise that a halibut took the bait. Usually Borrell aims for
flatfish with a sliding egg sinker and a larger single hook or
treble hook.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-inch brute proved too long for the livewell and the fish
box, so a 150-quart ice chest was employed for the job.
</P>
<P>
   A glut of California halibut has been caught recently, most
notably the 57.6-pounder taken June 6 off Santa Rosa Island by Will
Akins of Grover Beach. It was more than 4 pounds heavier than the
standing world-record 53\-pounder caught nearly 11 years ago by
Russ Harmon, owner of Cisco's Sportfishing in Oxnard. Halibut
weighing more than 30 pounds are not uncommon. And John Whalen of
Capistrano Beach took a pending-world, 4-pound-line-class record,
28.6-pound flattie on June 9 in Dana Point Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The big catches have anglers and biologists wondering.
</P>
<P>
   With all the squid congregating around the Channel Islands,
halibut are sure to follow their favorite food, Borrell believes;
and the more halibut, the more big halibut.
</P>
<P>
   Stands to reason, says Cal State Northridge biology professor
Larry G. Allen, who also feels the cooler waters driven into the
region by La Nina might be an element attracting more halibut.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, both Borrell and Allen said, halibut are enjoying
the residual effects of the gillnet-ban initiative that went into
effect in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Borrell's big catch came during a couple of unproductive days in
which he only caught two fish; they just happened to be personal
bests. One day earlier, he nailed a 39-pound white seabass on
fresh-dead squid and 20-pound line at Anacapa Island, bettering his
previous mark for the species by five pounds. &QL;

KAREEM'S SON TRYING TO MAKE IMPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is sitting in the stands at The Pyramid between games of the
FILA Summer Pro League, and he has a serious, thoughtful look on
his face when he's asked to reflect on his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely caused some problems for me over the years,''
admits Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the 22-year-old, 6-foot-6, 210-pound
son of the Hall of Fame superstar center who's trying to make an
impression on pro scouts as an off-guard with a team named Play 2
Win. ``Certainly, at times it's been hard on me, and I've had to
endure some indignities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one time I made a collect call, gave my name, and
the operator hung up on me in a huff. She thought I was pulling a
joke. And then opposing players oftentimes during games talk trash
to me about having such a famous father, and not being as good as
he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you learn to live with it, although I must admit there
have been times when I wondered how life would have been for me if
I had just been the son of an ordinary guy out of the public's eye.
Still, I have no serious complaints. I learned a long time ago to
live with it, and it doesn't dominate my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not addressed as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Jr., or was he a
much-desired commodity when he came out of high school Brentwood
Academy like his father was in the middle 1960s when the fellow
then known as Lew Alcindor arrived at UCLA from Power Memorial High
School in New York to help establish the greatest college
basketball dynasty in the history of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no junior after my surname,'' says Abdul-Jabbar. ``I
realize I'm not going to be as good as my dad, but how many
basketball players have been? I tell people I'd be quite satisfied
to accomplish half of what my dad did in the NBA. I'd take playing
10 years, winning three world titles, and winning three MVP
trophies. Nothing wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's also determined to avoid the troubles that have cursed
other sons named after their famous fathers, like Frank Sinatra Jr.
and Joe DiMaggio Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad's been a great father to me,'' says Abdul-Jabbar, whose
parents long have been divorced Habiba was his father's first wife
living with his mother in recent years when he wasn't away
attending college. ``He never pressured me to go into basketball
when I was a kid, and I played as much soccer and baseball in those
days as I did basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom and dad always have emphasized to me the importance of
education and the importance of setting goals for yourself and
reaching them. They've always said if you reach your goals too
easily, then maybe you should set them higher. And if you don't
reach them immediately, just keep trying and don't get frustrated
and give up. They've always been so supportive of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The young Kareem Abdul-Jabbar will be the first to tell you that
he's had a modest basketball career since departing Brentwood
Academy where he averaged 18 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   He originally enrolled at Valparaiso, became frustrated and
transferred to Santa Monica City College, and then wound up playing
two seasons at Western Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the last man on the bench at the start of my junior year
at Western Kentucky,'' says Abdul-Jabbar. ``But then I moved up and
was actually going to start a game, but broke a bone in my left
hand during a practice. That put me out for the season, but I
started at power forward for most of the next season and averaged
six points and four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer is the first time I'm playing my natural position,
which is at the two guard. I had to play power forward at Western
Kentucky because I was the second-biggest guy on the team. I was
really too small to be a power forward. I'm finally playing at a
position in which I think I can show what I'm capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is bright and
introspective, an articulate person who chooses his words
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   He had a 3.5 GPA at Western Kentucky in earning a degree in
psychology, and was acclaimed an Academic All American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I'd like to get into clinical psychology,'' he
says. ``I might try for a doctorate in the field. But right now my
goal is to show scouts that I can play, and I'm hoping I do well
enough to get an offer to play over in Europe or the Far East.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been around basketball as long as he can remember, and
what he remembers most fondly was being around the Forum and
watching his father and Magic Johnson and James Worthy and the rest
of the Showtime cast win world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely pluses to being the son of Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar,'' he says. ``As a youngster, I was able to see all
those great games at the Forum and to meet famous people like Jack
Nicholson. I used to tag along with my father at practices, and see
up close my father and Magic and Pat Riley and all the others. How
many kids can say they did that?''
</P>
<P>
   But he admits there have been moments in his life when it hasn't
been easy being the namesake of one of the legendary figures of
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned to deal with it,'' he says. ``I've tried to live
my own life, and not let my father's overwhelm me. All I can say is
that it's different, definitely different ... ''

HENRY KIMBRO, 87, SPEEDY STAR OF THE NEGRO BASEBALL LEAGUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Kimbro, a perennial All-Star center fielder during the
1940s in a Negro leagues career that spanned 17 seasons, died
Sunday at his home in Nashville. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   An outstanding hitter, speedy on the basepaths and a superb
outfielder with a strong arm who played mostly with the Baltimore
Elite Giants, Kimbro appeared six times in the showcase event of
black baseball, the East-West All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics for the Negro leagues are sketchy, but Kimbro is
believed to have hit over .300 in 10 different seasons. A
left-handed leadoff batter who invariably let the first pitch go
by, Kimbro was adept at slashing low fastballs to the opposite
field.
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself as ``strong as an ox,'' Kimbro had a stocky
build, at 5 feet 8 inches and 175 pounds, with powerful shoulders
and arms developed from swinging on ladders in schoolyards as a
youngster.
</P>
<P>
   Kimbro claimed to have hit a ball over the right-field roof at
Briggs Stadium in Detroit while touring against the Homestead
Grays, but received no plaudits. As he recalled it: ``The next
morning I picked up the newspaper, and you know who hit that ball
out of the park? Hoskins, my left fielder. I was really disgusted,
but I never did say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimbro's speed enabled him to make great catches, but scooping
up bounding balls was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my best friend, a shortstop, lose two front teeth when
the ball caught a bad hop,'' he remembered. ``Fields in those days
had rocks, gravel, all kind of stuff to make a ball kick up in your
face. A grounder would come at me, and everyone would hold their
breath.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Negro leaguers got to the ball park, they were
likely to be worn out by the bus rides through a segregated
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wouldn't let you in a restaurant,'' Kimbro recalled,
``so we'd stop and buy cold cuts in the store, put it in the bus,
ride that night, get to where we were going the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Nashville, Kimbro had a grade-school education,
played sandlot baseball, then made his debut in the Negro leagues
in 1937. He played in the 1941 All-Star Game while with the New
York Black Yankees and then appeared in five consecutive All-Star
Games, from 1943 to 1947, as an Elite Giant.
</P>
<P>
   Kimbro was a teammate of the future Brooklyn Dodger stars Roy
Campanella, Jim Gilliam and Joe Black while playing for the Elite
Giants. But he was too old for the major leagues by the time the
color barrier was broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took things as they come, and went on and did the best I
could,'' he said. ``We just loved to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimbro retired after playing with the Birmingham Black Barons in
1953, then owned a taxi company and a gas station in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Erbia; two sons, Phillip, of
Nashville, and Larry, of Dayton, Ohio; two daughters, Harriet
Hamilton, of Nashville, and Erbia Maria Drew, of Atlanta; two
sisters, Martha Jordan and Louis Hancock, of Nashville, six
grandchildren and one great-grandchild.  &QL;

QUESTIONS SURROUND CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only one question tumbles off the lips of citizens patrolling
the means streets of Long Beach:
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you leaving that parking space?''
</P>
<P>
   But if you're sitting in the Pyramid at Long Beach State and the
subject of the Clippers is broached, the inquiry is obvious:
</P>
<P>
   Are they going to extend the contract of power forward Maurice
Taylor for the maximum $70 million over six seasons?
</P>
<P>
   Or ...
</P>
<P>
   Are the Clippers really in the signing derby for Orlando free
agent guard and Li'l Penny running buddy Anfernee Hardaway?
</P>
<P>
   Or ...
</P>
<P>
   Where is Lamar Odom?
</P>
<P>
   The answers:
</P>
<P>
   Taylor extension is the intention of the franchise's basketball
staff, but the franchise's owner is Donald T. Sterling, so write
this down in pencil. As of Wednesday, there is no reason to believe
the extension won't happen. And no guarantee that it will.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers pursuit of Hardaway is a $68 million question that
can be answered in the affirmative, although Penny and his
financial hit men - who probably are looking elsewhere -- would be
silly to rule out the Clips. Think leverage.
</P>
<P>
   If Hardaway doesn't return to Orlando for the max (in the
neighborhood of $80 million over seven years), his folks would like
to swing a sign-and-trade proposal. Problem. Orlando would have to
take a player or two in trade to equal Penny's cap number, but who
could end up as flotsam and/or jetsam on their roster. Don't expect
the Magic to hurt themselves just to help Penny's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Odom?
</P>
<P>
   He is believed to be in New York City, but preparing for a
Friday plane ride to L.A. Once in town, Odom - the Rhode Island
star who was the fourth overall pick in last month's NBA Draft -
will participate in what we assume are grueling individual
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Will he play in the SPL?
</P>
<P>
   That's doubtful, although Odom has said he would love to compete
with the summer Clips.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe a little history figures in - remember, Marques
Johnson's career was ended by slamming his head into the tummy of
Benoit Benjamin - when team officials say they are reluctant to
trot out such a valued property within range of bloodthirsty (just
kiddin' here) free agents.
</P>
<P>
   That decision may have been driven home Tuesday night, when
Michael Olowokandi - last year's overall No. 1 pick - limped off
the court after hyperextending his left knee. In the same game,
Vancouver Grizzlies candidate Mario Bennett injured his knee in a
nasty spill.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi's injury was not expected to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's requires surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Almost forgot ... here's a fourth Clipper question:
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Troy Hudson, last season's CBA plum, what's the deal
at point guard?
</P>
<P>
   Well, one candidate is former North Carolina standout Jeff
McInnis, who made his SPL debut with the Clips on Tuesday. The
6-foot-3 McInnis was a second-round pick of the Denver Nuggets in
1997, and is expected to be invited to the Clippers' camp at
College of the Desert.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we have a fifth Clipper question:
</P>
<P>
   Where is second-round pick Rico Hill? Try the Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   The former Illinois State star, who spent last season playing
for pay in Spain (What did you learn in Spain, he was asked.
``Spanish,'' he said) is a SPL regular.
</P>
<P>
   To the 6-5, 230-pound swingman, adjusting to the level of
defense required to compete in the NBA is his biggest challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's so athletic and fast,'' said Hill, who has yet to
encounter the NBA's real bad boys. ``If you come off that screen
late defensively, you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill is glad the same can't be said for his career. After being
named Most Valuable Player in the Missouri Valley Conference as a
junior at ISU, he chose to leave school and support his son Rico
(now 3 years old). His reasons for competing now include son
Britain (six months).
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole life has changed,'' Hill said. ``In college, I did a
lot of stupid things. I went from being the guy who was throwing
the parties, to the guy who's staying home, watching TV with my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who was THE scoring option at ISU, doesn't want to be the
go-to guy if it requires going back to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad to be drafted,'' he said. ``I didn't want to go
back across the water.''
</P>
<P>
   While Tracy and Cameron Murray compete in the SPL for Team AM
1540, cousin Lamond right, another Clipper has been a no-show.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources beyond our control, the free-agent small
forward has been coveted by the Cleveland Cavaliers for a while
now, and they se would-be employers
</P>
<P>
   would like to sign him in August.
</P>
<P>
   But to do so would require clearing cap room, not to mention a
sign-and-trade maneuver with the Clippers. This also means the
Clips would be obliged to take a Cavalier in trade.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's offering is guard Bob Sura, who has a contract with
a life of five more years and about $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for playing, please try again.
</P>
<P>
   One of our favorite summer Lakers is 6-9 power forward Taymon
Domzalski, a free-agent rookie who wore his share of splinters at
Duke. Domzalski, who's strong, athletic and smart, was a big-time
prep star who transferred from Lovington (N.M.) High after his
junior year and began his Duke preparation by enrolling at New
Mexico Military Institute in Roswell. Right, Roswell, inspiration
for great TV such as ``Sightings'' and ``The X-Files.'' Taymon
won't be anything close to the X-factor for the Lakers, but he'll
probably be in somebody's camp come October. ... Running the point
for the SPL edition of the Portland Trailblazers is C.J. Bruton,
the former Indian Hills Junior College star who signed with Iowa
State, failed to qualify, entered the 1998 NBA Draft, but wasn't
selected. Bruton's father, Cal, played at Wichita State then became
a huge star in Australia's top pro league. ... Former Inglewood
High and Kansas star Paul Pierce was the NBA's second
most-productive rookie in 1999, but that's not stopping him from
playing for the SPL's version of the Boston Celtics. ... Our only
complaint, thus far, with the SPL is Monday night's merciless
deployment of the Village People soundtrack as mood music.

DONALD ENGEN DIES AT 75; LED SPACE MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Donald D. Engen, the head of the National Air and
Space Museum at the Smithsonian Institution and a former
administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, was killed on
Tuesday when the glider he was in broke apart over Nevada and
plunged to the ground. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The glider was being flown by William S. Ivans of San Diego, who
was also killed. Sgt. Lance Modispacher of the Douglas County,
Nev., sheriff's office said witnesses told of seeing the glider
break up and fall around noon near Minden, about 15 miles east of
Lake Tahoe.
</P>
<P>
   Both Engen, a retired Navy vice admiral and former test pilot,
and Ivans, 79, were officers in the Soaring Society of America, an
organization of gliding enthusiasts. Engen, who lived in
Alexandria, Va., had been vacationing in Nevada with his wife,
Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Engen had headed the Air and Space Museum, which
draws about nine million visitors a year and is the most popular
tourist attraction in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment to the museum was greeted warmly by World War II
veterans, many of whom had become enraged at his predecessor,
Martin Harwit, over plans for exhibiting the Enola Gay, the B-29
bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Many veterans
thought the original text accompanying the exhibit was too
sympathetic to the Japanese. Efforts to rewrite the text failed to
satisfy some veterans, members of Congress and historians, and
Harwit resigned in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Engen headed the FAA from 1984 to 1987 after serving on the
National Transportation Safety Board. In his three years at the
aviation agency he concentrated on trying to improve the nation's
air traffic control system while managing a boom in airline
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Air and Space Museum, Engen had not only a
historian's interest, but also an affection for the various
aircraft and missiles entrusted to his care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We arrest the corrosion and put old hydraulic lines back into
them,'' he said in an interview last year. ``A hundred years from
now, people can come back and see the technology of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Engen was responsible for treasures like the Spirit
of St. Louis, which Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic in
1927, and capsules that returned astronauts to Earth from the Moon.
</P>
<P>
   One exhibit was a somber reminder of a personal tragedy: a
surface-to-air missile captured by the Israelis from the Egyptians
in 1967 was virtually identical to the one that killed his
son-in-law over Vietnam, Engen said in the 1998 interview.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Pomona, Calif., on May 28, 1924, Engen left Pasadena
Junior College to enter the Navy early in World War II. He was a
dive bomber pilot on the aircraft carrier Lexington and saw combat
in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944 and in the campaigns to capture
Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945. He was awarded the Navy Cross, the
Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal. After the war, he was
commander of the carrier America in the Atlantic and the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Engen attained the rank of rear admiral in 1969 and served in a
variety of posts at sea and in Washington. He retired as a vice
admiral in 1978 and became an aircraft manufacturing executive. In
1982, President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the transportation
safety board, the agency that is investigating the accident that
killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Engen is survived by three sons, Travis,
Charles and Christopher; a daughter, Candace Ellis, and several
grandchildren.

   BURBANK, Calif. _ Time Warner Inc., continuing to solidify its
credentials as a premiere media conglomerate, impressed Wall Street
again Wednesday with a strong financial performance from all its
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter cash flow _ the most closely watched measure of
Time Warner's results _ rose 74 percent to $2.017 billion from
$1.16 billion a year earlier. Without a one-time $771 million gain
from selling cable systems, cash flow was up 15 percent, marking
the 11th straight quarter it has met or topped Wall Street's
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner stock, up 66 percent from a year ago, rose to its
second-highest close ever. Shares rose $1.5625 to $77.3125, less
than a dollar short of its all-time high of $78.25 in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was pretty much another great quarter, and there was
nothing to lead me to question any of the divisions,'' said Barry
Hyman, an analyst with Ehrenkrantz King. ``It's a great continuing
growth story with a great short- and long-term future.''
</P>
<P>
   ING Barings analyst Frederick Moran said he expects the stock to
hit $85 in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, which operates much of its film, TV and music
businesses in Burbank, also posted profits of 12 cents a share
before gains, double the average estimate of analysts polled by
First Call. Other highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _ Publishing operations performed well as cash flow jumped to
$196 million in the second quarter from $176 million. Time Warner
cited gains at InStyle and Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Music division cash flow rose to $101 million from $96 million
due to cost cutting and albums from Cher and Tim McGraw.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turner Broadcasting's film cash flow rose 87 percent to $71
million due to the success of ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me,'' headed for $200 million domestically.
</P>
<P>
   _ Warner Bros.' cash flow rose 8 percent to $132 million due to
the success of ``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Cable systems posted record cash flow of $1.18 billion, up
from $448 million; cable channels under the TBS division, including
CNN, TNT and the Cartoon Network, posted a 19 percent increase in
cash flow to a record $235 million; HBO cash flow rose 16 percent
to $131 million.
