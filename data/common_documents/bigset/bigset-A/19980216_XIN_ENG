<HEADLINE> 336 Foreign Invested Projects in Vietnam Revoked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Licenses for 336
foreign-invested projects in Vietnam with a combined capital of
over 2.8 billion U.S. Dollars have been revoked since vietnam
promulgated the foreign investment law 10 years ago, Vietnam's
Ministry of Planning and Investment Reported.
</P>
<P>
The revoked projects accounted for 17 percent of the total
number of investment projects and 8 percent of the total foreign
investment capital.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors have the
largest number of revoked projects.
</P>
<P>
Among 61 countries and regions investing in Vietnam, Hong Kong
ranked the sixth but it has the largest number of revoked projects.
</P>
<P>
Though Singapore and Malaysia are among the biggest investors
in Vietnam, they have the smallest number of revoked licenses.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Planning and Investment of Vietnam Nguyen
Nhac said that these licenses were revoked due to foreign
partners' failure to fulfill their commitments, particularly
financial commitments and the lack of experience in seeking joint
venture partners on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is the different perceptions of the ideal forms
of business management between partners. Besides Vietnamese
officials' lack of enough knowledge of the law, professional
skills and foreign languages are also one of the reasons.
</P>
<P>
Poor management, changing policies, bureaucracy and unstable
environment are also factors that have slowed down the
implementation of a large number of projects, according to the
ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and German envoys will
arrive here Monday for talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on the Iraq-U.N. crisis and global efforts to defuse it,
the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Special Envoy of U.S. State Department David Newton, due in
Cairo on the first leg of his tour of the Middle East, will meet
with senior Egyptian officials and mediamen to explain
Washington's determination to respond to Iraqi intransigence with
military punishment, according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
He will, then, fly to Saudi Arabia before visiting other Gulf
Cooperation Council member states as well as Syria, Lebanon and
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Germany's State Minister for Foreign Affairs Helmut Shiffer
will also arrive here Monday on a two-day visit at the start of
his multi-leg African tour.
</P>
<P>
The German official will meet with Moussa and Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid on the developments of the
Iraq-U.N. standoff as well as other regional and bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel Sunday expressed the hope
that a diplomatic solution to the standoff would be reached,
adding that the use of force should not be resorted to, unless all
political and diplomatic means are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have claimed Britain, Germany, Spain, Portugal,
Demark, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Australia, New Zealand and

<HEADLINE> Iraq Keen on Peaceful Solution to Crisis: Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Iraqi National
Assembly (Parliament) Saadoun Hammadi on Sunday emphasized Iraq's
keen desire to resolve the crisis over arms inspections through
peaceful means to preserve its sovereignty, dignity and security.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi made the remark during a meeting with ambassadors of
Sri Lanka, the Czech Republic, Spain, Greece, Bangladesh and
Pakistan, the Iraqi news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He briefed the ambassadors on developments in the relations
between Iraq and the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
He asked them to convey letters to their parliament speakers,
in an effort to solicit their rejection of any possible attack on
Iraq by the United States and seek a peaceful settlement for the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a similar move, Hammadi met with ambassadors of eastern
European countries on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and UNSCOM are locked in a standoff over inspections of
presidential sites. The United States has said it will attack Iraq
if Baghdad does not grant the special commission unfettered access
to these sites suspected of hiding the banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi said U.S. threats to use force against Iraq are
prompted by political, seditious designs in contradiction with the
U.N. Charter and international laws.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Iraq is demonstrating a high degree of flexibility
regarding initiatives dealing with the crisis, the Iraqi
parliament speaker said, describing Washington's stance as
"intransigent and arrogant."

<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Ju Weisong's last-second
three-pointer gave Shandong Flaming Bulls a 76-73 over-time win
over Shanghai Sharks in Sunday's Hilton Chinese basketball first
division league in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
After 19 round matches, league leaders August First Rockets
maintained their top position in the 12-team standings after a
lopsided 102-73 home win over Jiangsu Dragons in Chongqing,
Sichuan.
</P>

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Vietnam-ASEAN Trade Reaches Record High in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam-ASEAN trade reached a
record high of 5.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, 22.3 percent
higher than 1996, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Vietnam exported to the ASEAN market 1.9
billion U.S. dollars worth of goods, a 40 percent jump over 1996.
Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia were the country's main markets.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 was also the first year when Vietnam was able to
reduce partly its trade deficit with ASEAN countries. But
Vietnam's exports to regional countries were mostly raw farm
produce, with only 30 percent of it being processed.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN market now accounts for 22 percent of Vietnam's total
trade value. However, the on-going financial crisis in the region
has had a negative impact on Vietnam's trade.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of 1997, Vietnam's major trading partners
such as Thailand and Indonesia all intensified their exports while
reducing imports due to the devaluation of their currencies. As a
result, Vietnam suffered serious losses in its export value, said
Vietnam's Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI).
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that 1998 is likely to be more difficult for
Vietnamese exporters on the ASEAN market.
</P>
<P>
"The prices of many ASEAN commodities are expected to drop
further in 1998, marking them more competitive and thus directly
affecting Vietnam's imports from ASEAN countries as well," said
Ngyuen Duc Minh, director of the multilateral trade department of
Vietnam's Ministry of Trade.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

and throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
"This position of Arab people would develop, taking various
forms," said Ramadan, adding that "American interests in and
outside the region will be in jeopardy, should the United States
take such (military) action."
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said that Iraq and Russia are linked by strategic
ties based on common interests and objectives intent on
establishing peace and security in the whole world.
</P>
<P>

and other states and governments will prevail over the will of

those President Boris Yeltsin personally, to prevent the U.S. from
carrying out a military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said mounting denunciation of U.S. aggression policy
towards Iraq by Arab and Islamic states, as well as other world
countris, showed that American interests in and outside the region
would be jeopardized if it ventured to attack Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies US Allegation of Hiding Banned Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Sunday reiterated that
it does not possess any banned weapons or weapon components, the
Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a U.S. allegation that Iraq is hiding chemical,
biological weapons and missiles, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid said the weapons have been destroyed by the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
For example, Rashid said, the chemical weapons were eliminated
in 1993 under the supervision of UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The commission has to certify that Iraq has destroyed all
weapons of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council can
lift the economic sanctions imposed Baghdad in 1990 after its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Rashid added that since 1991 when the arms inspections began
after the Gulf War, 230 UNSCOM teams have carried out some 2300
visits to various sites across the country suspected of hiding
prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
An inspection team headed by an American, Diyana Simoon,
recently searched 60 Iraqi sites for 75 times, but did not find
any banned weapons, said the Iraqi minister.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that U.S. allegation is aimed at affecting the
work of UNSCOM and justifying its planned military aggression
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., strengthening its military build-up in the Gulf, says
it will attack Iraq if the ongoing diplomatic fails to secure
U.N. arms inspectors access to all sites suspected of concealing
the banned weapons.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Pledges Fair Vote in W. Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations Envoy
pledged a fair referendum to decide the future of Western Sahara,
fought over by Polisario guerrillas and morocco, the official
Algerian News Agency APS reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I will do my utmost to organize an honest, just and
transparent referendum in Western Sahara," said Charles Dunbar,
special representative of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who
is visiting Polisario headquarters in southwest Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The Polisario Front fought Morocco for some 15 years to try to
get independence for the mostly desert former Spanish colony
which Rabat claims as part of its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
APS reported Dunbar's speech, made after his arrival late
Saturday at Polisario bases near the southwestern Algerian town
of Tindouf.
</P>
<P>
Dunbar said he held talks with Polisario leaders over the
progress of the identification process of would-be voters, APS
said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is at present working to identify eligible
voters for a U.N.-sponsored referendum, due to be held five
months after a U.N.- sponsored cease-fire came into force, on the
Western Sahara's future -- integration with Morocco or
independence, as sought by Polisario.
</P>
<P>
The referendum of the territory has been delayed for six years
because of disputes over who was eligible to take part in the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held talks last December and decided to resume
to identify eligible voters, and the work is being handled by the
U.N. mission for the referendum (MINURSO). The referendum is now
due to be held in principle on December 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Dunbar met Moroccan King Hassan in Rabat last week, and also
held talks with Moroccan officials.
</P>
<P>
Over 86,000 Saharans have been identified since the
identification process was launched in 1994, U.N. figures
revealed.

<HEADLINE> OAPEC Says Oil Prices to Remain Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary General of
the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC)
predicted here Sunday that "oil prices would remain slump if the
causes behind it were not removed."
</P>
<P>
Abdelaziz Al-Turki said the oil prices would continue plunging
due to warm winter in the northern part of the earth, in addition
to the economic crisis hitting the south east Asian countries,
according to Kuwait News Agency reports.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the plunge was also attributed to the
non-compliance by a number of Opec member countries to their
quotas that were endorsed during the organization's recent
meeting in Jakarta which decided to raise the Opec oil ceiling by
10 percent from 25 million barrel per day to 27.5 million barrels
per day starting from January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The world oil prices have dropped to a 48-week low and the
Brent marker price has been just around 15 U.S. dollars a barrel
recently compared with a 21 dollar mark per barrel last year.
</P>
<P>
Al-Turki also said the oil prices during the period of the
current Iraq-U.N. stand-off would highly depend on the developments
of the oil market in light of the high oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
"The oil prices will also be dependent on results of the
efforts of the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in terms of
increasing Iraq's oil exports to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars
every six months from only the present 2 billion U.S.
dollars according to the oil-for-food program," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is now selling more than 1 million barrels per day under
the oil-for-food deal which the United Nations wants to be
expanded.
</P>
<P>
Most of the world dealers remain more concerned with weak
oil market fundamentals than the growing prospect that the
U.S. will bomb Iraq in a bid to make Baghdad allow access
to suspected sites by the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Dealers in London market were reportedly saying concerns
linger that a military strike on Iraq by the U.S. might put a
temporary halt to UN-monitored oil sales.
</P>
<P>
But Al-Turki indicated that the current Iraq-U.N. crisis might
not help push the oil prices up in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the impact of the current Iraq-U.N. crisis on the
Gulf economies, Al-Turki said "undoubtedly, these countries'
economies would be negatively affected if the war tune
intensifies."

<HEADLINE> PLO Urges Arab Unity to Prevent U.S. Blackmailing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Head of Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Political Department Farouk Qaddomi Sunday
reiterated the necessity of closing Arab ranks to prevent the
U.S. manipulation of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab solidarity and unity should be promoted in a bid to
deter the U.S. and stop it from blackmailing the Arabs financially
and politically," he told reporters here following his meeting
with Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Qaddomi said Washington likes to use the Gulf conditions as a
pretext to launch another attack, referring to the U.S. threat to
strike Iraq over the Iraq-U.N. standoff over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
"Washington wants to return back to the dual containment (on
Iran and Iraq) and pressing Syria in a bid to return the region
back to tension and chaos," according to the PLO official.
</P>
<P>
Qaddomi, who is visiting Cairo, described the ongoing events in
the Gulf region as "fabricated by the U.S. to cover up its failure
in reviving the Mideast peace process."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been in
shatters since last March when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu gave the go-ahead to the construction of a new Jewish
settlement in the Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. mediation also failed to resolve the differences
between Israel and the Palestinians over a long overdue Israeli
pullback from the West Bank under the 1993 Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians have no confidence in Netanyahu. He has
broken many promises he made," Qaddomi said.
</P>
<P>
Qaddomi was commenting on Netanyahu's remarks on Saturday that
Israel would count on its military power rather than peace accords
in handling what he claimed "neighboring dictatorships."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians advocate peace based on dignity and
honor. The establishment of an independent State of Palestine is
inevitable," Qaddomi said and urged the international community to
impose sanctions on Israel.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Expresses Concern over Tension in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Sunday expressed concern over the tension in the Persian
Gulf region as the United States announced its readiness to launch
a military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Receiving visiting Kuwaiti Minister of Planning Ali Fahad
al-Zumai, Khatami said that regional countries should be united
on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit and spare no
efforts to safeguard the regional security by themselves, Tehran
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the Iraqi crisis would not become a human calamity and
a confrontation in the region, saying the crisis should be solved
politically for the interest of regional people.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister, who arrived here Saturday, delivered
Khatami a written message from Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah. The content of the message was not revealed.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zumai said Kuwait believed attacks on Iraq would be harmful
to all regional countries, and they should solve regional issues
and maintain security.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister Saturday evening also held talks with
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi. He said Kuwait favors
tranquillity and stability in the region and considers it a
prerequisite for regional growth and development.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait gives priority to diplomatic solutions to the crisis,
the Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted al-Zumai as
saying. He added that if Iraq fails to comply with the
U.N. Security Council resolutions, other alternatives should be
considered.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kharrazi rejected the use of force against Iraq and
called for stepping up diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"Military actions will aggravate tension in the region," he
said, stressing that cooperation and amity among regional
countries can pave the grounds for peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Militia Make Headway in Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's leading civil
militia group known as Kamajors who have been fighting for the
restoration of ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah have captured
major towns in the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors Sunday took control of such major towns as Bo in
the south and Kenema in the north, three days after the ousting
of the military junta in the capital Freetown although junta
leader Johnny Paul Koroma has vowed to fight back from the
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Over 10,000 well armed Kamajor militiamen Sunday morning
entered bo, the second largest city of the country through three
entry points, singing war songs and searching for junta soliders,
according to a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored
here.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors, who were given a warm welcome by the jubilant
crowd in the main streets, later captured about eight junta
soldiers, who were all tried in public and punished afterwards,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen have discovered large quantities of arms and
ammunition in the residence of the former secretary of state for
the southern region, including rocket propelled grenade and
mortar bombs, as well as uniforms. All were abandoned by the
junta soldiers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Two abandoned vehicles loaded with anti-aircraft machine-guns
were also discovered by the Kamajors.
</P>
<P>
According to a Kamajor leader, all the arms and ammunition
will be handed over the west African peace keeping force known as
ECOMOG, which is expected to enter Bo for deployment and
disarmament any time between Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
A Kamajor spokesman Sunday warned the public against looting,
unnecessary firing and burning of houses within the township of
Bo.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors, who entered Kenema in the north, were also
reportedly welcomed by jubilant people in the town Sunday
morning, who are expecting the ECOMOG forces to come.
</P>
<P>
But the commander of the Sierra Leonean civil defense units,
including the Kamajors, has warned that the fall of the two towns
does not mean the beginning of the junta's collapse in the
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to ensure there is no resistance from
the junta soldiers, he said, calling on them to surrender.
</P>
<P>
Koroma Saturday vowed to regain power by fighting from the
countryside, claiming that the junta still had supporters across
the country.
</P>
<P>
The oath of Koroma, however, was dismissed by the commander,
who said it is impossible for the junta to come back again
because the civil defense units are stronger now.
</P>
<P>
A BBC report Saturday quoted ECOMOG intelligence as indicating
that Koroma was hiding with a group of Lebanese and was seeking
political asylum in the Lebanese embassy in Conakry, Guinea.
But the Lebanese embassy Sunday denied the news.

<P>
LAGOS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Executive Secretary of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Lansana
Kouyate has congratulated the ECOMOG peace keepers for its
victory in Sierra Leone, the television reported Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
In his first press statement since the Nigerian-led ECOMOG
force sacked the military junta in Freetown, capital of Sierra
Leone Thursday, Kouyate singled out ECOMOG force commander
Maj.-Gen. Timothy Shelpidi and Lt.-Col. Maxwell Kobe for praise
on "their courage, gallantry and sense of duty".
</P>
<P>
"ECOWAS remains committed to the full and timely
implementation of the Conakry accord (signed by the junta and
ECOWAS last October)," said the statement, which was issued
Friday in the ECOWAS secretariat based in the Nigerian capital of
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord to reinstate by April 22 elected President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, toppled on May 25 last year by the junta,
ECOMOG was given the mandate to enforce sanctions and embargo
imposed by ECOWAS and the United Nations on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
However, following the fall of Freetown to ECOMOG, the ECOWAS
statement called on the international community and all
humanitarian agencies "to immediately resume delivery of
humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
According to the World Food Program (WFP), 580 tons of food
will be sent to Freetown Wednesday as the first step to provide
urgent aid to the hungry people in the country.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses US of Having Evil Designs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed Al-Sahhaf has accused the United States of harboring evil
designs on Iraq with its threat to use force to solve the crisis
over U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
"What the U.S. is preparing for Iraq is an evil of massive
dimensions that no human conscience could possibly tolerate,"
al-Sahhaf told the Egyptian independent weekly Al Osbou to be out
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview conducted last week during his visit here,
Al-Sahhaf reminded of the American bombardment of the Al Amereya
bunker in Baghdad in the 1991 Gulf War, which left more than 400
Iraqis, mostly women and children, dead.
</P>
<P>
"The American juggernaut would not just hit military sites, but
would inflict heavier human losses," he warned, calling for a stop
to a possible U.S. attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
AL-Sahhaf rejected the suggestion that if Iraq opened up all
suspect sites for inspection without restrictions it would then
give U.S. threat of force the slip.
</P>
<P>
"It would mean ceding the country to the CIA," he said,
referring to the American Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Even if they strike Iraq 1,000 times, we will not hand the
country over to American imperialism," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened a devastating and selective blow on
Iraq to force its compliance with the U.N. arms inspections.
Iraq's denial of full access to sites suspected of hiding weapons
of mass destruction to the U.N. arms inspectors sparked the
current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf also disputed the real intention of the U.N. Special
Commission in charge of scrapping Iraq's nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons and long range missiles.
</P>
<P>
"They are looking for a white crow, but there is no such white
crow," Al-Sahhaf said in reference to U.N. inspectors hunting for
the banned weapons in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the hope that diplomatic efforts would gain the
upper hand in the current face-off, Al-Sahhaf, however, said that
if the U.S. decided to go ahead with the attack, it should bear
the responsibility.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun's Trains Collide, Killing 120 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Two petroleum tanker trains
collided in the Cameroun capital Yaounde Saturday night, killing
120 people, a report of Cameroun state radio monitored here said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Over 150 people suffered burns, most of them critically, after
colossal flames swept through a crowd of people scooping up
petrol spilling from the tankers, the worst disaster in the
central African country since toxic gases escaping from lake Nyos
in the northwest killed 1,746 villagers in 1986.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what caused the collision of the two trains,
one heading out of Yaounde and the other coming in. Both were
pulling petroleum tanker cars.
</P>
<P>
France, the former colonial power said Paris was sending six
tons of burn medications to Cameroun, along with four emergency
doctors and two nurses, the radio quoted the foreign ministry as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described the accident as horrible, in the midst of
explosions and shooting flames.
</P>
<P>
"People were running in all directions, many of them with
their clothes on fire," a nearby resident said.
</P>
<P>
Armed police sealed off the scene as crowds still gathered a
short distance away staring silently at the burned out wreckage
of the two trains.
</P>
<P>
Yaounde's three main hospitals were crowded Sunday by hundreds
of people seeking news of their relatives.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the Yaounde military hospital said 11 of 16
casualties brought there on Saturday had since died.
</P>
<P>
At Joungolo mission hospital, east of the capital, nine of 21
people admitted with severe burns had died, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Premier Peter Musonge Mafany visited the scene Saturday and
expressed sympathy with relatives.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun's cash-strapped hospitals are ill-equipped to deal
with a disaster like this inferno, health officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet discussed
the Iraqi crisis again Sunday and Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu urged the military to put its house in order for
possible Iraqi attack, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
During the cabinet meeting, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai,
Armed Forces Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak and
General Security Service head Amy Ayalon briefed the cabinet
about lasted developments in Iraq-U.N. crisis and Israel's
preparations for the possible Iraqi attacks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said although the diplomatic efforts are continuing
in resolving the crisis, Israel must get the home front well
prepared for any eventuality.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the peace process, Netanyahu said Israel still
believes that the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks could be moved
forward through negotiations, not through any kind of uprising.
</P>
<P>
"Israel will not be dictated by the intifada (uprising) as
announced by (Palestinian National Authority President) Yasser
Arafat and the peace process can only be moved forward through
negotiations," Netanyahu told his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said in Ramallah Thursday that he would renew the
intifada in the Palestinian areas if negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also said that he would declare a Palestinian state in
1999 regardless of the outcome of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
As the U.N.-Iraqi standoff going on and U.S. military buildup
in the Gulf, anti-U.S. demonstrations have been constantly held in
different parts of the palestinian territories despite the
U.S. warnings that such demonstrations could not be conducive to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinian demonstrators in the West Bank city of
Bethlehem turned out Sunday to express their support to the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
Israel also strengthened its security measures to prevent
conflicts with the Palestinians that could erupt any time. The
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) staged a military training exercise
Saturday night in the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoon, Israel police and IDF soldiers raided a
Palestinian company in northern Jerusalem, accusing it of a
Palestinian secret intelligence unit.

LAGOS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Chief of Defense
Staff, Major-general Abdulsalam Abubakar arrived in New York
Sunday for a one-week visit to discuss peace-keeping issues with
U. N. officials, the News Agency of Nigeria reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding on
Nigeria's troop contribution to the U.N.'s stand-by peace-keeping
force, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Colonel Ja'afaru Isa, the defense adviser of the
Nigerian mission to the U.N. as saying that the west African
country will contribute a motorized battalion and a sizable
number of civilian policemen to the stand-by force.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly approved the stand-by force as a way
of reducing the response time needed for the deployment of U.N.
peace-keepers. Fourteen countries have signed agreement on troops
contribution.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the U.S. mission to the U.N. has
requested a meeting between Abubakar and the U.S. official in
charge of the African crisis response initiative, an idea that
Washington has been promoting among some African countries in the
last three years.

<P>
ANKARA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said on Sunday that Turkey has taken all necessary measures
to fend off any impact in case the United States attacks Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish Armed Forces are strong enough in personnel and
equipment to meet any kind of threat," Yilmaz was quoted as saying
by the semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Local media have reported that Turkey has deployed troops along
the Turkish-Iraqi border to prevent the flooding of refugees into
the country possibly triggered by U.S. military actions.
</P>
<P>
About 1.5 million Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkey during the 1991
Gulf War which drove the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
As to the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey, Turkish
Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin has said that the U.S. has not made
a request to use the base for a possible attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He also said that no U.S. Patriot missiles have been sent to
the base.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led coalition used the base to launch air raids on
Iraq during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to attack Iraq if it does not grant
free access to the United Nations arms inspectors to all sites
suspected of hiding weapons of mass destruction and missiles to
launch them.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has sent a technical group to Baghdad to map out the
areas to be inspected in eight presidential sites that Iraq has
agreed to open to the arms inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Seeks Diplomatic Solution to Crisis: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is seeking a diplomatic
solution to its crisis with the U.N. over arms inspections "in
order that justice may prevail and regional security and peace
safeguarded," a senior Iraqi official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shabib al-Maliki, Iraqi minister of justice and personal envoy
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to Sudan made the remark at a
news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Al-Maliki accused the U.S. Administration and its allies of
maintaining the embargo imposed against Iraq for more than seven
years, and of even threatening to attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has agreed to open eight presidential sites for inspection
by a special team to be appointed by the U.N. secretary
general. The U.S. rejected the offer, demanding complete and
unconditional permission for inspection teams to enter all
suspected sites.
</P>
<P>
Al-Maliki praised China, France and Russia for their clear
position which calls for a diplomatic solution of the crisis,
describing this stance as positive and just.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he asserted that Israel ought to be compelled
as well to destroy the mass destruction weapons it holds. Israel,
he said, even refuses inspection of its nuclear reactor by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
He also called upon the Arab states to unify their stance,
saying that should the potential military strike against Iraq take
place, it would be a confrontation aimed at the whole Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Maliki arrived here Saturday carrying a letter from Saddam
to his Sudanese counterpart Omar al-Bashir on the latest
developments in the Iraqi-UN crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said his Arab tour aims at enhancing Arab solidarity and
closing Arab ranks.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Lawyer Criticizes Independent Counsel's Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky's attorney Sunday said independent counsel Kenneth
Starr is trampling her constitutional rights in an effort to force
her to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Appearing on CNN Sunday, lawyer William Ginsburg said, "a
pattern of abusive behavior" on the part of Starr makes it
impossible for his client to "ever get a fair hearing."
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky may face charges that she lied about having sex with
U.S. President Bill Clinton at his urging. Clinton has repeatedly
denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg accused Starr of a "continued, orchestrated campaign
of leaks" and asserted that investigators had illegally detained
Lewinsky without legal representation and made recordings,
including by phone tap, without a court order.
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg cited leaks of grand jury testimony, illegally
obtained tape recordings made by Lewinsky's friend, Linda Tripp,
the expansion of Starr's investigation to include the charges
before a special three- judge panel approved the move, and charged
for the first time that Starr "started tapping phones and wiring
people without authority from a judge."
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg said Starr had "effectively imprisoned" Lewinsky at a
hotel, "refusing to allow her to call her counsel for...more than
nine hours."
</P>
<P>
He said, "This is part of a pattern of abusive behavior that
has been going in in this investigation....They have tainted the
environment so that I doubt very much that Monica Lewinsky can
ever have a fair hearing."

<HEADLINE> Sudan Vows to Repel Eritrean Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Sudan will keep monitoring
repeated violations of its border by Eritrea and reserves the
right of self-defense and repelling aggression, Sudanese Minister
of State for Foreign Affairs Mustafa Othman Ismail said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Sudanese-Eritrean relations has been high following
successive military clashes along the borders and each side is
accusing the other of provocation.
</P>
<P>
The official Sudanese news agency quoted Ismail as saying in a
statement that the Sudanese government will keep notifying the
U.N. Security Council of Eritrea's actions.
</P>
<P>
The council members are fully aware of the practices of the
Eritrean regime, which are not only against Sudan but also against
most countries of the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Sudan had lodged numerous complaints and
notes with the Security Council regarding Eritrean acts of
aggression against Sudanese territories.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has decided to close its border with Eritrea to ward off
infiltration of Sudanese opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea accused Sudan of supporting its opposition group
Islamic Jihad Movement and severed diplomatic relations in
1994. Since then, Eritrea has been providing support and shelter
to the armed Sudanese opposition groups, which are fighting to
topple the Islamic Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
On Sudanese-Egyptian relations, Ismail said that visits and
contacts are under way between Sudanese and Egyptian officials and
have never ceased.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Ensure Success for UN Chief's Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf said here on Monday that Iraq will make efforts to
ensure the success of a possible visit by United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Iraq attaches much importance to Annan's visit to Baghdad and
will create some "substantial conditions" to make sure its
success, Al-Sahhaf said at a news conference jointly held with his
Lebanese counterpart Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Annan has announced that he would like to go to Iraq if there
is a chance of success to mediate a peaceful settlement for the
crisis over U.N. arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
And it is believed that his trip is the last hope to avert a
possible attack on Iraq by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., continuing to strengthen military build-up in the
Gulf, has said to take military actions to force Iraq to grant
unfettered access to U.N. arms inspectors to all sites suspected
of hiding weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf arrived here early in the day as part of his current
regional tour to drum up Arab support for Iraq's stance on solving
the crisis. He has traveled to Syria, Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He has met with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and delivered
him a letter from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Kuwait's position on the Iraqi issue, Al-Sahhaf
said that Kuwait should bear responsibility for the consequences
resulted from U.S. crimes due to its support for a possible U.S.
attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We are not threatening Kuwait, but hoping it will not become a
weapons storage (of the U.S.) used to kill Iraq," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait reportedly has allowed the U.S. to use an air base in a
possible air strike against Iraq. But it has not officially
announced its decision.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwaiti Planning Minister Ali Fahd Al-Zumei was also
visiting Lebanon and delivered a letter to Hrawi from Kuwaiti Emir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that al-Zumei is aimed at rallying
support from Lebanon for Kuwait's stance on the Iraq crisis.

BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities said today
that they will continue their efforts to stop paid news reports
and called on journalists across the country to stick to their
professional ethics.
</P>
<P>
The comment came at a national phone conference held today by
the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central

Publication Administration of China, and the Chinese Journalists'
Association.
</P>
<P>
It was pointed out that the prohibition on paid news reports
was officially imposed early last year and has some success. The
Chinese journalists' Association and some central and local news
organizations have telephone hotlines that people can use to
report on infractions.
</P>
<P>
This year, the news media should adhere to regulations that
prohibit paid news reports and should look into violations, authorities
said, and urged journalists to maintain close contacts with people
and to go to grassroots units to get the news and a better
understanding of the country's realities.

ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan opposes a military
strike against Iraq, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
Siddique Khan Kanju said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The use of force against Iraq would serve no purpose, rather it

Kanjua expressed hope that a diplomatic solution would be found
and the Iraqi crisis be brought to a peaceful end.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he reaffirmed Pakistan's support for all United
Nations resolutions without selective application or emphasis.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Bauchard delivered to Kanju a message from
French President Jacques Chirac, which was addressed to Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on France's efforts to reduce the
current crisis over the issue of the U.N. weapons inspection in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Chirac also appreciated Pakistan's efforts to
bring peace to the region, the APP said.

government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Monday
welcomed the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) full endorsement
to Hong Kong's existing fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
A press information notice issued by the IMF Monday carried the
IMF's official assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and
prospects.
</P>
<P>
Directors of the IMF Executive Board expressed their full
support for Hong Kong's maintenance of the linked exchange rate
system.
</P>
<P>
They described the system as "an important anchor for economic
stability since 1983 and that it plays a vital role in
demonstrating the commitment to an independent monetary and
exchange rate policy in Hong Kong and in maintaining confidence in
its status as an international financial center."
</P>
<P>
The notice said: "Directors observed that, more recently, Hong
Kong SAR's solid fundamentals and decisive policy actions had
helped it withstand the regional financial crisis and the bouts of
speculative attacks."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the IMF's assessment which is a fair and thorough
one," the SAR government spokesman said in response to the IMF
press information notice.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a clean bill of health. We share their
assessment that, notwithstanding the recent turmoil within the
region, developments in Hong Kong's economy during the past year
have been satisfactory in many respects," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said: "We are aware that our short-term economic
prospects may be clouded by the regional financial turmoil, but we
are confident that with our solid economic fundamentals and
resilience, Hong Kong will recover and come out even stronger."
</P>
<P>
"We are glad that the IMF has endorsed our continued commitment
to prudent fiscal policies. The 1998-99 Budget which has been
drawn up in line with this philosophy will be delivered on
February 18," he added.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hails Clerides' Re-election in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece hailed Glafcos Clerides'
victory in Cyprus' presidential elections Monday, saying Athens
would continue to support him in his efforts to seek a just and
viable solution to the Cyprus issues.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory message, Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos said the Cyprian leader could always rely on the
undivided support of the Greek people to help find a solution to
the Cyprus problem, based on international laws.
</P>
<P>
In Cyprus' presidential elections Sunday, Clerides defeated his
rival George Iacovou by receiving 51 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern part of the island in the wake of an
abortive coup backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece, together with Turkey and Britain, were the guarantors
of Cyprus' independence under the 1960 Treaty on the establishment
of the Cyprus Republic. But Greece and neighboring Turkey have
been at odds over Cyprus for many years.
</P>
<P>
In November 1993, Cyprus and Greece reached a joint defense
pact to deal with the threat from northern Cyprus and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greece has warned Turkey that if Turkish troops advance toward
the southern government-controlled part of the island, it would
mean war between the two neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> HK Container Port Throughput Projected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The throughput of the Hong
Kong container port is projected to grow on an annual average of
5.8 percent in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The latest findings of the Hong Kong Port Cargo Forecasts
showed that Hong Kong will retain its role as the main container
port for import and export to the Chinese mainland, Richard Yuen,
secretary of the Port Development Board, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said cargoes from South China are forecast to increase from
63 percent of Hong Kong's total container throughput in 1996 to 76
percent in 2016.
</P>
<P>
In more specific terms, he said that the forecasts predict that
the throughput of the Hong Kong container port will increase to 24
million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) in 2006 and 33 million
TEUs in 2016, which represent a projected average annual growth
rate of 5.8 percent up to 2006 and 3.1 percent between 2007 and
2016.
</P>
<P>
The port, including container terminals, mid-stream and river
trade, handled 14.5 million TEUs last year.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that Hong Kong needs more new terminals
beyond Container Terminal 9 to meet the growing demand in the next
20 years, Yuen said.
</P>
<P>
Container Terminal 9, which is expected to go into operation
in around 2001, will provide an additional capacity of 2.6 million
TEUs on top of the combined capacity of 11.5 million TEUs now
available in the container terminals in Kwai Chung.
</P>
<P>
"We will monitor the actual increase in the throughput of the
port in the next few years before making a decision on the timing
for CT 10 and other new terminals," Yuen added.
</P>
<P>
The Port Development Board carries out a major review of the
Port Cargo Forecasts once every two years to ensure that these
forecasts, which span up to 20 years ahead, are as up to date as
possible.

<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Minister of the State
Education Commission, Wei Yu, told a national meeting here today
that Chinese universities are preparing to adopt some
international practices in an effort to recruit more foreign
students.
</P>
<P>
Chinese universities will follow international practices in
giving scholarships to foreign students and will make their own
decisions about recruiting foreign students and granting them
diplomas, Wei explained.
</P>
<P>
There were at least 40,000 foreign students from more than 150
countries studying in China at more than 300 universities last
year, and an increasing number are coming to China for graduate
studies or to do work as visiting scholars, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the foreign students who are studying at
Chinese universities are here at their own expense, she said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urged to Form National Defense Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Knesset
(parliament) Subcommittee on Security Services has recommended
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to form a national defense
council to help deal with security matters.
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee made this recommendation in its unclassified
part of inquiry report on the botched assassination of Khaled
Mashaal, a leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), in
Amman last September.
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee, consisted of six Knesset members, ran its
own inquiry into the failed assassination of Mashaal, which caused
damage to Israeli-Jordanian relations.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry report, made public here Monday, believed no action
should be taken against any of the involved, but attributed the
failure of the Amman operation to its planning and the way it was
carried out.
</P>
<P>
Because of the failure of the operation, a national defense
council should be formed to help Netanyahu to deal with security
matters, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the decision to hit Mashaal was originated with
a government directive following the last July 30 suicide bombing
in Jerusalem, in which 18 Israelis were killed and some 150 others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The guideline was translated into operation in Jordan on the
recommendation of Danny Yatom, head of Israeli intelligence agency
Mossad. Netanyahu authorized it after discussing the matter with
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
Another committee investigating this issue submitted its
report to Netanyahu Monday morning, and unclassified parts of the
report have also been published after Netanyahu reviewed them.
</P>
<P>
The committee headed by Israel Airline Chairman Joseph
Ciechanover concluded that the upper echelons of Mossad, including
Yatom, bear full responsibility for the failed assassination
attempt.
</P>
<P>
The report absolved netanyahu of responsibility for the
fiasco, saying that once he gave the green light for the
operation, he stepped out of the picture.

<HEADLINE> Russia Willing to Boost Economic Ties With Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia intends to strengthen
its economic cooperation with Greece, said visiting Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov after talks with officials of a
Greek-Russian energy joint venture.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Primakov discussed energy issues in
southeastern Europe with the company's managing director Dimitris
Kopelouzos, including joint venture plans to construct a natural
gas system and electric power plants, the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Primakov affirmed that Moscow would fully support the gas
company's activities, particularly its participation in a
consortium for the construction of the Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil
pipeline in northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
Prometheus gas company was established in 1991 by VEP
Gazexport, the Russian energy giant Gazprom's exporting company,
and Greece's Kopelouzos group on an equal share basis.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for Athens Sunday, Primakov reportedly
said that the climate of confidence in the Athens-Moscow dialogue
was the cornerstone for strengthening economic relations between
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> (Round-up) Herminator Maier Wins Super-G, Timmer Sets Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Hermann Maier
proved his strength on Olympic snow slope on Monday, winning the men's
super giant slalom in Hakuba while Dutch skater Marianne Timmer won
the women's 1,500m speed skating with a world record time in M-Wave.
</P>
<P>
Maier, who had a bad crash in the men's downhill last Friday, threw
himself down the course and won the event at one minute and 34.82
seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Austria, who was nicknamed as Herminator, was the most
outstanding skiier at present with 10 world cup victories in 1997/98
season.
</P>
<P>
Didier Cuche of Switzerland and Hans Knauss of Austria shared the
silver medal with an identical clocking of one minute and 35.43
seconds.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time that Olympic Alpine race ended in a tie for a
silver. In 1964 Innsbruck, Jean Sanbert of the United States and
Christine Goitschel of France shared the silver in the giant slalom.
Six years ago in Albertville in 1992, also in the giant slalom, Diann
Roffe of the United States and Anita Wachter of Austria tied for the
second place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on the ice rink in M-Wave, Timmer outskated pre-favourite
Gunda Nieman-Stirnemannn of Gemany and world record holder Catriona
Lemay-Doan of Canada to win the women's 1,500m race, crossing the
finish line at one minute and 57.58 seconds.
</P>
<P>
It was the third world record set in the ice rink and the third
gold medal in the sport for the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Nieman-Stirnemann was second with 1.08 seconds behind and Christine
Witty of the United States was third with a further 1.39 seconds in
rear.
</P>
<P>
Lemay-Doan, who won the 500m sprint in the games, only managed to
finish at the 13th at 2:02.09.
</P>
<P>
Pasha Grishauk and Evgeny Platov of Russia wrote their names in the
history when they became the first dancers to win the figure skating
ice dancing in two Olympics.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Meets His Yemeni Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Military action will do
serious damages to Iraq as well as the whole region, Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with his Yemeni counterpart Abdul Karim Al
Iryani, Qian said the tense situation caused by weapons
inspection in Iraq has drawn great attention of the whole world.
</P>
<P>
He said China has held that Iraq should not obtain weapons
of mass destruction so as to create conditions for lifting the
sanction.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China supports the efforts made by the international
community to solve the crisis peacefully, he added.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid conflicts, Qian said, China has done a lot of
work to ease the tension and call for Iraq's cooperation with the
UN Security Council and Special Commission in a flexible manner.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue its efforts with the international
community to solve the crisis and support to the mediation by
the UN Security Council and the UN secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
On the Mid-East situation which China is very much concerned
with, Qian said, only peaceful negotiations can properly resolve
the Middle East issue.
</P>
<P>
The long-lasting stalement of peace process has upset countries
in the region and the international community, he said, China
advocates the settlement of the crisis on the basis of relevant
resolutions of the United Nations (UN) and the principle of "peace
for land", in a bid to bring a comprehensive, just and permanent
peace to this region.
</P>
<P>
Qian said Yemen is one of the first Arab nations to establish
diplomatic ties with China, and that over the past four decades,
Sino-Yemeni cooperation has maintained sustainable development,
becoming a good example of cooperation among developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China appreciates the Yemeni Government's policy of
peace, neutral and good-neighborly friendship and the role it has
played in maintaining unity of the Arab world as well as its
support to China on human rights and the Taiwan Issues.
</P>
<P>
AL Iryani said his government will firmly support China on
Taiwan issue and China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Yemen appreciates China's just stand on Middle East issue and
weapons inspection crisis of Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urged to Consider Turkish Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said on Monday that
Greece should make a clear and positive response to the Turkish
peace initiative aimed at improving bitter Turko-Greek
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly news briefing here, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Necati Utkan said that it is Turkey's hope that the
Greek government would give this initiative a serious
consideration.
</P>
<P>
"What I want to say on this subject is that the proposals
contained in our note (to Greece) are substantial and are bringing
a new opening to what was discussed before," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem presented a verbal note
last week to the Greek ambassador in Ankara concerning the
settlement of the Turkish-Greek disputes over the Aegean. No
detail is available.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Turkey suggested that a high-level meeting
between the two foreign ministries be held in Ankara or Athens to
discuss these issues.
</P>
<P>
Utkan noted Greek officials had made some statements with
regard to the Turkish proposals, but said "some of these
statements are contradicting each other."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over the Aegean Sea,
including the airspace limits, sea-bed mineral rights and
sovereignty over numerous islets in the sea.
</P>
<P>
Warships and military jets of the two countries are often
involved in small-scale confrontations in and over the Aegean
Sea.

<HEADLINE> Rural Chinese More Informed About Methods Of Contraception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A farm woman in north China's
Hebei Province who has two children chose a subdermal implant in
1992 as a means of contraception best suited to her and she said
this informed choice of birth control has contributed to her
family's improved standard of living.
</P>
<P>
The woman, Luo Shuxia, said that she has been able to
concentrate on earning more money for the family, bringing an
annual income of 30,000 yuan (about 3,600 US dollars), much higher
than the local average.
</P>
<P>
Luo is one of the women who have benefited from a Sino-American
project sponsored by China's State Family Planning Commission and
the Rockfeller Foundation to introduce new contraceptive methods
into the rural area and help give rural women greater choices.
</P>
<P>
The project was tried in four counties in Hebei and Shandong
provinces from 1992 to 1997 and was declared a success at a
two-day summing-up conference that opened in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
It covered 16 experimental townships with a total population of
360,000 and 75,000 women of child-bearing age, according to
Professor Tu Ping of Beijing University, who was a chief
researcher on the project.
</P>
<P>
By telling women about contraceptive methods available, doctors
and family planners involved in the project were able to help them
make a better choice, Tu explains.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the experimental area for the past five years show
that the program did not mean a change in the use of previous
methods or an increase in the number of unplanned pregnancies or
abortions, meaning that informed choice can be introduced in more
rural parts with a good family planning record. This can take the
place of purely administrative measures, Tu said.
</P>
<P>
The Family Planning Commission has also had informed choice
projects in 21 other counties in China, which is the world's most
populous nation, with over 1.2 billion people. It started a family
planning policy to control population growth at the beginning of
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, family planning workers have worked hard to
provide quality service to improve the health of mothers and
babies and to combine family planning with improved living
standards in rural areas, which hold most of the country's
population.

<HEADLINE> OECD Speeds Up Talks on Multilateral Investment Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The 29 member countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
Monday stepped up talks on the Multilateral Investment Accord,
which is aimed at liberalizing international investment criteria.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks, however, said there is little hope
the United States and Europe will reach a compromise over the
agreement before the end of April, when it is supposed to be
adopted by the negotiating countries.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between Europe and the United States over the U.S.
extra-territorial laws of the Helms-Burton Act and the D'Amato
Act, which ban foreign companies from doing business in Cuba, Iran
and Libya, is one of the blocks preventing agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has also met with strong opposition from civic
and ecological groups, unions, as well as numerous politicians and
intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on multilateral investment, which covers industry,
finance, land and intellectual properties, concerns vital
interests of all OECD countries, since they made direct
investments of 259 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 around the world.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for adopting the agreement has been postponed
several times over the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Japan Pledges to Help Indonesia's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan on Monday reaffirmed its
commitment to help in efforts to get Indonesia's beleaguered
economy back on track.
</P>
<P>
Senior advisor to Japanese Finance Minister Tadao Chino said
here after meeting with President Soeharto that Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto asked him to observe the situation in
Indonesia and consider a series of efforts to resolve the
country's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Japan, being an old friend of Indonesia, will always support
Indonesian efforts to make its economy back on its track," Chino,
who is leading an economic delegation here, told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said they agreed that the two most pressing problems
Indonesia faces in the crisis are the private sector's loan
management and import.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto expressed hope that Japan's aid would soon
materialize.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's total foreign debts reached 137.424 billion U.S.
dollars at the end of last year, including 63.426 billion dollars
of government debts and 73.962 billion dollars of private sector
debts.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said that the private sector debts were one of
the
main causes of the depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah against
the U.S. dollar. The rupiah dropped from 2,400 to the dollar in
July last year to about 10,000 now.
</P>
<P>
At the end of January, the Japanese government decided to give
Indonesia additional assistance worth 520 million dollars to help
the country overcome its monetary crisis.

<HEADLINE> Africans Urged to Meet Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Monday called on Africans to
work extra hard to meet food security in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the technical committee meeting of the 20th FAO
regional conference for Africa, Bamidele F. Dada, FAO assistant
director general and regional representative for Africa, noted
that the 1996 World Food Summit in Rome has set the target to
reduce the current level of hunger and malnutrition by half by
the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
"This poses a special challenge to us in Africa since the
majority of the world's 800 million hungry and malnourished
reside in this region," Dada said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, after the World Food Summit, several African
countries have already begun implementing the strategies to
improve their national food security situation in line with FAO
priority activities.
</P>
<P>
Some even launched special programs for food security and
emergency prevention system for trans-boundary animal and plant
pests and diseases. Other countries are also seeking FAO support
in the preparation of their national strategies for agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the on-going 20th regional conference for Africa,
Dada said the conference is to examine progress made so far since
the World Food Summit, discuss constraints and bottlenecks
encountered, share ideas and exchange experiences and find new
ways of promoting and strengthening inter-country cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It is important "to maintain the momentum generated at the
summit and come up with recommendations to achieve and even
exceed the summit goals and improve the food security and
socio-economic wellbeing of the most needy in your communities,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The three-day technical committee meeting will make
preparations for the 20th FAO regional conference for Africa
which will be held on February 19 and 20. Some 51 ministers and
vice-ministers of agriculture from African countries will attend
the conference.
</P>
<P>
According to the FAO, Africa is the only region in the world
where poverty is projected to increase over the next decade. It
is more alarming that a large number of low-income food deficit
countries are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The FAO has redefined its focus on the promotion of food
security/food production in the region through increased food
self reliance.

<HEADLINE> China's Service Sector Needs Time To Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, during talks with Leon
Brittan, vice-president of the European Commission, said that
opening China's service market can only be done gradually and that
negotiations for this should be held in accordance with the general
service trade principles of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that countries' economic development and situations all
differ, the trade liberalization process is different, and there
is no one model for liberalization in the world.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries can eventually liberalize trade in
services only by gradually opening their markets, and increasing
the capacity, efficiency and competitiveness of their service
sector.
</P>
<P>
She said that by sticking to the WTO's general principles of
service trade during negotiations, many problems can be solved.
</P>
<P>
These are the seventh talks between Wu and Brittan since
1993. Brittan said that the EU hopes that negotiations for China's
entry into the WTO can be concluded as soon as possible, and that
the EU will work toward this end.
</P>
<P>
Wu praised Brittan's efforts at adjusting EU policy on China,
promoting Sino-EU trade, and for China's getting WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
She said that one experience China has gotten from its rapid
economic development since it initiated the reforms and opening up
has been to gradually push the reforms and opening up, and that
China will stick to this.
</P>
<P>
Since applying for GATT membership, China has lowered tariffs
five times, for more than 60 percent overall, Wu said, adding that
it has carried out a series of reforms of its foreign trade system.
</P>
<P>
She said it is unfair to ask China to do in several years what
western countries took 100 or 200 years to do.
</P>
<P>
China had made headway in opening its service sector as well,
she said, adding that the sector will be opened step by step.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also reached consensus on how to advance the
negotiations on trade in services for China's entry into WTO.
</P>
<P>
Wu and Brittan signed three economic cooperation agreements for
China and the EU, on personnel training and technology assistance
from the EU to help China with village elections, improving
statistics, and establishing more open and competitive
purchasing order.

<HEADLINE> 8.4 Million Bangladeshis Suffer From Mental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- About 8.4 million people in
Bangladesh are affected by mental disorders, according to a report
of the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The WHO report was released in Dhaka on Sunday at an
international conference on psychiatry, which was organized by the
Bangladesh Association of Psychiatrists and attended by experts
from Canada, Finland, Denmark, Britain, India, Pakistan, Nepal,
Sri Lanka and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Of the 8.4 million, 1.2 million are suffering from psychiatric
illness, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, about 10 percent of the country's children are
mentally handicapped, the report said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.2 million people suffer from serious mental illness
and need immediate attention, treatment and rehabilitation,
Professor M. A. Sohhan said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
But there are only 60 psychiatrists in Bangladesh for a
population of over 120 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,320 doctors, 100 nurses and 2,000 auxiliary
health workers in the field, he said, adding that "such a poor
manpower cannot effectively meet the mental health need of the
country."
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh government has started building up a National
Institute of Mental Health in Dhaka at a cost of 250 million taka
(about 5.43 million U.S. dollars), Bangladesh Health and Family
Welfare Minister Sahahuddin Yusuf told the conference, urging
non-governmental organizations to help solve the problems
alongside government initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Habibie named Indonesia's Vice President Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's three political
parties have separately named Research and Technology Minister
Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie as the vice president candidate for the
next five year term.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the ruling party Golkar Harmoko said Monday that
Golkar has agreed to name Habibie its only nominee for the vice
presidency.
</P>
<P>
"This means Golkar will only propose one nominee, B.J. Habibie,
for vice president. President Soeharto, in his capacity as the
party's patron, has instructed that the decision should be
constitutionally processed in the upcoming People's Consultative
Assembly," he said after the second plenary meeting of the Golkar
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) Monday also
renominated incumbent President Soeharto for another five-year
term of office and Habibie as vice president.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Muslim oriented United Development party (PPP)
named Habibie its vice president candidate.
</P>
<P>
PPP Chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum said the party's decision
was based 'comprehensive consideration', including the result of
the party's meeting with President Soeharto, as well as criteria
established by the party.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto agreed to his renomination by the Golkar for the
1998-2003 term of presidency on January 20.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000 members of the People's Consultative Assembly will
meet from March 1 to 11 to elect new president and vice president.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cypriot President-Elect Calls for National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' President-elect
Glafcos Clerides has pledged that he would form a government of
national unity comprising all political parties to push forward
the settlement of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the pledge early Monday morning at Eleftheria
athletics center, where he was formally declared president of the
Cyprus Republic for a second five-year term by Chief Returning
Officer Thanos Michael.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that the elections are over. "For me there are no
winners or losers," he said, "now, all of us together, united,
will give the battle to save Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The president-elect vowed to work toward a just, viable and
workable solution to the Cyprus issue, which has remained
unresolved since the island was divided into Greek
Cypriot-controlled south and Turkish Cypriot-dominated north in
1974 when Turkish troops took over the northern third of the
island following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said he will continue with the joint defense pact
signed with the Greek government in November 1993, close
cooperation with Athens and Cyprus' European Union (EU) course.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, 78, won the elections in Sunday's run-off, in
which he beat his rival, former foreign minister George Iacovou,
with a marginal difference.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect, mainly supported by the right-wing
Democratic Rally, received 50.82 percent, or 206,879 votes, while
Iacovou, backed by left-wing Progress Party of Working People
(AKEL) and center-right Democratic Party (DIKO), won 49.18
percent or 200,222 votes.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for Clerides' winning is believed that he got
support from other small political parties.
</P>
<P>
During the first round of elections on February 8, seven
candidates contested the eighth president of the Cyprus Republic
since its independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Iacovou and Clerides became the front-runners with a marginal
difference, with Iacovou in favor.
</P>
<P>
However, four out of five presidential hopefuls turned their
support to incumbent President Clerides after the first round of
voting.
</P>
<P>
The fifth candidate, Socialist Party (EDEK) leader Vassos
Lyssarides, who garnered more than 10 percent votes, decided to
allow his supporters to vote at will.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging defeat in Sunday's presidential run-off, Iacovou,
60, complained that the electoral battle against Clerides "was
not equal," saying that his opponent had more means at his
disposal.
</P>
<P>
But it is widely believed here that Iacovou's defeat was
mainly because he did not win supports from other small political
parties.
</P>
<P>
After the elections, what lies ahead for the president-elect
is the thorny issue of the solution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Clerides pledged during his electoral campaign that he will
tackle the challenges ahead "with experience, determination and
patriotism" on the basis of the national strategy carried out in
the past years.
</P>
<P>
His strategy was reported to be based on three counts: the
rekindled international interest in Cyprus, the effort to lead
Cyprus into the EU and closer ties with Greece.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the U.N.-led international peace efforts
will be intensified after the presidential elections to bring the
two Cypriot sides into negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides have
been deadlocked since the two rounds of direct talks between
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash last year failed
to reach any agreement.
</P>
<P>
So far, neither the U.N. nor the Cypriot government has
expressed optimism over the Cyprus settlement within a short
period of time.
</P>
<P>
Observers here hold that after forming the new government,
Clerides will push the peace process forward by taking advantage
of the international interest and the Cyprus' EU course.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Foreign Exchange Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China's foreign exchange
reserves amounted to 139.9 billion US dollars in 1997, according
to Zhou Xiaochuan, director of the State Administration of
Exchange Control.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national conference on foreign exchange today,
Zhou said that the country's exchange control department tightened
supervision of exchange, paying special attention to risk at
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying the basic rules of various exchange businesses also
helped improve foreign exchange order, he said, pointing to the
general check-ups on national financial institutions, to examine
operating conditions and problems in the national exchange
business, to improve supervision of the exchange business.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserves management was also improved, and an
international financial market study and analysis system set
up. There were good results also in standardizing current-account
income and spending and keeping capital accounts in accordance
with the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
To deal with current-account convertibility of the yuan, the
administration went through all exchange control laws and
regulations, revised 47 of them and formulated eight new laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that this year the administration will further
improve current account and capital account controls,
international revenue and expenditure statistics and analysis,
management of foreign exchange reserves, the stability of the yuan
for continued and healthy national economic development.

<HEADLINE> Clan Finghting Breaks out in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Rival militiamen supporting
Somali faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid, fought in the town
of Afgoe, 30 km southwest of the Somali capital, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitness accounts, the fighting broke out
following the killing of a popular militiaman from the Suleiman
subclan by gunmen loyal to the Eyr subclan. Both subclans belong
to the Habar Gidir clan to which Hussein Aidid and Osman Ali Atto
belong.
</P>
<P>
Armed militia members from the two subclans exchanged heavy
machine gun fire and small arms fire in and around Afgoe town. At
least three more people were killed and five others were wounded,
mainly innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
The hostility between the two subclans has never eased since
the killing of a well known businessman in late last December.
Late Qasim Sheik Mohamoud was killed by Eyr clansmen stationed at
Ballidogle Airport in an ambush on his way back from the town of
Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
A possible bloody retaliation by the relatives of late
Mohamoud was since then prevented by efforts from the two subclan
elders and the fact that the Mogadishu-Baidoa road was cut off
following the floods and heavy rains that devastated many regions
in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Afgoe town remains tense this morning as the
traffic flow on Afgoie road is halted by uncertain elements.
Nevertheless elders from both sides are moving round here in the
capital in an effort to contain the hostility and reopen the road
which is economically vital for the people in the capital.

<HEADLINE> Clan Fighting in Somalia Kills 12 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Details are emerging from
the fighting that erupted between the two Somali subclans of
Suleman and Eyr supporting faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources in Mogadishu confirm the death of another
eight militiamen who were victimized during the fighting which
escalated early Monday morning. This makes the total death to
more than 12 people so far. However, other reports are putting
the number even higher.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, several battle wagons from
Mogadishu and the coastal town of Merca, 100 km South of
Mogadishu, were involved in the fighting to reinforce their
respective militiamen in the town Monday.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses told Xinhua that one double barrel
anti-aircraft machine gun mounted on a four-wheel-drive vehicle
was burned to ashes during the fighting while one more has turned
over wounding several of the occupants in the vehicle. Each of
the warring sides claimed to have seized battle wagons belonging
to the other side.
</P>
<P>
The town of Afgoe, 30 km southwest of Mogadishu, is now
reported to be calm, but the tension is very high even though the
major business centers in the town are undergoing their normal
duties. Elders from both sides in the capital are trying to curb
the hostility by holding an unofficial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, seven people including a woman were killed and more
than a dozen others were wounded when armed militiamen opened
fire indiscriminately on two public transport lorries heading for
Mogadishu from the central regions Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
According to some passengers on board those lorries, the
gunmen have opened fire in their attempt to loot the vehicles and
the properties on board, however, they could not manage to take
the lorries away with them after looting all the booties they
could carry with them.
</P>
<P>
All the wounded were transported to the Hospital of Keysaney
run by the International Committee of Red Cross where they are
being treated. The security in the streets linking Mogadishu to
the central regions has been extremely dangerous ever since the
Islamic courts of Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohamud (Sheikh Ali Dhere)
were demolished following a decree issued by Ali Mahdi Mohamed in
October 1996.

loses 140 million rupees (about 2.26 million U.S. dollars) each
month because of non-revenue water supplies.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Parties Call for Peaceful Solution to Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Some political parties in
Romania have criticized the government's recent announcement
regarding the Iraq crisis, and continue to urge a peaceful
solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government announced last Saturday that if
political effort to solve the Gulf crisis failed, Romania would
support and take part in the military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic Party of Romania (SDPR) said the
government should advocate a peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis,
SDPR leader Gheorgh Prisacaru, chairman of the foreign policy
commission of the Senate of Romanian Parliament, said.
</P>
<P>
Prisacaru stressed that one cannot pay too high a price for
diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis through political measures,
the Evenimentul Zilei (Event of the Day) newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq must carry out the United Nations Security Council's
resolution thoroughly and unconditionally, Prisacaru pointed
out. But the crisis can only be solved through peaceful and
diplomatic means, he added.
</P>
<P>
Varujan Vosganian, chairman of the Romanian Alternative Party,
said it was inappropriate for the government to have made the
announcement under the current situation.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to support the U.S. military action
must win approval from the parliament, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> HK Banking Faces Tough Time in 1998: Chinese Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The year 1998 is expected to
be a challenging year for the Hong Kong banking industry as the
negative effects of the Asian financial turmoil, which has
lingered for over half a year, are showing up, a Chinese banker
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Battered by the regional turmoil, Hong Kong has experienced a
plunge in stock and property markets, sluggish private consumption
and investment and a slowdown in export growth, Liu Jinbao, senior
deputy chief executive of the Bank of China (BOC) Hong Kong-Macao
Regional Office, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the operating environment for the local banking
industry will be relatively stringent, he said, predicting that it
would take time for interest rates to return to pre-crisis levels
and that bad debts would grow.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, favorable internal and external
factors still exist.
</P>
<P>
"The economic growth on the Chinese mainland is expected to be
maintained at 8 percent and the renminbi will remain stable. This
is a strong backup for the economic stability of Hong Kong and
Asia as a whole," said Liu, who is also general manager of the BOC
Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Hong Kong's financial system is healthy and its
fiscal reserves are hefty, he noted, expressing the confidence
that Hong Kong will recover from the crisis ahead of its Asian
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the Bank of China had a total of 421 member
bank branches and sub-branches in Hong Kong and Macao. Its
after-tax profit grew by 7.3 percent in 1997, with bad debts
accounting for a mere one percent of total loans.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese banker, the BOC will accelerate the
development of investment banking services in 1998. The BOC
International (HK) is expected to be set up and start operation
within the year.

Asian financial crisis and will underline Hong Kong's sound
economic fundamentals and the fact that Hong Kong's financial
markets have remained stable.

BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China plans to establish ten
education centers abroad, mostly in Europe, the United States, and
Australia, in the next three years to teach traditional Chinese
medicine (TCM), according to He Xingdong, who is in charge of
educational affairs at the State TCM Administration.
</P>
<P>
The administration will seek foreign governments' approval to
set up 30 medical centers where Chinese doctors can practice with
traditional medicines and methods to give foreigners a better
understanding of traditional Chinese medicine, He said.
</P>
<P>
The major problem, it has been pointed out, is to get the
confidence of foreigners. TCM treatments include acupuncture and
are mainly used in Chinese communities.

<P>
Medical universities in Beijing and Nanjing have cooperated
with Britain and Australia in undergraduate courses of TCM, and a
dozen TCM colleges and more than 40 hospitals and research
institutes in China offer courses for foreigners.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China will take steps this
year to support enterprise reforms, according to Zhou Xiaochuan,
the director of the State Administration of Exchange Control.
</P>
<P>
He said that more enterprises will be permitted to incur
short-term foreign debt directly, and some major efficient
enterprises with a good record will be selected to raise funds
directly from the international capital market.
</P>
<P>
Other enterprises will be allowed to retain foreign exchange
earnings to improve their operations, he said, adding that they
will also be helped to reduce their foreign exchange trading costs
and narrow the exchange gap between them and foreign-backed
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts will be made to increase the source of foreign
exchange savings deposits for various banks.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's current exchange control system can
control international financial speculation and that these steps
will not have a negative effect on the exchange rate of the yuan
and the country's foreign exchange reserves, but rather will have
a positive effect on China's balance of international payments and
help keep the yuan stable and the healthy development of the
national economy.

<HEADLINE> S. African Air Force Sells Aircrafts Due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The South African Air
Force (SAAF) is selling 12 of its upgraded TP C-47 Dakota
aircrafts on tender because of national defense budget cut, The
Star newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to rationalize prices, including on aircrafts
to save costs. The Dakota fleet was large and with the severely
cut budget, it has been necessary to remove a certain number,"
SAAF spokesman Laverne Machine said.
</P>
<P>
A further two have already been sold to buyers in the United
States, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Funds generated from the sale will not necessarily go to the
SAAF, but initially be placed in the Treasury as state funds, to
which the South African National Defense Force could apply in
order to have the money returned to it and utilized for
priorities.
</P>
<P>
The Dakota aircrafts were upgraded in the early 1990s because
it had been impossible for the SAAF to buy new aircrafts due to
international arms embargoes against the South African apartheid
regime.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Yemeni President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said that China is ready to make joint efforts
together with Yemeni friends to push forward bilateral relations on
the existing basis.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark here this afternoon in a meeting with
visiting Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
</P>
<P>
He said that China treasures Sino-Yemeni friendship which has
stood the test of both the time and changes on the international
arena, and the two countries can be viewed as "all-weather"
friends.
</P>
<P>
Li said that although China and Yemen are far away from each
other, Sino-Yemeni relations have been developing well since the
two countries forged diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates Yemen government's consistent support for
China on major issues, especially on issues such as human
rights and Taiwan, added Li.
</P>
<P>
On China's domestic situation, Li said that the policy on
reforms and opening-up initiated two decades ago has resulted in
sustained growth of China's national economy, the steady
improvement of Chinese people's living standard and great changes
in various aspects.
</P>
<P>
However, the level of China's overall economic development is
still low because of its huge population and weak economic
basis.
</P>
<P>
although its development is smooth on the whole, he said, China
is still faced with many knotty problems calling for prompt
solutions.
</P>
<P>
He continued that at present, Chinese people are advancing
confidently towards its grand cross-century objective, while
holding high the great banner of the Deng Xiaoping's Theory.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed Saleh on the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said that Yemen will continue to expand its friendly
relations and cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the fact that while carrying out reforms and
opening to the outside world, China has retained the fine
tradition of multi-party cooperation led by the Chinese Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yemen and other developing countries should draw
on China's experience in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his satisfaction with bilateral cooperation in
politics, the economy and culture, saying that his country will
learn from China's experience in economic development, so as to
build Yemen into a prosperous and strong country.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his thanks for Saleh's invitation to him to visit
Yemen.

<HEADLINE> Higher Poverty Rates Witnessed in Nigerian Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Poverty is now more prevalent
in cities and urban centers of Nigeria than in the rural areas,
the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) says.
</P>
<P>
The reversal in the concentration of the poor became
noticeable as from the mid-80s, according to a recent FOS
publication "Poverty and Welfare in Nigeria".
</P>
<P>
It says that the population of the urban poor increased from
9.7 million in 1985 to 11.9 million in 1992, whereas that of the
rural poor decreased from 26.6 million to 22.8 million in the
same period.
</P>
<P>
The report, which did not give the criteria to define the
poor, is jointly done by FOS and the National Population
Commission under the auspices of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
It also reveals that extreme poverty increased generally
within the period under review, from 10.1 million to 13.9
million.
</P>
<P>
But the rise is thrice more in towns than in villages.
</P>
<P>
According to the publication, the population of the poor is
greater in the northern parts of the country than in the
southwest and southeast where more people have access to
education.
</P>
<P>
On international comparative basis, the survey shows that
Nigeria ranks lower than Cote d'Ivoire, Zambia, Ghana and Kenya
in terms of living standards, quoting World Bank data.
</P>
<P>
Using the 1995 per capita Gross National Product, Nigeria had
260 U.S. Dollars, compared to 660 Dollars in Cote d'Ivoire, 400
Dollars in Zambia, 390 Dollars in Ghana and 280 Dollars in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed increasing poverty in Nigeria to what is
called "Dutch disease", a situation in which the country embarked
on importation spree during the oil boom era to the neglect of
agriculture and other productive activities.
</P>
<P>
During the oil boom, people and groups imported cheap
machinery for manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
But these ventures became less profitable, many, especially
those depending on imported raw materials, started closing down
and laying off workers, most of whom migrated from the rural
areas when farming could make less money.
</P>
<P>
This accounted for the increase of urban poverty, says the
report, adding "now that the boom is over, the economy can no
longer cope with the bloated appetite for imports."
</P>
<P>
Other reasons adduced for the rise of poverty in the country
include economic mismanagement, falling oil prices which reduced
government funding, huge foreign debts, rising world interest
rates, and misallocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
On the strategies to improve general welfare in the country,
the report recommends a focused emphasis on economic growth by
the government, better access for the poor to social services,
provision of adequate infrastructure, targeted intervention to
protect the poorest and most vulnerable in society and prudent
fiscal management.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Kuwaiti Planning
Minister Ali Fahd Al-Zumei said Monday that a possible attack
against Iraq will only benefit Israel and harm Arab world.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait, and the Arab world as a whole, will be the biggest
loser in a possible military assault against Iraq while Israel
will benefit from it," Zumei said at a meeting with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, he delivered a letter from Kuwaiti Emir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah to the Lebanese president.
</P>
<P>
Zumei said that his country and Lebanon share the common view
that the United Nations resolutions should be respected and all
diplomatic avenues should be used to cool off the situation and
keep the region from a war.
</P>
<P>
The US has threaten to attack Iraq if it doest not allow
U.N. weapons inspectors free access to its presidential sites
suspected of hiding weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister also expressed hopes that the would-be
visit by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to Baghdad which is
believed as the last hope for a peaceful solution to the current
Iraqi crisis be successful and positive.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the idea of holding an Arab summit to resolve the
problem, Zumei said that his country supports any solution within
the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Only pressures can force Iraq to comply with the
U.N. resolutions, he stressed.

rallying support for his country's stance on the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Says Yuan Will Not Be Devalued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Southeast Asian financial
crises will not affect China's international balance of payments
and will not lead to a devaluation of the renminbi, Zhou
Xiaochuan, director of the State Administration of Exchange
Control, told the annual national exchange control conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that a stable yuan is in China's interest and is
important to the economic development of Asia and the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
China expects to maintain its international balance of payments,
and the negative effect of the Asian financial crisis on China's
exports will be offset by increased export tax rebates and other
measures. Other factors are an expected fairly good economic
growth, new policies encouraging foreign investment, and the 140
billion US dollars in foreign reserves. Changes in their
operations have also helped increase the competitiveness of
China's foreign trade enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that, considering China's trade surplus in recent
years, its strong capital inflow, low rate of inflation, money
supply, and other factors, the yuan has the possibility of
appreciating and no pressure to devaluate. From 1994 to 1996, the
rmb appreciated 44.3 percent, and last year, although the nominal
rate was not up much, there appreciation in effect because of the
sharp depreciation of neighboring currencies, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- South African North-West
Premier Popo Molefe has agreed to resign from the ruling African
National Congress' (ANC) policy-making body, the National
Executive Committee (NEC), The Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after Molefe failed to secure the support of
his ANC provincial executive committee (PEC) to allow him to hold
both positions, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Molefe was elected member of the all-powerful NEC at the ANC
national conference in Mafikeng, North-West province last
December.
</P>
<P>
He told the newspaper that he gave up his national position
because the provincial executive body wanted him to "concentrate
on preparing the province for the 1999 general elections."
</P>
<P>
But the paper quoted PEC sources as saying that Molefe chose
to resign from the NEC after the PEC failed to agree on using its
constitutional option of supporting his bid to retain both
positions.
</P>
<P>
The PEC met Friday to debate whether it should make a
presentation to the NEC to request that Molefe retain both his
NEC membership and provincial chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Reports had said there were forces in the province against
Molefe, but the ANC denied the allegations.

<HEADLINE> S. African Cabinet Takes Over AIDS Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Shocking figures on the
spread of AIDS/HIV in South Africa -- at least 1,500 every day --
have forced the cabinet to take over the AIDS/HIV campaign from
the Health Department, The Star newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma told a media briefing in
parliament that a cabinet sub-committee has been established to
address the disease.
</P>
<P>
The report didn't say when the briefing occurred.
</P>
<P>
"We think we won't succeed if we look at AIDS as a health
matter because this is a matter that affects everyone," Zuma was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet initiative would reinforce the Health Department's
AIDS programs that have been running for three years, she said.
</P>
<P>
These include a campaign to move beyond AIDS awareness to
changing behavior, and a program aimed at children.
</P>
<P>
The control of the spread of AIDS, the treatment of sexually
transmitted diseases and the care of AIDS patients formed the
core of the Health Department's priorities for 1998.

<HEADLINE> UK Should Move to End Airlink Row, Nigeria Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has kicked the ball to
Britain, saying it is the British Aviation Authorities (BAA) that
should take into account Nigeria's conditions that will lead to
the resumption of mutual airlink cut by BAA last year.
</P>
<P>
The current impasse would soon come to an end if the proposals
and recommendations sent by Nigeria were considered, Minister of
Aviation Air Commodore Ita Udo Imeh said in the capital Abuja
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Britain last May banned Nigerian registered aircrafts from
flying its airspace on the grounds that they do not meet their
international standards.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria took retaliation within 24 hours by barring the
British Airways from flying to the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Having suffered huge losses from the severance of direct
airlink between the two countries, Britain lifted the ban four
months later.
</P>
<P>
However, Nigeria refused to do the same and instead insisted
on reviewing the bilateral air service agreement for equal
footing and fairness.
</P>
<P>
Several meetings have been held by officials of both countries
to resolve the impasse. The latest were held in last December
and earlier this month respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to industrial sources here, Nigeria has blamed the
British Airways for unilaterally introducing the use of Boeing
747 aircraft, and breaching the agreement of adopting DC10
planes.
</P>
<P>
Boeing 747 has a capacity for 350 passengers while that of DC
10 has only 260.
</P>
<P>
The British Airways also operates more flights than the
Nigerian Airways on the lucrative London-Lagos route, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
After the talks in Abuja two weeks ago, the Nigerian Aviation
Minister said "we are making some progress", and the British
officials who took part in the discussions had taken the views of
the ministry to their authorities.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is in their court. After they finish, we expect
them to inform us of their position," he added. "We don't however
foresee any problem."

<HEADLINE> Blacks Play Better Role in S. African Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- South African
electricity giant Eskom has exceeded a self-imposed affirmative
action target that by 1997 blacks would make up 30 percent of its
management.
</P>
<P>
The company now aims to have half of its managers from
previously disadvantaged communities by the turn of this century,
local daily Business Day quoted the company's sources as
reporting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The affirmative action policy had caused unhappiness in
certain circles in Eskom and led to a significant number of
people leaving, the unidentified sources said.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to estimate how many employees have left --
it could be up to 5,000. But they have generally been replaced
by competent, well-trained personnel so there have been few
hitches for Eskom as a service provider," one source said.
</P>
<P>
Eskom, the national electricity utility, supplies 98 percent
of electricity in South Africa, and is also dominating the region
of southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated in 1992 that only five percent of Eskom's
management was black and it sets target that by 1997 30 percent
should be from previously disadvantaged communities.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it reached 32 percent and is well on its way to
meeting the 50 percent target.
</P>
<P>
Eskom sources said the electricity utility had steered clear
of making token black appointments by recruiting people with
university degrees and a good reputation, and employing them at
middle-management level. They then had between six months and two
years to prove their mettle.
</P>
<P>
Eskom has previously stated that it would not employ a policy
of forced retrenchment to implement its affirmative action
policy. Depending on age, employees whose positions became
redundant could ask to retire, transfer to another position or
opt for "voluntary separation".

sharply on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) plunged by 71.14 points, or 4.6 percent,
to close at 1481.55 points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the share prices fell on worries over the
situation in Indonesia and the renewed weakness of the Indonesian
rupiah dragged down other Asian currencies, affecting regional
stock markets.

There were also fears that Indonesian investors may sell their
assets here thus putting further pressure on the local property
market, they said.

at 494.39 million Singapore dollars (about 294.28 million U.S.
dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 341 to 33 while 237
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Renong Bhd was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 51.95 million units. It was followed by
Rekapac which had 26.78 million shares traded. Easyknit was next
with 21.67 million shares changed hands.

dollars. GE Life increased by 40 cents to end at 11.9 Singapore
dollars. Singapore Land picked up by 14 cents to close at 3.74
Singapore dollars.

Singapore dollars. SPH fell by 90 cents to close at 18.9 Singapore
dollars while local car distributor Cycle &AMP; Carriage (C&AMP;C) lost 75

PARIS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The 29 member countries of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) Monday began negotiation on the
multilateral accord on investment aimed at liberalizing
trans-continental investment in industry, finance, land and
intellectual property. The agreement has been prepared under great
discretion, because it has met with opposition from American civic
and ecological groups, European intellectuals as well as many
politicians on the two sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
-- The Algerian security authorities announced last Friday the
death of Ali Touchent, alias Tarek, who was believed to be the
mastermind of a wave of terrorist attacks in France in 1995. Tarek
was "formally identified" nine months after his death on May 23,
1997 in a hotel in Algiers. France has expressed prudence over the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- A study by French scientists show that ecstasy, the pill
which is thought to be capable of stimulating people, can cause
depression, toothpains, heart problems and renal insufficiency.
The drug is no longer only used by drug addicts, but is consumed
by many in France.
</P>
<P>
-- France's overseas territories and relatively less developed
regions have greatly benefited from the subsidy by the European
Union for regional development. Among the beneficiaries are the
Indian Ocean island of Reunion, the Caribbean islands of Quadeloupe
and Martinique, the French Guyana and Corsica.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The steady development of
Guangzhou's Economic and Technological Development Zone, located
in the capital of south China's Guangdong Province, has been
credited to its industrial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the zone attracted 716 million
U.S. dollars of contractual investment in 1997, an all-time high
since its inauguration 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-seven projects were approved or added
investment. Altogether, the zone utilized 405 million U.S. dollars
in overseas funds, ranking first among all the state-grade
development zones.
</P>
<P>
The zone has directed overseas funds into the development of
high-tech industry and attempted to improve the product mix by
introducing high-tech projects, provincial officials said. So far,
10 labor-intensive enterprises have been removed from the zone.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, 43 of the world's top 500
companies from 26 countries -- including the United States, Japan
and England -- have launched business operations in the zone, with
their investment accounting for more than half of the zone's total
overseas funds. Meanwhile, investments from Hong Kong and Macao
fell from 80 percent to 42 percent.
</P>

To go full steam ahead, officials said, the zone has paid equal
attention to the development of secondary and service industries,
exports and imports.

of direct links among enterprises in the two countries.

Statistics from the Chinese customs indicated that the
trade volume between the two countries topped 751 million US

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
three-quarters of a U.S. cent lower Monday after being caught in
the downdraft of sagging Asian currency units.
</P>
<P>
The unit ended at 66.55 U.S. cents, from 67.31 in Sydney
previously.
</P>
<P>
Investors Monday were warily watching developments in Indonesia
as the government there mulled over a plan to implement a currency
board and peg the Indonesian rupiah to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
But the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the weekend
warned Indonesia against instituting the board.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has now indicated that it might withdraw the 43 billion
U.S. dollars it has earmarked for financial assistance to
Indonesia's battered economy.
</P>
<P>
Market participants fear that such an action would precipitate
a financial collapse and social unrest in the beleaguered nation.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 83.99 Japanese yen from 83.98
previously and at 1.2122 Deutsche marks from 1.22.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif Monday invited Hong Kong investors to take
part in his country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon organized by the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC), Sharif, who is on a three-day visit to
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, said the
time-tested friendship between Pakistan and China must now find
expression in mutually beneficial areas of economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is now geared and set for rapid growth," he told
hundreds of people present on the occasion. "I invite you to
become our partners in progress. The possibilities are enormous."
</P>
<P>
Calling Pakistan "a land of unmatched opportunities," Sharif
said permits and licensing are no longer required for the setting
up of any industry except in the areas of arms and ammunition,
currency and mint, high explosives, radioactive material and
alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
The private sector, therefore, is at liberty to decide on its
own priorities, set its own pace and embark on projects at any
time and in any place in Pakistan, he declared.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors enjoy full protection under laws of Pakistan
and foreign exchange restrictions have been removed, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Full repatriation of capital, capital gains, profits and
dividends is allowed without any hindrance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment is now allowed on a repatriable basis in
such diverse fields as agriculture, real estate and housing,
provision of services, infrastructure development and the social
sector, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Zero-rated import tariffs have been introduced in the
categories of value-added, export and high-tech industries,
whereas the tariff rate for priority and agro-based industries
has been set at a nominal 10 percent, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the new investment policy, import tariffs
for machinery and equipment for infrastructure development, hotels
and tourism, as well as for social and service sector projects
have also been kept at 10 percent or lower, he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the sweeping reduction of tariffs, very
attractive first-year and reinvestment allowances ranging from 50
to 90 percent have also been adopted, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Investment has been established to function as a
one-window facility to assist foreign and domestic investors, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif went on to say that at the macroeconomic level, Pakistan
has taken measures to contain the budget deficit, reduce
inflation, broaden the tax net and bring about savings by
downsizing the government and exercising financial discipline.
</P>
<P>
"I only wish to emphasize here that we, in Pakistan, have taken
a conscious decision to build a new, vibrant and dynamic system
which will bring about a transformation in the lives of our
people," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who arrived here Sunday morning after a visit to
China's mainland, will attend a banquet hosted by Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa in his honor Monday evening and leave Hong Kong for
home Tuesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> HK's Leading Airline Builds New Home at New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Cathay Pacific, a leading
airline in Hong Kong, is soon completing the construction of its
new headquarters at Hong Kong's new international airport at Chek
Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
The topping-out ceremony of the headquarters, named Cathay
Pacific City, was held Monday, officiated by Cathay Pacific
Chairman Peter Sutch and Chief Executive Officer of the Airport
Authority Henry Townsend.
</P>
<P>
"This is a landmark day for Cathay Pacific," Sutch said, noting
that the building is a huge investment in the new airport and in
Hong Kong, a premier aviation hub in the region.
</P>
<P>
Cathay's "new home," built at a cost of 4.9 billion HK dollars
(628 million U.S. dollars), features three office blocks, a staff
hotel and a flight training center. It will put under one roof
some 3,000 local staff members who are currently working at more
than 20 locations across Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The phased move into the building begins in June. Operational
departments will be ready for airport opening on July 6 and the
rest of the airline will move in phases during the second half of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The new airport, with a hefty investment of some 20 billion
U.S. dollars, is hailed as one of the most modern and
sophisticated airports in the world.
</P>
<P>
With its first runway put into operation in July, the airport
is capable of meeting the ever-increasing air traffic demand, with
 an annual capacity of 35 million passengers and about three
million tons of cargo.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Manila to Develop Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has urged the
Philippines to set "better funding" for technology, education and
training to improve competitiveness of its exports, the Philippine
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a recent study made by the bank as saying the
country's private sector invests little in technology development
and there is no program to stimulate technology activities in
industry.
</P>
<P>
There is a need for a "technology foresight" exercise that
would involve industry technology institutions and academies in
evaluating the most pressing technological needs facing the
Philippines, the study said.
</P>
<P>
This exercise is being undertaken in most countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation, aimed primarily at helping
firms with technical problems and upgrading, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the government must focus its attention on true
public services like basic and contract research, information
collection and dissemination and extension services to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
Productivity-raising measures for industry also need to be
launched in the country, using benchmarking techniques like those
of Taiwan that cater to a large number of export-oriented SMEs.
</P>
<P>
As the country's skilled manpower is its most valuable
resource, the bank said, the government should undertake sweeping
improvements at all stages of the education and training system.
</P>
<P>
It added that appropriate funding should be earmarked
especially for smaller firms to be used to upgrade the skills of
workers.

HONG KONG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong handled more than
118,000 tons of air cargo in January this year, a drop of
2.6 percent from the same month of 1997, Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals Limited (HACTL) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Festival holiday at the end of January brought a
traditional slowdown in air cargo traffic, said sources from
HACTL, one of the busiest air freight operators in the world.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 118,165 tons of air cargo, 45 percent, or 53,635
tons, were exports, 42.7 percent, or 50,502 tons, were imports and the
remaining 11.9 percent or 14,028 tons transshipment goods.
</P>
<P>
HACTL Managing Director Anthony Charter said Monday: "January
1998 was a slightly quieter month due to the closeness of
Christmas and the New Year holiday compared to last year. But it
is still too early to perceive any trend for this year's cargo
growth."
</P>
<P>
The air cargo operator handled a record 1.7 million tons of
goods in 1997 and kept breaking monthly records during September,
October and November.

TOKYO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto in his policy speech on Monday reiterated his cabinet's
determination to boost the country's sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
The government will get Japan through its current economic
difficulties and work to overhaul the entire system, Hashimoto
said in the speech initially scheduled for more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The head of government's policy statement was delayed due to
the country's financial and economic problems giving rise to
anxieties about possible collapse of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
He called for early implementation of measures to address the
anxieties and credit crunch, and for swift passage of the budget
for fiscal 1998, which starts April 1, by the Diet, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
About the Iraq crisis, Hashimoto said Tokyo will work with the
United States and other countries to push for Baghdad's
observation of United Nations Security Council resolutions and
providing U.N. inspectors with unrestricted access to all sites.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also expressed the hope to further
strengthen relations with China, the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that Japan will work together with other
countries through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help
other Asian countries out from the shadow of recent financial
crisis.

BAGHDAD, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh
Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabir al-Thani arrived here Monday to discuss
with Iraqi officials the latest Iraq-U.N. crisis over weapons
inspections, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz greeted Jabir al-Thani,
also Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani's special
envoy, at the Saddam International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari foreign minister said in a statement to the press
that his visit falls within the framework of a Qatari initiative
to discuss with Iraqi officials the standoff between Iraq and the
U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM in charge of eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time since the 1991 Gulf war that an Arab
state's foreign minister paid a visit to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that he hoped a solution conducive to peace would be
found.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari envoy is accompanied by a delegation comprising
foreign undersecretary, Qatar's permanent representative to the
U.N. and a number of officials.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has been calling for a peaceful solution to the crisis
between Iraq and the U.N. over weapons inspection triggered off by
Iraqi refusal to allow weapons inspectors unfettered access to
sites suspected of hiding banned weapons.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Shipyard Gets ISO 9002 Certification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A Kenya shipyard, the African
Marine and General Engineering, has been awarded the ISO 9002
Certificate of Quality, The East African reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper said the certification of the shipyard
was expected to give the company a competitive advantage over
other ship repair companies within the east African region.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Andrew Sinchair, managing director of the
shipyard, as saying that his company had maintained good
relations with ship-repairing industries in South Africa, Dubai
and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
This has enabled African Marine and General Engineering, which
was established 70 years ago, to continuously adapt and update
itself on the latest technologies, he added.
</P>
<P>
The director noted that the shipyard which started off with a
slipway had become a vital ship repair center along the east
African coast with a 180m-long modern dry-dock and a small
40m-long dry-dock.
</P>
<P>
The mark of international recognition will help the Kenya
shipyard compete with other international ship repair companies,
the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
A recent report on the ship repair industry published by a
U.K. shipping consulting firm, HP Drewry and Ocean Shipping, said
that the global repair market could see revenues rising from 8.7
billion U.S. Dollars in 1995 to 23.2 billion Dollars by the year
2000.

<HEADLINE> Two Drug Dealers Arrested in Dar es Salaam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Police have seized two
people here for possessing illicit drugs worth 500 US Dollars,
local newspapers reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were impounded Thursday afternoon with 5.2 grams
of heroin, 450 grams of bhang and 300 special rolls for wrapping
rolls of bhang, said Esaka Mugasa, an officer from the Anti-drugs
Unit.
</P>
<P>
They were caught inside a house in the Kinodoni A street,
which has been haunted by drug dealers over the past months,
Mugasa said.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse has become increasingly serious in Tanzania, George
Timbuka, Commissioner for the National Co-ordination of Drug
Control, told reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
Although drug traffikers took Tanzania as a drug trade
transit, they could not find the market because people in the
country would refuse to take drugs, he added.
</P>
<P>
But the clean reputation has been ruined after more and more
people in the country started to take drugs, Timbuka said.
</P>
<P>
"Drug dealing is a deadly monster which eats away the
country's most treasured section -- the young," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner has appealed to the public and various
government agencies to join hands in curbing the menace of drugs.

<HEADLINE> EC Vice-President Promises New EU-China Relationship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Europe and China should build
"a positive, open and comprehensive partnership" fit for the next
century and all the challenges it will bring, a leading European
Union official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Leon Brittan, vice-President of the European Commission, made
the remarks at a luncheon given in his honor by the EU
representative office in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In his lecture at the luncheon entitled the EU and
China: building a partnership for the future, Brittan said "the
EU's approach to China has always been firmly based on the concept
of open dialogue."
</P>
<P>
And "This is particularly true when dealing with a relationship
which evolves as fast as that between the EU and China. The pace
of change, both in China and Europe, is truly breathtaking. It is
essential that we construct a partnership which is able to keep up
with and respond to all the changes as they occur," he said. He
noted that EU wishes to expand and strengthen its long-term
relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the talks on China's joining of WTO, Brittan said
there have been great progress and China has made unremitting
efforts on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"The EU has long been one of the most enthusiastic and active
sponsors of the accession talks and the WTO membership is entirely
consistent with the direction of economic reform taken in China
and primarily serve China's interests," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Brittan also expressed his appreciation for a series of
important measures taken by China in this regard, including the
lowering of tariffs and improving its legal system.
</P>
<P>
Brittan also said he was heartened that in recent months a
concerted attempt has been made to address human rights in an
open, frank and respectful dialogue between the EU and China.
</P>
<P>
"The EU is keen to pursue this sensitive and highly important
issue through dialogue and is prepared to avoid unnecessary
confrontation," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Invest Heavily in Road Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has set
aside 7.6 billion Naira (about 95 million U.S. Dollars) for
constructing new highways nationwide this year, according to
Garba Muhammed, Minister of Works and Housing.
</P>
<P>
Some 56 roads in the country have been selected for the
construction project, local press reported Monday, quoting the
minister.
</P>
<P>
There are approximately 200,000 km of road network in the
country at present, 35,000 classified as federal highways.
</P>
<P>
The government would also spend an additional one billion
Naira (about 12.5 million Dollars) on the rehabilitation of
existing highways, the minister said here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to him, half of the amount for the road repair will
be provided by his ministry from the funds it generated from toll
plazas nationwide, while the government will complete the other
half.
</P>
<P>
The ministry had collected more than 700 million Naira (about
8.75 million Dollars) from the 28 privatized toll plazas on the
country's highways.
</P>
<P>
Toll collection on highways and bridges in Lagos is expected
to begin soon.
</P>
<P>
Highways and bridges in this national economic center have
been used freely.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Only Iraq Can Prevent U.S. Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has made it clear that the Iraqi abidance by all relevant United
Nations resolutions is "the sole way" to stave off any attack, the
Mayo weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the paper, the mouthpiece of the ruling
National Democratic Party (NDP), Mubarak asserts, however, that
nobody can prevent the U.S. from attacking Iraq specially in light
of its heavy military build-up in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"But should Iraq abide by the U.N. resolutions, Washington
would have no pretext before the international public opinion to
carry out any military action," the president continued.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who is also the NDP chairman, stressed that all Arabs,
spearheaded by Egypt and Saudi Arabia, prefer a peaceful solution
to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"A military action will be detrimental to Iraq, the Gulf
countries and the entire Middle East region. It will also affect
the interests of the U.S. and Britain which supports Washington's
political and military moves unconditionally," said Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the coming visit by U.N. chief Kofi Annan
to Iraq would fructify into a breakthrough and help solve Iraq's
crisis with the U.N. peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to meet with Iraqi officials this week to
discuss its compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolutions
and the necessity of opening all suspected sites to the U.N. arms
inspection team.
</P>
<P>
"Every possible avenue should be broached to prevent this
strike, which will claim the lives of Iraqi brothers and devastate
the country's remanent infrastructure," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He resounded his warning against any attempt to partition Iraq
because this would mean that parts of Iraq will be annexed by Iran
and another country.
</P>
<P>
The current crisis was triggered by Baghdad's refusal to open
all sites suspected of hiding weapons of mass destruction to
U.N. inspectors.

<P>
Touching upon the international situation, Jiang said China has
always pursued an independent foreign policy and is willing to
develop friendly relations and cooperation with all countries in
the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
He added that China is willing to work with other countries to
establish a peaceful, stable, fair and reasonable new world order.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Yemen has made efforts to improve relations
with its neighbors and other Arab states and to seek peaceful
solutions to conflicts. He said he hopes Yemen will play a bigger
role in promoting the unity among the Arab nations and in
maintaining peace and stability in the Arabian Peninsula and Red
Sea area.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the developing countries are becoming an important
force on the international stage and various regional
organizations are becoming more active.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the world is still full of complex
conflicts, and regional turbulence and wars occur from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East issue, Jiang said China supports the Middle
East peace process and is deeply concerned with the current
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
China believes that the Arabs and the Israelis should resume
peace talks as soon as possible on the basis of relevant United
Nations resolutions and on the principle of "land for peace"
</P>
<P>
In this way, he added, the two sides should gradually establish
mutual trust, eliminate hostility and finally realize a
comprehensive, fair and lasting peace in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ready for Direct Dialogue with US: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf has said that Iraq was ready for direct talks with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We call for a political dialogue between Iraq and the United
States of America," said al-Sahhaf in an interview with local
English daily Jordan Times, which was published Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was "the proper channel" to solve any problems between the
two countries, said the Iraqi foreign minister who arrived here
Thursday on the third leg of his regional tour to explain Iraq's
position on the Iraq-U.N. crisis.
</P>
<P>
"A healthy political dialogue should be with no
conditions. Iraq used to have good trade, economic and political
relations with the United States of America," Al-Sahhaf said, "we
strongly believe that a political dialogue is the way to remove
any obstacles to normal bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the American reaction," he added
</P>
<P>
The Speaker of Iraq's National Assembly, Saadoun Hammadi, once
contacted his U.S. counterpart Newt Gingrich through Iraqi envoy
to the U.N. Nizar Hamdoun, offering to start a dialogue between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal was immediately rejected by the
U.S. parliament.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that they rethink this offer and send a delegation to
Baghdad to see the facts as they are," Al-Sahhaf said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iraqi foreign minister welcomed the efforts
exerted by the U.N. to help find a peaceful solution to the crisis
triggered off by Iraq's denial of free access to U.N. weapons
inspectors to sites suspected of hiding banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's upcoming
visit to Baghdad will succeed in solving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf's regional tour has taken him to Egypt and Syria. He
left here Monday for Lebanon in a bid to drum up more Arab
support for Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Surprise World Best Wins Women's 1,500m Speed Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Marianne Timmer of the
Netherlands won her country's third Nagano Olympic speed skating gold
with a surprise world record as she claimed the women's 1,500m race at
the "M-Wave" on Monday.
</P>
<P>
With a new slap skate, Timmer skated a stunning new record time of
one minute 57.58 seconds to upset the heavy favorite Gunda
Niemann-Stirnemann of Germany for her first Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old rewrote the old world record of 1:57.87 set by
Canadian Catriona Lemay-Doan in Cagalry November 29 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it. When I crossed the line and saw the board,
I thought the time was for somebody else," Timmer said. "I thought I
would be between third and sixth."
</P>
<P>
The record was also the third new world mark in the Nagano Olympic
speed skating competitions. And two of them were set by the skaters
from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Dutchman Gianni Romme established the first in the men's 5,000m in
6:22.20, while Norwegian Aadne Sondral set the second in the men's
1,500m in 1:47.87.
</P>
<P>
The surprise of the day was the poor showing of former world record
holder Lemay-Doan, who won the 500 meters last week. She skated in
2:02.19 to finish in a disappointed 13th place.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Niemann, leader at World Cup standings in the distance,
raced last pair alone, but could not catch Timmer's time, capturing
the silver medal as she did at the 1992 Games with 1:58.66.
</P>
<P>
"It was of course everything or nothing since I was race alone,"
Niemann said. "I knew it would be extremely difficult anyway since
Marinnae had set this increadible time and then to have to go alone.
You saw that it wasn't the best run but it was a very very good run
and Marianne just skated brilliantly."
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old won two Olympic gold medals in 1992, but failed to
take her third again in Nagano. In Lillehammer four years gao, She
took bronze in the 1,500m race. However, she has chances for her dream
in her favorite 3,000m and 5,000m races in following days.
</P>
<P>
Christine Witty of the United Statesn, another young skater
benefiting from the new slap skate revolution, gave her country's
first speed skating medal in Nagano when she too the bronze Monday in
1:58.97.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Emese Hunyady of Austria was fourth in 1:59.19,
followed by German Anna Friesinger, only 0.01 second behind the
Austian.

<HEADLINE> China, Netherlands Step up Veterinary Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China's animal quarantine
plays an important role in its international export of animal
products, and China plans to cooperate closely in this area with
the Netherlands, an export giant for animal husbandry products.
</P>
<P>
During the Sino-Dutch Veterinary Seminar which opened here
today, Shi Youlong, an official in charge of policy studies in the
Department of Animal Husbandry and Health of China's Ministry of
Agriculture, said, "the export of Chinese animal husbandry
products is not compatible with its position as a major producer
in the world."
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, China now ranks first in major animal
products. Its annual meat production is 60 million tons,
accounting for 28 percent of the world total, and pork takes
46-to-48 percent of the world's share.
</P>
<P>
China also turns out 20 million tons of eggs a year, or 40
percent of the global production.
</P>
<P>
This is the first international veterinary seminar in China and
is cosponsored by the Chinese and Dutch ministries of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will be conducive to bridging the gap between China
and countries with a developed animal husbandry industry, said Jia
Youling, director general of the Department of Animal Husbandry
and Health.
</P>
<P>
On the three-day seminar, more than 100 government officials
and veterinary specialists from China and the Netherlands will
have in-depth discussions on veterinary administration, control of
animal diseases, and animal quarantines and inspections.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two countries also is carried out in
the two Sino-Dutch livestock training centers that were recently
established in Beijing and Shanghai. The centers are designed to
focus on technological cooperation, pilot experiments and training.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a cow project in central China's Henan Province is
under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
China has announced the eradication of rinderpest and
contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, two respiratory-related
diseases affecting cows.
</P>
<P>
To date, China's annual production value of veterinary medicine
is 12 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Thai Leader on Hurdles to Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has to overcome six
economic hurdles before it walks out of the shadow of the economic
slump by the middle of this year, the Bangkok Post Monday quoted
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi as saying.
</P>
<P>
He referred to short-term loans, export target, privatization
of state enterprises, soaring cost of living, unemployment and
lack of political stability.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, leader of the government's economic "Dream Team",
predicted that the economy would begin to recover by the middle of
the year when the Assets Management Corporation starts auctioning
the "bad" assets of the 56 closed finance companies.
</P>
<P>
But before that, the country would see the lowest point of its
economy, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
In view of calls for repayments of short-term loans, Supachai
said the government and the private sector will have to negotiate
for repayment delay.
</P>
<P>
As for exports, he said, obstacles should be removed so that
the monthly export volume could reach the 5 billion U.S. dollar
target from the present 4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
The government still needs to concretize the policy of
privatization. So far, some 15 state enterprises have been ordered
to finalize their privatization plans by mid-year so that their
marketability could be assessed.
</P>
<P>
The cost of living will continue to rise before the economy
bottoms out, Supachai said. He forecast rises of prices in the
following two months, but vowed that the government will put
control on it.
</P>
<P>
The employment situation will worsen as many factories are
expected to close down soon. The government will solve the problem
by absorbing laid-off workers from factories to the agriculture
sector and pushing alien workers out to make way for local
job-seekers, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
Political stability is of grave concern, which will affect the
confidence of foreign investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think we should put aside partisan politics for a while to
allow the economy to recover," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chuan Leekpai government has been in office for three
months, during which the government endeavored to solve the
country's serious economic problems by closing 56 of the 58
troubled financial institutions to boost investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
Now the administration is looking into problems of the central
bank. "We have to do everything to win back confidence" in the
Thai financial system and the Thai economy as a whole, Supachai
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Plantation Industry Expected to Be Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's plantation
companies and major trade unions have expressed confidence that
the plantation industry will resume normal operation Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Initial reports indicated that Sunday we had about 60 percent
worker turnout and by Monday the estates would be in full
operation," a spokesman for the plantation management companies
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
After a low turnout last Saturday, workers began reporting for
duty in large numbers Sunday, he added.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions Friday reached a compromise agreement with the
plantation management companies over a wage hike dispute, which
led to a nine-day nationwide strike by some 600,000 estate
workers.
</P>
<P>
The companies agreed to pay workers in the tea plantation
industry a daily wage of 95 rupees (1.53 U.S. dollars) and a price
share supplement of six rupees, bringing the total daily wage to
101 rupees (1.63 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The strikers had asked to raise their daily wage from 83 rupees
(1.34 dollars) to 105 rupees (1.69 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some strikers, led by a few minor trade unions, staged fresh
protest Saturday because they thought the major union leaders
betrayed them by clinching the compromise deal.
</P>
<P>
The strike was estimated to have cost the country about 64.5
million dollars, according to a local expert.

<HEADLINE> From Laying Brick to Laying Olympic Gold  by Xinhua sportswriter Zhou Ji e, Liang Xiyi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 16 (Xinhua) -- At last, ex-bricklayer
Hermann Maier of Austria added an Olympic title to his gold pocket
when he won the men's Super-G race in Nagano on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian skiier, like a daredevil, threw himself down in the
Hakuba course and clocked a winning time of one minute and 34.82
seconds, beating his nearest rivals Didier Cuche of Swizterland and
Hans Knuss of Austria by almost a second.
</P>
<P>
Just days ago, in the men's downhill race, Maier raced out of the
course and broke two safty nets before somersaulted in the air twice
and landed on his back in the deep snow. He got minor injuries that
time.
</P>
<P>
"It is okay for me, I can continue my skiing," he said afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't perfect race for me and I wasn't in perfect form. I
don't know how I can come back after such a terrible crash," he said.
</P>
<P>
No one could imagine Maier, when at 15, was dismissed from a ski
secondary school because he was too small and had weak knees. Only
his parents, both ski instructors, encouraged their son to success.
</P>
<P>
"Since the age of five, Hermann dreamed of becoming a World Cup ski
racer," said his father Hermann senior.
</P>
<P>
"What always facinated me is how he always had a very strong desire
to win. Something inside him dies when he loses and gives him the
power to try harder next time," the father added.
</P>
<P>
However, the way leading to the Olympic podium as well as World Cup
victory has not been so easy for the flamboyant skiier. And it was
almost unblievable that the 25-year-old Maier had been ignored by the
Austrian team for many years.
</P>
<P>
Maier recalled that every time he tried to get noticed at regional
and national championships, the Austrian team coaches would always
look the other way.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep his life going on, he became a ski instructor in
the wintertime. In summer, he learned the hard job of a bricklayer,
working 12-14 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult time but it was very positive at the end," he
explained. "I got very strong carrying all the time the construction
materials. I never gave up the hopes to come back once. In fact I
always trained a little by myself.
</P>
<P>
"With the years I also got stronger in my mind. I know what really
counts for me now and I don't feel making sacrifices in training
hard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Things changed in 1996 when he encouraged himself to resign from
the construction company after posting a top time as a World Cup
forerunner in his native Flachau, about one hour drive south from
Salzburg.
</P>
<P>
Even in World Cup races, he could not get the same treatment as his
teammate had. He still remembered his first World Cup race in the
1996 Lillehammer finals in which he competed not in the official
Austrian team kit, but in a speed suit he bought second-hand from an
American snowboarder.
</P>
<P>
"The fact I never had any help or coaching to get where I am today
is what makes me so strong," said Maier, who learned racing techniques
by studying competitors on TV.
</P>
<P>
Hard training and dedication to skiing soon propelled him on top:
in November 1996, he conquered his first top-ten place at Park City,
but a bad cold prevented him from keeping on in December. During the
1997-98 season, he startled the world and amused his fans by winning
10 races in four disciplines.
</P>
<P>
Being called the "Monster" by some of his rivals and the press,
Maier prefers the nickname "Herminator" which expresses very well his
aggressive attitude on course.
</P>
<P>
"Just look at his face at the start, he seems ready to eat the
first gate," said French team head coach Michel Vion. "He is charged
with incredible energy and determination. He is a killer who only
likes to ski fast."
</P>
<P>
Even Italy's Alberto Tomba was impressed by Maier. "He is cool and
only follows his instinct. He reminds me of myself when I was young.
He's an individual who goes his own ways and he is great in skiing, "
Tomba said.

<P>
WELLINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand decided Monday
to participate in the multinational coalition formed to force Iraq
to abandon its mass destruction weapon programs in compliance with
relevant UN resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The government announced the decision following Cabinet
consideration of a United States request for NZ to support the
coalition, said a press statement from the Prime Minister Office.
</P>
<P>
NZ will contribute about 20 Special Air Services (SAS)
personnel to conduct search and rescue. They will work with the
Australian SAS unit, whose contribution has already been announced
by Australia.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said in the statement that NZ has
also agreed to commit two aircraft to carry out surveillance and
search and rescue functions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a C130 Hercules plane will be employed to carry
personnel and equipment, but will return to NZ after its mission,
Shipley announced.
</P>
<P>
However, the press statement stressed, "New Zealand strongly
supports the efforts underway through the United Nations to find a
diplomatic solution to the impasse with Iraq."
</P>

force being used. New Zealand hopes that by supporting the
coalition a diplomatic solution may be more likely," it added.

<HEADLINE> NZ to Hold By-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A by-election will be held
on May 2 in the Taranaki-King Country electorate in New Zealand,
Prime Minister Jenny Shipley announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The election will be held after the MP for the electorate
former prime minister Jim Bolger resigns from parliament on April
6 to take his new post as the NZ ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said the appointment of Bolger, currently minister of
state, as ambassador to the U.S. means New Zealand's interests
will continue to benefit from his significant skills and
experience.
</P>
<P>
She described Bolger as the best person to represent NZ in the
U.S. as NZ seeks to make progress on trade issues.
</P>
<P>
She said the National Party will select a candidate shortly for
Taranaki-King Country and expressed confidence that it win the
by-election in May.
</P>
<P>
As Bolger's nomination had been rumored for a long-time, some
parties like ACT and Alliance are already on the way to selecting
their candidates for the electorate.
</P>
<P>
Observes here note that the by-election is too important for
the coalition government to lose as it now holds only 61 seats in
the 120-member parliament. The election will put the popularity of
the government to test after Shipley became prime minister at the
end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Steps Up Protection of Laborers' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Labor departments in south
China's Guangdong Province are enforcing their supervision of
factories and enterprises to see the Labor Law and protect
laborers' rights and interests are safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 these departments have conducted examinations of more
than 50,000 units, mainly foreign-invested, privately owned and
township enterprises and resolved 150,000 cases involving
laborers.
</P>
<P>
The cases involved such issues as unpaid salaries, excessive
overtime and work security. With the help of the local supervision
departments, employees in Guangdong have received unpaid salaries
totalling about 10 million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars) since
the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
The labor departments also handled some 100,000 telephone calls
reporting illegal practices, with a resolution rate of 92
percent.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Boost Rice Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Agriculture and
Cooperatives Ministry has worked out a five-year plan with a
budget of 648 million baht (13 million U.S. dollars) for fragrant
rice planting to boost the country's rice export, according to a
local press report Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of the ministry's master plan designed to
raise productivity based on original rice seed. A high-yield seed
will be developed for second crop farming instead of a monocrop.
</P>
<P>
Newin Chidchob, deputy minister of agriculture and
cooperatives, was quoted as saying that the project will support
the country's plan to upgrade the image of Thai fragrant rice.
</P>
<P>
Newin said the project, from January 1998 to 2002, involves
quality controls for rice seed, chemicals and fertilizers, quality
inspection and marketing.
</P>
<P>
The control process will apply to rice planting through
packaging and export, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Thai fragrant rice is popular in overseas markets.
Thailand exported 5.3 million tons of rice last year.

<HEADLINE> Miners Go on Strike for Pay Rise in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Finance Minister
Muravei Radev has arrived at Gorubso, South Bulgaria, for
negotiations with miners who have been on strike for a fifth day
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 340 miners are staging a sit-in and hunger strike inside
the mines, demanding a 200 percent increase in their monthly
wages. On Monday, they will be joined by their wives and children.
</P>
<P>
"We must look at the condition of the enterprise as a whole,
the miners' specific demands and the possibilities to meet them,"
Radev said in a National Radio interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that a satisfactory solution requires a careful
analysis.
</P>
<P>
"The will is there, but meeting these or other such demands is
a question of practicability. People should finally realize that
money does not grow on trees," the minister said, expressing
hopes to be able to discuss various options for a solution with
the strikers.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, the Federation of Independent Trade
Unions of Miners, which is affiliated to the Confederation of
Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria, has issued a declaration,
urging the government to take measures to solve the problems in
Gorubso, including the provision of temporary financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
Underestimate of the problems may lead to an explosion of
social problems in the industry, said the declaration. A copy of
the declaration has been sent to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some trade union leaders have suggested an urgent
meeting with Deputy Prime Minister and Industry Minister Alexandar
Bozhkov in connection with the escalating tensions in the ore
mining industry.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter, the trade unionists demanded disclosure of
information on the mines' performances including debts and wages
payment and pressed for specific proposals for a way out of the
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Indian Voters Disillusioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Electorate of New Delhi,
capital of India, went to polls Monday to elect the 12th Lower
House of Parliament, yet some of them were not enthusiastic about
the voting, saying that they were too disillusioned to believe in
candidates' promises.
</P>
<P>
Maya Ram, 30, a gardener, has been working in the capital for
more than 16 years. He said that he has voted several times but
each time he was disappointed. Candidates of various parties made
all kinds of promises such as providing electricity, drinking
water, sanitation, schools, jobs, etc. during their election
campaigns, yet when the election was over, "We could not see them,
not to say their promises."
</P>
<P>
He said, "I'm still considering whether I shall go to vote or
not this time."
</P>
<P>
"Their promises are worthless and no one believes them here,"
said Kalkaji from the city's Nizamudin area.
</P>
<P>
An auto-rickshaw driver Govind Bhatt said, "Why should we vote
for them? What will the government give us? Each campaigner says
"give me a chance to prove myself" and people are getting chances
at our expense."
</P>
<P>
He is bitter about the rising prices of petrol, saying, "The
minute the new government comes, they will tax us again."
</P>
<P>
An elderly gentleman said that he had never heard the names of
the candidates. "They don't come to our places where there are no
proper roads. I don't think the candidates know our problems."
</P>
<P>
K. S. Sandhu said that the politicians were simply trading
charges to gain political mileage.
</P>
<P>
His friend V. Kalra added, "What politicians do is simply to
make a fool of the people. They play upon the emotions of the
illiterate masses and brainwash them into voting for them." he
said that he would not exercise his right to vote this time.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper The Statesman in a recent report expressed the
similar feelings of some voters in the capital city. It said, "
Apprehensions are being expressed about a low turnout on February
16 as the capital's electorate has been left unmoved by the
promises and assurances being churned out by candidates for the
seven seats."
</P>
<P>
"Most candidates, especially the ones who had won in 1996
(general elections), have been found wanting when it comes to
convincing the voters about why they should be given another
chance. And why they (the voters) should even come out to cast
their vote?" it added.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, the Citizen's Council in the
capital has made a call to boycott the coming elections "since all
efforts of all the official channels to provide safety to
residents of Vasant Kunj area in the city have come to naught".
</P>
<P>
Last year seven women in the area were attacked and their cash
and jewelry were taken away by robbers.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Arrives for Talks with Mahathir on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong arrived here Monday for a two-day working visit to
Malaysia to find a new base to forge closer cooperation between
the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Goh was received at the Kuala Lumpur international airport by
his host Mahathir Mohamad and the two leaders drove directly to
the latter's office for talks, the third time between the two in a
month.
</P>
<P>
Goh said earlier in Singapore that he is meeting his Malaysian
counterpart "not to think there are problems to be solved, but how
we can work together".
</P>
<P>
Finding a new base to forge closer cooperation between
Singapore and Malaysia is what he would do during his talks with
Mahathir, Goh said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mahathir earlier said he would discuss with Goh
during this meeting "better relations" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We just want to discuss how to get over all these problems we
have and to have better relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Still, the regional economic crisis will be on the top of the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry statement issued here on February 13 on
Goh's visit said besides bilateral matters, the focus of the
discussions between Mahathir and Goh would be on the financial and
economic situation in the region and efforts to enhance
intra-ASEAN trade and promote the use of regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders already met twice this year, on January 20 in
Johor, southern Malaysia, and on February 7 in Singapore
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Erosion-Control Project Benefits Poor Farmers in Loess Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1.2 million poor
people living in rural areas of the Loess Plateau in northwest
China have bid farewell to poverty through an erosion-control
project financed by World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The project, the largest of its kind supported by WB in China,
is designed to alleviate poverty and improve the ecology by
treating 250,000 hectares of eroded land and 22 million tons of
silt, said today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The project, initiated in 1994, costs 2.1 billion yuan (about
253 million U.S. dollars), of which, WB would pay up 150 million
U.S. dollars in soft loans. The loans will be repaid in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The project covers 15,000 sq km of land in the Loess Plateau's
seven worst eroded prefectures and 21 counties in Shaanxi, Shanxi,
Gansu provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
For decades, 1.3 million local residents in these areas have
been living in poverty due to serious water and soil erosion, which
plagues over 80 percent of the areas' total land surface.
</P>
<P>
However, the annual per capita net income of these locals
amounted to 800 yuan last year, double the average 307 yuan in
1994, the newspaper quoted information from the Ministry of Water
Resources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, the WB-backed project has not only
provided local farmers with encough food and clothes through the
creation of high-yield farmland, forestry and orchards, but also
vitalized the local economy with the development of animal
husbandry, processing and transportation industries.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting 38,000 hectares of orchards and economic
forests grown in the project area, a WB delegation said the goals
of shaking off poverty and reducing the silt in the Yellow River
have initially be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers' annual per capita crop-yield increased from 250
kg to 475 kg in Shanxi Province and Inner Mongolia in the last
three years. Newly-built terraces have allowed farmers to be more
than self-sufficient in grain rations, the first step towards
poverty relief.
</P>
<P>
About 23,000 hectares of orchards, mostly apples, are being
constructed with a survival rate averaging over 75 percent, said
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Various anti-erosion projects, including many dams built in
gullies and ravines, are playing an increasingly important role in
reducing the silt washed into local rivers by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The local environment has been improved as forest cover went up
by an average of 12.5 percent. The utilization rate of land
increased by 10 percent and more local water resources were
conserved.

<HEADLINE> Facts &AMP; Figures (5): India's Key Political Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Facts &AMP; Figures: Key
political forces in India:

The United Front:
</P>
<P>
The United Front (UF), formed by 14 regional parties during the
1996 elections, came to power in June 1996. Its minority
government led by H.D. Deve Gowda was only backed by the Indian
National Congress after no political party could obtain a majority
in parliament during the April-May 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the UF coalition fell in April 1997 after 10 months in
office when the Congress withdrew its support. The Congress
propped up a new government when Inder Kumar Gujral was elected to
replace Gowda. Gujral's coalition collapsed in November 1997 after
seven months when the Congress again withdrew its support,
leading to the current elections.
</P>
<P>
The UF in its recent manifesto gave assurances to liberalize
the economy, but made no mention of its plans on furthering
economic reforms and was against large-scale opening up of the
economy.

The Indian National Congress:
</P>
<P>
The Congress, founded in 1885 to oppose British rule, has ruled
India for around 45 of the 50 years since independence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Jawaharlal Nehru ruled India as its first prime minister at the
head of a Congress government from 1947 to 1964.
</P>
<P>
Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, headed the country's Congress
government twice from 1966 to 1977 and from 1980 to 1984 when she
was killed by her body guard.
</P>
<P>
Rajiv Gandhi replaced his mother as Congress leader and prime
minister in 1984 and he was assassinated in 1989 by a suicide
bomb.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1996, a minority Congress government took office
and won over enough members of parliament to attain a majority
after two years.
</P>
<P>
The party got only 141 seats in the 545-member lower house of
parliament in the 1996 elections. In order to prevent the Indian
People's Party (BJP) from coming to power, the Congress, which
could not come to power itself, decided to offer its support from
outside to the UF which then formed a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The Congress in its recent manifesto claimed that the party
alone could give a development-oriented stable government based on
experience. While talking about liberalization, the party never
mentioned the word "globalization" even once. There was no mention
of the need to privatize the banking sector.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, Indian People's Party):
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party, founded in 1980 as a breakaway
group of the People's Party, is the largest parliamentary party in
India. The BJP got its first taste of power at the national level
after the inconclusive 1996 elections during which the party won
193 seats with its alliance. Its government, however, fell within
a fortnight after failing to establish a majority in the hung
parliament.
</P>
<P>
In its recent manifesto, the BJP with a membership of 10.5
billion said that it would allow foreign direct investment only
into priority areas like infrastructure, export promotion and
hi-tech industries, but restrict the flow of foreign direct
investment in non-priority areas and areas where the domestic
industry was performing well.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 16 (Xinhua) -- China's goal is to generate one
million kilowatts (kw) of wind power annually by 2000, according
to a senior official with the Ministry of Electric Power.
</P>
<P>
China has already developed 10 million small wind-power
generators, with a total capacity of 20,000 kw, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The country has the capacity to produce 30,000 wind generators
annually, and build 15 large wind-power generation fields with a
combined installed capacity of more than 30,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
The official said China will continue to carry out its policy
of developing small generators for individual households living in
border areas and remote regions who are not connected to power
grids.
</P>
<P>
The country is phasing out its plan to develop wind power in
provinces which are rich in wind resources and lacking in power
supplies. The official said that China has abundant wind
resources; about two-thirds of the country is windy, with total
wind-energy resources estimated at 253 million kw.

SHENYANG, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The residents in Shenyang,
the capital of China's Liaoning Province, are being given a chance
to become the "parents" of some animals in the city zoo.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Zoo, the wildlife protection center, and a local
evening paper came up with a program asking the public to
contribute to nature and animal protection.
</P>
<P>
And people answered the call. One local company adopted a swan,
and a nine-year-old girl donated all of her savings to put toward
the care of the zoo's 370 animals.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the zoo say they plan to put up a board containing
the names of these "adoptive parents" to honor their civic
mindedness.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has had a series of activities itself
with the theme "Contributing Love to Nature and Animals" and has
gotten some positive results. Shanghai, the country's commercial
center, reports that 46 units and organizations have adopted
animals and have contributed towards the cost of raising them.

<HEADLINE> Early Form Of Advertisement Found Among Ancient Chinese Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The advertisement as we know
originated in China about a thousand years ago, according to
Chinese historians.
</P>
<P>
Ancient peddlers used songs and rhymed verses as something that
might be called the earliest ad, says Li Zhengyu, a research
fellow who has studied Dunhuang cave documents.
</P>
<P>
One Chinese document from the Tang Dynasty (A. D. 618-907),
which is now in a library in France, is still one of the best
records of ancient ads, Li says.
</P>
<P>
Shop owners at that time caught the attention of passers-by
with the words "New arrival, good chance, attractive price, all
visitors welcome," according to Li, and some boasted of the
quality of their produce on banners. But the early Chinese often
looked down on merchants or peddlers so there are few historical
records left.
</P>
<P>
However, people in the Song Dynasty (A. D. 960-1279) recorded
similar things in their writings.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show a prosperous business community near
the area of Dunhuang, which is now in northwest China's Gansu
Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Streetlights that are powered by
solar energy have become a new feature in Lhasa, capital of Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning, people on their way to pray will stop and
look with great interest at the lights by Dragon King Pool behind
the Potala Palace. A special piece of silicon half a meter square
at the top of a lightpole stores enough energy during the daytime
to provide electricity for 68 lights on the roads near the pool
all through the night.
</P>
<P>
The 820,000 yuan (98,700 US dollars) cost of the solar-energy
streetlights came from the Beijing municipal government. It is
estimated that the whole project will cost 15 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has an average of 3,100 to 3,400 hours of sunlight
annually in most areas because of its high elevation and thin air.
</P>
<P>
In order to make full use of the solar energy, the local
government has spent more than 17 million yuan on solar-energy
facilities to heat water, green houses, and solar-energy stoves.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy produces profits of about 80 million yuan each
year in Tibet.

BRUSSELS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- An estimated total of 25,000
Belgians Sunday took to the street to protest against the
government's silence regarding the investigations into unresolved
child abuses and murders.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators waved banners and gave applauses to the
speeches delivered by parents of the victims of a paedophile ring
before the Palais de Justice Sunday in Brussels.

The parents, who organized the demonstration with relatives of
missing children, called for a plea of truth and protested against
the "law of silence."
</P>
<P>
The two eight-year-old kids were found abused and then left
starving to death in a hidden cellar in Dutroux' house. They and
other missing children are believed to have fallen prey to an
organized ring of paedophiles in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
A total of 250,000 Belgian people participated in the so-called
"white march" last year to protest against police and government
inefficiency in resolving the case.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Iraq Strike Trade Protocol for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Trade ministers from Jordan and
Iraq here Sunday signed a 255-million-U.S.-dollar trade protocol
for 1998 within the framework of the Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The new protocol, which came after two days of talks between
Jordan's Trade and Industry Minister Hani Mulqi and his Iraqi
counterpart Mohammed Mahdi Saleh here, maintains the highest level
of Jordanian exports to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The protocol included 185 million dollars worth of Jordanian
products and 70 million dollars worth of services, and Jordan's
medium and small industries would benefit for the first time from
such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mulqi added that 5 million dollars from the new protocol,
together with 2 million from the 1997 Jordanian-Iraqi trade
protocol, would be allocated to repay Iraqi debts to Jordanian
companies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mulqi expressed thanks to Iraqi government for its
priority given to Jordanian companies under the oil-for-food deal,
which allows Iraq to sell two billion dollars worth of oil every
six months to buy humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of the deal, Iraq supplies Jordan with
4.8 million tonnes of oil and oil products in 1998 at below-rate
prices. In return, Jordan exports goods such as food and medicine
to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq remains a main market for Jordanian industries, many of
which mushroomed during Baghdad's 1980-1988 war with Tehran to
cater solely for the Iraqi market.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iran End Diplomatic Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Iran will send new
ambassadors to each other's capital, thus ending a year-long
diplomatic row between the two neighboring countries, according to
a Turkish official statement here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement said that during the official
talks between its Undersecretary Kormaz Haktanir and Iranian
officials in Tehran, the two sides decided to exchange ambassadors
in March.
</P>
<P>
Haktanir returned home Sunday morning from Iran after
submitting a written message of President Suleyman Demirel to
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on the Iraq-U.N. crisis over
arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Turkey and Iran had decided to
activate the mechanism of security cooperation along the border
areas between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Iran cooled down in February last
year, when Ankara accused former Iranian Ambassador Mohammad
Baqeri of insulting Turkey's secular government in a public
speech and ordered him to leave the country. In retaliation, Iran
also asked Turkey to recall its ambassador to Iran Osman Koruturk.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Turkish government assigned Sencer Ozsoy as its new
ambassador to Tehran while Iranian government appointed Mohammad
Hussein, an adviser for Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi,
as its ambassador to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the two countries agreed to hold talks
on the transport issues for the economic cooperation between
Ankara and Tehran and to hold a meeting of the Turkish-Iranian
Joint Economic Commission in Tehran.

According to the final result announced by the Central Election

</P>
<P>
After winning the elections, Clerides called for unity,

"These are times of unity. We should all give our hands because
serious developments in the Cyprus problem lay ahead of us,"
Clerides said in a message.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, there are no winners and losers," Clerides stressed,
calling on his supporters to reach out to all the citizens
regardless of their political affiliation, with love, friendship
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Clerides was backed by the ruling right-wing Democratic Rally
and four candidates defeated in the first round last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Iacovou, former foreign minister, was supported by the
left-wing Progress Party of the Working People and the
center-right Democratic Party. He has conceded defeat.
</P>
<P>
The run-off took place following last Sunday's first round of
elections, during which Clerides and Iacovou, defeating the other
five candidates, became the front-runners for the eighth
presidency of Cyprus since its independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Crown Prince Expects Annan's Iraq Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan
Sunday said that he expected United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan's planned visit to Baghdad would succeed in finding a new
channel to solve the current Iraqi-U.N. standoff over weapons
inspection peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"Let's hope that the visit of Kofi Annan, which represents,
afterall, some kind of agreement among the (U.N.) Security
Council members including the United States, will establish a
more direct channel (for dialogue)," said the crown prince.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while speaking to reporters after meeting
Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen who arrived here
Saturday on a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
"If the question is about the weapons of mass destruction,
then we have to identify the ceiling of what have been achieved
and I think the secretary general is intending to do that," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Annan's visit will come "in a couple of days" and he
expected a breakthrough from the visit aimed at settling the
crisis over Iraq's refusal to open all suspected sites to
U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the crown prince underscored the necessity for the
other sides of the international community, including Jordan
itself, to exert further efforts to help find a diplomatic
solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen a French initiative and a Russian initiative and
we have received the Arab League Secretary General and we are in
contact of course with President Khatami in Iran, who is President
of the Organization of Islamic Conference," he added.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has agreed to open eight presidential sites to
inspection by a special team to be appointed by Annan. The Iraqi
proposal was flatly rejected by the U.S. and Britain, which
demanded Iraq surrender all sites to U.N. arms inspector.
</P>
<P>
A survey team assigned by Annan has arrived at Baghdad on
Sunday to define the eight presidential sites pending further
diplomatic efforts to settle the crisis.
