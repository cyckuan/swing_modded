<HEADLINE> DPRK Refutes U.S. Rumor of "Threat From North Korea" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States regards the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) as an imaginary enemy
with ulterior motives so as to achieve military Hegemonism, a
commentary of the Korean Central News Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of the U.S. State Department,
officially made a provocative statement at a press conference on
June 4 that the DPRK is the imaginary enemy of the U.S. "national
missile defense" initiative, according to the commentary.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. authorities are spreading such rumor of 'missile
threat from north Korea' to achieve two aims. One is to retain
monopoly of missiles and realize its military domination over the
world by establishing the 'national missile defense' system at any
cost under the pretext of the 'missile threat' from the DPRK. The
other is to isolate and suffocate the DPRK politically and
militarily by branding it as a 'missile proliferating state'," it
said.
</P>
<P>
"This brings into bolder relief the long-standing U.S.
dominationist ambition and impudence. It also eloquently shows
that the U.S. call for 'dialogue and cooperation,' 'peace and
disarmament' is nothing but sheer hypocrisy," it added. "The DPRK
and the United States are in the process of dialogue. Action
getting on dialogue partner's nerves should be avoided to advance
dialogue and establish cooperative relations."
</P>
<P>
The commentary warned that "this impudence of the U.S. may
throw a grave obstacle in the way of improving relations with the
DPRK."
</P>
<P>
"Unless the U.S. discards its intention to stifle the DPRK, the
latter will have no option but to take a strong countermeasure,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
"In that case the situation will not be in favor of the United
States and it will be held wholly responsible for all the
consequences arising therefrom," the commentary ended.

KAMPALA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the Economic
Cooperation Organization (ECO) ended a one-day summit here on
Saturday with a call for the early establishment of a collective
trade and development bank and a reinsurance company, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 10 members should complete the pending formalities as soon
as possible for the early establishment of the bank and the
reinsurance company, leaders of the member states said in a
statement known as the "Tehran Declaration".
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran, Italy to Expand Agricultural Cooperation: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran is keen on further expanding
cooperation with Italy in the agricultural sector, said Iranian
Agriculture Minister Issa Kalantari on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with visiting Italian counterpart Alfonso
Pecoraro Scanio, Kalantari said the two sides will work together in
agricultural research and training courses in particular.
</P>
<P>
Iran's agricultural sector accounts for over one quarter of the
country's gross national product (GNP), said the minister.
</P>
<P>
During the past six years, the use of pesticides has reduced
from 55,000 tons to 20,000 tons as priority has been given to
environmental protection, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kalantari called for expansion of cooperation among research and
training centers in the two countries, mainly for education of the
Iranian university students seeking higher education in
horticulture course at the doctorate level.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Italy to provide advanced technical and
research assistance to Iran in fight against pests and diseases in
pistachios, to enhance investment in Iran's food industries and
better utilization and consumption of water.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Tehran's readiness to enter joint venture projects
with Italy.
</P>
<P>
Rome will welcome Iranian experts and researchers for training
in horticulture and watershed management courses, said Scanio,
underlining the need to expand ties in research, training,
horticulture and watershed management.
</P>
<P>
He said that Italy is prepared to receive the Iranian university
students and cooperate in the exchange of data both at the
governmental and private sector levels.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also agreed to form a committee to manage
dispatch of experts as well as exchange of information between the
two countries.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Mourns Death of Assad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Saturday made a phone call to Bashar al-Assad, son of late
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad who died earlier in the day, to
express condolences over the passing away of his father.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Royal Court also announced a mourning period of
40 days in the kingdom as of Saturday over the death of Assad.
</P>
<P>
During the phone call, Abdullah noted that the Arab nation has
lost a historical leader who dedicated his life to his people and
nation, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The king spoke highly of Assad's wisdom, political shrewdness,
bravery showed in his 30-year service as president of Syria, Petra
said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian parliament has amended the constitution to lower the
age threshold for a president from 40 to 34 to pave the way for
Bashar, 35, the second and favorite son of Assad, to become the new
president.
</P>
<P>
Assad died at a time when Jordan and Syria are improving their
ties which have been strained for five years over Jordan's 1994
peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Assad was against any unilateral peace deal with the Jewish
state
and had been at odds with late Jordanian King Hussein Ibn Talal,
King Abdullah's father, over the treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, Assad paid a surprising and fence-mending visit to
Amman, his first in years, in Febuary 1999 to attend the funeral of
Hussein who died of cancer. The ties between the two countries
thawed after the visit.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian FM Describes Indirect Talks With Eritrea as Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhao Yi
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin said Saturday that the proximity talks on the
Ethio-Eritrean conflict were "useful, constructive and
successful".
</P>
<P>
Bilateral talks were held from May 29 to June 10 in Algiers,
Algeria, under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU).
</P>
<P>
The OAU has submitted to Ethiopia and Eritrea a proposal for an
 agreement on the cessation of hostilities between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"This proposal will be submitted, as a matter of priority and
urgency, to the Ethiopian leadership," Seyoum said, adding the
result of the consideration of the proposal by the leadership will
be communicated to the OAU Current Chairman, Algerian President
Abdelziz Bouteflika in the shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
Instead of giving any details of the talks, Seyoum said the
talks took so long time, which was due to intransigence of
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Ethiopian delegation to the talks, Seyoum
expressed deep gratitude to Bouteflika and the OAU General
Secretariat for their indefatigable and untiring efforts and
perseverance despite the many difficult moments during the talks.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed gratitude to the government of the United
States and the European Union for their commitment and assistance
to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The 15-point proposals of the OAU for an agreement on cessation
of hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea included, among
others, a call for commitment by both parties to the immediate
cessation of hostilities starting from the signature of this
latest OAU document.
</P>
<P>
It also notes that Ethiopia shall submit redeployment plans for
its troops from positions taken after February 6, 1999 and which
were not under Ethiopian administration before May 6, 1998, to the
peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
This redeployment shall be completed within two weeks after the
 deployment of the peacekeeping mission and when this is verified
by it.  The proposal said that upon verification of Ethiopian
redeployment by the peacekeeping mission, Eritrean civilian
administration, including police and militia, will be restored to
prepare for the return of the population, and that the Eritrean
forces shall remain at a distance of 25 kilometers (artillery
range) from positions to which Ethiopian forces shall redeploy.
</P>
<P>
This zone of separation, according to the OAU document, shall
be referred to as the "temporary security zone."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a letter of acceptance of the OAU proposal,
Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile-Woldetensai noted that Ethiopia
has refused to redeploy its troops immediately and without
precondition to positions of May 6 and has invaded and continues
to occupy uncontested sovereign Eritrean territory.
</P>
<P>
He said despite its rejection of the Ethiopian position,
Eritrea has agreed to Ethiopian withdrawals after the early
deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping mission under the auspices of
the OAU.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean foreign minister said that Eritrea has also
consented to a " temporary security zone" free from the presence
of regular units of the Eritrean Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
He further pointed out that despite strong reservations,
Eritrea has also accepted a 25 kilometers depth for the "temporary
security zone."

<HEADLINE> Israel to Continue Peace Efforts With Assad's Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli will continue its efforts
to reach a peace agreement with Syria after the death of Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad, a statement issued by Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's Office announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first reaction from Israeli officials to the death of
the Syrian leader, who was 69 and reportedly died Saturday morning.
The breaking news was announced by Syrian parliament's special
session a short while ago.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Israel understands the grief of the Syrian
people following the death of President al-Assad," the Israel's
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel worked in the past for a peace deal with Syria and will
continue to work for this in the future with all future
leadership," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two countries resumed last December after
a 45-month stalemate, but only to hit a snag again in January after
two rounds of talks in the United States failed to resolve their
disputes over the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau seized by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear what effect the death of al-Assad will
have on the prospect of the peace talks, however, local analysts
said that the death might cast clouds over the Israeli-Syrian peace
track.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Assad's favorite son Bashar al-Assad, 35,
will succeed his father.
</P>
<P>
Israel appealed to the future Syrian leader to keep the borders
between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon quiet,
which is most important for Israelis and Syrians, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its withdrawal from south Lebanon, which it had
occupied for two decades, in May. Syria is the major foreign power
broker in Beirut.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Earlier Ratification of Agro Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday called on the
United Nations and international community to exert more pressure
on Washington and London for earlier ratification of the contracts
for buying basic agriculture equipment.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture told a press
conference here that the U.N. Sanctions Committee put on hold 35
contracts that Iraq signed on the purchase of such equipments under
the sixth phase of the U.N. oil-for-food program, and 18 others
under the seventh phase which expired earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The official blamed the U.S. and British representatives in the
committee for delaying the ratification of those contracts, which
were signed under the relevant Memo of Understanding on Agro and
Veterinary Needs.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of the Agriculture Ministry Basil Kamil Dalal
also accused Bank of France, in which Iraq's proceeds from oil
exports under the oil-for-food program were deposited, of delaying
the credits of the contracts.
</P>
<P>
The rainless hot season in Iraq heavily hit the country's grain
production, depriving the country of 70 percent of its barley and
wheat yield. Iraq will have to import its need of live stock this
year due to a possible massive live stock loss.
</P>
<P>
The severe shortage of animal disease vaccines in Iraqi markets,
caused by the decade-long U.N. sanctions on the country, has caused
the spread of foot-and-mouth disease among Iraqi live stock in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling U.N. sanctions since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. To alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi
people, whose lives have been affected most severely by the
sanctions, the U.N. launched the oil-for-food humanitarian program
in 1996. The program was later expanded to allow Iraq virtually
free oil sales to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its people.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians May Reach Partial Agreement by September: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinians may
reach only a partial peace agreement by September, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It is not impossible that a permanent agreement with the
Palestinians won't be finished now and September, despite Israel's
willingness," Barak told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Should the two sides fail to reach a "complete agreement" by the
September 13 deadline, said Barak, "there will be an almost
complete agreement in which some issues will be in place but others
will be delayed to a later date."
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remarks as Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
prepared to continue their peace talks in the Washington area early
next week in an effort to reach a framework agreement on the final
peace by the self-imposed September deadline.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have always rejected any partial accord on
the key issues dividing the two sides, which include the fate of
Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees, borders and
water.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who has promised to hold a national referendum on any
final peace treaty, said he would present the peace accords which
have been concluded with the Palestinians to the people even if
they are
rejected by the Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Asked about the Knesset's preliminary approval Wednesday of
a bill which called for dissolving the Knesset and holding early
elections, Barak said he was "convinced there won't be early
elections."
</P>
<P>
During the Knesset vote, Knesset members of the Shas party,
National Religious Party and Yisrael Ba'aliya, three coalition
partners, voted with the opposition for the bill.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said he would work in the coming days to put
together a new coalition.

<HEADLINE> U.N.Member States Finish Negotiations on Outcome Document </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua -- The delegates from more than
180 U.N. Member States finished their hard negotiations early
Saturday morning on the Outcome Document which is expected to be
adopted at the end of the U.N. General Assembly special session.
</P>
<P>
The Outcome Document, which assesses what has been achieved
and what still remains to be done in the past five years in the
implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action adopted in the
Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Out Document also sets strategies and means to accelerate
the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action in the next
few years to achieve the gender equality.
</P>
<P>
The most disputed issue was women's sexual rights, which pitted
Islamic nations, especially Algeria, Libya, Iran, Pakistan and
Sudan, along with of the Vatican, against Western and African
nations and nearly all of South America nations.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also argued over any reference to "households",
as that could imply nontraditional families, such as homosexual
unions or unmarried partners.
</P>
<P>
During the night negotiations, several issues were resolved,
including a dispute between the United States and Cuba over the
effect of U.S. sanctions on Cuba's women.
</P>
<P>
Delegates also agreed on strong planks calling for prosecution
of all forms of domestic violence against women, now including
marital rape.
</P>
<P>
The traditional practices of forced marriage and honor killing
were addressed for the first time in an international consensus
document, with strong calling for laws to eradicate these human
rights violations.
</P>
<P>
Due to the hard negotiations on the Outcome Document, the
special session, which began on June 5, did not conclude on June 9
as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The special session is expected to conclude this afternoon
with the adoption of two documents, the Outcome Document and the

<HEADLINE> Canada to Phase Out Dursban Pesticide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada is moving to phase out a
common pesticide known as Dursban over one to four years.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Health Minister Allan Rock told Parliament Friday that
Canadian manufacturers of the chemical chlorpyrifos, known by the
trade name Durban, had reneged on a deal to withdraw it from the
market.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to impose unilaterally, using our authority as a
government, that the product come off the market," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Health Department is reviewing chlorpyrifos suspected
to be linked to cases of muscle weakness, blurred vision,
headaches and memory loss. A final report is expected by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Canada's decision to ban the pesticide followed a move by the
United States Thursday to get rid of Dursban from store shelves.
</P>
<P>
Introduced in 1969, the pesticide has been commonly used in
many homes in everything from pet flea collars to garden and lawn
chemicals and indoor bug sprays.

<HEADLINE> Policy of Prevention Needed to Fight Terrorism, Says Greek Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos Saturday stressed the need for a policy of
prevention in combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
To confront terrorism, there must be a complete and continuous
policy of prevention which must be accompanied by a series of high
cost measures, Tsohatzopoulos said on the sidelines of the
European conference on peace, democracy and cooperation in the
Balkans, which began in Athens Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He added that they would not prove to be effective without the
existence of a policy of prevention.
</P>
<P>
The minister stated that there existed a framework of
international cooperation, as determined by relevant treaties, to
fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Britain's defense attache in Athens, Stephen
Saunders, was shot dead by two members of the November 17, a
terrorist group in Greece, and the Greek police investigation
aimed at tracking down and arrest the attackers continued Saturday
with the participation of Scotland Yard officers as well as the
FBI team in Athens and other U.S. specialists who arrived here
after the killing of Saunders.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Athens prosecutor with a urgent
request to the U.S. court authorities asked that former CIA chief
James Wesley testify in Greece regarding his interview with a
Greek newspaper that the November 17 terrorists were acquainted
with Greek government ministers.
</P>
<P>
Greece has insisted that there are no lists with names of
terrorist suspects.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Mourns Death of Syrian President Assad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Saturday mourned the death of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad,
saying he was saddened by Assad's passing away and hoped to
continue to work with Syria for a comprehensive Middle East peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
"I am saddened by the news of President Assad's death and want
to offer my condolences to his family and to the Syrian people,"
Clinton said in a written statement issued by the White House
while he was visiting Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to working with Syria to achieve the goal of a
comprehensive peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who was in Minnesota to deliver a speech to graduates
at Carleton College there and to attend political fundraisers,
said despite his differences with the late Syrian president, he
still respected him.
</P>
<P>
"We had differences, but I always respected him ... Throughout
my contacts with him, including our last meeting, he made clear
Syria's continued commitment to the path of peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton last met Assad in Geneva in March in an attempt to
break the deadlock in Syrian-Israeli negotiations, but failed to
achieve a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton would make a
special address from Minnesota, and said no decision had been made
yet whether Clinton would attend Assad's funeral.
</P>
<P>
White House National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley
said the Clinton administration expected Syria to continue its
participation in seeking peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"President Assad made a strategic choice for peace. We strongly
believe it was the right choice, and it is our expectation that
Syria will continue on the path for peace," Crowley said.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Accepts OAU Proposal on Ceasefire With Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea has accepted a proposal of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for immediate ceasefire
with its Horn of Africa neighbor Ethiopia, according to a news
release available here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, which gained independence in 1993, formally
demonstrated its acceptance late Friday through a letter from its
Foreign Minister Haile Weldensae to Special Envoy of the OAU Ahmed
 Ouyahia.
</P>
<P>
The OAU proposal, which has the backing of the United States
and the European Union, was presented to the two nations during
their proximity talks held in Algiers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Ethiopia accused Eritrea of launching new attacks on
the former in central front of the border on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea claimed that Ethiopia was torpedoing the ongoing
Algiers proximity talks by setting a precondition for
redeployment and the " security guarantees" by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea called on the international community to take "strong
action" against Ethiopia if Ethiopia "rejects the OAU proposal or
pretends to accept while continuing its war against Eritrea",
according to the news release.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia declared on May 31 that the war was over, which was
announced while it claimed to have recovered all occupied
territories from Eritrea and attained all its military positions.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting in a two-year-old border war
between the two Horn of Africa neighbors erupted on May 12.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Optimistic About Solution to Issues on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela said on Saturday that he was confident
that some of the outstanding issues still plaguing war-torn
Burundi would be resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at his residence here that one of the issues
to be resolved would be the release of political prisoners. Some
of them have been held for years without trial.
</P>
<P>
This problem was not solved during last week's meeting between
Mandela and Burundi President Pierre Buyoya in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, a former political prisoner himself, voiced his
disapproval about the ongoing incarceration of "innocent people"
in Burundi during his meeting with Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said on Saturday that breakthroughs had been made in
three key areas in Burundi:
</P>
<P>
-- All 19 political parties had contributed to a draft proposal
to address all the points of contention in the Burundi dispute;
</P>
<P>
-- It was agreed that people interned in controversial
regroupment camps would be released by July 31; and that
Burundi's troops would be integrated on a 50/50 basis to include
Hutu and Tutsi factions.
</P>
<P>
It's possible the split may have to be amended to include a
pigmy group, the Twa, who makes up about 1 percent of the
population, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Rebels had originally demanded that they make up 75 percent of
the military.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is expected to leave for Burundi on Monday for a
three-day visit as international mediator in efforts to end its
ongoing civil war.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he would discuss the issue of the prisoners with
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who is accompanying Mandela to
Burundi in his capacity as chairperson of the leadership in the
Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
At least 200,000 people -- both Hutus and Tutsis -- have been
killed since October 1993 when civil war broke out following the
assassination of the country's first democratically elected
president.
</P>
<P>
Peace efforts started in 1995 but stalled because of continued
violence. Mandela restarted the stalled peace process after he
became chief mediator late last year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe not Satisfied With U.N. Decision on Observer Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Saturday criticized a decision by the United Nations on not
sending an observer team to the parliamentary elections in the
country set for June 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
Addressing more than 20,000 people who gathered at the Rudhaka
stadium in Marondera about 72 kilometers east of the capital,
Harare, he said: " We never asked the U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan to send a technical team. We asked for an observer
team."
</P>
<P>
"We do not see any role of coordinating that the U.N. can
play." "We want them to send an observer team," he said, adding:
"Each country which has sent an observer team will provide its own
report in its own way. The U.N.'s role is an illegitimate one,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe stressed the U.N. must observe the elections in its own
way.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has announced to an international press that it will
no longer observe the election process in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"If we are not coordinating there is no reason for us to stay
there (Zimbabwe)," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard was quoted by a
report reaching here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Mugabe said, the legitimacy of the election process
would depend on the Zimbabwean judgement. Zimbabwe complied with
its own election procedures in 1980, 1985, 1990 and 1995 and came
up with its own judgement.
</P>
<P>
"We want our elections to be free and fair," he said. "They
are going to be free and fair in our own judgement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other observer teams already in the country are from the
European Union, Southern African Development Community,
Commonwealth and South Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has set up a National
Earthquake Council (NEC) as the country's most authoritative body
to cope with the ever-increasing threat of the natural disaster,
reported Turkey's Anatolia News Agency on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The council is mandated to address quake-related matters in
guiding seismological research, preventing allegations and rumors
from causing panic among people, and providing consultation
services to public establishments and bodies regarding quakes and
seismological activities.
</P>
<P>
The council consists of 20 experts from relevant departments of
the Middle East Technical University, Istanbul Technical
University, Yildiz Technical University, Bogazici University and
Istanbul University.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is an earthquake-prone country with certain areas
situated along established fault belts. The country suffered two
devastating earthquakes last year, one measuring 7.4 degrees on the
open-ended Richter scale in the Marmara region on August 17 and
another 7.2-magnitude tremor in the western Bolu province on
November 12.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20,000 people were killed in the two quakes and the total
property losses were estimated at 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the recent development, a 5.9-magnitude tremor hit the
Cankiri province, some 100 kilometers north of the capital of
Ankara, on Tuesday, killing three people and injuring over 80
others.
</P>
<P>
Early Friday morning, two strong aftershocks rattled the Cankiri
province. One was measured at 5.0 and another 5.2 degrees on the
Richter scale. No loss of lives was reported in the two tremors.
</P>
<P>
But a 35-year-old man was killed in still more aftershocks in
the province on Saturday morning. The panicky villager died of
heart attack as he tried to flee his house in Asagikayilar village
in Orlu township.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The following is a chronology of
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, who died of heart attack Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hafez al-Assad, president of Syria, was born in a farmer's
family at Latakia province on October 6, 1930. He was educated in
Syrian military colleges.
</P>
<P>
Assad joined the Baath party in 1946, and then formed the
Baathist Military Committee when he was in Egypt. He was promoted
to be General of the Air Force in 1964. He served as Minister of
Defense and Commander of the Air Force from 1966 to 1970. Then he
served as Syrian Prime Minister from 1970 to 1971, and Secretary of
the Baath party in November 1970.
</P>
<P>
Assad was the secretary of the regional leadership of the Baath
party in May 1971 and General Secretary of the party's national
leadership. Assad was also a member of the Presidential Council of
the Federation of the Arab Republics, which consists of Syria,
Egypt and Libya in 1971. He has been the president of the Syrian
National Progressive Front since 1972, and Commander-in-Chief of
the Armed Forces since 1973.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> URGENT Syrian Parliament Announces Assad's Death, Ready to Amend Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
died Saturday morning, Syrian parliament announced in its
extraordinary session Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers stood in silence in tribute to the late president,
who had been in power since 1971, according to Syrian state
television which broadcast live.
</P>
<P>
The parliament has decided to set up a special committee to
amend the constitution and lower the age threshold for the
presidency. The current constitution requires any Syrian who wants
to run for the president should be above 40.
</P>
<P>
This is believed to pave the way for Assad's favorite son,
Bashar, 35, to assume power.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition of Famous Tomb Objects Held in Chengdu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of burial objects
unearthed in the early 1970s from a 2,000-year-old tomb in
Changsha, central China, opened to visitors today in Chengdu,
capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The tomb, at Mawangdui on the outskirts of Changsha city in
Hunan Province, has been identified as belonging to the early
Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD), and contained the well-
preserved corpse of an elderly woman and more than 3,000 valuable
funerary objects.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President to Visit France Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika will visit France on June 13-16, the first by an
Algerian head of state since 1983.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Bouteflika will be given the highest protocol,
including an exceptional welcome ceremony to be presided by French
President Jacques Chirac at the airport upon his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika is expected to meet with Chirac and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin as well as some French business leaders and
representatives of the strong Algerian community in France.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and Algeria have fully normalized
since Bouteflika came to power in April 1999, after one decade of
cold and sometimes tense relations.
</P>
<P>
But French officials and media have described the relations
between the two countries as "always passionate" because of
cultural and historical ties and the huge Algerian community in
France, including more than 1 million French citizens of Algerian
origin and half a million Algerian nationals.
</P>
<P>
One of the objectives of Bouteflika's visit is to encourage
French enterprises to invest in Algeria, which is experiencing
some social and economic difficulties after a decade of internal
conflict between government forces and Islamic militants, in which
100,000 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika has called on French nationals who used to live in
Algeria before its independence in 1962, to return and join the
country's reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Cake Made to Attract Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMCHI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 4,000 tourists got to
see, and then eat, the largest cake ever made in China on display
today at a square in Korla city, the political center of the
Bayingolin autonomous prefecture in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The oblong cake was 100 meters long, 1.7 meters wide, and 0.5
meters high. It weighed 15 tons, and was made from 2,100 kg of
eggs, 7,360 kg of flour, 4,000 kg of sugar, and 1,600 kg of cream.
</P>
<P>
Chefs from eight hotels in the city spent about 15 days making
the gigantic confection.
</P>
<P>
Jing Jianxin, chief official with the Tourism Administration of
Bayingolin, said that the cake was made to resemble the landscape
of Bayingolin, the largest prefecture in China, occupying about
480,000 sq-km, and the most eye-catching area in the Xinjiang
Autonomous Region in China's northwest.
</P>
<P>
"We made mountains out of cream, paved roads with chocolate,
the sand beaches are bread crumbs, and the lakes come from jelly,"
veteran chef Ji Haiben said excitedly.
</P>
<P>
But the sweet scenery didn't stop there: Also on the cake were
representations of China's largest natural reserve, the country's
only wild camel protection reserve, the nation's highest grassland
area and biggest desert, and an array of other unique sites in the
autonomous prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials in Xinjiang said that the region's most
fetching features were included on the cake, and it was likely to
give even more of a boost to the prefecture's tourism industry,
which earned 80 million yuan (9.6 million US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
After it was on display for about two hours, the cake was eaten
by the crowd.

<HEADLINE> IBM: Arm Small, Medium-Sized Chinese Companies with E-business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- IBM will help small and medium-
sized Chinese enterprises grow by way of E-business, Wu Baochun,
manager of the E-business department of IBM (China) Corp. told
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
As a representative of IBM, Wu is currently taking part in the
2000 Trade Fair of Zhejiang province, one of China's eastern
economic powerhouses, in Ningbo city.
</P>
<P>
IBM pays special attention to China's small and medium-sized
companies, which have developed with unbelievable speed, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Some years ago, for example, the Chinese companies of Changhong,
Haier, and Chunlan were seen as small and medium-sized in IBM's
eyes, but now they have grown into the nation's leaders in the
fields of household appliances, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, these small and medium companies usually lack efficient
management, enough professionals on staff, and rarely become
familiar with the rules of the game when it comes to improving
performance using E-business, said Jiang Wei, manager of IBM (
China) Corp. in charge of east China business.
</P>
<P>
IBM's solution is a good choice for them, Jiang said, for it
has already earned a sound world reputation and understands China'
s situation.
</P>
<P>
IBM is now cooperating with domestic software-developing
companies to provide E-business solutions for China's small and
medium-sized enterprises, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Politics, Bureaucracy Block Japanese Investment in Bangladesh By Chen Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Political instability, red tape and
power problem were regarded as the major impediments to Japanese
investment in Bangladesh at the 11th meeting of the Japan-
Bangladesh Joint Committee for Commercial and Economic Cooperation
(JBJCCEC) which concluded in Tokyo Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of JBJCCEC Uzuhico Uwatoko said while addressing a
press conference after the two-day meeting that if the political
instability could be overcome, Bangladesh would be a tremendous
destination for foreign investment, especially from Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh's labor is cheaper from security perspective, it
enjoys very good position, and it has no ethnic problem and war
like Sri Lanka," said Uwatoko.
</P>
<P>
However, the amount of investment in the country only accounts
for 0.1 percent of Japanese investment in Asia, according to Japan
External Trade Organization (JETRO) President Yoshihiko Saeki.
</P>
<P>
Even compared with other South Asian countries, not to mention
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the scale of Japanese
investment in Bangladesh is quite small, he added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics given by Saeki said India got 1.1 percent of
Japanese investment in Asia, Sri Lanka 0.4 percent and Pakistan 0.
3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year Japan's import from Bangladesh amounted to 115
million U.S. dollars while Japan's export to Bangladesh was 325
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"In order to correct the trade imbalance between the two
countries and accelerate economic development in Bangladesh,
further development of export industries is of vital importance,"
the JETRO president said.
</P>
<P>
"Japanese products made in Bangladesh" should be the motto for
both sides for boosting investment from Japan into the country and
an equitable bilateral trade between the two unequal economies, he
suggested.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials and entrepreneurs also expressed their
concern over allowing trade union right in export processing zones,
saying that will tarnish the investment environment in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
At present Japanese investment in Bangladesh through 52
projects is 22.4 billion yen (226 million U.S. dollars), a large
part of which is in the export processing zones.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the worried entrepreneurs, Bangladesh delegation
leader, Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry
Director Abdul Haq said the Bangladeshi government is trying to
reach a consensus in the union issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also adopted an 18-point declaration, including
implementation of recommendations coming from both sides and a
plan to set up a human resources development institute in Dhaka
with Japanese assistance.

Tesseny, which began Saturday morning, is continuing. Ethiopian
troops are causing " severe damage to enemy troops" in the intense
fighting, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Strike in Nigeria Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- All flights have been suspended at
Murtala Muhammed international airport of Lagos, Nigeria's main
outlet, when the nationwide "sit at home" strike against a petrol
price hike continues.
</P>
<P>
The airport was shut off on Friday evening, making
international flights divert to airports in Ghana or other
countries, according to local media reports on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Several people have been reportedly killed, and more wounded in
violence relating to the strike in the last two days. Police have
reportedly arrested hundreds of rioters.
</P>
<P>
Most of Lagos's public hospitals have also been shut down,
leaving patients staying in the wards taking care of themselves,
said local resources on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Governments at federal and state levels remained closed
throughout Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the federal Head of Civil Service Abu Obe on Friday in
Abuja required all senior officials to return to posts
immediately, as "they are by rule not expected to participate in
an industrial action''.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Minister of Aviation kema chikwe, said air
traffic controllers are working and not expected to be on strike.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC), organizer of the action, has
refused to call off the strike, in spite of the fact that the
government Thursday had announced five-naira-per-liter (one U. S.
dollar is equal to 100 naira) reductions for petrol and diesel,
and 10-naira-per-liter reduction for kerosine.
</P>
<P>
NLC launched the strike shortly after the Nigerian government
increased the country's petrol price by 50 percent to 30 naira
per liter last Thursday.

<P>
Joo, who had beaten table tennis all-time greats Liu Guoliang
of China and Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden, handed a 19-21, 21-11, 21-
18 defeat to Qian, an Austrian with Chinese origin.
</P>
<P>
Qian had a good record against defensive players but he didn't
show his best form while facing the South Korean. He was so upset
about the loss that he threw his bat into air, which fell and just
missed a photographer.
</P>
<P>
"Two surprising wins in two days boosted Joo's confidence and
he didn't show mercy to Qian Qianli today," said South Korean Kim
Taek Soo.
</P>
<P>
Joo edged out Olympic and world champion Liu Guoliang 2-1 in
the South Koreans' 3-0 routing of the defending world club
champion Chinese Army on Thursday.

twice world champion, in three sets.
</P>
<P>
Kim Taek Soo gave Daewoo a flying start as he downed
Niederosterreich's Chinese international Ma Lin 21-16, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who has strong forehand topspin and lethal backhand attack,
was pressuring world runner-up Ma Lin throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
"He looked very confident and aggressive, giving me little
chance to attack or counter-attack," said Ma Lin, who helped the
Chinese Army clinch the inaugural world club championship last
year.
</P>
<P>
Park Sang Joon wrapped up Daewoo's victory with a 21-18, 21-18
win over world championship bronze medalist Werner Schlager.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect such an easy win," said Kim. "I thought
before the match we would have a slim chance against Ma and
Schlager."
</P>
<P>
Kim added Daewoo had been preparing for this championship for
two months.
</P>
<P>
In the other semi-final, Chinese Super League winner
Heilongjiang edged out the Chinese Army 3-2.
</P>
<P>
Helongjiang's Kong Linghui overcame Liu Guozheng 21-16, 21-18
before Liu Guoliang leveled the score with a 21-11, 21-15
thrashing of Yan Sen.
</P>
<P>
Xu Hui put the the Chinese Army in lead as the teenage attacker
nipped Zhang Yong 21-19, 17-21.
</P>
<P>
World No. 1 Kong made it 2-2 as he single-handedly beat Liu
Guoliang 21-14, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
Yan Sen clinched the deciding game by defeating Liu Guozheng 20-
22, 21-14, 21-19.

"The expo has become a platform to exchange the up-to-date
information of tourism," said Ho Pui Ying, Sales &AMP; Marketing
General Manager of the expo's organizer, Adsale Exhibition
Services.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the first day of the 14th expo to open to the
public, thousands of Hong Kong residents poured into the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center for a visit. Ho expected that the
number of public visitors this year would exceed the estimated 40,
000 for last year, thanks to a remarkable economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Lau Chi Keung, an accountant in his 40s, like many other
visitors, wanted to collect information here to work out a travel
plan for his coming 15-day annual summer holiday.
</P>
<P>
"We Hong Kong people work very hard and need to find a good
place to relax," Lau said, with both hands carrying bags filled
with colorful brochures.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 exhibitors from more than 40 countries and
regions are attending the 14th expo, with the delegations of
Brunei, Bhutan, Qatar, Ecuador, Malta, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe
joining the show for the first time.
</P>
<P>
In addition to collecting information, visitors can take part
in other travel-related activities.
</P>
<P>
A folk dance show, accompanied by lively music, performed by
six Guam aboriginals wearing traditional costumes and a radiant
smile, won warm applause from the audience while a seminar on
sightseeing in Inner Mongolia drew hundreds of listeners.
</P>
<P>
Queues were formed in front of the stands of some exhibitors,
who promoted their products and services by distributing cute
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
The organizer also arranged a lucky draw with prizes such as
free air tickets, hotel accommodation and travel package.
</P>
<P>
In line with the market development, an information technology
pavilion and golf pavilion have been added to the current expo.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation is a notable participant of the event,
with an exhibition area occupying one-fifth of the 10,000-square-
meter exhibition hall.
</P>
<P>
"China is poised to become one of the largest players in the
global travel and tourism market, both as a destination and as a
source of travelers to other destinations," said John M. Koldowski,
director of Strategic Information Center of the Pacific-Asia
Travel Association.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization has predicted that China will be
the fourth most important generating market, according to
Koldowski.
</P>
<P>
About 5,800 buyers, including 400 hosted buyers, are attending
the 14th expo, which was tailored for trade professionals on
Thursday and Friday and is open to the public in the following two
days.
</P>
<P>
"We will move the exhibition from the current old wing of the
Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center to the bigger new wing
next year," said Ho Pui Ying.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Official on China's Development of Western Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- International organizations
should participate in the development of China's vast western
regions and play a positive role in the expansion, a United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Leitner, UNDP resident representative to China, made
the remark today at an international symposium on development of
China's western area, which opened on Thursday in Chongqing,
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The symposium has been listed as part of UNDP's aid to China
early this year, Leitner said, adding that the project will help
UNDP play a role in developing China's vast western regions.
</P>
<P>
UNDP is now carrying out many projects in the area, she noted.
</P>
<P>
In the coming three years, UNDP will grant at least one billion
US dollars in loans to support the construction of infrastructure
facilities and water-conservation projects in the area, according
to the Leitner.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is now using World Bank loans to start environmental
protection projects. The environment of Chongqing and the Three
Gorges Dam project area will be greatly improved once these
projects are finished.
</P>
<P>
Officials from UNESCO, the World Tourism Organization, and the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization also expressed
their willingness to support China's development of western area.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that since 1978 China has got some
four billion US dollars in international aid, which was managed by
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Eastern and coastal areas were the major beneficiaries of this
aid in the 1980s, according to officials from the ministry.
International organizations can play an important role in the
development of China's west, they said.

<P>
WUHAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on cooperation between
central China's Hubei Province and France opened in this
provincial capital city today.
</P>
<P>
French ambassador to China Pierre Morel, officials from French
city Bordeaux and representatives of over 30 noted French
companies attended the seminar, which was organized by the Hubei
provincial government and the general consulate of France to Wuhan.

By the end of last year, France had built 22 enterprises in
Wuhan, involving a total investment of 2 billion U.S. dollars.
France opened a general consulate in Wuhan in 1998, and the city
of Bordeaux forged sister-ties with Wuhan the same year.
</P>
<P>
There is a bright prospect for cooperation between France and
Hubei since the European Union signed an agreement with China on
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), French
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Afghan President Calls for International Effort Towards Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Ousted Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani here on Saturday called for more efforts by the
international community to find a solution to the ongoing civil war
in his country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference
and Afghanistan's neighboring countries should step up efforts to
put an end to the tragic crisis in the country, Rabbani said at the
6th summit of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) held here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic government of Afghanistan will warmly welcome any
just plan to put an end to the civil war and foreign intervention
in the country, the Afghan exile leader said.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani also urged the ruling Taliban militia to give up war and
solve the Afghan crisis through political means. "War is not the
way to resolve the Afghan issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani, whose government was driven out of the capital Kabul in
1996, blamed the ruling Taliban regime for "all the tragic
consequences of the civil war."
</P>
<P>
Under the domination of the Taliban militia, Rabbani lambasted,
Afghanistan has been turned into a base for terrorism, smuggling of
narcotic drugs and dispatcher of armed groups for carrying out
sabotage activities in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has controlled more than 90 percent of the country's
territories, but the international community has so far refused to
recognize it while Iran still supports Rabbani, who is leading the
Northern Alliance in fighting against Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Terming the 10-member ECO as a "large economic family," Rabbani
also called for the consolidation of relations among its members to
create a suitable atmosphere for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran-based ECO was founded by Iran, Pakistan and Turkey in
1985 and later joined by Afghanistan as well as Central Asian and
Caucasian republics of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan.

redefine its position against new national and international
challenges.
</P>
<P>
"As members of a body of developing nations, we ought to move in
the direction of achieving our goal of comprehensive, balanced and
harmonious development," Khatami said at the inaugural session of
the sixth ECO summit held here on Saturday.

Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan as well as the
Kazakh prime minister and Turkish minister of state for economic
affairs attended the summit.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, chairman of the ECO summit, said the ECO countries can
take a more active part in today's global events due to their the
cultures, civilizations, rich natural and human resources.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the ECO still has a long way to go before the
optimal level of cooperation and coordination is achieved, the
Iranian president stressed that at present the ECO should focus on
projects and plans on the basis of economic priority for the
region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the ECO members would reach agreement and
sign a memorandum of understanding in reducing tariff and non-
tariff barriers by setting a specific timetable for progress toward
the establishment of the ECO free trade zones.
</P>
<P>
He also called for promotion of cooperation among ECO members in
the fields of transport, energy, environmental protection and
campaign against drug trafficking in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran-based ECO was founded by Iran, Pakistan and Turkey in
1985 and later joined by Afghanistan as well as Central Asian and
Caucasian republics of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan.

<P>
ABU DHABI, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Excavations by local and foreign
teams in the north of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have
contributed to the outlining of the features of the ancient society
in the UAE, an official of the Sharjah Department of Culture and
Information said.
</P>
<P>
The annual seasonal excavations, concluded last month at various
archaeological sites in the Sharjah emirate, added more information

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader Urges Support for Fighting Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
called on the Filipino people Saturday to unite and support him in
fighting poverty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a radio-TV program, Estrada said this is a fitting
way to mark the 102nd anniversary of Philippine independence,
which falls on June 12.
</P>
<P>
"If we can only unite and avoid fighting, we have a good chance
to beat poverty, which is our real enemy now," he said, adding
that the challenge in the new century is for the people to regain
the freedom to live decent lives.
</P>
<P>
"We have a duty to fulfill. We may be independent politically,
but we are not yet free from poverty and ignorance. This is our
fight today. This is what is expected of us. And we can not win
this war if we don't unite," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he feels sad that conflict continues to rage
in Mindanao, the southern Philippines, between government forces
and armed groups who want to secede from the country. Much-needed
resources are being poured to stop the secessionists, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that we will be able to pour our funds into development
projects throughout the country, especially in Mindanao, so that
we can free ourselves from the bondage of poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his administration's commitment to tap
Mindanao's potentials and turn the vast region into the country's
food basket once the fighting dies down.

<P>
KATHMANDU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- People who use mobile phones
while driving in the Kathmandu valley will be subjected to penalty,
according to the Valley Traffic Police Office (VTPO).
</P>
<P>
The first-time offender will be fined 25-50 rupees (36-80 U.S.
cents while repeated offenders will be penalized up to 200 rupees
(3 U.S. dollars), said a notice by VTPO.
</P>
<P>
Serious offenders can be fined up to 1000 rupees (14.5 U.S.
dollars), said the notice, publicized Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Use of mobile phone while driving your car is one of the
potential factors that can invite accident," said VTPO officer
Kumar Koirala. "The notice came after much delay," he added.
</P>
<P>
The number of mobile phone users has exceeded 6000 in the
Kathmandu valley, and the number is still escalating.
</P>
<P>
Most of the mobile users are businessmen, top-level politicians
and senior bureaucrats, who generally work under stress and are
more prone to accidents, said a traffic police source.
</P>
<P>
The notice is a necessity as the traffic situation in the
valley is chaotic due to narrow roads and ignorance of traffic
regulations by people, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The tourism sector in
Tanzania, accounting for 14 percent of total Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in 1999, served as second biggest contributor after
agriculture, local newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Director of Tourism Saleh Pamba in the

<P>
The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry Philemon Luhanjo also

</P>
<P>
Luhanjo said as tourism gains fame worldwide day by day and is
among the fastest growing sectors, Tanzania, like other African
states, had embarked on development of tourism as a tool for
poverty alleviation and improvement of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"Our country is one among those countries that have given high
priority to tourism development," he said. "We have taken measures
both at the marco and sectoral levels in order to allow the
industry to perform well." Such measures include liberalized
financial and tax regimes and improved investment climate and
policies.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to streamline its roles so as to
leave business activities to the private sector, while
concentrating on policy formulation, implementation, monitoring

<HEADLINE> Conservative Leader Says Britain Against Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Conservative
Party leader William Hague said on Saturday that the "vast
majority" of Britons support his stance against the euro as the
Tories held a national day of action for the pound.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative leader said there were signs the public was
rallying to the policy in the run-up to the next general election.
</P>
<P>
"People are going to be faced by a Labor government that wants
to get rid of the pound, or a Conservative government that is
guaranteed to keep it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Every other party would want to do away with the pound and so
it is a straightforward choice, a fundamental choice, and I think
people will be on our side," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tory party workers were mounting stalls in 330 constituencies
around Britain on Saturday to ask passers-by to sign a commitment
card pledging not to replace sterling with the euro.
</P>
<P>
Hague will reiterate his message in visits to Edgbaston in
Birmingham and Bury in Greater Manchester.
</P>
<P>
The move came as Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers
said there would be "clear business benefits" if Britain joined a
single European currency.
</P>
<P>
The Independent newspaper said that pro-European ministers are
celebrating after Byers was given the go-ahead to speak out in
favor of the euro.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Carpet Export Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's carpet exports declined
by a sharp 50 percent in the first three months of this year
compared with the last three months of the previous year,
according to Nepal Carpet Exporters' Association (NCEA).
</P>
<P>
Nepal exported 336,000 square meters of carpet by the end of
March this year while the total exports during the last three
months of 1999 were 669,000 square meters, NCEA President Kabindra
Thakur told its annual meeting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Thakur attributed the sharp downward turn to the saturation of
the German market and Nepal's inability to explore new markets.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons behind the decline included the devaluation of
the German currency and the Euro and the flow of cheaper Indian
carpets into European markets.
</P>
<P>
Europe, the United States and Japan are the major export
markets for Nepali carpets, with Germany being the biggest
importer.
</P>
<P>
Sales of carpets, which used to be Nepal's biggest export item,
have been on the decline in recent years following reports of use
of child labor and substandard raw materials in carpet production.
They have now fallen behind ready-made garments as the second
largest foreign exchange earner for Nepal.
</P>
<P>
A new tax on export earnings proposed in the budget for the
fiscal year 2000/2001 is expected to further affect the Nepali
carpet business, said Thakur.

<HEADLINE> Iran Favors Earlier Solution of Afghan Crisis: Khatami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
has expressed his country's hope for an earlier solution to the
Afghan crisis so that peace and stability could be realized in the
region, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iran hopes that efforts of international organizations as well
as regional countries will lead to a political solution to the
Afghan crisis as soon as possible, Khatami said on Friday in a
meeting with visiting Pakistani Chief Executive Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
"A turbulent and war-ravaged Afghanistan is not to the benefit
of any regional country and certainly not in the interest of any of
its neighbors," the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's Muslim factions have been engaged in a bloody
civil war since 1992 after the former pro-Soviet government was
toppled.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, President Burhanuddin Rabbani's government was ousted
by the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban militia, who is now
controlling more than 90 percent of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
Military clashes are still continuing between the Taliban and
the Northern Alliance opposition headed by Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Pakistan, both neighbors of Afghanistan, have sided
with different political factions in the country, with Tehran
supporting Rabbani and Islamabad backing the current Taliban
government in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf arrived here Friday for the two-day summit of
the 10-member Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) which started
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ECO was founded by Iran, Pakistan and Turkey in 1985 and
later joined by Afghanistan as well as Central Asian and Caucasian
republics of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan,
Tajikistan and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
In their meeting Friday, both Khatami and Musharraf expressed
their willingness to enhance bilateral ties in all fields. They
also stressed the need to promote regional cooperation as well as
removing misunderstandings and tensions.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
has stressed that central and western Asian countries should
enhance economic cooperation to offset the negative effects of
globalization, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
All members of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) must
expand their economic relations, Khatami said Friday in his meeting
with Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov, who is here for the two-
day sixth ECO summit meeting which started Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also reiterated that littoral states of the Caspian Sea
should establish an acceptable and legal regime representing the
interests of all of them so that they could cooperate in developing
the rich oil and gas resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Iran is ready to enter into various kinds of
cooperation with Turkmenistan, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, President Niyazov expressed his satisfaction with
the Iran-Turkmenistan bilateral ties. He also hailed the
cooperation of regional countries in gas projects, which he said
would be avenues to achieve greater regional peace and friendship.
</P>
<P>

1985 and later joined by Afghanistan as well as Central Asian and
Caucasian republics of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan,

<HEADLINE> No Resettlement Project for Development of China's West: Official ( 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cai Fang, Director of the Institute of Population Science of
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that in recent period
the population structure in the west will remain unchanged. The
population floating between the east and west will abide by law of
market economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the west which is economically and culturally
backward, labor force is surplus and high level talents are
deficient comparatively. Thus, China's west is now continuing to
transfer laborers to the east.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the commercial opportunities promoted by the
development of China's west will absorb high-quality talents and
mature technical workers.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of the greater development of the west
China region, Chinese government and local governments in the east
have formulated a series policies to encourage talents to take
part in the development in the west.
</P>
<P>
According to the policies, the talented people can retain all
their relations in their original places in the east and they can
return to east at any time. The west region is also allow the
people to come and go freely.
</P>
<P>
Cai said the state stressed the importance to improve the
quality of the population in the west, for development of west
mainly depends on themselves.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the Ministry of Education has decided to
promote development of education in the west, especially in the
regions with ethnic population.
</P>
<P>
The universities and colleges in the eastern and central part
of China will expand enrollment to the students from the west and
they are encouraged to run well classes for students from Tibet
and Xinjiang and for other ethnic people.

<HEADLINE> No Resettlement Project for Development of China's West: Official ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese official said here today
there is no large-sized resettlement project for the greater
development of west China region.
</P>
<P>
Li Shantong, Director of Regional Development Department of the
Development Research Center of the State Council, said that some
overseas media incorrectly reported that China will open up the
western region by huge resettlement project.
</P>
<P>
Some articles carried by overseas media claimed that China's
west will become a "container" for the increased population of the
country and in the coming years, the west is expected to hold
about 300 million people from the east.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, the central government does not have such a
project. At present, the principal task for the development of
China's west is to improve ecological environment and the
population quality," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the Chongqing International Symposium on Development
of China's West, Li said unlike the development of the west part
of the United States, China's west is not a virgin land. There
are some population structure and central cities with stronger
radiation capacity in west China region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that comparing with the east, labor force in the west
are not deficient.
</P>
<P>
There are 10 provinces, autonomous regions and municipality in
China's west. The area and the population of the west accounts for
57 and 23 percent of the country's total respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Large-sized resettlement to the west will aggravate the
ecological environment and it is not a good way to follow," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Soldier Jailed in Turkish Cypriot Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A military court in the Turkish
Cypriot area has sentenced 21-year-old Greek Cypriot soldier
Giorgos Kasianides to 20 days in jail for "illegal entry" into a
military area in northern Cyprus, local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish soldiers seized Kasianides early on Sunday when they
found him in the Turkish Cypriot side of the divided Cypriot
capital Nicosia. Kasianides was in uniform, but carrying no
weapons.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no information about why or how Kasianides went
to the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Turkish Cypriot court took Kasianides' age into
account in reducing the sentence from a maximum of two years.
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP (U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus) spokeswoman Sarah
Russell said permission had been granted for Kasianides' family to
visit him in the jail Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<HEADLINE> Strategy of Developing Western China Benefits Neighboring Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of the
strategy of developing China's western areas will facilitate
economic growth and social development in neighboring countries of
China, agreed experts attending an ongoing international symposium
on developing the west here.
</P>
<P>
Central Asian member nations of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) will benefit the most from the strategy since they
border on the western areas of China and the transportation is
very convenient between China and all these nations, said Li
Jingwen, an economist from the government think tank, the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Li, also an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences,
said development in western China will boost in bilateral trade
with these CIS nations. Also, China and these CIS member nations
may join forces to better develop the natural resources in the
region such as petroleum and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Li's view, a Russian official said better development
of China's west will create more demand, which the neighboring
countries could well make use of to boost their economy.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and CIS member nations in central Asia are very
interested in China's strategy of developing its west, and hope to
participate in the move." the official said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Development of China's Western Area Going On Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The development of China's vast
western regions is going on smoothly since Chinese President Jiang
Zemin put forward the strategy last June during a visit to Xi'an,
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The 10 western areas targeted for development are Shaanxi,
Gansu and Qinghai provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions
and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions in the northwest,
Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan provinces, Chongqing Municipality and
Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, the State Development Bank had granted a
total of 400 billion yuan (48.19 billion US dollars) in loans to
support the construction of railways, oil and natural gas fields,
hydropower stations in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Third Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress in the Chinese capital city of Beijing in March further
beat the drum for the campaign. During the meeting, Premier Zhu
Rongji elaborated on the significance of the State policy, which
was acclaimed by the media as a "major important decision" of the
Chinese government in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided that 70 percent of the State
treasury bonds, as well as large sums of state appropriate funds
and loans from foreign governments and international organizations
will go to help the economic growth of the western regions.
</P>
<P>
In March, the initial stage of a gas pipeline aiming at
carrying natural gas produced in western China to energy-
consumpting eastern area began. The first phase of the project,
the second largest infrastructure facility project following China
's Three Gorges Dam project, involves a total investment of 120
billion yuan (14.46 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Construction on nine other key projects in transportation,
water control, ecological construction sectors in western China is
also currently underway.
</P>
<P>
Forum on development of western China and various trade talks
were held in these regions, including the Fourth China East-West
Cooperation and Investment Trade Fair held in Xi'an in April and
the ongoing international symposium on development of western
China which opened Thursday in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said the State has stipulated various
preferential policies to encourages foreign investment in the
region. The World Bank is expected to issue one billion US dollars
in loans to the area in the coming three years.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, of the world's top 500 enterprises, over 60 have
invested in western China. Some countries have established
consulate in the regions.
</P>
<P>
But sources concerned believed that the development of China's
vast western area is a long and arduous task and needs the hard-
working of several generations.

removed should be deeply buried in line with the principle of not
occupying arable land.
</P>
<P>
Now the Chinese government is advocating cremation all over the
country and the policy is winning more and more supports from the
villagers in the Three Gorges area. Most of the resettled
residents cremated the remains of their kinship or ancestors and
then re-buried the ashes.
</P>
<P>
As for those graves that no one claims, the government will
arrange people to manage the cremation before the removal.
</P>
<P>
Wanzhou City has more than 80 percent of the resettled
population of the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
Ouyang Zuhui, Director of Resettlement Bureau of the city, said
some people placed the ash of the remains of their kinship or
ancestors in funeral home, some of them deeply buried the remains
in the ground near their new houses and some have the remains
buried in cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wanzhou City Civil Affairs Bureau has allocated a
special fund to build a new cemetery to hold 470 martyrs' tombs
which will be inundate in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Adopts Strict Control on Water Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Facing the danger of drought as a
result of rare rains, the Chinese capital Beijing plans to adopt a
series of strict and obligatory measures on water consumption.
</P>
<P>
The measures include introducing a quota system for water usage
in industrial enterprises and in hotels, restaurants, and colleges
and universities.
</P>
<P>
Beijing plans to save 70 million cubic meters of water this
year, 50 percent more than the amount for 1999.
</P>
<P>
While all the industrial enterprises will be subject to an
upper limit in their water consumption, those enterprises which
waste water resources and generate heavy pollution will have to
upgrade their technological level within a limited time period so
as to use water economically or they will be forced out of
production.
</P>
<P>
Stricter control will also be imposed on water consumption in
sectors which consume a large amount of water, such as the car-
washing business and public bathhouses.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that per capita water resources in Beijing
stands at 300 cubic meters, about one-eighth of the national
average and one-thirtieth of the world's average. The city is now
facing the strike of drought as the arid weather since last year
has resulted in sharp decline in the water level in the city's
reservoirs and in the underground water level.
</P>
<P>
In other water-saving moves, the city also plans to replace the
irrigation system in downtown Beijing with a more water-saving
system and adopt a quota system in water usage among households on
an experimental basis. Water used daily by Beijing residents is
expected to be reduced under 130 cubic meters by the year 2002.

<P>
Local governments under Chongqing City have enlisted the remain
removal project into the Plan for Resettlement in the Rural Areas
and they have allocated special fund for the program.
</P>
<P>
The super dam of the Three Gorges Project will be 1,983 meters
long and 185 meters in crest elevation. The normal water storage
depth will be 175 meters till 2009 when the construction of the
dam is completed.
</P>
<P>
The ascending water of the Yangtze River in the coming years
will submerge more than 1,100 villages and townships.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement of residents and removal of the remains of the
residents' kinship are concerned with thousands of households in
the rural areas where there is a long-existing custom to bury dead
under the ground and hold memorial ceremony for the soul of the
dead.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Changsheng, a farmer at Dachang Town, recently removed
the remains of his mother and elder sister from the area to be
inundated.
</P>
<P>
Dachang Town with more than 1,700 years of history is noted for
its ancient buildings of the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911)
as well as for exquisitely-decorated tombs. The town has been
resettled on another hill with ancient buildings and homes of the
residents reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.07 million residents to be resettled and
there are at least more than 10,000 tombs below the inundate line.
</P>
<P>
According to government official in charge of the resettlement
work in Wanzhou City, the government will compensate the resettled
residents more than 10 million yuan on their removal of the
remains of their kinship.
</P>
<P>
Zheng, who lost his mother at age of 11, said that he could not
fall asleep in the evening prior to the day for removal of his
mother's remains.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Multinationals Marching Into Western China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 out of the world's
top 500 industrial enterprises have invested in western China.
</P>
<P>
In the first several months, foreign investment in Sichuan
Province, southwest China, was three times more than the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Since June last year, China has encouraged foreign businesses
to invest in its western region since the central government
initiated a campaign to develop the region.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Company Vice Chairman Wayne Booker said that "We
need a balanced development. The western region with one-fourth of
China's total population is the first choice of my company to
develop business potential since there are flood of markets in
eastern China."
</P>
<P>
Booker, who is attending an international symposium on the
development of western China, said his company is considering
investing more in western China.
</P>
<P>
Compared to foreign investment in eastern China, some western
regions are still struggling to attract overseas money. However,
the situation is expected to turn around for the better this year
since some foreign companies are starting to make profits.
</P>
<P>
The British BP Amoco company has invested in an acetic acid
project in Chongqing and made 3 million U.S. dollars in profits in
its first year of operation. The company plans to invest more
funds in the project.
</P>
<P>
The Glaxo Holdings Ltd. from Britain has also made big profits
after increasing investment.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign businessmen have attributed the success to the
rich resources and cheap labor in the western region.

<P>
Another factor that encourages foreign investors is that the
Chinese Government plans to invest heavily to improve
infrastructure facilities. China plans to build 20 airports in the
region this year.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Klein, who was awarded a Nobel Economics Prize in 1980,
said at the symposium that multinationals coming to western China
is part of companies exploring new markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
Most multinational companies first put their capital into high-
tech industries zones in some key cities in western China.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Korea (ROK) has become the second largest trade
partner of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. ROK's businessmen
have not only invested in local railway construction, but also in
the development of organic agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tongsan, an economist from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that "Chinese Government should further open its
western markets, so that the region can attract more foreign funds.
"
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission announced recently
that the country will open more sectors to foreign investors,
including telecommunications, insurance and retail sales market.
Foreign investors even can apply for mineral exploration in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Without Kobe, Lakers Take 2-0 Lead Over Pacers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 9 (Xinhua) -- MVP Shaquille O'Neal scored 40
points and grabbed 24 rebounds while making just enough free
throws to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 111-104 victory over
the Indiana Pacers Friday night and a 2-0 lead in the best-of-
seven NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers overcame the loss of their second superstar Kobe
Bryant, who sprained his left ankle in the first quarter. Bryant
just played 9 minutes and scored only two points.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, repeatedly deliberately fouled by the Pacers to exploit
the only weakness in his game, made 18-of-39 from the free throw
line while shooting 11-of-18 from the floor. He exceeded the
previous Finals record for foul shot attempts by 15.
</P>
<P>
Though he struggled in most of times at the foul line, O'Neal
made 9-of-16 in the fourth quarter. "I was trying too hard. I
just said to myself, calm down, shoot," he said after the game.
</P>
<P>
Laker's veteran point guard Ron Harper and forward Glen Rice
both scored 21 points apiece to pick up the slack in Bryant's
absence.
</P>
<P>
For the Pacers, Jalen Rose scored 30 points but missed some key
free throws, going 10-for-14 from the stripe and 10-for-23 from
the floor. Reserve Austin Croshere added 24 points and superstar
Reggie Miller atoned somewhat for his dreadful 1-for-16 night in
Game 1, but he only tallied two points in the final period.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers got an unexpected break when Bryant sprained his
left ankle early in Game 2. But they couldn't take advantage of
the injury that should have been a pain for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Bryant landed on Rose's left foot nine minutes into Friday
night's game and didn't return, taking away the Lakers' No. 2
scoring option.
</P>
<P>
His absence made it a close game. Although the Pacers played
much better than they did in losing Game 1 104-87 last Wednesday
night, Miller again failed to produce any heroics in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Miller, coming off a career playoff-low seven points Wednesday,
was held to two points in the fourth on two free throws that drew
the Pacers within three with less than two minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
Miller finished with 21 points on 7-of-16 shooting, far fewer
shots than he said he wanted to take after Game 1.
</P>
<P>
Game 3 is scheduled on Sunday in Indianapolis.

<HEADLINE> Olympic-qualified Shuttlers Banned from Competing in Indonesian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) finally decided to ban 19 Olympics qualified
shuttlers from performing in the 15th National Games (PON) in
Surabaya this month,according to the Jakarta Post Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision is considered controversial as at the same time
KONI allowed women's taekwondoin Juana Wangsa Putri, who is
recovering from her injury, and her junior Rahadewi Neta to
compete in PON and in the Korea Open championships in Seoul at the
same time later this month.
</P>
<P>
KONI had earlier claimed it would focus on badminton because
the sport has the greatest chance to contribute gold medals in the
Olympic Games. But it also pledged that it would not be partial
towards athletes from other sports who had qualified for the
quadrennial event from September 15 to October 1.
</P>
<P>
KONI spokesman Ahmed Solihin said Olympics training director
Arie Sudewo, who is also KONI's vice chairman, asked the Badminton
Association of Indonesia (PBSI) to advise its West Java chapter,
where the shuttlers were registered for PON, to find their
substitutes.
</P>
<P>
"Only West Java still has its Olympics players registered for
PON. KONI has requested that PBSI and its West Java chapter
replace the 19 shuttlers with others. KONI reminded PBSI that we
already had an agreement not to allow Olympics-trained shuttlers
to compete in PON," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian badminton has quite a long tradition of netting gold
medals in Olympics. It earned two golds in 1992 in Barcelona when
badminton was featured for the first time. In 1996, Indonesian men
's doubles pair Ricky and Rexy retained supremacy.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed said that Juana and Neta should try their best in the two
events, as KONI would select one of them to represent the country
in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He said KONI would allow four women's archers, also being
groomed for the Olympics, to compete in the FITA events and the
Indonesian Archery Association events in PON from June 19 to 30.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for International Treaty to Ban Outer Space Arms Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese representative said here
that "it is necessary to speed up negotiations on an international
agreement for the prevention of arms race in outer space."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 43rd session of the United Nations Committee on
the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) Thursday, Huang Huikang,
head of the Chinese delegation, said it is important and realistic
for the committee to restart consideration of maintaining peaceful
use of outer space after a two-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
"Recently, a certain country has accelerated development and
test of an outer space weapon system, or the so-called TMD, which
risks intensification of arms race in outer space. Such an action
is contradictory to the current trends and goes against
established international principles," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
The TMD system, or the Theater Missile Defense system, which
has its roots in the "Star Wars" anti-ballistic missile research
begun in the 1980s, is now being studied jointly by the United
States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The United States claims that the system is being considered
because of a perceived missile threat from the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea. However, many countries have expressed concern
about its deep adverse impact on international stability and the
disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
In 1967, the United Nations ratified a treaty on principles
governing the activities of states in outer space, saying that all
exploration and use of it should be for peaceful purpose.
</P>
<P>
"Outer space belongs to all mankind. Therefore, exploration and
use of it should proceed on a peaceful basis and serve the
economic, scientific, and cultural development of all countries,"
the Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
"Non-militarization is no doubt in tide with the future of
space law," he added. "In order to prohibit testing and using
weapons in outer space, an international legal instrument should
be negotiated and concluded immediately."
</P>
<P>
The current COPUOS session, which started Wednesday, will
submit a report on ways and means to maintain outer space for
peaceful purpose to the forthcoming 55th U.N. General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Chief EU Negotiator Sacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's chief negotiator with the
European Union (EU), Alexander Bozhkov, Friday was requested to
resign by Prime Minister Ivan Kostov for suspected involvement in
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Bozhkov was removed from positions of vice prime
minister and industry minister when the Bulgarian cabinet was
reshuffled, but later he was appointed chief negotiator with the
EU.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister demanded that Bozhkov resign over
irregularities found with the Industry Ministry in issuing
compensation notes during the period when Bozhkov was in charge.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Bozhkov is known as "Mr. 10 Percent" for
his demand for that amount of commission in every transaction in
the process of denationalization.
</P>
<P>
Kostov stressed on television Friday evening that the Bulgarian
government will not become a protective umbrella for corruption
and said he has handed all files concerning Bozhkov to the chief
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
He said he will name a new chief EU negotiator next week after
the Council of Ministers approves the resignation.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Kostov reported the case to President Peter
Stoyanov, who pledged continued support for all actions against
breach of law, the President's Press Secretariat said.

in the open air after a powerful earthquake measuring 7.9 on the
Richter Scale jolted the province Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Displace people on the Enggano island which lies close to the

</P>
<P>
Provincial secretary Hasanul Arisin said the government would
help people build simple, temporary houses. "But they are going to
have to pay for rebuilding permanent houses themselves. We don't
have the money. We need help from overseas if we are going to help,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
Bengkulu residents Friday urged President Abdurrahaman Wahid,
who is on an overseas trip, and Vice President Megawati
Soekarnoputri to soon visit the quake-hit province to see the
plight of the victims.

to solve the problem of under-cut prices of Thai rice by Vietnam,
and to boost prices of Vietnam's rice to levels comparable to
those sold by Thailand, he said.

<P>
The deal is practical, as Thai and Vietnamese rice is of
similar quality and standard, if the pilot project is proven
successful, it will be expanded, with each country contributing
more rice to the project, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Paithoon said that the Thai Commerce Ministry's Public

<P>
PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- American Tyler Hamilton won the fifth
stage of the Criterium du Dauphine-Libere cycling race on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton completed the stage by clocking five hours 25 minutes
13 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Tour de France champion American Lance Armstrong finished
second with an identical time. He was the key to Hamilton's win on
the 201-kilometer haul from Baune de Venise to Digne-les-Bains.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton totalled 20 hours 22 minutes and 38 seconds in overall
stadnings, 44 seconds ahead of overnight leader Haimar Zubeldia of
Spain, with Armstrong another four seconds back. Fourth-placed
Swiss Alex Zuelle was almost two minutes behind.
</P>
<P>
A breakaway group opened a lead of five minutes 50 kilometers
from the finish and looked uncatchable, but several riders
including five members of Zubeldia's Euskalte team engaged in a
pursuit.
</P>
<P>
When Armstrong attacked, Hamilton was right behind and they
killed off the field, going 25 seconds clear with 15 kilometers to
climb to the finish at Digne and 46 seconds when they arrived.

China's Internet Development Hindered by Narrow Bandwidth
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Information Industry Zhang Chunjiang said on
June 6 the most severe problem China's Internet development facing
is the narrow bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
China's current basic Internet network can not meet the demand
with narrow bandwidth, high prices and unstable services.

Chinese, Italian Scientists Find Possible Trace of Dark Matter
</P>
<P>
A research group composed of both Chinese and Italian
scientists have found what they believe to be traces of dark
matter, announced the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) on June 6.
</P>
<P>
Four scientists from the Institute of High Energy Physics under
the CAS and some experts from the University of Rome drew the
conclusion from their observations in a DAMA (Dark Matter)
laboratory, 1,000 meters underground in Gran Sasso, Italy.
</P>
<P>
In recent experiments, they used a large piece of crystal to
catch the reflection of movement of dark matter particles, and
succeeded in finding a trace which might prove the existence of
dark matter.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Council Calls for No Trade Ban on Fiji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand jobs could be lost
and the economy harmed if the government imposes trade sanctions
on Fiji, the Dominion Saturday quoted the NZ-Fiji Business Council
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The council has urged the New Zealand government not to impose
any trade sanctions, according to the Wellington-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Council Director Bruce Goldsworthy was quoted as saying Friday
that New Zealand exports far more to Fiji than Fiji exports to New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"There's between 250 million and 300 million NZ dollars (about
117.5 million and 141 million U.S. dollars) worth of reciprocal
trade between the two countries, and it's about four to one in New
Zealand's favor," Goldsworthy said.
</P>
<P>
If trade sanctions are imposed, New Zealand has far more to
lose than Fiji, he added.
</P>
<P>
The council has put its views to New Zealand Minister of
Foreign affairs and Trade Phil Goff and to the New Zealand Council
of Trade Unions, Goldsworthy said.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the New Zealand government has
been considering to impose sanctions on Fiji since the political
crisis began last month. The New Zealand Council of Trade Unions
adopted a resolution on June 1, calling on all New Zealand
businesses trading with Fiji to suspend trading.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for No Incidents in Euro 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry
expressed desire on Friday to avoid incidents that might
overshadow Turkish team's successes in the forthcoming Euro-2000
Football Championship.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that measures,
including several warnings, had been taken in view of the Euro-
2000 that will take place in the Netherlands and Belgium between
June 10 and July 2.
</P>
<P>
It added that a seven-member group had also been formed to
serve Turkish spectators.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that some unpleasant events had occurred in Istanbul
and Copenhagen prior to UEFA Cup games, the statement said the
Foreign Ministry had thought it beneficial to warn the Turkish
citizens living in the Netherlands and Belgium against possible
provocations in order to prevent re-occurrence of similar
incidents during Euro-2000.
</P>
<P>
"We wish that all Turkish citizens should stay away from
attitudes and violence that may overshadow the Turkish team's
successes and harm the prestige of Turkey," it said. "Turkish
people and supporters, who watch the games, should behave calmly
without paying attention to provocations."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry established a seven-person mission force
to help and guide the Turkish team players and supporters during
the Euro-2000.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the mission force had been giving services
in the Netherlands since June 4, and it would extend every
assistance and facility to the Turkish supporters in Arnhem,
Eindhoven and Brussels soon.

<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager Kevin
Keegan has dismissed suggestions that he is covering up the truth
about captain Alan Shearer's knee injury.
</P>
<P>
The national skipper has been given a deadline of Sunday to
prove his fitness ahead of the opening game against Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Shearer has had a precautionary scan on the problem - but
Keegan continues to be upbeat about the center-forward's chances
of being fit for Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
"We are not trying to hide anything," Keegan said at the team's
Spa training ground. "If he doesn't train on Saturday he would
have to train on Sunday to have a chance of playing in the first
game."
</P>
<P>
"In an ideal world you want all your players training all the
time. In football they get little niggles. With Alan he has so
much experience that to miss two or three days won't be a major
problem. If it becomes five or six we have a major problem,"
Keegan added.

<HEADLINE> Southgate to Give Penalties a Miss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Gareth Southgate has admitted that
he will not volunteer to put himself through a repeat of his
penalty agony of four years ago if England face another spot-kick
shoot-out in Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Southgate is resigned to being remembered as the player who
missed the vital kick against the Germans in the Euro 96 semi-
final at Wembley, even though he came to terms with that ordeal a
long time ago.
</P>
<P>
Since then he has carved out a distinguished career in the
Premiership with Aston Villa - prior to Thursday's shock request
for a transfer - and has seldom let England down while winning 36
caps to date.
</P>
<P>
But his uncomfortableness at taking penalties surfaced again
this season when he missed the deciding one for Villa in a
Worthington Cup-tie with West Ham at Upton Park.
</P>
<P>
Southgate said: "I think we would have to go down to about 18-
all before I took one with the way things stand! The possibility
of penalties being needed to win this competition has been
discussed. The chances are that somewhere down the line it will be
required because many of the teams are so evenly matched."
</P>
<P>
"But it goes without saying that I would be well down the list.
It is not something I am considering. It has gone beyond the point
where I have to prove a point. If it came to a shoot-out the most
important thing is that the team gets through. Unless it is 10-10,
or something like that, it is not going to happen in terms of me
taking a penalty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I've got fed up with it now and it's ancient
history. I've done plenty in my career since 1996 and I am very
pleased with the season I've just had. But I know that penalty is
something that everybody will go back to and I know that it is
something that I will probably always be labelled with. The most
disappointing thing about it all was that, on home soil and
playing the way we were, it was a missed opportunity for England.
That is why I have always said nothing could make up for that. I
am fortunate myself to have another crack at the European
championships but there are people who are not - and that is
something you can never bring back."
</P>
<P>
Southgate's demand to leave Villa is likely to spark a transfer
scramble with the likes of Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea among
possible interested parties.
</P>
<P>
But that is on the back-burner until after Euro 2000 and
Southgate believes his Villa team-mate and rising star Gareth
Barry could be the answer to Kevin Keegan's prayers for a left-
sided player.
</P>
<P>
Barry has played in the left-sided centre-half role
predominantly for Villa, but he showed he is at home at wing-back
in his two substitute appearances against the Ukraine and Malta.

<HEADLINE> Violent Fans Banned from Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- English courts have banned 36
football fans convicted of violence from travelling to Euro 2000
hours before the championship starts.
</P>
<P>
Magistrates in North Tyneside barred 35 fans from the football
tournament in the Netherlands and Belgium because they had been
involved in a fight between Newcastle United and Sunderland fans.
</P>
<P>
Oxford magistrates using the same new laws designed to prevent
football violence, gave Patrick Vigilante a three-year
international match ban because of his part in clashes at the
England versus Scotland match in November.
</P>
<P>
The travel bans, the first of their kind to be issued in the UK
under the Football Offences and Disorder Act 1999, were made on
the same day Home Secretary Jack Straw called for an end to the
culture of violence.
</P>
<P>
He urged families to turn in relatives involved in trouble.
</P>
<P>
Under the new act, courts have the power to issue international
football banning orders forcing hooligans to surrender their
passports up to five days before international fixtures if they
have been convicted outside of the country.
</P>
<P>
The 36 banned fans have been told to report to police stations
prior to England games or surrender their passports until June 25.

<P>
WELLINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Wellington Weightlifter Olivia
Baker has been chosen for the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Baker and Aucklander Nigel Avery will fill New Zealand's two
weightlifting spots in Sydney, the Dominion reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wellington-based newspaper, the 21-year-old
Baker will compete in the 75kg-plus class, with her personal best
combined total of 225kg for the clean and jerk (125kg) and snatch
(100kg).
</P>
<P>
Baker and Avery qualified New Zealand for the two olympic spots
at last month's Oceania and Commonwealth championships where Baker
pocketed both women's gold medals.
</P>
<P>
She set a world record in the clean and jerk at the 1997 world
junior championships in Cape town.
</P>
<P>
Baker's personal best is still 55kg off the leading Chinese and
Polish lifters who are up around the 280kg mark.
</P>
<P>
"My aims for the Olympics are to set personal bests and
hopefully a place in the top 10," Baker said.

<P>
PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten came from
behind to eliminate Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero 7-5, 4-6, 2-6, 6-4,
6-3 to enter his second French Open final on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fifth seed needed three hours 38 minutes to defeat his
Spaniard rival. He will take on Swedish third seed Magnus Norman,
who earlier edged Franco Squillari of Argentina 6-1, 6-4, 6-3, in
the final.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero, the 16th seed playing in his first French Open,
displayed tremendous power and precision to move two sets to one
ahead and win a break in the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
But Kuerten, 1997 champion here, clawed his way back with some
brave baseline rallying on big points.

KUWAIT CITY, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-
Ahmed Al-Sabah ordered on Saturday a three-day official mourning on
the death of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, during which the
national flags will fly at half mast.
</P>
<P>
An Emiri statement broadcast on Kuwait Television (KTV) said
President Assad is "well known for his wisdom, patience, shrewdness
and far-sightedness."
</P>
<P>
"During these painful moments Kuwait remembers very well the
stand extended by the Syrian people during the Iraqi invasion and
occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Kuwait is fully confident that the Syrian people

<HEADLINE> Woman NGOs in Iran Protest U.S. Fingerprinting Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Several non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) for Iranian women on Saturday lodged a protest
to the U.S. move to fingerprint members of an Iranian NGO
delegation to the "Women 2000" international conference in New
York.
</P>
<P>
A protesting statement was released by the Community of Islamic
Revolutionary Women, the Association of Women Following Ahl-ul-Bait
(Prophet Mohammad's Household) and the Association of Women Loving
Peace and Justice, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is an independent world body and no restriction should
be imposed on its guests, the statement said, adding that members
of the Iranian NGOs, who were heading New York to attend the
meeting, had both officially been invited by the U.N. and held
valid and legal U.S. visas.
</P>
<P>
Seven members of the Iranian delegation refused to enter the U.
S. for the conference when they were required to undergo a
fingerprinting procedure at the New York airport.
</P>
<P>
But an Iranian government delegation, headed by Zahra Shojaie,
presidential advisor and head of the Center for Women's Activities,
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,250 representatives of NGOs from countries around the
world attended the five-day meeting held in the U.N. headquarters
from June 5.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian NGOs called on the Majlis (Parliament) to devise
befitting laws on international relations to confront "the blatant
insult of the U.S. rude statesmen to Iranian nation".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of women in charge of cultural affairs,
students and theological students in the holy city Qom also issued
a statement, calling on international organizations, which claim to
defend rights of all human beings, to press the U.S. government to
compensate for the financial and spiritual damages inflicted on the
Iranian delegation.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi last week
also criticized the U.S. move, saying that the U.S. immigration
measure was a clear contradiction of its declared goodwill
intentions toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
Since the visas of the Iranian nationals were issued through the
United Nations, such a measure was an insult to the U.N.,
particularly to the U.N.-sponsored "Women 2000" meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. severed diplomatic relations in 1980 after
Iranian radical students took over the U.S. embassy and held its
staff members as hostages for 444 days at the heyday of the 1979
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Since moderate President Mohammad Khatami took office in 1997,
officials of the two countries have softened their hostile tones
toward each other and expressed their willingness to improve
unofficial contacts and exchanges.

LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Saturday paid tribute to late Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and
urged all involved in the Middle East peace process to redouble
their efforts to find a settlement.
</P>
<P>
"President Assad was a figure of stability in the Middle East
and much respected in the Arab world and beyond," Blair said in a
statement released by his Downing Street office.
</P>
<P>
"Although I never had the chance to meet him we regularly
exchanged messages about the Middle East peace process in which he
was a crucial player. He will be badly missed," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Honduras To Ask OAS Funds for Lawsuit Against Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That OAS fund "could mean an important relief" for Honduras,
whose resources are mainly directed to reconstruction, said
Foreign Minister Roberto Flores Bermudez.
</P>
<P>
The OAS created the fund, to be fed by voluntary contributions,
to finance the mechanisms of peaceful solution to the conflicts
among its member countries.
</P>
<P>
Honduras will start consultations to use the fund and partially
finance the new lawsuit against Nicaragua in The Hague (Holland),
said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua filed a lawsuit against Honduras to delimit the
border in the Caribbean Sea, a conflict that was latent, but
reemerged after the ratification by Honduran of a treaty with
Colombia, considered unfriendly by Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The Hague International Court sources said this week that the
trial could last four to five years.
</P>
<P>
The maritime conflict began with a commercial dispute because
Nicaragua has been collecting for six months a 35 percent customs
tariff on Honduran and Colombian goods in retaliation for the
treaty ratification.
</P>
<P>
This is the second lawsuit Honduras and Nicaragua are disputing
in The Hague, which ratified in 1960 a decision of King Alfonso
XIII of Spain, who fixed the border on land between the two
countries in 1906.

</P>
<P>
The expert said that Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and

alone as countries.

"The five ought to unite to have a single voice in regional
trade negotiations, and the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA)
arrival, in which we must negotiate with the United States, Canada,

He said that to accelerate the real integration of the Andean
countries the political will of their respective governments is

</P>
<P>
"It is necessary that the political will of the presidents
elected by their peoples will assert itself before the obstacles
that emerge every day to torpedo and blackmail the Andean
integration process," he said.

Herrera also suggested that the CAN should eliminate the

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Warns of Crisis Over Policing Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army, warned Saturday that there is a crisis
looming over the future of policing in Northern Ireland which
could have the potential to unravel the peace process.
</P>
<P>
It said the Policing Bill, which passed its second reading in
the House of Commons this week, was unacceptable and needed to be
amended.
</P>
<P>
The bill followed the publication of a report by the
Independent Commission on Policing headed by European Union
Commissioner Chris Patten last September.
</P>
<P>
Both sides of the community in Northern Ireland have their
concerns about it - unionists think it goes too far, and
nationalists argue that it is a dilution of the Patten
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
There were 75 changes that needed to be made to the bill to get
it back in line with the Patten Report proposals for a new
policing service for Northern Ireland, said the party.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said Northern Ireland Secretary
of State Peter Mandelson had a "huge distance" to cover if he was
to implement the Patten report.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Saturday in Dublin where he was attending a party
executive meeting, he said: "I am not persuaded at all by the
protestations of the British Government and Peter Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
"They have moved a huge distance away from the Patten
recommendations and they still have a huge distance to cover to
get back to them," he added.
</P>
<P>
After the Bill passed its Second Reading in the House of
Commons this week, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern flew to
London this week for private talks with Tony Blair, then flew
right back to Dublin.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Says Ruling Party to Decide his Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said on Saturday he will only retire from power once the national
congress of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-patriotic
Front (Zanu-pf) votes him out.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told his party's supporters in Marondera of east
Zimbabwe that some former parliamentarians were wasting their
time calling for him to leave office.
</P>
<P>
"Some people in parliament want Mugabe to be removed from
power," he said. "They forget that they had a job to represent
the interest of their people."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said party members elected to parliament should not use
that platform to criticise him and the party.
</P>
<P>
"I will only get out of power if the congress decides," he
said. "If the congress votes us out, well we will go," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, 76, has in the last few years downplayed speculation
that he would leave office after the 2000 parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
He has been in power since the Southern African nation of 12.5
million people gained its independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe urged party candidates to work hard to develop their
constituencies once elected into parliament.

<P>
HARARE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Saturday said his government would seriously consider establishing
a senate in the next parliament following its elections scheduled
for June 24-25.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the supporters of the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union- Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) in Marondera of east
Zimbabwe, Mugabe said the government was mulling over setting up a
senate although this was rejected in the February referendum to
choose a new constitution for Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said this while criticising independent candidates who had
defected from his party to stand alone in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
"There is no independent Zanu-pf candidate," he said, adding
that " Anyone who wants to run as an independent is automatically
out as a member of our party. Win or lose, they will never be
allowed back into the party."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is on a nationwide campaign tour, said his party
would never allow individualism to tear apart Zanu-pf which has
been in power since independence in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Over 13,000 Mozambicans Still in Gaza Accommodation Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 13,548 homeless people
by the February floods in the southern Mozambican Province of Gaza
are still living in government-run accommodation centres, as the
local authorities face difficulties in moving them to resettlement
areas.
</P>
<P>
Gaza Provincial Governor Eugenio Numaio said Saturday that a
shortage of tents is one of the main problems delaying
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts are under way to obtain more tents to
provide provisional accommodation in resettlement areas while
people are building their definitive new homes.
</P>
<P>
Despite these difficulties, Numaio was confident that
resettlement is going well. He pointed out that the vast majority
- over 90 per cent - of the 248,193 people who were displaced by
the floods have already resettled.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the floods crisis, there were 33 accommodation
centres in Gaza. Now only 13 centers are still in operation. A
total of 6,000 people still living there are from Chokwe, the
worst-hit district in the province.
</P>
<P>
Numaio said work is now under way to build about 2,300 houses
in Chokwe and in the provincial capital Xia-Xia for the speedy
relief of these families.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government, Rebels Ask International Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the government
and of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) concurred
Saturday in the need of having the international community
cooperate in the peace process of this country.
</P>
<P>
Government delegate Favio Valencia Cossio and FARC leader Raul
Reyes are the main actors in the International Conference on "The
peace process in Colombia," going on in the Alcala de Henares
municipality.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said that "international assistance must not have a
military character, because that would be intervention, more war.
The real assistance is more resources to solve the problems of the
people."
</P>
<P>
The meeting sponsored by the Organization of Solidarity with
the Peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America (OSPAAAL), an
independent entity, began this Saturday and will end Sunday in
Alcala de Henares, 30 kilometers east of Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Valencia agreed with the guerrilla leader that "international
cooperation must come simultaneously with the process of peace,
even as observers of the agreements we may arrive at, but without
intervening."
</P>
<P>
Both leaders said that the solution for Colombia is the table
of talks set by the government and the guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
The government representative said that the solution does not
only goes through the resolution of the armed conflict, but also
through "overcoming the violence caused by various sectors,
because we must remember that 32,000 homicides are committed in
Colombia every year."
</P>
<P>
Valencia described drug trafficking as "the main enemy of peace
in Colombia."
</P>
<P>
He said that "drug trafficking is an international crime and we
ask collaboration not as a gift, but as an alliance to combat the
worst scourge of humanity."
</P>
<P>
This is the first conference in which government and guerrilla
publicly expose their plans, backed by many representatives of the
Colombian civil society and European organizations.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Spain to Boost Collaboration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Giuliano Amato and
his Spanish counterpart Jose' Maria Aznar closed their two-day
summit in Italy's southern city of Naples expressing common
satisfaction over the state of bilateral relations, voicing their
readiness to boost both collaboration and cooperation and agreeing
that this summit, the sixth since 1995, was more "fruitful" than
the others.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing joint press conference, Amato said the
summit was "very satisfying" and allowed for a "convergence of
views on concrete issues and specific questions".
</P>
<P>
"We have common positions," the Italian premier explained, "on
the economy, structural reforms, liberalization and reinforcing
the euro".
</P>
<P>
After recalling that progress was made on a number of more
technical European questions, including bolstering cooperation in
the Inter-Governmental Conference, Amato said that he and Aznar
also agreed on questions related to European defense, including
the creation of a professional army.
</P>
<P>
Another area where Italy and Spain agreed to push in a joint
effort was Euro- Mediterranean dialogue which they both viewed as
of key importance in order to "control the flow of unauthorized
migration".
</P>
<P>
Looking at the immigration question, Aznar told the press the
initiative we have take on immigration was certainly a positive
one also in view of the fact that Spain and Italy represent the
external borders of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Aznar also gave his remedy to combating unemployment, which he
said was "reinforcing political stability, guaranteeing economic
stability and pushing through polices for reform, liberalization
and economic change".
</P>
<P>
By using this method, he explained, Spain "created 700,000 new
jobs in 1999 and another 500,000 in 2000. In all 1,200, thanks to
an economy which expands by 4 percent a year and will allow us to
achieve near full employment in the future".

<HEADLINE> Campaign Against Sex Tourism To Start in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Tourism Institute (
ICT) chairman Walter Niehaus announced Saturday the start in a
short time of an international campaign against sex tourism and
especially against children exploitation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The announcement will be the basis of the campaign to be
publicized in magazines, the Internet, and specialized media in
the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will last four months in magazines, with a
possible continuation for four more, while it will be available in
the Internet longer in the pages related to Costa Rica, tourism,
prostitution, and childhood, said Niehaus.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican authorities are worried by the campaigns
abroad that offer sex tourism in this country.
</P>
<P>
Official information says that a suspect of German nationality
was detained in a San Jose hotel when he was promoting a business
of "feminine escorts" in the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The investigation made by the Judicial Investigation
Organization (OIJ) of Costa Rica confirmed, that the German, 45
years old, worked with more than 60 women, from models to school
girls, offering "sex tourism."
</P>
<P>
 Children's rights activists say foreigners, especially
Americans,come to Costa Rica increasingly in search of sex with
children.
</P>
<P>
 Adult prostitution is legal in Costa Rica, and up until last
year, it also wasn't a crime to pay a child for sex. Now an adult
who pays for sex with a child can face two to 10 years in prison
for child abuse.

<HEADLINE> Seismic Swarms Observed in Nicaraguan Volcano Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the seisms were located in a small zone on the southern
slope of the 1,282 meters above sea level volcano, said INETER.
</P>
<P>
The seisms were felt in the Nicaraguan Electricity Company (
ENEL) geothermal plant, that operates in the place, said the
communique.
</P>
<P>
The INETER said that Friday at 13:00 a continuous seismic
tremor was observed in the volcano, which indicates that the
seismic activity is not only caused by movements of the tectonic
faults, but that it is a volcanic process.
</P>
<P>
Similar swarms were observed in August of 1999, the stronger of
them with a 4.1 degree intensity on the Richter scale, which made
authorities evacuate some 500 residents of nearby communities.

economic war that has not ceased for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
This measure not only damages Cuba, but also the United States,
not because of the amount of what they will come to buy or not,
but because of the degree of irrationality it has, he said.

For this, any step forward is important, said the Cuban leader.
