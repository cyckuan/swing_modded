<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam granted licences to 211
foreign-invested projects with a combined registered capital of
2.15 billion U.S. dollars in the first six months of this year,
the Vietnam News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This brings the total number of licensed projects to 1,729 with
a combined registered capital of 27.89 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The actual amount of capital used by foreign-invested
enterprises in the first half of the year reached 1.6 billion
dollars, a 62 percent increase compared with the same period last
year, bringing total utilized capital to 10.061 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of the year, foreign-funded enterprises
excluding oil and gas saw their exports rise 31 percent to 460
million dollars over the first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of Vietnamese partners in foreign joint
ventures are state-owned businesses. They account for 96 percent
of projects and 99 percent of the invested capital.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 companies from over 50 countries and regions
have invested in Vietnam, providing jobs for 200,000 people and

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Omani Sultan Hold Talks in Red Sea Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
started talks with Sultan Qaboos Ben Said of Oman today on the
deadlocked Mideast peace process in the Red Sea resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held the first session of talks at Sharm
el-Sheikh airport upon the arrival of Sultan Qaboos, before they
drove 35 kilometers to the natural reserve of Ras Mohammed, home
to the rarest coral reefs in the world.
</P>
<P>
"They reviewed the latest Mideast developments, the results of
contacts held by Egypt with different parties concerned, and other
Arab issues," said Minister of Information Safwat Sherif after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions are also expected to focus on Egypt's
spearheading bids to establish a common Arab market, according to
today's Egyptian Gazette.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Oman are two members of the Damascus Declaration
whose foreign ministers ended on Thursday discussions at the
Syrian Mediterranean resort of Latakia, agreeing to set up a
common market among the eight signatories to the pact.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes within the context of constant meetings between
the Egyptian and Omani leaderships to boost distinguished ties
between the two countries, the English daily said.
</P>
<P>
Oman was the only Arab Gulf country that kept ties with Egypt
when other Arab states severed diplomatic relations with Cairo in
protest against its 1979 peace pact with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks collapsed since March when
Israel started building a new neighborhood for Jews in East
Jerusalem, where Palestinians want as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and then annexed it. The annexation has not been recognized by
most nations.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian and U.S. initiatives have failed to bring the two
sides back to the negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Send Warplanes to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada will send six fighter jets
to join the NATO squadrons enforcing the "no-fly" zone over
Bosnia, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time that Canada sends warplanes to
operate in the region.
</P>
<P>
Six CF-18 fighters and up to 125 personnel will move to a base
at Aviano, Italy in mid-August to start flying patrols over Bosnia
as part of the NATO force.
</P>
<P>
"The deployment of Canadian Forces CF-18s will contribute to
the operational capability of NATO's integrated air force and the
safety of troops on the ground, including Canadians," said Defense
Minister Art Eggleton.
</P>
<P>
"Canada has consistently been a strong advocate of
international security and our participation in this mission is
evidence of our commitment to continued peace in the region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Canada already has a reinforced infantry battalion of about
1,200 troops on the ground in Bosnia, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Business as Usual for The New SAR, Says HSBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Prospects for the Hongkong's
Special Administrative Region's (SAR) economy look bright given
rapid growth in both the territory and China, said HSBC today.
</P>
<P>
In an article entitled "Business As Usual For The New SAR", its
Global Markets Weekly said: "Officials from both mainland China and
the territory have repeatedly noted that the current system will
be preserved through 1997 and beyond," so Hongkong's economy's
functioning will "remain the same".
</P>
<P>
The Weekly said, a cornerstone in the territory's financial
system is the linked exchange rate system that was installed in
1983 amid a confidence crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since then, "it has functioned exceptionally well, proving
itself to be able to weather severe financial turmoil," it added.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) recently reiterated that the
HKD will remain a foreign currency in China after July 1st.
Similarly, the Chinese yuan will trade as a foreign currency in
the Hongkong's SAR, the Weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining this will depend partly on the ability of the
Hongkong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to carry out monetary policies
independently, it added.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its confidence in HKMA, HSBC said: "A recent vote of
confidence in the HKMA's ongoing independence was the invitation
for it to become a member of the Bank for International
Settlements, alongside the PBOC."
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hongkong's huge foreign reserves, which were 66.6
billion US dollars as of end-May, will help fend off any
speculative attack on the HKD, the Weekly said.

<HEADLINE> WFP Resolves Disputes with Contractors in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) today paid more than 200,000 U.S. Dollars for
contract termination severance to eight local subcontractors
companies.
</P>
<P>
The payment of 239,747 Dollars was on a compromise deal made
by WFP with the contractors in a bid to settle a long standing
dispute which hampered the relief operation of WFP in Mogadishu,
according to Hugh Hanley, head of WFP's Administration Finance
Section.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference after handing out the money to the eight
local off-loading and transport companies in North Mogadishu
today, Hanley said his agency will now be capable of running its
humanitarian operations which concentrate on food deliveries to
its target areas.
</P>
<P>
Hanley further said the money was not paid under certain legal
systems, but instead paid on negotiation bases with the
subcontractors of WFP's main contractor.
</P>
<P>
The main contractor, Giancarlo Morochino, is an Italian
businessman who handles the off-loading, clearance and storage
facilities for WFP. And he has given subcontracts to these eight
local contractors in facilitating these operations.
</P>
<P>
WFP also has similar problems relating to job terminations and
unpaid wages in South Mogadishu. Hundreds of teachers
demonstrated in front of WFP's main gates in South Mogadishu last
month.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between WFP and the local contractors has resulted
in the disruption of the on-going food aid off-loading at El-Ma,
a natural port, the hijacking of three food convoys early this
month in North Mogadishu and a failed abduction attempt against
WFP personnel.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Proposes to Set up Joint Bank with Tunisia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam
Majali said today that Jordan and Tunisia may establish a joint
bank to facilitate trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Majali made the remarks upon his return to Amman this evening
from a three-day official visit to Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Majali said that he made the proposal to the Tunisian leaders
when he had talks with them during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Tunisia tentatively agreed in May to create a
common free trade zone in Jordan and both sides have signed an
accord which provides for a special committee to study the
creation of the free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The special committee is scheduled to meet in Tunis for the
purpose this month, according to local press.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Amman this evening, the prime minister
also said that Jordanian-Tunisian relations are "strong" at all
levels.
</P>
<P>
Majali said that he delivered a message from king Hussein
to Tunisian President Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali and disclosed
that the king will visit Tunisia soon.
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, he also held talks with
Tunisian leaders on Arab relations and the stalled Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today at a press conference in Tunis before ending his
visit, Majali noted that Jordan will attend the Middle East and
North Africa Economic Summit due to be held in Qatar in November.
</P>
<P>
By attending the summit, he said, all the parties in the
region will be able to promote their rights, particularly on
economic and refugee issues.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have threatened to boycott the conference,
the third since the Madrid Middle East peace conference in 1991,
because of Israeli participation. They argued that the Arab
countries should boycott the meeting as Israel is following its
hardline policy which has stalled the Middle East peace march.

<HEADLINE> Israeli High-tech Industries Report Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- There has been a slowdown of
growth in the high-tech industry in Israel for the first time in
five years, according to a report of the Israel Export Institute
(IEI).
</P>
<P>
A survey of activities of industrial companies in the economy
published earlier this month by Dun and Bradstreet showed the
trend.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech industry, comprising electronics, programming and
trade in software and hardware, grew by 26 percent in 1996
compared to 32 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
For the past 10 years the share of high-tech industry in
general industrial activity has been increasing steadily. The
high-tech has been Israel's main branch of exports, accounting
for almost 60 percent of Israel's industrial exports.
</P>
<P>
The industry, whose products are mostly destined for export,
has been hit by the high rates of interest in the Israeli
banks. These high rates have forced companies in the Israeli
high-tech industry to become more efficient in order to maintain
high profitability and competitive ability. However, some
companies have recorded a drop in profitability and reduced
competitiveness, particularly against companies from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the drop in growth is the lack of manpower
and the competition within the industry in Israel for
professionals, particularly in the field of software and
electronical engineering. In Israel, there is reportedly a shortage
of between 1,000 and 2,000 programmers and engineers. The
flourishing local start-up branch attracts many staff, and large
companies are today competing with start-up companies for
university graduates. This fact has naturally led to significant
wage rises, which affect the competitiveness of companies to a
certain extent.
</P>
<P>
During 1996 a number of attempts were made to increase the
supply of staff in the industry, both through retraining courses
and by increasing the number of training centers and the capacity
of universities. These steps are likely to reduce the shortage of
staff in the long run, but no short term answer has been found for
the huge demand for workers in high-tech industry.

ALGIERS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Twenty two people have been killed
near the city of Medea, about 90 kilometers south of the capital
of Algiers as terrorists actions were resumed in the country after
a short period of tranquility.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here said today that the killing was carried
out yesterday by a group of scores of terrorists equipped with
fire arms.
</P>
<P>
The people being attacked responded by firing shotguns at the
terrorists and managed to kill one of them, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
A bomb planted in a small passenger bus went off some 20
kilometers away from Medea Thursday morning, leaving eight people
dead and 20 others injured.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the bomb was laid inside the bus by
a woman who got off the bus minutes before the bomb blasted.
</P>
<P>
Two bombs exploded at a railway station in the same area
injuring 46 people and damaging several train carriages.
</P>
<P>
Some 60,000 people have been killed and 2 billion U.S. dollars
of material losses inflicted as a result of terrorist activities
in Algeria over the last five years.

<HEADLINE> Clock-Watchers Crowd Onto Tiananmen Square </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- As it ticks down to zero, the huge
countdown clock in Tiananmen Square measuring the moments until
Hong Kong's return is attracting an ever-growing crowd of
spectators.
</P>
<P>
Today, hundreds of thousands of Beijing residents and other
visitors flocked to the clock, mounted on a large white board
against the stone pillars of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution
and the Museum of Chinese History, located on the east side of the
world's largest square.
</P>
<P>
The clock-watchers are expressing their feelings over the
imminent return of Hong Kong in many ways: many wave red paper
miniatures of the Chinese national flag and the flag of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region. Savvy peddlers throughout the
square have hiked up the price of a pair of flags from three yuan
to ten.
</P>
<P>
One young police officer says that the crowd, which has been
huge all week, has swelled noticeably every day. "We are expecting
the largest group today, especially this evening," he says.
</P>
<P>
And like Mickey Mouse in Disneyland, everybody wants their
picture taken near the clock. But photography among the multitudes
requires nimble fingers and saintly patience.
</P>
<P>
Two-year-old Xie Yuqing, balanced on her father's shoulders, is
asked again and again to wave her flags and smile at Mom with the
camera, but they are repeatedly interrupted by passersby who walk
into the view. Finally, Xie's exasperated mother clicks a decent
shot.
</P>
<P>
A tourist from Hong Kong says she's lucky to be in Beijing at
this historic time. "Seeing such a massive celebration in Beijing,
I feel so proud to be a Chinese," says Wong Wai Ting.
</P>
<P>
The clock has been in its place on the square for more than 900
days. It will stop at midnight on June 30, when all its digits
turn to zero. It is estimated that in the more than two years that
have passed, over 10 million people have come to see it.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese are concerned about the clock's future. Beijing
retiree Xu Yingkui, who visited Tiananmen Square today, said, "I
don't know how they will deal with it, but I do hope it will be
kept in a museum."
</P>
<P>
It will be -- but not in the grand Museum of Chinese History
just behind it: The Chinese government has decided to move it to a
spot at the foot of the Great Wall in the northern suburbs of
Beijing, where it will stand as a symbol of China's long journey
toward reunification.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- With less than 30 hours away
before Hong Kong's return to China, political dignitaries from
various countries, regions and organizations are arriving here to
attend the handover ceremony, making the Kai Tak Airport, already
the busiest in the world, even busier.
</P>
<P>
People are walking in and out of the reserved lounge for
distinguished guests on the second floor. With planes landing
continuously, guests are invited to have a rest there, where they
go through relevant procedures.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of safety, the glass door of the lounge is tightly
closed. A women supervisor of the lounge told reporters on the
other side of the door that the lounge has been fully occupied and
no reporter is allowed in and no interview is permitted.
</P>
<P>
Today and tomorrow, some 800 foreign guests are expected to
arrive in Hong Kong to attend the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Many reporters are at the airport to cover the arrival of these
guests. They often have to wait for two or three hours at the
exit, and after getting the news, they rush out of the airport and
go back by various transportation means to write their stories.
</P>
<P>
The police officers responsible for the security of the airport
are on high alert. A police officer, identified himself as Li,
said that with the many passengers and political dignitaries
arriving these days, the police shoulder a great responsibility.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the safety of the airport and passengers, the police
have been reinforced, he said.
</P>
<P>
As usual, there are large numbers of passengers coming to Hong
Kong. A Mr. He, a U.S. university teacher, came to Hong Kong with

<HEADLINE> UAE Underlines Commitment to Opec Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 29 (Xinhua)-- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
will continue to commit itself to its oil production quota
awarded by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(Opec), a senior UAE official has said.
</P>
<P>
"The UAE is always working to support Opec policies in
maintaining agreed quotas and prices," said UAE Minister of
Petroleum and Mineral Resources Obeid bin Saif al Nasir, quoted
by UAE's Wam news agency today.
</P>
<P>
He said the UAE would honor its assigned quota of some 2.2
million barrels per day (bpd), hoping world crude prices would
rise in light of all Opec members' adherence to their own assigned
quotas.
</P>
<P>
Nasir returned to the UAE after attending an Opec
ministerial meeting in Vienna last week.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed to freeze the current Opec production
ceiling of 25.03 million bpd for another six months until
November and maintain assigned quotas of all members.
</P>
<P>
Opec's output, with the exception of Iraq's was set in
September 1993. But the actual output now is running at nearly
27 million bpd because many members are known to have been
exceeding their quotas.
</P>
<P>
This has greatly damaged crude prices which currently hover
around 19 U.S. dollars a barrel, down sharply from 25 dollars in
late 1996.

<HEADLINE> Chinese in California Celebrate HK's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 20,000 Chinese
Americans gathered in a college stadium here today to celebrate
the return of Hong Kong to China at midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
The largest ever Chinese gathering in the United States, named
"Welcome Home, Hong Kong Spectacular," was jointly sponsored by
more than 100 associations and guilds in southern California to
mark the end of more than 150 years of British colonial rule of
the island.
</P>
<P>
An congratulatory message to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Li Peng was read out at the rally, which said Hong Kong's
return marks "an end to the humiliations the Chinese nation
suffered for more than a century."
</P>
<P>
In another message to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, Tung Chee-hwa, and his six million
fellow residents of Hong Kong, the organizer said they wish Hong
Kong "long-term prosperity" and the island "to shine more
brilliantly."
</P>
<P>
Consul General of the Chinese Consulate General in Los Angeles,
Feng Shusen, and the city's mayor Richard Riordan addressed the
crowd. Feng said that the Chinese government and people are
confident and capable of guaranteeing Hong Kong's long-term
stability, and creating a more prosperous Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Riordan emphasized Los Angeles' role in the U.S. ties with Hong
Kong, the rest of China and the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
The event, beginning with five skydivers landing in the
stadium's field amid colorful smokes, also attracted hundreds of
local Americans.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1997 white pigeons were freed, followed by a parade
of floral floats and marching bands representing 80 organizations.
</P>
<P>
Symphonic music, chorus, dances, martial arts and the
performance of a local concert band enlivened the biggest Chinese
rally in southern California, where more than 800,000 Chinese live.
</P>
<P>
President of the United Chinese Women Organization of USA,
Geogiana Lee, companied by her elder daughter, took part in the
parade. "I want my children, who speak little Chinese, to learn
some history of China from the event," she said.
</P>
<P>
A 30-minute fireworks display brought the spectacular to a
climax.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao Celebrates HK's Return to Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Macao residents today staged
artistic performances and exhibitions, planted trees and held
races to celebrate the return of Hong Kong to the motherland,
which was slated for July 1.
</P>
<P>
Celebration activities in Macao have increased remarkably over
the past weeks as the time draws near July 1. Almost all
grassroots organizations and bodies of different industries have
held parties, discussions, singing and dancing galas and other
forms of activities to mark the historic event.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Women's Federation staged a performance of
celebration early in the morning today. More than 100 women and
children sang, danced, recited poems, chorused and staged a
fashion show.
</P>
<P>
"The performance is to express their love for their motherland
and their happiness with the return of Hong Kong to China," said
Lo Pak Sam, president of the federation. "It is a big event not
only for Hong Kongers, but also for us in Macao."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large exhibition organized by 14 local art
organizations began here today. Organizers said that the 121
pieces of calligraphic works and paintings on display eulogize the
concept of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to express our heartfelt wishes for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) through our paintings," said
Luk Cheung, head of the organizing committee in an opening address
at the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the exhibition began, thousands of Macao workers,
students and ordinary citizens started a race in the name of
celebration. Wearing T-shirts marked with "Celebrate Hong Kong's
Return," they ran about 2,000 meters in the street.
</P>
<P>
Chinese civil servants planted trees today, while many sports
and education organizations planned to stage celebration galas
tonight.
</P>
<P>
Major buildings and streets in Macao have been lit up at night
and decorated with red lanterns and banners. The celebration is
expected to come to a climax on June 30 and July 1.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Beats France in Penalty Shoot-out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay advanced to the
semi-finals of the world youth football championship after beating
France 7-6 in a penalty shoot-out here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
France opened the scoring through David Trezeguet's 26th minute
goal, but Nicolas Olivera tied the score in the 67th minute.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay's goalkeeper Gustavo Munua saved a penalty from Nicolas
Anelka to take his team into the last four, where they will meet
either Ghana or Japan, who play later on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
France began the shoot-out badly when goalkeeper Mickael
Landreau's kick was saved by Munua. But Uruguay's second shot by
Walter Coelho then hit the bar.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay's successful shooters were Marcelo Zalayeta, Mario
Regueiro, Pablo Garcia, Nicolas Olivera, Christian Callejas,
Martin Fernandez and Carlos Diaz.
</P>
<P>
For France, Trezeguet, Kodjo Afanou, Medhi Leroy, Cedric
Mouret, Jean Joures and Mikael Silvestre scored.
</P>
<P>
The defeat marred a personal triumph for Trezeguet, who scored
his sixth goal to take second place behind Brazil's Adailton
Martins (10) in the list of goal scorers.
</P>
<P>
Both players, however, will not have a chance to increase the
tally as Brazil crashed to a 2-0 defeat against defending
champions Argentina earlier on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Legislature Discusses Laws on Higher Education, Flood Control (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress (NPC) broke into groups today to
review draft laws on higher education and flood control.
</P>
<P>
Most of the participants in the ongoing 26th session of the NPC
Standing Committee deemed it necessary to have a law to ensure a
healthy development of higher education and standardize the ways
of higher education.
</P>
<P>
However, some insisted that China already has enough
education laws, such as those on teachers, general education and
compulsory education. They felt that much of the content of the
draft law now being studied is identical to that in the existing
law on education, which went into effect in September, 1995. They
proposed to make the draft law a chapter of the existing law of
education.
</P>
<P>
Committee members Xie Songkai and Cai Cheng said that for the
most part the draft law is good, as it reflects the current status
of China's advanced education undertakings and clearly defines the
responsibilities of the governments, schools and society regarding
higher learning.
</P>
<P>
They believed that, after careful deliberation, the law, the
first of its kind in the country, will play an important role
in the development of China's higher education.
</P>
<P>
But Hao Yicun and Dong Ruifang deemed that the draft law lacks
the elements of reform. They held that China's reform in higher
education has not kept pace with the developing market economy,
and is short of regulations and norms in curricula, training and
teacher qualifications as well as their rights and interests.

<HEADLINE> Legislature Discusses Laws on Higher Education, Flood Control (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They said that many teachers have taken to second jobs in their
sparetime, and the teaching profession has lost its attraction in
China. They also thought that the draft law sets a lower standard
for physical and moral education.
</P>
<P>
Dong Naifang said that the making of a higher education law
must aim high and must embody the strategy of invigorating the
nation by developing science and education.
</P>
<P>
Many members of NPC Standing Committee expressed their
dissatisfaction with the State investment in higher
education. "Universities and colleges now can hardly make ends
meet, and they have to make money by all possible means in order
to maintain their routine operation," said Xu Jialu, member of the
Sub-Committee for Education, Science, Culture and Health of the
NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Xu suggested the draft law on higher education should include
concrete stipulations for the State's investment in the field.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the draft law on flood control, participants
generally believed that it is a good law, since flood control has
a direct bearing on the safety of people and property.
</P>
<P>
They were virtually unanimous that it is very important to
enact such a law as many parts of the country suffer from flooding
every year.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhenhui, vice-chairman of the Environment and Resources
Protection Sub-Committee of the NPC Standing Committee, said that
the draft law on flood control should be made one of the basic laws
concerning China's water conservation effort, like the Water Law
and the Law of Conservation of Soil and Water.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his views on the fight against floods and drought
and on comprehensive control of water pollution, the utilization
of water resources and the legal responsibilities of flood
control.

<HEADLINE> Higher Education Sticks to Party Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The draft law on higher education
that is currently being debated by the national legislature
stresses that colleges and universities should cultivate personnel
who are "both socialist-minded and vocationally proficient."
</P>
<P>
Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of the State Education
Commission, told the ongoing 26th session of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress that higher education
must be guided by Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong thought and the
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and
should be under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and
"stick to socialism."
</P>
<P>
"The kind of personnel our universities produce has a great
bearing not only on our country's modernization process, but also
on its long-term stability," Zhu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The draft law encourages non-governmental organizations to
launch higher education institutes which will supplement State-run
universities and colleges, but stresses that starting such
institutes should serve national and public interest, and not be
driven by profit-making.
</P>
<P>
The State Council gives macro guidance to higher education
while local governments supervise colleges and universities under
their jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
China currently has 2,170 higher education institutes, which
had a total of 5.67 million students in 1996.
</P>
<P>
To make higher education more accessible to females, the
handicapped and students from ethnic minority areas and poor
families, the state will set up scholarships and financial aid
funds.
</P>
<P>
The draft law encourages business enterprises, social groups
and individuals to set up scholarships and funds.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the draft to have been deliberated
by the NPC Standing Committee, after the State Council approved it
in May.
</P>
<P>
Also under discussion at the ongoing session is the draft of a
flood control law.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Lindsay Davenport, Amanda Coetzer
and Conchita Martinez had a bad day as Wimbledon opened its gates
on the traditional rest day for only the second time in history.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the three women big names were upset by little-known
players respectively.
</P>
<P>
The fifth-seeded Davenport was ousted 7-5, 6-2 by Denisa
Chladkova, a Czech player ranked 57th in the world who had never
won a Grand Slam match before this tournament.
</P>
<P>
Coetzer, the No. 6 seed from South Africa, won only three games
in a 6-2, 6-1 loss to Canada's Patricia Hy-Boulais. Coetzer came
into the tournament with high hopes after reaching the semifinals of
the French Open last month.
</P>
<P>
Martinez, the 1994 champion who was seeded No. 10 this year,
continued in her deep slump as she tumbled to a 6-4, 6-2 defeat to
Helena Sukova. Martinez, who hasn't won a tournament in more than a
year, was the only former women's champion in the draw.
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Jana Novotna and No. 9 Mary Pierce also looked in
danger of possible upsets but managed to scrape into the third
round.
</P>
<P>
In other women's matches, eighth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario, No. 11 Mary Joe Fernandez and No. 12 Irina Spirlea beat
their rivals to move into the next round.
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Martina Hingis was scheduled for the second match on
Court 1 against Nicole Arendt.
</P>
<P>
In men's play, third-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov beat Javier
Sanchez 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the day's opening match. No. 9
Marcelo Rios, who'd never won a match here until this year, moved
into round three by beating Dennis van Scheppingen 6-2, 6-3, 6-7
(1-7), 7-6 (9-7).
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Richard Krajicek was scheduled for a late
match on Court 1 against David Rikl.
</P>
<P>
Organizers scheduled play on the middle Sunday in an attempt to
clear a backlog of matches caused by two complete rainouts during
the first week.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today strongly
condemned the anti-Islam acts carried out Saturday by Jewish
settlers in Hebron and called on the international community to
pressure the Jewish state to stop these acts.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Abdul Aziz
Dakhil Al-Dakhil said in a statement after a weekly cabinet
session that "Kuwait strongly condemns anti-Islam provocation and
calls on the international community to pressure the Israeli
authorities to stop these humiliating acts which targeted Islam
and Prophet Mohammed."
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers Saturday pasted anti-Muslim posters on about
20 storefronts near a Jewish settlement in the West Bank city of
Hebron tarnishing Prophet Mohammed as a pig.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Muslim acts led to Palestinian demonstrations in which
clashes flared between the protesters and Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Reports said at least two Palestinians were wounded by
Israeli soldiers' rubber bullets in the clashes.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran today once again voiced its
willingness of forging friendly, healthy and constructive
relations with the Persian Gulf littoral states.
</P>
<P>
The idea was expressed by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati while addressing the opening session of a regional
seminar here on Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is aimed at reviewing further promotion of
bilateral and regional as well as economic, political and cultural
relations between Iran and eight Persian Gulf littoral states.
</P>
<P>
Velayati outlined Iran's crucial and strategic status in the
world of Islam, according to a report of the official news agency
IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister called for collective efforts
and cooperation to maintain regional stability, security and
tranquility.
</P>
<P>
Iran's ambassadors and representatives to Persian Gulf
countries including Iraq, Yemen, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Bahrain are attending the
four-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Iranian authorities expressed welcome to the
joint statement of Damascus Declaration foreign ministers meeting
and termed it as a positive sign in relations between Iran and
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said that
readiness and interest of the Damascus Declaration states' foreign
ministers in improvement of friendly relations with Iran could
be considered as a positive sign.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said "such an issue would not only be in line with
expansion of cooperation among regional states, but would be the
sole way of guaranteeing security in the sensitive region of the
Persian Gulf and of helping promote international peace and
security."
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting of foreign ministers of Damascus Declaration
states, which include Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, ended Thursday in Syria.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement, the foreign ministers emphasized the
sovereignty of the UAE over the three Gulf islands in its dispute
with Iran, calling on both sides to enter into serious talks for a
peaceful solution to this issue.
</P>
<P>
Today, Major-General Mohsen Rezaee, Commander of the Islamic
Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), said that Iran is ready to sign
security and defense pacts with its southern Arab neighbors in a
bid to promote security in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We need security because we don't want our vital interests be
jeopardized. We have proved our good intentions." Rezaee said in
an interview with English daily Kayhan International.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Signs Deal for Economic Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has signed a memorandum
of understanding with the International Economic Forum to host
the fourth Middle East and North Africa economic conference in
its capital city of Doha, the official Qatari news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum was signed Saturday at a seminar organized by
Qatar's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which is being held in
Doha to pave the way for the conference due on November 16-18,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar focused on how Qatar can benefit from the
conference, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is expected to propose at the conference about 30 projects
requiring investment of around 3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Qatar hopes to invite some 2,500 delegates, including Israeli
businessmen, to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Syria was reported to have tried to assemble opposition to the
conference because of possible Israeli participation.
</P>
<P>
Syria boycotted the previous three conferences because it
believes that Israel should not deserve economic rewards from the
regional conference until it signs peace agreements with all its
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The previous three economic conferences were separately held
in Casablanca of Morocco in 1994, Amman of Jordan in 1995 and
Cairo of Egypt in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Qatar to Allow Majority Stakes by Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 29 (Xinhua)-- Qatar is expected to enact a
law soon allowing foreigners to own majority shares in local
projects and companies, a senior Qatari official said today.
</P>
<P>
"The draft law allows foreign entities and individuals to own
more than 51 percent in projects set up with local partners in
Qatar," the Qatari news agency quoted Youssef Hussein Kamal,
undersecretary of the Qatari Ministry of Finance, Economy and
Trade as saying.
</P>
<P>
The law also deals with incentive schemes and provides for
exemption of customs duties for five to 10 years for
projects set up in industrial zones, Kamal said at a seminar
organized by Qatar's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which is
being held in the Qatari capital of Doha.
</P>
<P>
The draft law has to be approved by the cabinet and the
Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa al Thani before it takes
effect, he said. But he did not give the exact date for the
approval.
</P>
<P>
The draft law came within the framework of Qatar's
preparations for hosting the fourth Middle East and North Africa
economic conference due to be held from November 16 to 18.
</P>
<P>
The first three economic conferences were separately convened
in the Moroccan city of Casablanca in 1994, in the Jordanian
capital of Amman in 1995 and the Egyptian capital of Cairo in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Qatar hopes to invite 2,500 delegates, including Israeli
businessmen, to the conference and it will propose some 30
projects requiring investment of 3 billion U.S. dollars during the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The existing law prohibits foreigners from holding more than
49 percent of stakes in a Qatari project or firm.
</P>
<P>
Kamal said the amended law would serve as an incentive for
foreign companies to invest more in the country and he asked
Qatari businessmen to scout out foreign partners with fund and
technical know-how to set up medium and small projects in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Condemns Anti-Islam Poster Found In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to dampen a
possible religious flareup, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu today condemned the anti-Islamic leaflet that appeared
in Hebron over the weekend, reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The leaflet showed Mohammed as a pig writing in the
Koran. The provocative drawing appeared at more than 20
Palestinian stores near the Jewish enclave of Beit Hadassah in
downtown Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Hassouneh, 60, who owns one of the shops, said: "I
came out at 7 o'clock in the morning, only to find the drawing
posted on my shop's door. It is a criminal act and humiliating
to the Islamic religion."
</P>
<P>
"They do not have a principle and even their religion does not
permit such violations against other religions," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a phone call to Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natshe, Netanyahu
described the incident as very grave. He said that the drawing
contradicts the respect which the Jewish people hold for Islam
and other religions.
</P>
<P>
Natshe promised to convey his remarks to the Palestinian
residents in the city.
</P>
<P>
Police said that a 25-year-old Jewish woman from Jerusalem,
detained for stoning a vehicle near the Machpela Cave in Hebron,
is suspected of distributing and posting the posters outside
Palestinian stores.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlers in Hebron also issued a statement
condemning the leaflets. But Palestinian residents believe that
the settlers have helped the woman.

<HEADLINE> PNA: Egypt, Among Only Mediators in Place Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat today hailed the sustained Egyptian efforts to salvage the
faltering Mideast peace process but deplored the absence of other
mediators.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview given this morning with the Egyptian
Voice of Arab radio from Jerusalem, Erekat said that the Egyptian
efforts have now become "the only ones made to patch up the
staggering peace process."
</P>
<P>
He characterized the Egyptian initiative at this crux as
seeking to remove reasons behind the current quagmire of the
Mideast peacemaking because of Israel's ground-breaking for a
Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) said recently that
Egyptian presidential political advisor Osama el-Baz will set out
for Tel Aviv early this week on a new round of shuttle tour in a
bid to narrow the gap between Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian and U.S. mediations have failed to bring the two
sides back to the negotiating table after a three-month freeze in
contacts while violence flared up anew in the occupied Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian public became furious as the U.S. Senate's
appropriation subcommittee decided ten days ago to withdraw aid
from Egypt on the grounds that it pursued what it called an
obstructionist policy in the regional peace-making.
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee removed allocations for Egypt totalling 2.1
billion U.S. dollars, while maintaining Israel's 3 billion
dollars grant and creating a 250-million-dollar fund for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has made it clear that it will not succumb to pressure
by foregin powers through aid. Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said
the decision would not affect Egypt's commitment to the peace
process and its efforts to salvage it.

<P>
SOFIA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to China has
become the major issue in the Bulgarian press in recent days with
major papers splashing whole-page stories about the event.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's most widely circulated daily newspaper, 24 Chasa
(Hours), today devoted a whole page to the history of Hong Kong
with the headline: "Britain: Farewell, Hong Kong!"
</P>
<P>
At midnight on June 30, Britain will lower its flag in Hong
Kong and the Chinese flag will fly over the richest island in the
world, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The "one Country, two Systems" concept put forward by late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping laid the foundation for Hong Kong's
smooth return to China, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor newspaper said Friday that the return of Hong Kong to
China after more than 150 years of British colonial rule is surely
the biggest and most brilliant event.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the agreement signed between Britain and
China on the question of Hong Kong in 1984 was one of the greatest
achievements of Deng.

Philippines, and to a vibrant global trade in general.
</P>
<P>
He said he is hopeful that the 1984 Sino-British joint
declaration on the question of Hong Kong and the "one country, two
systems" principle will be implemented faithfully.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the Philippines' close and
fruitful partnership with Hong Kong will continue to flourish
in trade, investments and people-to-people exchanges.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief: Libya Accepts Proposal on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary-General
Esmat Abdel Meguid said today that Libya has readily accepted
proposals by the Arab League and the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) to solve the Lockerbie crisis.
</P>
<P>
The AL and the OAU has proposed that the two Libyans, suspected
of involvement in the bombing of a Pan AM airliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in 1988, which killed 270 people, be tried by a justice
from Scotland in a third country other than in Britain and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian MENA news agency quoted the AL cheif as saying
that he had asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to persuade
the countries concerned with the Lockerbie crisis to accept the
proposals which he described as "fair" solutions to ending the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions against Tripoli for its refusal to
hand over the two Libyans to Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Mummar Gaddafi has suggested the two be tried
anywhere else than in the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Libya will not hand over the suspects (to Britain or the U.S.)
for fear that they will not stand a fair trial there, but it is
ready to hand over them to a neutral court," Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged strenuous Arab efforts to settle the crisis in order
to ease the suffering of the Libyan people as a result of the
five-year-old embargo.
</P>
<P>
Both the OAU and Al have been calling for a prompt lift of
international sanctions against Libya over the Lockerbie crisis
and aired support for Tripoli's overtures to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Libya-West crisis was discussed for the first time early
this month at the Harare OAU summit which called for lifting the
sanctions and taking temporary measures to help ease the
sufferings of the Libyan people.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, during his two-day visit to
the Libyan coastal city of Tobruk on June 12-13, also denounced
the U.N.-imposed ban on Libya and urged an immediate removal of
it.

<HEADLINE> Survey: One Third of Israeli University Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- One-third of Israeli university
students have tried drugs some time in their lives, and 21 percent
of them did so during the past year, local English-language
newspaper The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed in a new survey released last week on drug
use among young people to coincide with the World Anti-Drug Day,
which was marked Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Shlomo Gal, director of the Anti-Drug
Authority, as saying that the survey "sets off alarm bells." "If
something drastic isn't done in education and prevention, we'll
find ourselves facing a national social problem with many
implications," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gal said that an additional cause for worry is that drug use
begins at younger ages, adding that "this behavior can be found
today even among children 10 or 12. "
</P>
<P>
He warned against differentiating between "soft drugs"
(hashish and marijuana) and "hard drugs" (cocaine and heroin),
as young people think there is nothing wrong with the former and
then they "graduate" to the latter.
</P>
<P>
Gal called on parents to get more involvement in the issue and
look for suspicious signs of drug use. "They must discuss the
dangers of drugs with their children," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pride of Chinese: Interview with Henry Fok Ying-Tung (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Just think of the feeling of a
Hong Kong resident who knew that he was a Chinese but could not
identify him as a Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Only with the understanding of such an experience of many Hong
Kong residents can people really come to know the tremendous
inspiration and pride the upcoming return of Hong Kong to China
has brought to the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"When Hong Kong people went abroad, they couldn't identify
themselves as Chinese and were unwilling to identify themselves as
British, they could only write 'stateless' on the entry form,"
said Henry Fok Ying-tung, an influential businessman in Hong Kong
and vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
"After Hong Kong's return on July 1, Hong Kong compatriots will
become dignified Chinese with tremendous pride," he told reporters
recently in his hometown of Nansha, Panyu County, Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Fok, 74, who was born and grew up in Hong Kong, witnessed the
period of history when China was invaded and the Chinese people
were humiliated. Fifty-eight years ago, the Japanese aggressors
occupied large areas of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen-year-old Fok changed his name from "Fok Haojian" to his
present name "Fok Ying-tung," implying the hope that one day the
Chinese nation could "stand as a strong nation in the East of the
world."
</P>
<P>
With the passage of several decades, and the Chinese nation has
eventually found a way to make itself strong which is suited to
its realities. The once-sleeping lion now stands like a giant in
the East.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will return to the motherland soon. This indicates
that the Chinese nation has become strong. Hong Kong's smooth
return fully demonstrates that only when our motherland becomes
strong and prosperous, can we Chinese people wipe out a national
disgrace of more than 100 years," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pride of Chinese: Interview with Henry Fok Ying-Tung (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he returned to his hometown Panyu 18 years ago, he was
struck by poverty and backwardness there. "I wanted to make a
phone call, and but couldn't get through for a long time. I asked
someone to ride a bike to meet the person, and he got there and
yet I still did not get through for my call."
</P>
<P>
Panyu was a poor small town then and Nansha was a bleak place
with few restaurants. "Not only Panyu, but the whole of the
country was poor then. Once I stayed in the interior areas for 49
days, and simply couldn't make a long-distance call to my family,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone can see clearly what China looks like today. The
facts are there," he said. On top of the Nansha Mountain, pointing
to the Humen Bridge, factories, residential buildings and a steady
stream of moving vehicles, he said, "This (Nansha) is only a small
town of Panyu. One can imagine what tremendous changes have taken
in China in recent years. But for the policy of the reform and
opening up, China could not have become what it is today."
</P>
<P>
In his view, only sustained development in China's inland areas
can ensure the smooth transition of Hong Kong. "As a matter of
fact, the process of Hong Kong's return has proceeded
simultaneously with the reform and opening up in the inland
areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that every phase of Hong Kong's return process -- from
the Sino-British negotiations in the early 1980s, the signing of
the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the drafting of the Basic Law,
to the establishment of the Preparatory Committee and the
formation of the Government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region -- was accompanied by the increase in
China's national strength, the deepening of the reform and the
opening wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"Without the steady increase in the national strength, the Hong
Kong issue could not have been solved so smoothly, and Hong Kong
would not have enjoyed the stability and prosperity as it does
today," Fok pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The reform and opening up are the correct choice made by the
Chinese people after decades of exploration. Practice has proven
that this is the road that will enable China to become strong and
the Chinese people to achieve prosperity. In this sense, the
policy of the reform and opening up will never change," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So long as China advances along this road, its national
strength will become increasingly stronger and Hong Kong will
become increasingly prosperous, and the principle of 'one country,
two systems' will certainly succeed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a Chinese, I feel proud and dignified," he said.

HARARE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Vice-President Simon
Muzenda on Saturday described young Zimbabweans who despise their
own music and traditions as "a terrible shame and disgrace".
</P>
<P>
In a statement presented by Cephas Msipa, minister of state in

devote their time and energy to studying traditional music and
dances in order to preserve their indigenous cultural values.
</P>
<P>
"I regard it a terrible shame and disgrace that, some of our
young people seem bent on throwing anything that is African,
including our languages, preferring to imitate western values
which can never be ours even in a million years," said Muzenda.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was encouraging to know that some young
people were seriously pursuing and studying different types of
Zimbabwean music and dances.
</P>
<P>
The UZ Arts Festival was characterised by traditional African
music, dance, drama, poetry performed by students from the
capital.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Detects 38 New Drug Addicts Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-eight new drug addicts
were detected daily with the majority of them aged between 16 and
34, showing the seriousness of the situation, Malaysian National
Association Against Drug Abuse vice-president Lee Lam Thye said
today.
</P>
<P>
In view of the seriousness of the situation, the community and
individuals must seriously renew their commitment to tackle the
malaise, he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
A more effective approach and strategy from all parties
including government agencies, non-governmental organizations,
voluntary and religious organizations as well as political parties
must be implemented immediately, Lee said, adding efforts to curb
drug addiction problem required close cooperation from all strata
of society as it was not an easy task.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government spent 550 million ringgit (about 220
million U.S. dollars) to deal with the country's drugs scourge
between 1984 and 1996 but the menace had yet to be wiped out
completely.
</P>
<P>
The amount was spent particularly for treatment and
rehabilitation programs in drug rehabilitation centers, prisons
and other educational programs, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
Prisons Department director-general Zaman Khan said recently
that the government spent 750,000 ringgit (about 300,000 U.S.
dollars) a day for the 15,000 addicts in rehabilitation centers
and another 10,000 under the charge of the prison authorities
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 13,846 new drug addicts were detected in
Malaysia and the number of drug addicts in the country now stands
at some 200,000, Lee disclosed earlier.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield retained the
WBA heavyweight championship Saturday night in Las Vegas as Mike
Tyson was disqualified for biting his opponent's ears after the
third round.
</P>
<P>
After the bout, Tyson complained to referee Mills Lane and then
charged across the ring to Holyfield. Tyson hit a police officer
before being pulled away.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's 30 million U.S. dollars purse was being withheld
pending a hearing before the Nevada Athletic Commission, according
Marc Ratner, executive director of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield took advantage in the first two rounds while Tyson
was winning the third. With 40 seconds remaining, Holyfield
suddenly jumped up and run away in angry with a bleeding right ear.
</P>
<P>
The fight suspended four minutes and Tyson bit Holyfield on the
left ear. Both men then exchanged punches that didn't connect.
</P>
<P>
After the round ended, Lane disqualified Tyson and explained
that his decision was not due to the bleeding but due to the foul.
</P>
<P>
Lane was named referee Friday after Mitch Halpern voluntarily
withdrew. John Horne and Roy Holloway, Tyson's managers, had
protested that Halpern, the referee of the first fight on November
9, 1996, wouldn't treat him fairly.
</P>
<P>
Tyson began the fight cautiously and was cut at the corner of
the right eye in the second round. Lane ruled it as an accidental

<HEADLINE> Iran Ready to Sign Security Pacts with Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran is ready to sign security and
defense pacts with its southern Arab neighbors in a bid to
promote security in the region, a senior Iranian military
official was quoted today as saying.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Mohsen Rezaie, Commander of the Islamic
Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), made the remarks in an interview
carried in today's English daily Kayhan International.
</P>
<P>
The major-general also warned that any U.S. military
adventurism against Iran would be crushed. He called on foreign
military forces in the Persian Gulf to get out of the region.
</P>
<P>
Rezaie is expected to replace current Defense Minister
Mohammad Forouzandeh in the new government headed by Mohammad
Khatami, who won a landslide victory in the 7th presidential
election on May 23.
</P>
<P>
"We need security because we don't want our vital interests
be jeopardized. We have proved our good intentions. Now, we are
ready to sign security and defense pacts with all our Arab
neighbors in the Persian Gulf region," Rezaie said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. Security Council Resolution 598 also
calls for security cooperation among the Persian Gulf
states. "Iran has no expansionist desire and we want peaceful
coexistence with our neighbors," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believe that Iran has taken a bold gesture by
offering to sign security and defense pacts with its southern
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Election of moderate intellectual Mohammad Khatami as
president has strengthened Iran's desire to promote confidence
building and rapprochement between Iran and Arab countries in
the region, they said.
</P>
<P>
Rezaie attacked the United States for seeking to destabilize
the region, saying that "they want to keep the regional states
under pressure and threats."
</P>
<P>
However, he sent a message to Americans: "Let me send a clear
message to the Americans: the Persian Gulf is our region. They
have to leave our region. We have vital interests in the Persian
Gulf and we are going to defend interests."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of possible military confrontation between Iran
and the United States, he said, Iran will never start any
war. But if Americans one day decide to attack us, then they
will have committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
"We will turn the region into a slaughterhouse for them. There
is no place better than the Persian Gulf to destroy Americans'
might," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "there is a possibility that Israelis may
provoke America to seek adventurism in the region."
</P>
<P>
"In that case, they may be a good starter but the end of such
a war will not be in America's hands. The American people should
not let their children be killed in a war incited by Israel," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rezaie noted that the presence of foreign powers, especially
U.S. forces, in the Persian Gulf, is tantamount to an aggression
against the region. "It is against international norms and it
creates instability in this region." he said.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is committed to protect security in the Persian Gulf
and is trying with patience to get foreign forces out of this
region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The general also criticized U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen for his defense of U.S. presence in the region. "The
Americans have for the first time announced that they would
remain in the region as long as (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein
is in power in Iraq," he said, adding that "this shows they have
retreated one step back since they had never given any time limit
for their withdrawal before."
</P>
<P>
On Iran's defense capability, he said, Iran is now producing
advanced anti-tank rockets as well as short-range and medium-
range missiles.
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "there is no limitation in producing our
defense requirements within the international rules."
</P>
<P>
"I do confirm that we are seeking to expand our defense
capability but we have no desire to acquire banned weapons such
as nuclear bombs and chemical weapons."

issue.

<P>
He said that the ceremony for celebrating Hong Kong's return, a
grand occasion for people in the interior, Hong Kong, Macao and

<HEADLINE> All Set for By-poll in Manikganj, Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The much-talked by-poll in
Manikganj, dozens miles away from Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, is
expected to be held tomorrow while the main rivals warned each
other against bid to rig the election.
</P>
<P>
The Manikganj-3 seat was vacated after the death of the main
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) lawmaker Nizamuddin
Khan in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Though six candidates are in the race, the main contest is
between the nominees of the ruling Awami (people's) League, the
BNP and the third largest Jatiya (national) Party led by former
President H.M. Ershad.
</P>
<P>
The BNP, though boycotted two earlier by-elections on the pleas
of partisan role of the Election Commission, is contesting this
by-election. But they have warned of a movement to topple the
government if it tries to rig the by-election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Saturday also warned
that the government will not allow anyone to rig the polls.
"Nobody can play with the voting rights of the people," she said,
indicating that the BNP might have the ill motive.
</P>
<P>
The voting will start at 8 am (local time) in 404 centers and
continue till 4 p.m. (local time) without break amidst adequate
security, said the Election Commission in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The commission has given directive to the concerned authorities
to hold the election peacefully and properly while an electoral
committee has been formed to investigate any complaint of
irregularities or violation of code of conduct.

ROME, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said here today that the Italy-led Multinational Protection
Force (MPF) is expected to pull out of Albania in mid August.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that the international military presence in Albania

After the withdrawal of the MPF, the international community

plunged into chaos in February after armed rebels took to the
streets.
</P>
<P>
Albania's elections are seen as a key step to end months of

<HEADLINE> Alcoholism on Rise Among Singapore Women: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Alcoholism may be on the rise
among Singapore women because of changing lifestyles, growing
affluence and stress, the Sunday edition of the Straits Times,
said in a report today.
</P>
<P>
The number of women with alcohol problems is growing, though
only a few are seeking treatment, the report quoted psychiatrists
and psychologists as saying.
</P>
<P>
Seven professionals told the Sunday Times that they now see
more women with alcohol problems, despite the lack of
comprehensive statistics. They said they each have two to three
among their current patients, compared with perhaps one or none
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
They said they believe there are more out there who have not
come forward because they are too ashamed.
</P>
<P>
Changing lifestyles and growing affluence may explain why more
women are turning to drink, they said. "Alcohol consumption and
disposable income have gone up. It's more acceptable now for women
to drink. They have ladies' nights at most discos, and pubs are no
longer seen as seedy," one explained.
</P>
<P>
One psychologist in private practice said that the change in
women's roles has put many women under stress. "Unable to cope
with new pressures of family and work, they turn to alcohol as an
escape," he said.

COLOMBO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's imports from India has
risen tremendously last year, according to Trade Ministry sources
here.
</P>
<P>
The value of Sri Lanka's total imports from India in 1996 was
well over 550 million US dollars while Sri Lanka's exports to
India stood at only 50 million US dollars leaving the trade
imbalance largely in favor of India.
</P>
<P>
At discussions on the matter between the two countries
recently, the sources said both sides agreed to examine the trade
imbalance with India looking into the possibility of removing
Non-Tariff Barriers while Sri Lanka will boost its export to
India.
</P>
<P>
Indian official said that India has opened its market for Sri
Lanka's products. In the process, India has reduced tariffs on
more items in favor of Sri Lanka. Now they are studying the
possibility of adding more items to this list, the sources added.

resumption of the exercise of sovereignty by China over Hong Kong
indicates China is becoming stronger with its international status
being increasingly enhanced.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the concept of "One country, two systems"
put forth by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, adding that
Hong Kong's return will not only wipe out the historical national
humiliation, but also pave the way for the return of Macao and
Taiwan, signaling the reunification of China as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He noted that from the commercial point of view, Hong Kong's
return will provide more business opportunities for overseas
Chinese and foreign businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Power of Final Adjudication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Before July 1, 1997, under
British colonial rule, Hong Kong has adopted British laws and the
British Legal system. Lawsuits in different categories and classes
are routed to the magistrates' courts, the district courts and the
High Court.
</P>
<P>
However, Hong Kong has never had the power of final
adjudication, with its court of final appeal in the British Privy
Council.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) has stipulated that after Hong Kong returns to China on
July 1, 1997, the Hong Kong SAR will be vested with the power of
final adjudication except for cases concerning the territorial
integrity of the state, national defense and foreign affairs, and
the relationship between the central authorities and the Hong Kong
SAR.
</P>
<P>
This is intended to ensure that the HKSAR enjoy a high degree
of autonomy and have full and independent judicial power.
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits within the Hong Kong SAR may be subject to the final
adjudication by the Court of Final Appeal of the SAR, the Basic
Law stipulates.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that the Chief Justice of the Court of Final
Appeal of the HKSAR must be Chinese citizens who are permanent
residents of the region with no right of abode in any foreign
country.
</P>
<P>
In the appointment or removal of judges of the Court of Final
Appeal and the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Chief
Executive of the HKSAR must, in addition to going through
procedures stipulated in the Basic Law, obtain the endorsement of
the Legislative Council and report such appointment or removal to
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for
record.

<HEADLINE> Interview: "One country, two systems" Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The concept of "one Country, two
systems" is a great innovation developed by the late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, said Mirza Gholam Hafiz, President of the
Bangladesh-China Friendship Association (BCFA).
</P>
<P>
During a recent interview with Xinhua, Mr. Hafiz, now
77-year-old, recalled his long-time friendship with China. "When
the new China was founded in 1949, my friends and I, still young
at that time, were much excited and held a special function to
celebrate the historical event."
</P>
<P>
Having been the president of the BCFA for more than 30 years,
Mr. Hafiz contributed a great deal to the Sino-Bangladesh
friendship. In 1994, he was awarded the title of the "Friendship
Ambassador" by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship
with Foreign Countries.
</P>
<P>
"As a politician, I have to say the concept of "one country,
two systems" is a new development in International Political
Science," said Hafiz, who served as the Speaker of Bangladeshi
parliament from 1975 to 1983 and Minister of Law in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In his view, this workable system will set a good example for
other regions facing similar problems.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, Hong Kong, after July 1, will be governed by
a government made up of local people, enjoy a high degree of
autonomy and have its own customs and tax system. "This will
guarantee Hong Kong to continue as a free port and a major
international finance and trade center." he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in addition to Hong Kong, Macao will also return
to China in a few years under the concept of "one country, two
systems". This has testified to the feasibility and practicality
of the concept which also opened the door for resolving the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
Hafiz, who will attend the grand ceremony marking the return of
Hong Kong to China, said: "Hong Kong's return is a very happy
development in modern world history."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Have More Business Opportunities After Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is bound to have more
business opportunities in China's interior areas as well as in the
global marketplace with Hong Kong as the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by Dr. Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong
Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) today.
</P>
<P>
"China's opening to the outside world more than a dozen years
ago provided an opportunity for Hong Kong and its return to the
motherland represents a new opportunity," said Dr. Fung.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fung said Hong Kong can enhance its cooperative ties with
the rest of China in such fields as product design, packaging,
infrastructure construction as the city boasts a very developed
service industry.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fung said HKTDC can help promote products made in the
interior areas on the world market by making use of its global
market network.
</P>
<P>
The service trade has made up 80 percent of the product value
and the number of employees also constituted 80 percent of the
total employment in Hong Kong. Not long ago, the Trade Council
announced that it will allocate 40 million HK dollars to
strengthen Hong Kong's status as a the center of service in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong is the world's fourth source of direct foreign
investment, its direct investment outside the region reached 25
billion US dollars last year, and Fung said that his council will
help encourage and organize more overseas business people to
invest in China in the years ahead.
More than 50,000 Hong Kong-funded firms have been established in
China's interior areas and more enterprises will follow suit, he
estimated.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that trade with the interior areas accounts
for more than one third of Hong Kong's 400 billion US dollar-worth
annual external trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1966, the TDC has been engaged in exploring Hong
Kong's trade with the rest of the world. The council has so far
established 51 offices in 34 countries and regions worldwide, 11
of which are in interior areas.

ALMA ATA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia said today that the flying
of a U.S. naval remote surveying aircraft near its border with
Kazakhstan is "unacceptable" and poses "a direct threat to the
security interest of Russia."
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh "Panorama Weekly" quoted a Russian foreign ministry
spokesman as saying that this incident could lead to the use of
the territorial space of a member country of the Commonwealth of
Independent States for military reconnaissance activities against
another member country.
</P>
<P>
The weekly said that U.S. aircraft arrived in Kazakhstan on
June 18 to participate in a land survey operation which will end

On August 14, 1945: Japan announced unconditioned surrender to
the Allies. On September 16, the ceremony to accept the surrender
of the Japanese troops in Hong Kong was held in the Government
House. Britain resumed its colonial rule over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, 1949: the People's Republic of China was founded.
On January 6, 1950, Britain officially announced its recognition
of the government of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
On October 1971: China resumed its legitimate seat in the
United Nations. In March 1972, China and Britain reached an
agreement on establishing diplomatic relations at the
ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
On March 8: Huang Hua, the Chinese ambassador to the United
Nations, wrote the chairman of the UN Special Committee of
Twenty-Four, a committee on the decolonialization issue, declaring
that Hong Kong and Macao are not "colonies", and the solution to
the Hong Kong and Macao issues is within the scope of China's
sovereignty. In November, 1972, the UN General Assembly voted 99-5
to adopt the resolution on deleting Hong Kong and Macao from the
list of colonies.
</P>
<P>
On March 29, 1979: Deng Xiaoping, while meeting visiting
Governor of Hong Kong Sir Murray MacLehose, pointed out that Hong
Kong "is part of China's territory, but we regard Hong Kong as a
special region and a special issue to deal with. No matter how the
Hong Kong issue will be solved by 1997, the special status of Hong
Kong will be maintained, namely, within this century and over a a
long period in the next century, Hong Kong may practice its
capitalism, while we will practice our socialism." He assured
investors around the world that they did not have to worry.
</P>
<P>
On September 24, 1982: when meeting British Prime Minister
Margarite Thatcher, Deng Xiaoping made it clear that the issue of
sovereignty over Hong Kong was not open to discussion. Under
China's jurisdiction, Hong Kong's existing political and economic
systems, and even most of its laws, could be maintained.
</P>
<P>
From July 12, 1983, to September 5, 1984: China and Britain
held 22 rounds of negotiations on the issue of Hong Kong question.

On December 19, 1984: the Chinese and British governments
officially signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing.
In the Declaration, the two governments solemnly announced that
the government of the People's Republic of China had decided to
resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997;
and the government of Britain would return Hong Kong to the
People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
On May 27, 1985: China and Britain exchanged the instruments of
ratification for the Joint Declaration and three annexes, which
demonstrated that the Joint Declaration came into force and Hong
Kong entered the transitional period.
</P>
<P>

People's Congress (NPC) deliberated and passed the Basic Law of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the three
annexes. The Basic Law, in the form of national law, embodies the
concept of "one country, two systems" and the principle and policy
of "one country, two systems", Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong, and a high degree of autonomy. It serves as the fundamental
code for maintenance of Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
On October 7, 1992: the newly appointed Governor of Hong Kong
Christopher Patten made public the political reform bill, which
made drastic changes in Hong Kong's existing political structure.
The bill violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the
principle of dovetailing with the Basic Law, and the agreements
and understandings concerning the arrangements for Hong Kong's
election for 1994/1995, which were reached between the Chinese and
British governments in the late stage of drafting the Basic Law.
Hence it was called the "triple violation" bill.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The People's Republic of China
is to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1.
The following is a chronicle of major events in Hong Kong's
history.
</P>
<P>
From the late 1700s to 1842: in an attempt to cut trade deficit
with China, Britain started to sell opium to China from the late
1700s, thus bringing great affliction upon Chinese people and
plundering a huge amount of wealth from China. In 1838, the Qing
Dynasty government sent Lin Zexu as the imperial envoy to ban
opium trade in Guangdong. Under the pretext of China's prohibition
of opium trade, Britain decided to launch a war against China.
Hence the Opium War broke out in 1840.
</P>
<P>
On January 26, 1841: British marines disembarked near the
present Possession Street in Sheung Wan, and occupied the Hong
Kong island by force.
</P>
<P>
On August 29,1842: Britain forced the Qing Dynasty government,
which had been defeated in the First Opium War, to sign the
unequal Treaty of Nanking, in accordance with which the Hong Kong
island was ceded to Britain. The area of the island was about 78
sq. km.
</P>
<P>
In 1860: by launching the Second Opium War, Britain forced the
Qing Dynasty government to sign the Convention of Peking, which
ceded Kowloon to the British. In accordance with the convention,
the area south of the present Border Street on the Kowloon
Peninsula was ceded to Britain. The area was measured nearly eight
sq. km then.
</P>
<P>
On June 9, 1898: Britain forced the Qing Dynasty government to
sign in Beijing the Convention Respecting an Extension of the Hong
Kong Territory, and forcibly leased the area south of the Shenzhen
River and north of the Border Street, as well as 235 nearby
islands (namely, the so-called "New Territories," which account
for about 91 percent of Hong Kong's land area). The term of the
lease was 99 years and would expire in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On April 16, 1899: the British hoisted the Union Jack at Tai Po
in "New Territories", claiming that Chinese residents in "New
Territories" were under British rule from 2:50 p.m. on April 16,
1899. The local residents rose to fight the British, and were
cruelly put down by the British army with force.
</P>
<P>
On the morning of December 8, 1941: the Japanese troops started
to attack Hong Kong, and occupied it on December 25. Hong Kong was
ruled by the Japanese for three years and eight months.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to China is a
significant historical event not only for China but also for the
whole world, Tauno Olavi-Huotari, Chairman of the Finland-China
Society, said here today.
</P>
<P>
For China, the return of Hong Kong is a milestone marking the
end of a history in which it had to yield to imperialist demands
and unfair treaties, Olavi-Huotari said in an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hong Kong's return through peaceful negotiations
will have positive implications in the world.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Yrjo Hakanen, Chairman of the Communist Party of
Finland (Unity), told Xinhua that China's successful
implementation of the policy of "one country, two systems" has
laid a good and convincing foundation for the settlement of the
Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Reino Gunn, Chairman of the Finland-China Trade Association,
said that Hong Kong will maintain its position as an international
commercial, financial and information center after the return.
</P>
<P>
He said that Finnish enterprises will continue to keep close
trade contacts with the firms of Hong Kong.

On March 31, 1993: as the British side adopted an uncooperative
attitude on the issue of Hong Kong, the First Session of the
Eighth NPC adopted the decision that authorized the NPC Standing
Committee to establish a preliminary working body of the
Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR. On July 2, the Standing
Committee of the Eighth NPC adopted the decision to establish the
Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the
HKSAR. The preliminary working committee was officially
established on July 16. Its main duties included all kinds of
preparatory work for China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 and for Hong Kong's smooth
transition.
</P>
<P>
From April to November in 1993: representatives of the Chinese
and British governments held 17 rounds of talks concerning the
arrangements for the 1994/1995 election. During the 17th round,
the British side unilaterally announced the suspension of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
On January 26, 1996: the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR
was established. It consisted of 150 members, of whom 94, or 63
percent, came from Hong Kong. The committee was in charge of the
preparatory work for the establishment of the SAR. As the British
side unilaterally pursued its "political reform package," the
existing Legislative Council of Hong Kong could not become the
first Legislative Council of the HKSAR. To ensure the smooth
transition and avoid a legal vacuum, the Preparatory Committee
decided to form a Provisional Legislative Council for the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On November 2, 1996: the Preparatory Committee elected the
Selection Committee for the first HKSAR government. The Selection
Committee was in charge of selecting the first Chief Executive and
the Provisional Legislative Council of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On December 11, 1996: the Selection Committee elected Tung Chee
Hwa as the first Chief Executive of the HKSAR; on December 16, the
11th Plenary Meeting of the State Council approved the
appointment, and Premier Li Peng signed the No. 207 State Council
Decree that appointed Tung Chee Hwa as the first Chief Executive
of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On December 21, 1996: in Shenzhen, the Selection Committee
elected 60 members of the Provisional Legislative Council of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On January 24, 1997: Tung Chee Hwa announced the list of the
members of the first Executive Council of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On February 20, 1997: the 23 principal officials of the HKSAR
government nominated by Tung were appointed by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
On May 20, 1997: according to the recommendation by the
Judiciary Recommendation Committee, Tung agreed to appoint Li
Kwok-nang Chief Justice of the HKSAR Court of Final Appeal. The
appointment will take effect on July 1.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Due to the sabotage by the
British side, the "through-train" arrangement, which means that
members of Hong Kong's last Legislative Council may become, upon
confirm ation by the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), members of the first
Legislative Council of the HKSAR, has been derailed.
</P>
<P>
Since the last Legislative Council of the British Hong Kong
authorities cannot continue to operate after July 1, 1997, and it
is also impossible to form the first Legislative Council of the
HKSAR on July 1 or soon after that, there will be a temporary
legislative vacuum after the founding of the HKSAR if no measure
is taken.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there will be many affairs that require the
participation of the legislature after the Hong Kong SAR is
established, particularly such as the formulation of new laws for
the transfer of power. Therefore, there must be a temporary body
to exercise the power of the first HKSAR Legislative Council prior
to its formation.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, 1990, the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, adopted a "Decision on the Method for the Formation
of the First Government and the First Legislative Council of the
HKSAR", which granted the HKSAR Preparatory Committee the power to
"take charge of relevant affairs relating to the preparations for
the establishment of the HKSAR".
</P>
<P>
In March of 1996, the HKSAR Preparatory Committee adopted a
"Decision on the Establishment of the HKSAR Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC)" at its second plenary session.
</P>
<P>
On December 21, 1996, a Selection Committee for the First HKSAR
Government, which was composed of 400 permanent residents of Hong
Kong, held its fourth plenary session in Shenzhen and elected
through secret ballot the 60-member PLC of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The major functions of the PLC include formulating laws that
are urgently-needed and indispensable in the early days of the
HKSAR government, amending some laws that required to be revised
before continuing to be applicable, and declaring the termination
of several laws that have no necessities to be preserved.

</P>
<P>
On the new insignia, the crown has been replaced by a bauhinia,
a flower representing Hong Kong. Otherwise, the insignia features
a sword and a key crossing each other.
Pointing at the sword and key, Li said they represent law
enforcement and the collection of duties.
</P>
<P>
"Mind you, this is a Chinese sword, a symbol of high authority,
that gives the bearer discretionary powers," he said.
</P>
<P>
A seasoned customs officer, the 53-year-old Li became the first
Chinese commissioner of customs and excise of Hong Kong when he
was appointed to lead the 4,300-strong customs force in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Li will serve at his present post for the future Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.
He said he was aware of his heavy responsibilities as
commissioner of customs.
</P>
<P>
The Customs is an important government department in Hong Kong,
he said. Aside from ensuring internal security and duty
collection, the customs cracks down on illegal activities such as
smuggling, drug trafficking and infringement of intellectual
property rights.
"Whether or not the Customs does a good job has a bearing on Hong
Kong's image in the international community as well as on its own
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that, with rapid economic expansion in Hong Kong, the
Customs is facing new challenges and that people's expectations of
the Customs are rising.
</P>
<P>
Main tasks for the Customs at present, he said, range from
cracking down on drug trafficking and smuggling, protection of
intellectual property rights, tariff collection, management of
export quotas, safety standards for consumer goods, to control of
the import and export of contrabands such as goods that cause
serious pollution, explosives, and protected plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
Specific plans include the construction of a new customs
building in two or three years, improvement of its computer
network as well as its administrative structure.
"The Customs will do its best to further improve work efficiency
and raise service standards," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner expects closer cooperation with his
counterparts in inland areas of China, especially the customs in
neighboring Guangdong province. Over the past 15 years, the heads
of Hong Kong and Guangdong customs have held annual meetings and
liaison officers of the two customs meet once every six weeks, he
said.

<HEADLINE> PICC Group to Reform Pay, Promotion Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- China's largest insurance
underwriter, the People's Insurance Co of China (PICC), will
reform its operations to maintain its leading status in domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
A senior manager of PICC said the group would change its
employment, promotion and pay systems in order to "meet the
challenges from domestic and overseas counterparts".
</P>
<P>
The iron rice-bowl system, which guarantees lifelong
employment, should be broken. Instead, the industry should
employment a contractual employment system, under which employees
can be fired if they do not fulfill their work requirements, said
PICC Group Vice President Wu Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The "iron chair" system, which secures an official's position
after he or she is promoted, would be abolished, Wu was quoted
today by China Daily's "Business Weekly" as saying.
</P>
<P>
The group headquarters is planning to appoint heads for seven
departments through public selection, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The group would link employees' income with performance, and
senior officials of the group are no exception, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We will make more efforts in transforming operations to meet
the challenges from our domestic and overseas counterparts," he
said.
</P>
<P>
PICC Group, which owns life, property and reinsurance
subsidiaries, is being rivaled by some 20 domestic insurance
companies and more and more foreign insurers that are striving to
crack China's market.

<HEADLINE> New Berths for China's Largest Coal Terminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINHUANGDAO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A new terminal at Qinhuangdao
port on Bohai Bay in north China will start trial operation on
July 1, port authorities say.
</P>
<P>
The terminal has three berths: one for 100,000-ton vessels and
two for 35,000-ton. It adds 30 million tons to the port's annual
coal handling capacity, raising the total capacity to about 127
million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao is now the second port in China with a yearly
capacity surpassing 100 million tons, and is considered the
largest coal terminal in the world. Last year it handled 83.1
million tons of cargo, 65.5 million tons of which was coal.
</P>
<P>
A fourth phase of construction began in April 1993. The
terminal has handled a total of 1.88 million tons of coal while
installing and testing equipment.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 1.68 billion yuan has been spent on the project,
including 10.34 billion yen from a Japanese government loan. The
Mitsubishi company of Japan won a bid to supply the main equipment.
</P>
<P>
North China produces most of the coal used in the South. A
large part of it is transported by ship, and Qinhuangdao handles
nearly 70 percent of the south-bound coal carriers.
</P>
<P>
The phase four project was to make use of a railway built
earlier, between Qinhuangdao and Datong in Shanxi Province, the
largest coal production base in China. The 653-kilometer
Datong-Qinhuangdao line is solely for coal transport and is
capable of handling 100 million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
The new coal terminal is equipped with advanced dock
facilities. It is run by the Seventh Stevedore Company, which was
established in May 1996 and now has 659 employees.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian President
Julius Kambarage Nyerere said here today that a powerful China is
the basic guarantee for the smooth return of Hong Kong to its
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The long-cherished wish to bring Hong Kong back into the
embrace of China is realized only today when China has developed
and become powerful, Nyerere said before leaving for Hong Kong to
view the hand-over ceremony to be held on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, 75, one of the founders of the Sino-Tanzanian
friendship, has conducted 13 visits to China.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Nyerere said that Hong
Kong will be more prosperous after its return to China, and its
position as a world financial and trade center will be further
strengthened.

correctness of Deng's concept and this concept will promote the
smooth settlement of the Taiwan question.

stability are the only way to gain economic and social
development.

<HEADLINE> Ivanisevic Knocked out of Wimbledon Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Croatian veteran star Goran
Ivanisevic was knocked out of the on-going Wimbledon tennis
championships Saturday after losing a five-set battle to young
Swedish player Magnus Norman.
</P>
<P>
Norman, beat world number one Pete Sampras at the recent French
Open, put up an inspiring fighting form at the All England Law
Tennis Club and refused to make any concessions to the world's
most powerful server.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, the second seed and twice a losing finalist, set a
record for the number of aces in a match, but at the crucial final
set the temperamental player lost his patience the conceded a
remarkable 3-6 6-2 6-7 6-4 12-14 defeat.
</P>
<P>
Although the 21-year-old Swede sailed into the third round, his
hear problem, which nearly forced him to abandon Saturday's match,
would cast a long shadow upon his future Wimbledon battles ahead.
</P>
<P>
Norman will now consult his doctor in Sweden to discuss how
serious a risk he would be taking by continuing in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the match, Norman told reporters: "Last time it
happened to me it lasted for 40 minutes, today it was just for 30
seconds. I am going to phone my doctor in Sweden and we're going
to take the decision."
</P>
<P>
Tenth seed Carlos Moya of Spain was another major casualty on
Saturday. The rising young tennis star was beaten 4-6 3-6 3-6 by
American Richey Reneberg to leave South African Wayne Ferreira as
the only remaining seed in the bottom quarter of the draw.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Krajicek almost became the biggest upset
today when he was trailing by a set when his opponent Andrei Pavel
of Romania suffered injury, granting the fourth seed a surprise
victory 3-6 6-4 6-7 6-3 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, World number one Pete Sampras and two German
veterans Boris Becker and Michael Stich cruised into the next
round by defeating their opponents in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, World number one Martina Hingis of
Switzerland, ninth seed Mary Pearce of France and other major
seeds also overwhelmed their opponents and sailed into the third
round.

involved in producing the fake lubricant.

FUZHOU, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong businessman, who had 13
tons of dried mushrooms that were held illegally by a food company
in Zhangzhou City in east China's Fujian Province, got a fair
hearing from the local court, which saved him more than 120,000
yuan (14,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Courts at various levels in the province, one of China's
coastal areas that are benefiting from the opening-up policy, have
had similar equitable and speedy trials in more than 260 cases
involving Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The cases mostly involved divorces, real estate, and property
and rental disputes with overseas joint-ventures, with real estate
development, sales, and management disputes becoming much more
common.
</P>
<P>
Cases involving Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao compatriots usually
are given priority for court dates, hearing, and settlement. Some
of them are even handled the very day they are filed.
</P>
<P>
This of course saves overseas compatriots time and money, and
is not bad for the reputation of the local courts either.

WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A plane crashed Saturday
morning on the southwest side of Box Springs Mountain in Riverside
County, California, killing two male passengers.
</P>
<P>
Residents reported hearing a low-flying plane and a loud crash
just before 7:30 a.m. local time near the Box Springs Mountain
Park, about 63 miles east of Los Angeles, The United Press
International reported.
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies responding to reports were led to the badly
mangled plane by two mountain bikers, at which time the two
victims were discovered. It was not clear whether anyone else was
killed because authorities have not gone through all the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and the
National Transportation Safety Board said they may have the
wreckage airlifted from the mountain side to an area where it can
be examined more thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
The area was reportedly blanketed by a thick layer of fog
around the time of the crash.

<HEADLINE> Greece: New Europe Should Not Ignore Small </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The course towards a federal Europe
should not ignore the particularities of the smaller countries,
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said while addressing a group
of socialist finance ministers from European Union (EU) member
states.
</P>
<P>
The EU socialist ministers are meeting here this weekend to
discuss strengthening of the social state, accelerating growth and
boosting employment in the EU.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that flexibility should not constitute the main
focus, saying that this would lead to "a concentration of power in
the hands of the bigger states."
</P>
<P>
In short, flexibility would allow some countries to forge ahead
of others, adopting specific policies and integrating more
closely, without the threat of a veto from an unwilling partner.
</P>
<P>
As for economic policy related issues, he stressed the need for
social cohesion, adding that the European socialists should focus
economic policy on battling unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Economic policy should also take into serious consideration
the particularities and sensitivities of the various member-states
of the European Union, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Delors, former European Commission president, also said
at the meeting that the great challenge for socialists was to make
the necessary adjustments to the system, without losing the values
of freedom, solidarity and personal responsibility.
