<HEADLINE> EU Concerned Over Disappearance of Belarusian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
on Thursday that it is deeply worried by the disappearance of Mr.
Victor Gonchar, deputy chairman of the 13th Supreme Soviet of
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Refferring to the assurances given during discussions held in
Minsk between the representatives of the EU and Belrusian
authorities, the EU calls upon the Belarusian authorities to do
everything in their power to locate Mr. Gonchar's whereabouts and
ensure his safety.
</P>
<P>
The EU expects the results of these investigations to bring
early results and "also reminds of the fact that the previous
disappearances of Ms. Tamara Vinnikova, former Central Bank
chairwoman, and General Yuri Zakharenko, former interior minister,
are still unclarified", the EU said in a presidency declaration.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says Washington Resented for Unpaid U.N. Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said here Wednesday that she had been
inundated with complaints from other countries about the U.S.
failure to pay its U.N. dues and U.S. Congress does not understand
the toll this debt is taking on American influence.
</P>
<P>
During numerous meetings with foreign ministers in New York
during the ongoing 54th General Assembly session, this issue "has
been a constant theme," she said, adding that it "is the
irritation all the other nations have at the United States for
non-payment."
</P>
<P>
"They resent us deeply because we are not paying," she said of
the U.S. arrears which is currently estimated at about 1.7 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties lie with the Republican-led Congress, where
critics have refused to pay the dues until the United Nations
implements reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the demand
amounts to an excuse because the world body, under his leadership,
has undertaken the most profound reforms in its history of more
than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Albright said "part of the problem is that there is a lack of
understanding in Congress about the toll it takes on the
American position if we don't have the money" to pay the U.N.
dues.
</P>
<P>
The United States was widely criticized here for its failure
to pay the arrears full, in time, and without any preconditions.

<HEADLINE> Gerhard Schroeder Arrives in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 23 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder arrived on late Thursday in Bucharest, on a two-day
official visit, for an exchange of opinions with the Romanian
authorities on bilateral, regional and European issues.
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Schroeder's visit to Bucharest is made in reply to
January's visit to Bonn of Romanian Premier Radu Vasile. It is the
first visit here by a chief of the German Executive in 21 years, a
fact which can be interpreted only as an important political
signal for the revival of relations between Bucharest and Berlin,
remarked local media.
</P>
<P>
Besides the political signal for the development of
Romanian-German relations, Schroeder's arrival to Bucharest is
expected also to give an impulse to bilateral economic relations
which, although they have recently registered sustained growth,
are still below the real possibilities of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The reception ceremony took place this evening at the Victoria
governmental Palace, when the prime ministers and the delegations
started talks. The economic relations are expected to be in the
focus of the talks, the materialization of the big projects agreed
on in January in Bonn, Stuttgart and Munich.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the German Chancellor will be received by Romanian
President Emil Constantinescu at the Cotroceni presidential Palace
and will hold talks with Senate President Petre Roman and the
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Ion Diaconescu. He will also
deliver a speech in Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Camdessus: Agreement Close on Debt Relief For Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Michel Camdessus, Managing
Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said here
Thursday that it is close to reach an agreement on expanding debt
relief to the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are truly at the striking distance," Camdessus said at a
press conference before the start of the annual meetings of the
IMF and the World Bank, hoping to announce the agreement at the
conclusion of discussions on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are now in the business of convincing bilateral donors to
provide us with needed resources," he said. "We are now at the end
of the process."
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted the ongoing negotiations are very
difficult. "The last stages of any negotiations are difficult
ones," he said.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said he hopes the IMF and major donor countries will
agree on increasing to 90 billion dollars the debt relief made
available to 41 of the world's poorest countries, many of them in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The complex financing arrangement would involve revaluation of
14 million ounces of the IMF's huge gold reserves from 47 dollars
per ounce, the current value on the IMF's books, to world market
prices, currently more than 250 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The extra money would be invested and the proceeds of that
would be used to finance the IMF's contribution to the 90 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
High levels of external debt have been increasingly recognized
as a serious constraint on the ability of poor countries to pursue
sustainable development and reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
In response, in September 1996, the World Bank and the IMF
launched the Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC).
</P>
<P>
The Initiative is endorsed by some 180 governments around the
world because it is considered the best instrument available to
provide poor countries with a way out of the debt trap.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Deputy head of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen,
said Thursday that the Palestinian people would not accept less
than the full implementation of the United Nations Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We did not demand any thing impossible or outside the
international legitimacy," Abbas, also secretary-general of the
Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO), told the Voice of Palestine radio from the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Rather, we demand the rational and lawful implementation of
the U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of reaching a compromise with
Israel to achieve reconciliation, he said "The compromise had
already been reached when we accepted the two resolutions and no
one has the right to ask us to compromise on the compromise."
</P>
<P>
"The resolution No. 242 gives the Palestinian side the right to
restore the West Bank and Gaza Strip which constitute together
just 20 percent of our historical right to the Palestinian land,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, who is accompanying PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat on a
visit to the U.S., said the Palestinian leadership will not sign
any deal with Israel that does not enjoy the approval of the
Palestinian National Council and the PLO central and executive
committees.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 23 (Xinhua)-- An armed group attacked a
caravan of military vehicles in Mexican southern state of
Guerrero, said Thursday National Defense Secretariat (SEDENA).
</P>
<P>
SEDENA said in a communique that the attack, occurred Wednesday
morning, left two soldiers wounded, but press said that four army
men died and 10 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The military vehicles were shot at from the undergrowth when
they were making a routine vigilance journey between Ayutla and
Cruz Grande towns in Guerreor.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Announces New Money-laundering Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government
Thursday announced its first national money-laundering strategy to
stop the flow of billions of criminal dollars through the U.S.
financial system.
</P>
<P>
The package of proposed new laws and rules was announced by
Attorney General Janet Reno and Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers at a joint press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"Money laundering is a very sophisticated crime and we must be
equally sophisticated," Reno said.
</P>
<P>
"The scheme of cleansing criminal (money) through legitimate
bank accounts of hard-working Americans must be stopped," she said.
</P>
<P>
The new strategy seeks to bolster international cooperation in
investigating money-laundering and strengthen U.S. enforcement
through tighter regulation of banks and other financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
It includes a requirement that storefront check cashiers,
brokerage firms and casinos notify authorities of suspicious
activities the way banks must do. The government would designate
new high-intensity money-laundering zones.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has directed the Treasury and Justice
departments to submit the new strategy early this year, before the
case involving the alleged money-laundering by Russia through U.S.
banks broke.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Rebels Say No to International Mediators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Congolese rebels fighting to
topple president Laurent Desire Kabila Thursday claimed refusal
to accept any international mediators without their approval.
</P>
<P>
''For quite some time, we are noticing some agitation in
Kinshasa following the announcement of the presence of some
personalities presented as facilitators of the national dialogue
stipulated by the Lusaka accord,'' Lambert Mende, the spokesman
of the main rebel movement, the Congolese Rally for Democracy
(RCD) said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted the RCD leader Emile Ilunga as saying that
no agreement has been yet reached by all parties involved
concerning the facilitator of the national dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"Consultations were held in the presence of the Secretary
General of the Organization of African Unity(OAU), all the parties
to the accord were associated to the discussions about the choice
of the facilitator, but no conclusion was drawn to date,'' Mende
told Rwanda News Agency on a phone interview from Goma.
</P>
<P>
Mende said the RCD would like to have inter-Congolese
political negotiations taking place in an African country which
makes protagonists feel secure.
</P>
<P>
"The RCD would also like a college of facilitators comprised
of African personalities whose moral integrity and independence
are not questionable,"
</P>
<P>
Mende stressed.
</P>
<P>
He discarded the current endeavor by former Benin president
Emile Dirlin Zinsou, and former OAU Secretary General Edem Kodjo,
saying that they cannot undertake such a facilitation mission
without prior consultation of the armed opposition.
</P>
<P>
Zinsou was mandated by the recent francophone meeting in
Moncton, Canada, while Kodjo was sent by the OAU secretariat.
''The RCD cannot accept them as mediators,'' Mende emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Zinsou reportedly arrived in Kinshasa on Monday together with
Don Mateo Zuppi of the Rome-based San Egidio Community. Edem Kodjo
was still awaited in the Congolese capital.
</P>
<P>
The internal opposition in Kinshasa have also expressed grudges
about the above-mentioned facilitators, saying that president
Kabila wants to divert the dialogue in his favor.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Urged to Better Manage Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- All the three countries in
east Africa, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, have been urged to try to
manage Lake Victoria better in order to improve the life of those
who rely on the largest lake in Africa for their subsistence.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan State Minister of Fisheries Fred Mukisa made the appeal
at a sensitization workshop on the management of Lake Victoria in
capital Kampala Thursday, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
All the three countries should make concerted efforts in the
management of the lake and this is the only way out for the lake
and those who live nearby, the minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The quality of fish can be improved and the eco-system can be
protected by the joint administration of the lake, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lake Victoria provides some 300 million shillings (200,000 U.S.
dollars) in taxes for Uganda and fish exports earn the landlocked
country some 50 million dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
A total of 700,000 Ugandans live directly or indirectly on
fishing in the lake.

<HEADLINE> Aziz Says It Is Time to Lift U.N. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice Premier Tareq Aziz
on Thursday said it is time to lift the U.N. embargo on Iraq, and
condemned "continuous aggression" by the U.S. and Britain on the
country's north and south.
</P>
<P>
Denouncing the air embargo as "unlawful," Aziz expressed regret
over the "negative U.N. attitude" towards Iraq's demands, the
Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press briefing Thursday, Aziz said there had been
no direct contact between his country and the U.N. since
U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq last December except through
the U.N. envoy to Iraq, Brakash Shah.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Iraq, Shah met Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, and said the sanctions will not be lifted until
Iraq gets a clean bill of heath on weapons of mass destruction
from the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long sought to have the sanctions removed, but
UNSCOM'S weapons inspections actually came to a halt last December
when the U.S. and Britain launched air raids on Iraq for what they
called "Baghdad intransigence."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused UNSCOM of serving U.S. interests and trying to
prolong the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said Iraq accepted the Memorandum of Understanding with
the U.N. to alleviate the sufferings of its people, under which
Iraq can sell limited amounts of oil every six months to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian goods for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
But the memorandum that has entered its sixth stage failed to
reduce significantly the sufferings of the Iraqi people, such as
malnutrition, lack of medicines and insufficiency of power and
water.
</P>
<P>
Aziz noted that the U.S. and British representatives in the
UNSCOM played a role in blocking the implementation of the
U.N.-Iraqi memorandum and suspending contracts in different fields.
</P>
<P>
Such situation can not be solved through further resolutions
but through lifting the embargo completely, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iraq's ties with other Arab countries, Aziz said
his country is ready to improve relations with all Arab brothers,
and has made progress in bettering ties with Syria and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq's relations with most Gulf Arab states, including
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, witnessed no thaw, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. and Britain persisted in their aggression on
Iraq, and tried to convince the international public opinion that
Iraq was an aggressive country.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Washington and London knew very well that
their attempt to seek to undermine the Iraqi leadership would be
doomed to fail.

<HEADLINE> Russian Planes Launch New Strikes on Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian warplanes carried out
a second wave of air strikes Thursday near Grozny, capital city
of the breakaway republic, hitting an oil refinery and causing
fires, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Two flights of planes dropped bombs and fired missiles on
Zavodskoi district on Grozny's northern fringe and on the nearby
village of Andreyevskaya Dolina, Interfax said in a dispatch from
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Bombs hit an oil distribution station at a refinery, causing a
massive fire.
</P>
<P>
Grozny was covered by thick clouds of smoke, but the city does
not have functioning equipment to fight the fires.
</P>
<P>
This was the second wave of air raids on Grozny Thursday.
Federal planes bombed the Grozny airport and destroyed an An-2
plane earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry said the plane had been used by
Chechen militants "for delivery of arms and ammunition across
Chechen territory."
</P>
<P>
"The Air Force will continue attacking targets which gangs will
be using in their interests," Interfax quoted the ministry's press
service as saying.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the federal force in the North Caucasus
said earlier that the air strikes were conducted over arms depots
and a radar station at the airport which militants had been using
in their own interests.
</P>
<P>
"This radar tracked Russian planes' flights over Chechnya and
supplied information to the terrorists," Interfax quoted a source
with the headquarters as saying.
</P>
<P>
In addition, attacks were also made at a store of fuel and
lubricants, arms and ammunition depots, a power sub-station and an
oil refinery, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry is considering the
possibility of using heavy bombers capable of carrying more
powerful weapons to deliver air strikes against rebel bases in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Tactical bombers such as Tu-22m2 and Tu-22m3 may be deployed to
deliver more powerful air strikes, Interfax quoted ministry
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, air strikes on rebel bases were mostly carried
out by Su-24 frontline bombers and Su-25 attack planes.

<HEADLINE> Clerides Says Ready to Negotiate Over Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides Thursday told the United Nations General Assembly that
Cyprus is waiting for U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to invite
the two sides of Cyprus for talks.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 54th General Assembly session, Clerides said
the parameters established for the solution of the Cyprus issue
"provide that Cyprus must be a bicommunal, bizonal federal
republic, with a single sovereignty and international personality
and a single citizenship."
</P>
<P>
Such a "federation, becoming a member of the EU, will thrive at
home and abroad, enjoying genuine peace, stability and security
based on international law and legality," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the federation would be supervised by an international
force authorized by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that the Greek Cypriot side stands ready to
negotiate in good faith," he told the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Clerides expressed regret that the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash is refusing to negotiate with him.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The seven most industrialized nations plus Russia (G-8), in
their June summit in Cologne, Germany, asked the U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan to invite leaders of the two communities to
unconditional negotiations in the fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side has made it clear that it wants peace
talks to take place, but will not accept the preconditions set out

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Opposes House-Building in Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Education Minister
Yossi Sarid said here Thursday that it is unnecessary to continue
the housing constructions in the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Terming the housing constructions in the heights "waste of
money," Sarid told the Israel Radio that he will request a
ministerial committee in charge of the Golan Heights constructions
to discuss this issue.
</P>
<P>
Golan regional council head Yehuda Wolman said Wednesday that
a new Israeli neighborhood of 52 homes is to be built in the
region soon.
</P>
<P>
The homes slated for the Bnei Yehuda settlement are to put up
by private contractors and the project was approved by the
government of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said
Housing Ministry spokesman Moshe Eilat the same day.
</P>
<P>
Settlement expansion in the Golan Heights, the southern
territory of Syria seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war,
is a controversial issue in Israel.
</P>
<P>
"How could Israel carry out its negotiations for the settlement
of the Golan Heights issue with Syria while it continues to build
more homes there for the Israeli settlers?" left-wing politicians
of the Jewish state have asked.
</P>
<P>
Wolman disclosed that the government has begun cutting state
funds for Golan settlements, which stand at 2.5 million
U.S. dollars for 1999, and 2.2 million for 2000.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has repeatedly asked Syria to restart
negotiations to settle the Golan Heights issue and diplomatic
efforts in this regard have been going on for some time. But till
now there is no clear timetable for the two sides to sit together
to discuss the issue.

<HEADLINE> Finnish President to Visit Lebanon Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari will make a lightning visit to Lebanon on October 6 as
part of a Middle East peace-making endeavor, Lebanese foreign
ministry officials announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During his hours-long stay in Beirut, the president will hold
talks with his Lebanese counterpart Emile Lahoud on the Middle
East peace process and the European Union's (EU) aspirations to
play an active role in the course.
</P>
<P>
European diplomatic sources said Ahtisaari may be carrying new
ideas to jump-start talks on the Syrian-Israeli and
Lebanese-Israeli tracks which were cut off in 1996 when hawkish
former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari's visit is also meant to relay a message to the
United States, a key sponsor of the peace process, that Europe has
a complementary political role in the peace talks which the
U.S. should not ignore, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari's tour comes as some Arab leaders, notedly those of
Syria and Lebanon, are calling for more active European role in
the talks to offset the U.S. bias in favor of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari, accompanied by Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen and
EU peace envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos, will also visit the Gaza
strip, Syria and Israel as part of his Mideast swing.
</P>
<P>
Finland currently holds the half-year rotating presidency of
the EU.

<HEADLINE> WTO's Liberalization Policy Criticized In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The policy of liberalization
to be introduced by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in November
has been criticized in Zimbabwe as it will allegedly leave
multinational companies in control of indigenous resources in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Mushita, director of the Community Technology Development
Trust of Zimbabwe, said here Thursday that the WTO policy would
lead to the disregard of patent rights, leaving a few big
companies controlling natural resources in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Mushita as saying that the
liberalization policy would override the Convention on Biological
Diversity which allowed communities to protect medicinal
discoveries they made.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries should lobby for other conventions to
protect their traditional medicine discoveries when the WTO
liberalization policy was implemented, he said.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries will "face a negative impact on the
economy and natural resources development," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"They risk losing control of their resources to big companies
so they must quickly lobby for the protection of these resources,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO plans to introduce a number of new global trade
conditions at its third meeting of ministers in Seattle, the
United States, in November.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 15 developing countries have already resolved to
oppose the move, saying that it would further weaken their
economies.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Lambasts U.S. Intervention in Its North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq condemned on Thursday
the meeting of some United States diplomats with Kurdish leaders
in northern Iraq on September 13 as an "irresponsible act and part
of the U.S. aggression on Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The aim of the U.S. move is to maintain its control over its
agents in the region so as to serve its suspicious interests and
prevent the Kurdish parties from returning to the Iraqi national
ranks, the Iraqi News Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the deterioration of political and security
situation and worsening of livelihood in Iraq is the foreign,
especially the U.S., intervention in Iraq's internal affairs, said
the official who was not named.
</P>
<P>
Such intervention complicated the situation and pushed it to
catastrophe, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official expressed regret over Turkey's support for
the U.S. attacks on Iraq, saying that it is in violation of
Ankara's declared position of respecting Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes have been using bases in Turkey in
launching attacks on targets in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government condemns the irresponsible acts against
Iraq's sovereignty, security and stability, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The only solution to the instability in northern Iraq is the
stopping of any foreign intervention and the restoration of the
legitimate authority over the region, he added.

<HEADLINE> 200 Ugandan Sugar Workers Go on Strike for Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- About 200 workers in the
Sugar Corporation of Uganda Limited, some 45 kilometers east of
capital Kampala, went on strike Thursday morning because of the
delayed payment of their salaries.
</P>
<P>
"The workers wanted the management to pay their salaries of
August," Chris Bakesiima, police commander of the Central Region,
told Xinhua Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
"The strike had calmed down as I left the plant," the police
commander said.
</P>
<P>
The plant produces sugar mainly exporting to neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
About 60 people who were instigating others to strike have been
arrested, Bakesiima said.
</P>
<P>
After contacting the Uganda Social Security Authority in
Kampala, the management had secured 500 million shillings (350,000
U.S. dollars) to pay the 7,000 workers the plant employs, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Delay of payment sparked a big Industrial unrest in the Owen
Falls Extension Project recently. Police and local security
forces intervened in time to prevent more serious consequences.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Economy On Downward Trend: U.N. Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's economic growth has
been on a downward trend from the early 1990s and now stands at
growth rate of 0.1 percent as of last year, the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has said.
</P>
<P>
In its Trade and Development Report for 1999 released in Harare
Thursday, the UNCTAD said that Zimbabwe's economy grew by 0.8
percent between 1990 and 1995, leaped to 6.6 percent in 1996 and
then dropped to 3.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The outbreak of hostilities in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) adversely affected the economies of Angola, Chad,
Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe," said the U.N. organization.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned countries except Chad even now have troops
in the DRC fighting for the rivaling parties in the third largest
African country.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD said that South Africa also grew by the same margin
between 1990 and 1995 but achieved a 2.5 percent growth in 1996,
1.7 percent in 1997 and only 0.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The substantial drop in commodity prices in 1998 encompassed
the entire range of African exports and of 47 African countries,
of which 39 were dependent on a mere two primary commodities for
more than 50 percent of export earnings.
</P>
<P>
While the impact of falling commodity prices varied among
countries, the overall result was a decrease of 16 percent in
export value together with a slight reduction in volume, said the
U.N. organization.
</P>
<P>
"The overall weakness of commodity prices can be expected to
continue, reflecting the continuation of sluggish world demand and
overcapacity in almost all commodity markets," it added.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other countries in the 14-member Southern African
 Development Community (SADC), Zimbabwe had a loss of export
earnings of minus five percent, the same with Mauritius while
Malawi had minus six percent and Mozambique minus 4.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Strengthening Belief in SOE Reforms: Commentator's Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The latest issue of the "
Seeking Truth" magazine carries a commentator's article which
hails the decisions on SOEs made at the just-concluded fourth
plenum of the 15th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party as a major theoretical innovation in the reform and
development of SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Titled, "Strengthening the Belief in Running Well State-Owned
Enterprises (SOEs)", the article said the decisions clarified the
direction of SOEs' reform and development and should be regarded
as a guideline for future changes.
</P>
<P>
The reform of SOEs is directly related to China's reform,
development and stability and is a key part of the country's
economic reform, the article said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the key to establishing a socialist market
economy is a modern enterprise system, which means that SOEs must
alter their management systems to adapt to the needs of the market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that China's reform in the last 20 years has
provided all the necessary conditions for SOEs reforms, including
the establishment of a social security system.
</P>
<P>
It urged government and party officials at various levels to
carry out the decisions seriously and strengthen the leadership
over SOEs reforms.
</P>
<P>
The article expressed the belief that with Deng Xiaoping Theory
as their guide, the leadership of CPC Central Committee with
President Jiang Zemin at the core and the efforts of all party
members, China's SOEs reform would surely enter a new stage.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Consumer Price Index Up 0.9 Pct in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's consumer price
index (CPI) in August 1999 rose 0.9 percent over the same month of
last year, marking the fourth consecutive month of year-on-year
increase, according to the data released Thursday by the
Statistics Department of Singapore (SDS).
</P>
<P>
Compared to July this year, the CPI in August inched up 0.2
percent, SDS noted.
</P>
<P>
The biggest gainer was educational costs which surged up 4.4
percent over the same month last year as a result of higher
tuition fees at commercial institutions as well as higher
miscellaneous school fees.
</P>
<P>
The sole loser was the housing costs which declined by 1.1
percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Transport and communication costs registered a 1.2 percent
year-on-year increase as higher car prices more than offset road
tax and cheaper petrol.
</P>
<P>
Compared to August 1998, food prices posted a 1.5-percent rise
in August 1999 while clothing costs and miscellaneous costs went
up by 1.0 percent and 1.3 percent respectively in the month.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President on Challenges in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President
Olusegun Obasanjo said here Thursday that African countries are
suffering "the adverse effects of globalization of the world
economy" despite total elimination of colonialism and the twin
menace of constitutional racism in the southern part of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as the Nigerian foreign minister, who made
his first speech at the General Assembly since he was sworn in on
May 29.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is indeed proud and glad to see the end of this century
coincide with the total elimination of colonialism and the twin
menace of constitutional racism in the southern part of the
continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "it is rather tragic that Africa, the least developed
of all the regions and the least able to cope with external
shocks, has borne the brunt of the adverse effects of
globalization of the world economy," said the president.
</P>
<P>
"There are grim statistics which indicate that the well-known
marginalization of the African continent has turned into
de-linkage from the global scene," he said.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries, mostly in Africa, are being
marginalized by the current trend of globalization because some of
the African countries were involved in lengthy war and conflict.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Africa's exports and imports as a share of world
trade has decline from four percent to two percent. Africa's
development is presently strait-jacked by a debt burden of around
300 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Africa is experiencing import compression, weak productivity
and low output. On the average, factors that are still operating,
do so at least than 30 percent of installed capacity.
</P>
<P>
"In the quest for a better and fairer management of a
globalized world economy, it is now incumbent on us to direct our
search light on the unsatisfactory evolution of the multilateral
trading system," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In participating in the historic Uruguay Round of Multilateral
Negotiations that ushered in the new rules-based trading system,
the developing world had hoped that the new trading regime would
enhance their trading fortunes, facilitate their effective
integration into the world economy, and arrest their
marginalization from the global trading system," he said.
</P>
<P>
The oil-rich Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, it
ended the decade-long military rule in smoothful transition to
civilian rule.

<HEADLINE> Lake Toxin Level Proved to Cause Human Infertility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Great Lakes are proved to
have enough toxin doses to derail women's menstrual cycles and
make couples infertile, the Ottawa Citizen reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a new report by the Canada-U.S. International Joint
Commission, the newspaper said there is a significant reduction in
the timing of the menstrual cycle in women who consume more than
one meal per month of contaminated fish from Lake Ontario.
</P>
<P>
"Gender-bender" chemicals, which mimic human hormones and were
considered at a "safe" level in the past, are found to be causing
human infertility in Michigan, where 15 percent of the surveyed
625 married couples had no success after one year of trying to
conceive, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Chemicals consumed by women before or during pregnancy damage
their babies in the womb, with the surveyed children recorded at
an average 6.2 points lower on IQ tests than children whose
mothers didn't eat the fish in the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
The Canada-U.S. report was quoted as saying that " the levels
of persistent toxic substances have declined in the past 30
years," but "there has been an increasing knowledge of the dangers
posed by exposures to these substances."

<HEADLINE> 20% Of Zimbabwean Youths Are HIV Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- About 20 percent of the
Zimbabwean youths are HIV positive, the results of recent
countrywide tests show.
</P>
<P>
Philip Moses, counselling coordinator of the Zimbabwean
National AIDS Coordinating Program, said here Thursday that the
response to calls for voluntary HIV testing by the New Start
Voluntary Counselling and Testing Centers was so overwhelming that
the 10 centers available were unable to satisfy the demand.
</P>
<P>
"The response is very good and results show that the numbers
coming positive are the numbers we had expected, of about 20
percent of people below the age of 35," Moses said.
</P>
<P>
Moses said two more centers could be built in Harare, which
already has two, before the end of this year or in the next year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the widespread awareness on how the HIV virus was
spread and how it could be prevented, about 2,000 new infections
occurred each week, hence it needed for the change of behavior,
the coordinator noted.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is second to Botswana on the world list of countries
worst affected by AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes Tax Cut Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton Thursday vetoed the bill of 792 billion dollars tax cut
pushed by Republicans and passed by Congress some weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
It was the 26th veto of Clinton in his presidency.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he rejected the tax bill because it would "turn us
back to the failed policies of the past" at a time when the nation
is enjoying economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In a letter accompanying the signed veto, Clinton told Congress
he refused to sign "because it ignores the principles that have
led us to the sound economy we enjoy today and emphasizes tax
reduction for those who need it the least."
</P>
<P>
But on Capitol Hill, House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters they would concentrate
on passing annual government spending bills, reducing federal
debt, protecting Social Security funds and preventing tax
increases during the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
Other than a limited measure renewing expiring tax provisions,
they said compromise with Clinton on tax cuts would probably not
happen and would be left as an issue when Congress reconvenes in
2000.
</P>
<P>
The tax bill would have used part of a projected 10-year budget
surplus to reduce all federal income tax rates by 1 percentage
point, cut capital-gains taxes, phase out estate taxes and the
alternative minimum tax and ease the "marriage penalty" paid by
many two-income couples. On nearly party-line votes, it passed in
the House, 221-206, and in the Senate, 50-49, falling far short of
the two-thirds majority needed to overturn a veto.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said such an ambitious tax cut reflected misplaced
priorities. Salvaging Social Security and Medicare should come
first, he insisted. He also said it would absorb so much of the
projected budget surpluses that federal programs from national
parks to education could suffer deep, debilitating cuts. He has
instead proposed cutting taxes by up to 300 billion dollars, and
called on Congress to work with him on a compromise.

<HEADLINE> Chissano Urges Mozambicans to Get Ready for SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano on Thursday urged the country's private sector to brace
itself for the difficulties that may arise from Mozambique's
ratification of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC)
Trade Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Seven SADC countries have ratified the Trade Protocol. Although
 Mozambique signed the protocol in 1996, it has yet to ratify it.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the fifth annual Private Sector
Conference in Maputo, Chissano said that the protocol was an
important instrument from which Mozambique should not alienate
itself.
</P>
<P>
"We must organize ourselves to overcome the existing
difficulties for ratification, because it is in this instrument
where our greatest challenges lie in order to consolidate our
economies and allow a greater inflow of investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Because globalization and liberalization of the world economy
is a reality to be ignored at one's peril, Chissano said that the
conference would provide a platform where the country's
competition both in the region and world could be measured.
</P>
<P>
This would allow the government and the private sector to
understand in depth each other's role in facing the challenges of
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said he was aware that neither the country as a whole
nor the private sector would develop without the reform of the
Mozambican administrative system.
</P>
<P>
Thus, an area to which the government has given special
attention is " the simplification of procedures through the
systematic elimination of certain barriers in the context of
reforming the public administration".
</P>
<P>
As for the forthcoming general elections, Chissano thought they
were an important exercise for guaranteeing peace and stability,
which he characterized as essential conditions for the country to
continue being a preferred destination for private investment.
</P>
<P>
Egas Mussanhane, president of Mozambique's Confederation of
Business Associations (CTA), said it was important that
Mozambican businessmen be ready for the demands envisaged in the
Trade Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Mussanhane said that businesses must improve the quality of
their goods, if they wanted to compete.
</P>
<P>
Although the country has become an economic attraction, he
thought that a lot could be done with a change of mentalities both
in government and private sector circles.
</P>
<P>
It was the prevailing mentality of creating barriers, and
delays in the removal of red tape, that would eventually drive
away foreign investors, he warned.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican
presidential front-runner George W. Bush promised Thursday to
pump billions of dollars into developing new weapons if he is
elected president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his plans for the U.S. military, the Texas governor
said he would increase spending on research and development of
weapons, raise soldiers' salaries, develop an anti-ballistic
missile system and avoid "vague, aimless and endless" troop
deployments throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
"If elected, I will set three goals: I will renew the bond of
trust between the American president and the American military; I
will defend the American people against missiles and terror; and I
will begin creating the military of the next century," he said in
a speech to the Citadel military academy in Charleston, South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to keep the peace is to redefine war on our
terms," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he would increase spending by 20 billion dollars over
five years on the research and development of new weapons. The
annual Pentagon budget is about 270 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 20 percent of the current budget for weapons and
information systems should be earmarked for the purchase of
weapons that take advantage of new technologies, Bush said.

<P>
MAPUTO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- An agreement on investment
promotion was signed here on Thursday between Mozambique and the
American Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), aimed at
facilitating United States private investment in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
OPIC is a development agency of the U.S. government and, in
the terms of the agreement it will be allowed to make direct
investments or grant loans to American businessmen, who can either
invest as single entities or in partnership with Mozambicans.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by Mozambican Deputy Planning and
Finance Minister Carlos Jessen and U.S. Ambassador to Mozambique,
Brian Curran, on behalf of OPIC.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Curran said that the U.S. government
is granting OPIC 120 million U.S. dollars for investments in the
southern African region, out of 300 million for the whole
continent.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the recent Bilateral Investment Treaty,
signed between the United States and Mozambique, has paved the way
for significant American investments in the country. OPIC can only
operate in countries with which the U.S. has this kind of
bilateral agreement.

<HEADLINE> S. African Banks Cut Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Seven South African
commercial banks announced Thursday that they would cut their
prime overdraft and home loan interest rates by one percentage
point from 16.5 to 15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
First National Bank (FNB) led the major South African banks to
announce the latest interest rate cut, followed by ABSA, Nedcor,
Standard Bank, Saambou, NBS and Mercantile Lisbon Bank.
</P>
<P>
FNB's new prime rates will take effect on October 4.
</P>
<P>
A similar percentage point cut in the mortgage bond rate to
15.5 percent -- for both existing and new business -- will also
take effect from October 4.
</P>
<P>
ABSA said it would cut its rates for new bondholders from
October 4. The cut would affect existing bondholders only from
October 18.
</P>
<P>
"The move has been made possible by the general improvement in
market conditions as reflected by the lower repo rate," ABSA said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The repo rate is the rate at which the central bank lends money
to commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Nedcor, which comprises Nedbank, People's Bank and Permanent
Bank, said it would cut its rates from October 4, but the cut for
new home loans would take effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
Standard Bank said its rates cut for new and existing prime
overdraft and bondholders would come into force on October 4.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong People Enjoy Freedoms, Says  Senior </HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hong Kong Official
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has enjoyed
the economic and political freedoms in the "one country, two
systems" principle after its reunification with China in 1997,
said a senior Hong Kong official here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Our free, open, argumentative and free-wheeling society
continues to manage successfully in free-market economy
bolstered by the rule of law, and the free and unfettered flow
of ideas and information," said Donald Tsang, the Financial
Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region at a
Luncheon given jointly by the Hong Kong Economic &AMP; trade Office
in New York and National Committee on U.S.-China Relation.
</P>
<P>
He said "I am here to assure you that we are alive and well.
Human rights, the freedom of expression, the freedom of the
press -- in fact all the freedoms we have come to expect over
the years, as our right, are intact."
</P>
<P>
Tsang on a visit to the United States said the Asian
financial crisis caused a great deal of suffering to the Hong Kong
people but it also gave Hong Kong enormous opportunities to
reshape its markets, enhance its banking sector and liberalize
the communications industry. The reforms pulled Hong Kong out of
decline in its economic growth and Hong Kong's economy grew by
0.7 percent in real terms in the second quarter after a 3.2
percent decline in the first quarter, this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said, the reforms will reinforce Hong Kong's position
as a global financial center, and as the world enters the 21st
century, Hong Kong will play an increasingly important role as
the number one services center and capital fund-raising focal
point for China and the East Asian region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Tsang pointed out that all these reforms are very much Hong
Kong market-driven. They are not instructions somehow being
handed down from the Central government.
</P>
<P>
He said many people do not fully understand the "one
country, two systems" principle under which Hong Kong operates
as a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of
China. Under that principle, Hong Kong people are running Hong
Kong with a high degree of autonomy in everything except defense
and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
All Hong Kong's systems remain intact and that includes the
rule of law, an independent judiciary with the power of final
adjudication, a free and open market, freedom of the press,
freedom of speech, the protection of property rights and foreign
investment, a free-convertible Hong Kong Dollar, the freedom to
run its own economic and fiscal policies without interference,
low and business-friendly taxes and a clean and efficient
administration, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Central Government in Beijing has been
scrupulous in adopting a hand-off approach, allowing the Hong
Kong people to get on with the business of running Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The special relationship we have with the Mainland of China
is working, and working well. Teething problems, when they
arise, will be resolved amicably and openly together by the
Central Government and Hong Kong," Tsang added.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong is moving ahead with its capitalist
system and way of life firmly entrenched and guaranteed for 50
years until 2047.

<HEADLINE> Solana Says Independent Kosovo is Unrealistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Javier Solana, outgoing
secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), said Thursday that the goal of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians
to gain independence from Yugoslavia is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
Solana told a group of American defense reporters that ethnic
Albanians must abandon hope of gaining independence from
Yugoslavia in order to achieve a lasting peace in the divided Serb
province.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted him as saying that if the
international community allows a shifting of borders in southern
Serbia, it will be hard to stop a momentum toward political
fragmentation elsewhere in the Balkans and perhaps even in the
vast territories of Russia.
</P>
<P>
However, Solana, who is leaving his post as NATO's top diplomat
on October 6, spoke optimistically of Kosovo's future.
</P>
<P>
"It will take time to cure the many wounds, but I'm sure that
there could be moral reconstruction in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Solana said the NATO-led peacekeeping force that moved into
Kosovo in June will have to remain until there is a political
settlement of Kosovo's status. He said he could not predict how
long that might take.

The confrontations between the Army's Fourth Brigade with
headquarters in Medellin and rebels of Front 9 of the FARC are in
the rural zone of San Carlos municipality in Antioquia department,
according to sources.
</P>
<P>
Five soldiers and 10 guerrillas perished, while eight soldiers
and four civilians were hurt during the fighting.
</P>
<P>
According to military authorities, to wound civilians by
guerrillas violates international human rights as they are members
of San Carlos Hospital staff.
</P>
<P>
The insurgents shot at the ambulance which were moving wounded
soldiers. In the action, the vehicle's driver, a doctor and two
nurses were hurt, said military spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
Fighting began when members from the Fourth Brigade followed
those responsible for a kidnapping which occurred on September 19.
</P>
<P>
Authorities don't know if those guilty of the kidnapping are
rebels from the FARC or the National Liberation Army (ELN), as
both guerrilla groups are in the region.
</P>
<P>
The subversives took away 10 persons, among whom were three
employees of a private insurance company and three college
students, from a restaurant between Guatape and Marinilla
localities in Antioquia.
</P>
<P>
After the kidnapping, two soldiers died and another was wounded
when the guerrillas, who ambushed them, dynamited the armored car
in which they were traveling.

</P>
<P>
Misago allegedly attended meetings chaired with
self-proclaimed president Thodore Sindikubwabo, and the then Prime

<HEADLINE> Brazil Backs Peace in Angola without Splitting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luanda, September 23 (xinhua) -- Out-going Brazilian Ambassador
in Angola expressed his hope for a rapid implementation of peace
in the southwest African country, without the existence of one
more parallel nation, local press reported here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Public Television of Angola (TPA), Addor
Neto said that the civil conflict should be ended as soon as
possible "on condition that there doesn't exist a parallel state
in Angola."
</P>
<P>
Neto mentioned in his speech that Jonas Savimbi, head of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), is in
opposition to him on the principle of "no parallel nation".
</P>
<P>
After the recrudescence of the Angolan civil war in late 1998,
the Angolan government found that UNITA had reinforced its army
during the period of negotiation.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, the government troops encounter many
difficulties in their battle against the rebels, which hindered
the government from going further in the rural areas under the
control of Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
A "Dry Season Offensive", put forward by the government soon
after a crushing defeat in an attacking on Andulo, headquarters of
UNITA, proves an abortion as the rain season has begun in
September.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian ambassador also urged Angola to keep its air
space under control, hence the government can better detect the
clandestine planes carrying military supplies to UNITA rebels.

<HEADLINE> Internet Leads Direct Marketing Media in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Internet is the
fastest growing business-to-business direct marketing medium in
the United States, the U.S. Direct Marketing Association (DMA)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Between 1994 and 1999, U.S. business-to-business direct
marketing sales through the Internet grew at a compound annual
growth rate of 195 percent, from only 30 million U.S. dollars in
1994 to 3.9 billion dollars in 1998 and a projected 7.1 billion
dollars in 1999. Again, the annual growth rate between 1999 and
2004 is expected to be 49.6 percent, with sales reaching 53.4
billion dollars by 2004.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, from 1994 to 1999, all direct marketing sales to
business grew 11 percent per year, with sales volume from 411
billion dollars to 691.6 billion dollars. Other direct marketing
media include direct mail, telephone, newspaper, magazine,
television and radio.
</P>
<P>
By 2004, total business-to-business direct marketing sales
through all kinds of media are projected to surpass 1 trillion
dollars, and 8 million Americans will be employed as a result of
these sales, according to the DMA.
</P>
<P>
Business-to-business direct marketing advertising expenditures
also grew rapidly, with a compound annual rate of 8.4 percent
between 1994 and 1999. During the period, total advertising grew
from 60 billion dollars to 90 billion dollars. Advertising
spending through the Internet grew even faster, at a compound
annual growth rate of 156 percent, from only 8 million dollars in
1994 to 83 million dollars in 1999. Direct marketing ads on the
Internet are expected to reach 5.4 billion dollars by 2004, when
all media's ads for direct marketing are projected to total 129
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Prices Soar as OPEC Holds Firm to Tight Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices soared by
more than 80 cents on Thursday, after OPEC decided to hold firm to
supply cuts.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark Brent crude blend were traded at 23.77 U.S. dollars a
barrel in late afternoon, 84 cents up on the day, as the market
bets that the cartel's commitment to hold back millions of barrels
of oil will send prices soaring even higher as the northern
hemisphere winter looms, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted analysts as saying that the only way was up
for oil, as long as producers kept their promises to curb exports
amid rising temptation to sneak out supplies at such high prices.
</P>
<P>
OPEC ministers who met in Vienna on Wednesday agreed to keep an
existing pact on supply limits until end March 2000.
</P>
<P>
"I must stress that the market situation still seems to be
fragile," Youssef Yousfi of Algeria was quoted as telling fellow
OPEC ministers in Vienna. "Stock levels are still high and could,
at any time, have a negative impact on price."
</P>
<P>
Supportive comments were made as ministers left Vienna after
the talks reassured traders that oil supply would stay tight as
demand from the northern hemisphere winter kicked in.
</P>
<P>
Mexico wants concrete proof that an oil market surplus had
disappeared before producers consider relaxing curbs, as the
country's Deputy Oil Minister Jorge Chavez said: "The glut has to
disappear. Why should we discuss something when we haven't
achieved that?"
</P>
<P>
Crude prices have more than doubled since March as a result of
tight OPEC compliance with the cuts, with U.S. crude futures
touching a 31-month high of 24.85 U.S. dollars last week.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the only blot on the horizon was the possibility
of sales from U.S. oil reserves if American consumers start to
complain of higher energy costs as temperatures drop, according to
Reuters.

<HEADLINE> Africa to Set up Database of Light Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- An international workshop on
the establishment of a database of light weapons in Africa
opened in Ghanian capital Accra on Thursday with a call on
industrialized countries to join African efforts against arms
proliferation on the continent.
</P>
<P>
 Ghana's Vice-President John Atta Mills urged governments,
Non- Governmental Organizations (NGOs), churches and the media to
lend their support by sharing the information on the acquisition
and movements of small arms in the society.
</P>
<P>
 Ghanian News Agency quoted the vice president as saying that
Africa has suffered a great deal from violence and civil strife
as a result of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons
on the continent.
</P>
<P>
 "No day passes without the media reporting distressing cases
in which innocent people, including women and children have been
killed or injured in various violent incidents and conflicts,
arising from the use of small arms and light weapons," Mills
told delegates at the opening session.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which is under the auspices of the United
Nations and ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States),
is being attended by policy makers as well as experts and
researchers from some 20 African countries, to carve modalities
for the establishment of an arms register and database in Africa.
</P>
<P>
 The Accra workshop forms part of the general framework for
the implementation of the Moratorium on the Importation,
Exportation and Manufacture of Light Weapons, declared by ECOWAS
states in October last year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 20 million small arms are illegally
 circulating in the African civil society out of which 15 million
is found in the West African sub-region in addition to
landmines.
</P>
<P>
 Small arms have become both a cause and a catalyst of armed
 conflicts, urban banditry, child soldiers and armed robberies.
</P>
<P>
 These vices, the vice president added, have denied many
African countries the opportunity to pursue their development
agenda in a safe and secure environment.
</P>
<P>
Mills urged sister states to take more active part in
current negotiations under the auspices of the UN for the
adoption of the Firearms Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Adrienne Diop, Director of Information, ECOWAS, recalled
various conflicts in Africa including, those in Liberia and
Sierra Leone and said they escalated due to the proliferation of
arms in the region.

<HEADLINE> Europe to Launch Superbourse Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Eight European stock exchanges
said Thursday they will launch a "virtual" pan-European bourse via
a common electronic link in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
That will be earlier than planned, but the superbourse will not
be the single trading platform originally trumpeted.
</P>
<P>
The "common market model" agreed will include a harmonized rule
book and will expand overall share trading and make it easier for
investors to hold cross-border portfolios. It will handle up to
600 European blue chips, double what was originally envisioned,
according to a Reuters report filed from London.
</P>
<P>
The London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Boerse unveiled a
strategic alliance to develop a joint electronic trading platform
for blue chips back in July last year. In May this year, six other
bourses -- Madrid, Milan, Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and Zurich --
joined the project.
</P>
<P>
The alliance has come under heavy fire for being too slow in
pressing ahead with its project when competition from alternative
electronic trading systems is increasing. The superbourse project
has been dogged by regular reports of failure among the alliance
members to agree on basic issues such as single technology, stock
index benchmark, and ownership, Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
Although the original timeframe was to launch the superbourse
sometime "beyond 2000," bringing it forward a few months still
gives competitors an easy deadline to beat and time to approach
individual bourses with alternative plans.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's announcement follows Monday's step towards common
trading hours, which means the opening bell is now rung at the
same time in London, Frankfurt and Paris.
</P>
<P>
Last week, German banking sources confirmed that leading
investment banks, the key dealers on bourses, were looking at ways
to trade pan-European stocks on their own exchange because of
disappointment over the slow pace of progress by the exchanges.

WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration
said on Thursday the plan of Colombian President Andres Pastrana
to fight narco-trafficking and revive the country's economy was
"ambitious but realistic."
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, State Department spokesman James Rubin
said Pastrana was proposing a comprehensive approach to the
complex factors that have sustained the growth of the narcotics
industry and its associated ills in Colombia for generations."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. applauds Colombia's strategy "as an ambitious, but
realistic, package of mutually reinforcing policies," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana is seeking 1.5 billion U.S. dollars from the United
States over three years to support his 7.5 billion plan. He met
President Bill Clinton in New York and congressional leaders here
on Tuesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government will carefully review Colombia's request
for international assistance and, in consultation with the
Congress, develop proposals on how the U.S. can best assist the
GOC (Government of Colombia)," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Announces Full Control of North-west </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government
Thursday announced that it has resumed complete control of Lofa
County, a battle field since early last month between its forces
and rebels, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted when insurgents invaded the towns of
Kolahun and Voinjama in August, forcing thousands of Liberians
and Sierra Leonean refugees to flee the area.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian authorities had said the insurgents are former
militia who fought in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The fighting had been a major cause recently of the intensified
conflict between Liberia and its neighboring Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Liberia has been repeatedly accusing Guinea of backing the
rebels, whose base is believed on the Guinean side of the border.
</P>
<P>
To forestall possible conflict between the two west countries,
Economic Community of the western African States (ECOWAA) held an
emergency summit recently to mediate disputes between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
A communique released by the summit condemned the resurgent
fighting by the Liberian rebels and called on Liberia and Guinea
to restore their good ties through dialogue.

<HEADLINE> S. African Banks Cut Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Seven South African
commercial banks announced Thursday that they would cut their
prime overdraft and home loan interest rates by one percentage
point from 16.5 to 15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
First National Bank (FNB) led the major South African banks to
announce the latest interest rate cut, followed by ABSA, Nedcor,
Standard Bank, Saambou, NBS and Mercantile Lisbon Bank.
</P>
<P>
FNB's new prime rates will take effect on October 4.
</P>
<P>
A similar percentage point cut in the mortgage bond rate to
15.5 percent -- for both existing and new business -- will also
take effect from October 4.
</P>
<P>
ABSA said it would cut its rates for new bondholders from
October 4. The cut would affect existing bondholders only from
October 18.
</P>
<P>
"The move has been made possible by the general improvement in
market conditions as reflected by the lower repo rate," ABSA said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The repo rate is the rate at which the central bank lends money
to commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Nedcor, which comprises Nedbank, People's Bank and Permanent
Bank, said it would cut its rates from October 4, but the cut for
new home loans would take effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
Standard Bank said its rates cut for new and existing prime
overdraft and bondholders would come into force on October 4.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- East African
Co-operation (EAC) members Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda Thursday
resumed talks to lift their collaboration levels.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which is attended by high-level experts in northern
Tanzanian town Arusha, is aimed at reaching a consensus on a draft
treaty for establishing the East African Community.
</P>
<P>
The most contentious issues in the 148-page treaty are
imbalance of trade and industrialization among the three states,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
A Tanzanian official claimed that Kenya is in more advantageous
position in the new regional bloc compared with the other two
states.
</P>
<P>
However, the official was positive that given Kenya's
willingness to assist the other two states, the experts may find
an acceptable solution before the Permanent Tripartite Commission,
the highest decision making body of EAC, meets on October 30.
</P>
<P>
"We hope we'll resolve the impasse," said the official, who
declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
Once the experts and the Permanent Tripartite Commission reach
agreement on the draft treaty, it will be ready for the three east
African heads of state to sign at a summit scheduled for the end
of next month.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the treaty has already been postponed twice as a
result of differences over the proposed text.
</P>
<P>
EAC's predecessor, the defunct East African Community,
collapsed in 1977 due to the divergence of political and economic
policies pursued by the member states.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. investigators now
believe as many as 10 American banks might have been used to
divert up to 15 billion U.S. dollars from Russia, the U.S.
newspaper USA Today reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
That indicates that a probe into alleged money laundering by
Russian officials and crime groups could be wider than officials
had thought, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted federal investigators as saying that
"suspicious transactions" involving Russian accounts have been
identified at, among other banks, Fleet Financial Group Inc. in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
Some of the transfers at Fleet were as high as 200 million U.S.
dollars, investigators said. A fleet spokesman said the bank does
not comment on ongoing investigations.
</P>
<P>
Several other banks, including BankBoston and J.P. Morgan, have
begun their own internal investigations after identifying
suspicious accounts. Both banks declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
The accounts belong to or are linked to Benex Worldwide, a
trading company headed by Peter Berlin, a Russian emigrant who is
married to a former Bank of New York executive Lucy Edwards.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are looking into allegations that more than 15
billion including up to 10 billion U.S. dollars from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans, was diverted by Russians
illegally abroad.

According to U.N. diplomats, on the issue of Iraq, the five

<HEADLINE> Italian President Urges Italy to Keep Up With Euro Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi Thursday called for a concerted effort at all levels to
help boost Italy's production and prevent the nation from being
left behind by its euro area partners.
</P>
<P>
"In the last two or three years we aren't running as fast as
everyone else in Europe," said Ciampi to local administrators at
the start of a two-day visit to the central region of Abruzzo.
</P>
<P>
The president called on politicians and administrators at all
levels to mount "a joint effort to create a climate of confidence"
in which businesses could produce and expand.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi said the concerted effort by politicians, business,
unions and administrators was especially necessary in the
depressed south, or Mezzogiorno, where several local development
projects were languishing.
</P>
<P>
In further remarks after meeting a group of workers from
struggling local firms, Ciampi stressed that wage and contract
flexibility should not be seen only in negative terms but also as
a chance for continual retraining.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promises Help for Israeli-Palestinian Final Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton said on Thursday that the United States would do what it
could to help Israel and the Palestinians achieve a final status
agreement in accordance with their agreed timetable.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks at a photo session at the
White House with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who came to
Washington with some new ideas on ways to push forward the peace
process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"He (Arafat) and (Israeli) Prime Minister (Ehud) Barak have
agreed on a very ambitious timetable, to have a framework
agreement by February, final agreement by next September. The
United States is prepared to do all we can to assist them in
coming to an agreement," Clinton told reporters at the photo
session.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak have set a one-year timetable for talks
aimed at a final status agreement that will deal with the issue
of Palestinian statehood and, hopefully, a lasting peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
With Arafat seated to his right, Clinton called on Congress to
approve funding for Israel and the Palestinians. The financial
assistance to Israel and the Palestinians were promised by Clinton
when the two sides agreed to sign a land-for-security deal at the
Wye River, Maryland, last October.
</P>
<P>
"We should first ... meet our obligations under the Wye
agreement, and I hope that Congress will give me the funding
both for Israel and for the Palestinian Authority, so that we
can meet our obligations there," Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Cashew Workers Demonstrate Outside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Parliament
</P>
<P>
 MAPUTO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's National Union
of Cashew Workers (SINTIC) on Thursday held a demonstration
outside the parliament, calling on deputies to pass a bill
designed to protect the cashew processing industry.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 workers from two paralyzed Maputo processing plants
gathered at the Assembly to demand a total ban on the export of
raw cashews.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of the trade in raw cashews was imposed by
the World Bank on the government in 1995. With cashew nuts
exported to India, rather than sold to the local industry, the
factories have found themselves starved of raw materials, and
forced to close, throwing thousands of workers into unemployment.
</P>
<P>
A message to the Assembly read out by SINTIC general secretary
 Boaventura Mondlane, said that the policy of export
liberalization had led to the closure of 15 out of Mozambique's 16
sizeable processing factories.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 cashew workers had definitively lost their jobs,
while a further 7,000 have had their work contracts suspended
indefinitely, without any compensation.
</P>
<P>
"The government is passively watching the collapse of an
industry that has played, and can still play, an important role in
the country's economic and social development," he accused.

LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Renewed confidence in the
price of oil and better-than-expected UK trade figures Thursday
helped the London market shake off its recent nerves over interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE-100 index closed just under 1 percent higher at
5,969.7, a gain of 56 points. However, it failed to hang on to
gains above the psychologically important 6,000 level.
</P>
<P>
Reassurance from oil-producing countries that they would not
slacken their production quotas brought some confidence back over
the future of oil prices.
</P>
<P>
BP Amoco and Shell, which between them dominate the FTSE-100
index, both put on a spurt through the day, though Shell fell back
in the last hours.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Dax share index gained more than 1 percent with
telecoms and engineering group Mannesmann soaring more than 7
percent after it announced plans to divide into two separate
companies.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 in Paris managed to hold on to most of its earlier
gains to close 0.7 percent higher at 4,601.24, a rise of 33
points.
</P>
<P>
Traders said much of the lift was due to technical rebounds
after recent losing session, although upbeat economic data in
France and Germany also helped sentiment.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Wipe out Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The main sectors of the
Mozambican economy have been carrying out concrete plans to deal
with the "millennium bug", Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi said that all sectors would have plans to convert their
 computer systems and emergency plans completed by November.
</P>
<P>
 "Mozambique is seriously preparing for a peaceful transition
of the millennium, through the development of actions to reduce
the negative impact of the millennium bug," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that all public services, such as telecommunications,
the banking system, aviation, health, finance, electricity and
water supply, among others, are becoming ever readier to deal with
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi explained that besides updating Mozambican computer
systems, so that they are Y2K compliant, the country is also
developing an emergency plan, which consists of a number of
alternative procedures to allow the continued functioning of
public services, even if computer systems happen to fail.
</P>
<P>
He said this is the result of a growing conviction that,
although the country's stock of computers is currently small, any
failure to deal with the problem may affect many services.
</P>
<P>
The banking system is expected to complete its adjustments by
30 September, telecommunications should be ready by the end of
November, and aviation has already completed the job.
</P>
<P>
 To deal with the situation, the Mozambican government has
created a Technical Support Unit dealing specifically with the
"Millennium Bug", and has passed a decree imposing full
responsibility on the suppliers for any sales of computer systems
that are not compatible with the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officials Expect Kosovo Independence, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Senior U.S. officials have
privately dropped their opposition to Kosovo's independence from
Yugoslavia and say the Clinton administration increasingly sees
the province's secession as inevitable, a leading U.S. newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported from Pristina, Yugoslavia, that
officials say the emerging consensus, which amounts to a major
shift for the U.S., is already having a significant impact on the
international peacekeeping operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has become a leading advocate for the
creation of independent institutions and legal structures that
tend to isolate the fledging United Nations protectorate from
Yugoslavia's manifold economic problems and political troubles,"
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. officials deny that the administration's
approach is meant to engineer the further breakup of Yugoslavia,
as the Belgrade government claims.
</P>
<P>
The officials added that sovereignty issues should not be
allowed to stand in the way of Kosvo's progress because it will
likely gain its independence anyway.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody in Washington expects this not happen," said a U.S.
official who spoke on condition he not be identified. "Our
attitude before the war was, it's better if it doesn't happen.
Now, we know it's clearly on the way...It's the mostly unspoken
assumption" of all U.S. policy makers.
</P>
<P>
But the newspaper continues to say that Washington declared
that the administration has not altered its policy. The U.S. is
opposed to the independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We support the creation of democratic institutions and a
market economy, and that's the focus of our effort," said a White
House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said, "We have always
said we do not support independence for Kosovo, and we do not
support independence for Kosovo now."

relatives in Taiwan or return to Taiwan as quickly as possible,"
an official said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister: PLA Foreign Exchange Achievements " Notable" (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking back over the past 50 years, Chi pointed out that "
China's active military diplomacy has promoted mutual
understanding and trust between Chinese armies and armies
worldwide."
</P>
<P>
"Through the exchange, China has not only learned the latest
developments in army building abroad, but also displayed to the
world that the Chinese army is a mighty and civilized force," said
Chi. He added that China's military foreign exchange has
effectively promoted state diplomacy in seeking an international
environment of long-term peace and stability and guaranteeing the
sustained, rapid and sound economic development of the country.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, the PLA has further consolidated its
good-neighborly friendship with armies of surrounding countries,
promoted the traditional friendship and cooperation with other
developing countries, and gradually established and then
maintained normal relationships with industrialized countries, Chi
said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the development of China's military diplomacy has been
"multi-dimensional, multi-leveled and wide-ranging," noted Chi.
</P>
<P>
It's a basic starting point of China's military diplomacy to
develop good-neighborly friendly ties with neighboring countries.
The PLA's effort to build a stronger military tie with neighboring
countries has in turn helped win a peaceful and stable environment
for the country.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, China has signed several treaties with bordering
countries like Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
India aimed at increasing mutual trust, safeguarding border
security, which in turn promoted stability and prosperity in each
country.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Chinese army has continued its ties with
the old friends in developing countries in west Asia, Africa and
Latin America, and also contacted armies in the West such as the U.
S., Britain and France.

<HEADLINE> Manila May Ban Duty-free Importation of Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Agriculture Department of
the Philippines said Friday it may recommend the ban on the
duty-free importation of more sensitive agricultural products such
as rice, sugar, onions and garlic.
</P>
<P>
The government already banned the importation and sale of
chicken, pork and beef by duty-free shops on September 7, aimed at
helping the agriculture sector become more efficient and
competitive.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said in a statement that
the continued importation of these products by the duty-free
shops, coupled with massive smuggling, pose unfair competition to
local producers.
</P>
<P>
Angara said agricultural products are being shipped in the
country through various entry points.
</P>
<P>
"Massive smuggling of agricultural products is worse than that
in duty-free shops," he said.
</P>
<P>
Angara noted the volume imported through the duty-free shops is
small compared to massive smuggling, adding that 40 percent of
meat products sold in groceries are smuggled.
</P>
<P>
He said the share of duty-free shops' importation of these
products is also unusually high and disproportionate to total
imports.
</P>
<P>
For instance, importation of these shops accounted for 33
percent of total chicken imports, 11 percent of pork imports and
nine percent of beef imports as of end-August, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister: PLA Foreign Exchange Achievements " Notable" (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking on China's military ties with the U.S., Chi said that
"Sino-U.S. military exchange is an important part of bilateral
relations, and has trod a rocky road, recording in history both
wide-ranging exchanges and tortuous experiences."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "as President Jiang Zemin has indicated, China
and the U.S., both influential countries worldwide, have major
responsibilities for maintaining peace and stability in the region
and the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
"We should carry out exchanges with the U.S. in line with the
principles of mutual respect, reciprocal treatment and seeking
similarities while reserving differences," Chi added, stressing
that the stable and sound development of Sino-U.S. relations
benefits not only both countries but also the world.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the PLA came to its present stage of development in
military diplomacy, Chi responded that the reason lies in the "
unswerving adherence to the Deng Xiaoping thought on diplomacy in
the new period and Jiang Zemin's important exposition on diplomacy.
"
</P>
<P>
Chi continued that the rise in national strength as a result of
the reforms and opening-up also created favorable conditions for
army foreign exchange, while the drastic change in the world after
the end of the Cold War also created opportunities for exchanges
between armies to further develop.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Calls for Resumption of Danube Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 24 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder called for the implementation of the Balkans Stability
Pact "as soon as possible." The pact was agreed upon in July to
help rebuild the region.
</P>
<P>
While meeting Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, Schroeder
said his country will make contributions toward the resumption of
navigation on the Danube, adding that it depends on the attitude
of the Yugoslav side.
</P>
<P>
NATO blasted Yugoslavia for 11 weeks and destroyed bridges on
the Danube. The blockage of the river, Europe's second longest
after the Volga, has caused financial losses for countries such as
Romania and Bulgaria. The river is a key trade route with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's visit to Romania was his third stop on a three-day
tour of the Balkans. He was in Albania and Bulgaria earlier.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Constantinescu said Schroeder's visit to Romania
is the first one for a German Chancellor in 21 years. The
president said the visit has very important political implications
and will boost bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The German leader also discussed Romania's EU hopes. After
talks with Prime Minister Radu Vasile Thursday, he said Bucharest'
s hopes of joining the European Union depend on "its own efforts."
</P>
<P>
Romania is in the second wave of EU applicant countries, along
with Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Malta.

<HEADLINE> China's Minority Nationalities Games Open in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese premier Zhu Rongji
declared open the Sixth National Games for Traditional Sports of
Minority Nationalities at a three-hour, colorful ceremony at the
Workers' Stadium here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in its 46-year history that the event is
staged in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The Games opened at a perfect timing to coincide with a
traditional Chinese festival, which also provide a prelude to days
' celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the founding on October
1, 1949, of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The quadrennial sports gala kicked-off as the world's most
populous country is permeated in the annual Mid-Autumn Festival -
a time for family reunion, moon-watching and an enjoyment of
traditional Chinese food of "moon cakes".
</P>
<P>
A near-capacity crowd of 60,000 in the stadium took a first
taste of week-long National Day celebrations extended from the
first three days of October, which are official national holidays.
</P>
<P>
Over 3,000 athletes, dressed up in exotic and picturesque
costumes representing the 56 nationalities in China, paraded into
the giant stadium at the outset of the festivities. Also present
at the VIP sector of the stands were senior Chinese leaders Li
Ruihuan and Li Lanqing.
</P>
<P>
Amid a carnival atmosphere, a three-part performance themed "
China of Excellence" unfolded as 7,000 middle school students took
the central floor with music and dance in colors of blue, white
and red, symbolizing the sea, snow and fire.
</P>
<P>
With a vivid backdrop reflecting the unique life of China's
minority nationalities, the splendid display translated the field
into a sea of jubilation for the country's prosperity and ethnic
harmony.
</P>
<P>
A glamorous fireworks show brought to a close of the
spectacular, multi-cultural night, which was broadcast live on
television both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Sixth version of the National Minority Nationalities Games,
with more than 6,000 participants including some 3,000 athletes
for 10 medal sports and 114 demonstration events being staged here,
are to last through September 30.
</P>
<P>
Competitions with three medal sports and over 40 demonstration
events were held August 18-23 in Lhasa, capital of Tibet
Autonomous Region, which served as a branch venue for this year's
Games.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Stresses "One-China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepal will stick to the
"one China" policy and maintain that Taiwan and the Tibet
Autonomous Region are inseparable parts of China, said Nepali
Prime Minister Krishna Bhattarai here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a talk program on the occasion of the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China,
Bhattarai said that Nepal will not allow any activities to be
staged against China in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai said that Nepal cherishes its good relations with
China and the friendship between the two neighboring countries
will last forever, no matter what changes take place in the world.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed his sincere wish for China to
become stronger both in the political and economic arena, saying
"a stronger China will be helpful to Nepal for its social and
economic development."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Zeng Xuyong said on the occasion
that China consistently pursues the independent foreign policy of
peace and develops good-neighborly friendships with Nepal on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
"During the past several decades, China-Nepal relations have
seen sustained, steady and sound development, and withstood the
tests of time and changing international situation," said Zeng.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that economic cooperation between China and Nepal has
been fruitful and effective, adding that China has offered Nepal
economic and technological assistance, completing 27 projects
including roads, factories, hydro-power stations, irrigation,
transportation, international convention center, hospital, and
sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
Zeng also said that China's great achievements in the past 50
years, especially after the adoption of the reform and opening-up
policy in late 1970s, have proved that China's development path of
"building socialism with Chinese characteristics" is completely
correct.
</P>
<P>
The talk program was organized by the China Study Center of
Nepal, which is a non-governmental organization aiming to promote
the bilateral relations between China and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, Chairman of the
Communist Party of Nepal (ML) Sahana Pradhan and some 100 people
including government officials, scholars and journalists also
attended the program.

<P>
Turning to the international situation at the turn of the
century, Chi pointed out that "peace and development still remain
the theme of the time, but hegemonism, power politics and cold war
mentality still exist and are witnessing new developments."
</P>
<P>
"The reason why an argument such as 'human rights is more
important than sovereignty' has emerged lies in the motive of some
hegemonies, amidst the new international situation after the Cold
War, for the purpose of interfering in others' internal affairs,
containing, controlling and invading other countries, under the
pretext of human rights issues."
</P>
<P>
However, Chi said, tension in the international situation is
generally easing, which is why "there are more chances than
challenges, more hopes than difficulties for us."
</P>
<P>
Chi vowed that in the 21st century, the PLA diplomacy will "
continue as always to serve and be subordinate to the state
diplomacy, develop friendly ties with all armies in the world,
carry out wide-ranging dialogue and cooperation and enhance mutual
understanding and trust."
</P>
<P>
This will show the world that "the PLA is not only a just,
peaceful and civilized force faithfully implementing China's
independent foreign policy for peace, but also a mighty force
safeguarding regional and world peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Finally, Chi stressed that "the PLA should be vigilant for
peace," adding that national defense construction should be
strengthened, that the army should be strengthened, both in terms
of technology and in general, following the path of army-building
with Chinese characteristics, so as to be ready at any moment for
safeguarding the national sovereignty, unity and security, and the
national pride."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Holds Open Session on Small Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday held an open meeting on small arms, which, though
small in size and light in weapons, have created big casualties in
the world today.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan opened the meeting, which is
held at ministerial level at the initiative of the president of
the 15-nation Security Council, Arnold Peter van Walsum of the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Council meeting, Annan said, "The proliferation
of small arms, ammunition and explosives has also aggravated the
violence associated with terrorism and organized crime."
</P>
<P>
"Even in societies not beset by civil war, the easy
availability of small arms has in many cases contributed to
violence and political stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Council met in a closed-door session Thursday in
preparation of the formal meeting.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations said in an early August report that the
world is awash in more than 500 million small arms and light
weapons, the weapon of choice in many contemporary conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, long focused on nuclear weapons and
conventional disarmament, has become increasingly concerned over
the role of small arms, particularly in internal conflicts and in
the hands of insurgents, criminals and terrorist groups. The world
body plans to hold an international conference on the illicit arms
trade by 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
The policy is meant to safeguard national sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and also to create a stable international
and surrounding environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the early days of New China, independence and self-reliance
were the outstanding features of the country's diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva Conference in 1954 marked China's debut on the
international stage, and the Chinese delegation, headed by late
Premier Zhou Enlai, had played an active role in promoting the
settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue and the relaxing of the
situation in Indo-China.
</P>
<P>
As early as in 1953, Premier Zhou put forward the five
principles of peaceful co-existence. At the Bandung Conference in
1955, advocated by China, the Bandung principles were reached
based on the five principles, and China thus became an important
force in safeguarding peace and fighting against imperialism and
colonialism.
</P>
<P>
Today, the five principles have turned out to be the well-
recognized basic principles in guiding nation-to-nation relations,
Qian said.

From the late 1960s to the late 1970s, the U.S. and the other
western countries adjusted their foreign policies towards China
out of their own concerns, and late Chairman Mao Zedong also put
forward his idea the "three worlds" division according to the
world situation, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in 1971, Dr. Henry Kissinger's secret visits to
China started contact between China and the U.S., and in January,
1979, the two countries formally established diplomatic relations.
In 1972, China and Japan normalized their relations.
</P>
<P>
At the 26th UN General Assembly in 1971, China restored all of
its legal rights in the UN, which marks the resumption of the
country's status in the international community.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, Qian said, late leader Deng Xiaoping, in
keeping with the changes in the world, decided to shift the
country's priority to economic development, and adjusted China's
foreign policy accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The core of China's diplomacy in the new period is to stick to
the independent foreign policy of peace, oppose hegemonism,
safeguard world peace, promote common development, and create a
long-term and stable world environment.

<P>
In the 20 years of China's reform and opening up, the country
has made considerable achievements in the diplomatic field, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that relations with developing countries have been
reinforced, a sound surrounding environment has been created, a
relatively stable framework of big-country relations has been set
up, and with the gradual realization of the notion of "one country,
two systems", the reunification cause of the motherland has been
steadily moved forward.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest developing country, and a permanent
member of the UN Security Council, China is a force in
safeguarding world peace and promoting common development, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
On important issues related to peace and war, China has always
supported justice, and advocated peaceful settlement of world
conflicts. During the Asian financial crisis, China, although
under great pressure, has maintained the value of the RMB, which
in turn has contributed immensely to the regional and world
economies.
</P>
<P>
On the control of military equipment, Qian noted, China
unilaterally committed itself as early as in the 1960s not to be
the first to use nuclear weapons, and not to use or threaten to
use nuclear weapons towards nuclear-free countries or regions.
</P>
<P>
China also has actively participated in the international
disarmament, and the multi-lateral economic and social activities,
he said. In the human rights sector in particular, he noted, China
has made noteworthy achievements, so far signing 17 international
human rights conventions.

<P>
Qian pointed out China's present diplomatic work faces two
major challenges.
</P>
<P>
First, the world is unstable and uncertainties are increasing,
hegemonism and power politics have developed anew, the trend to
strengthen military alliance and to interfere in other country's
internal affairs under the excuse of human rights or humanity is
becoming more pervasive, and the theme and principles of the UN
Charter and the universally-recognized principles governing
international relations are being tested.
</P>
<P>
Second, with the globalization of the economy, the gap between
the rich and the poor is widening, and the controversy between the
south and the north is increasing.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, opportunities outweigh challenges in China's
diplomatic sphere. In the ten years since the end of the Cold War,
the world situation has been gearing towards an easing of tensions,
offering no reason for world war.
</P>
<P>
Although the road towards multi-polarisation is winding, such a
developing trend is irrevocable, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he believes that as long as China sticks to the main
task of economic development, continues its reform and opening up,
and follows the independent foreign policy of peace, the country
will be prosperous, and its diplomatic work will be more fruitful.

HARBIN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A sino-Russian trading zone
was set up today in northeast China's Suifenhe City, an important
port city for Sino-Russian border trade.
</P>
<P>
The new trading zone is a special economic zone with an area of
6.5 square km, covering most part of Suifenhe's downtown area.
</P>
<P>
Russian citizens may enter the zone with simple certificates
and may enjoy favorable policies about their economic activities

<HEADLINE> African Nations Urged to Respect, Protect Women's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Friday urged the African countries to respect
and protect women's rights while sparing no efforts to eliminate
war and poverty in the continent.
</P>
<P>
In an address to celebrate the 1999 Pan-African Women's Day in
OAU headquarters in Addis Ababa, OAU Assistant Secretary-General
Mahamat Habib Doutoum attached great importance to the role of
women in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Generations of African women, both literate and illiterate,
have contributed their quota to the enriching and strengthening of
their great continent," Doutoum said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU saluted the African women with pride, encouragement and
support for their human endurance in their indefatigable efforts
to maintain the social, economic and cultural structure of Africa
and their continued struggle for a just and peaceful society.
</P>
<P>
"The African women's commitment to protecting, reconstructing
and transforming our countries towards recovery and sustainable
development, while at the same demanding their inalienable rights
to take their rightful place on various socio-economic, political
and cultural issues on the basis of equality and principles of
democracy, must be promoted and enhanced," he said.
</P>
<P>
Doutoum noted that inequality and discrimination against women
in public and private life, among others, remain serious problems
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Millions of girls are being raised in an environment of
neglect, overwork and are often abused simply because they are
female," the OAU official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"In many (African) countries, girls are fed less than their
brothers, forced to work harder, provided with less schooling
opportunities and denied equal access to medical care. They marry
earlier and face greater risks of dying in adolescence or early
adulthood," he added.
</P>
<P>
Doutoum also called on all African governments and people to
reconsider their commitments to curbing regional conflicts and
wars and to alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is a priority as it is a prerequisite for the
development and the advancement of women in particular," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pan-African Women's Day was first declared on July 31, 1962
in Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
It was on that day that the first ever Pan-African Women's
Organization was born at the first ever African Women's
Conference.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Support Court of Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The 21 member states of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) have been
urged to support the Court of Justice for its next budget.
</P>
<P>
Judge Josaphat Kanywanyi, president of the COMESA Court of
Justice, told a press conference in Lusaka Friday that the court
is very important for the region, which will resolve some
conflicts involving its member states.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the COMESA Court of Justice is a milestone
in history and the development of the regional organization, said
Kanywanyi.
</P>
<P>
However, he said since the court was established in 1994 as one
of the independent organs of the common market, it hasn't done
much in terms of operations due to lack of funding from the
members.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the court only got 500 U.S. dollars from its member
states' contribution.
</P>
<P>
The president appealed to the member states to contribute to
the Court of Justice so that it can start working as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The common market aims to achieve a free trade area by October
31, 2000.

SOFIA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia has agreed to increase
its natural gas supply to Turkey from the present 28.5 million
cubic meters per day to 32-34 million cubic meters per day from
January 1, 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today
published a speech delivered by vice-president Hu Jintao at an
awarding ceremony for outstanding social scientific achievements
on September 23.
</P>
<P>
Philosophy and social sciences have entered a new period of
development and prosperity since the Third Plenary Session of the
11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in
1978, Hu said at the ceremony, which was co-sponsored by the
Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee and the National
Philosophy and Social Sciences Planning and Leading Group.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said that researchers in the fields of
philosophy and social sciences have promoted the development of
various communist and socialist thoughts and theories from
different historical periods and made major contributions to the
creation and public awareness of the Party's basic lines,
principles and policies during the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Since China's reform and opening policies were launched in 1978,
the research of philosophy and social sciences have led to major
findings and cultivated a group of innovative researchers known
for their creative ideas, he said.
</P>
<P>
China and the rest of the world have entered an important
period at the turn of the country. The Chinese people should try
to develop new thoughts, points of views, methods and areas of
inquiry in accordance with the country's actual conditions, and
raise the research of philosophy and social sciences to a new
level, Hu said.

<P>
The social practices of the people are a driving force for the
development of social sciences, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The research in this field should help promote socialist
modernization, enhance democratic and scientific decision-making,
and safeguard the basic interests of the masses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Social sciences researchers must practice the Marxist study
technique of integrating theory with practice and focus on
practical issues involved in the reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Hu urged social science researchers to learn from the masses,
explore the law of economic, political and cultural development,
and combine theory with practice.
</P>
<P>
While focusing on basic scientific research, the research
bodies should fully develop new and pioneering areas of science,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that educators should be democratic in their work, and
that schools should compete with each other in the realm of social
sciences.
</P>
<P>
Emancipating people's minds, seeking truth from facts, bravely
exploring and pioneering are the requirements for social
scientific research development, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu called on researchers to closely follow important issues in
the world and the country and learn from all outstanding
achievements made by mankind.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hu said, a new management system in social science
research which is in line with the socialist market economy should
be established in order to make new breakthroughs in the field.
</P>
<P>
Flourishing social sciences are necessary if the nation is to
be rejuvenated through science and education, he said, adding that
the success of social sciences are a reflection of the overall
quality and cultural strength of a nation, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes all levels of society will support the
research in social sciences.

sciences to study Marxism and Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and
Deng Xiaoping Theory, adopt proper outlooks on the world and life,
and master the use of dialectical materialism and historical
materialism.
</P>
<P>
Gaining a better understanding of the fundamental theoretical
and practical problems which crop up during the process of the
development of the reform should be a major aim for the studies in
philosophy and social sciences, he said.
</P>
<P>
Social science workers should help people to correctly assess
some crucial theoretical and political issues and improve their
ideology and political awareness, Hu stressed.
</P>
<P>
They should explain to people how to better understand the
complicated international situation, and miss no opportunities to
speed up the development of the country, he said, adding that
social science workers should use their findings to help the
country survive international competition and struggles.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian mission's flight
to East Timor was delayed Thursday by the country's two aging
Hercules military transport planes, according to the Globe and
Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
One of the C-130 Hercules had to abort its flight from the
Canadian air base Trenton for the third time this week because of
a broken gyro-compass navigation system, the report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The flight was resumed six hours later after ground crews
replaced the system.
</P>
<P>
Another mechanical problem brought down the second C-130
Hercules as it limped between refueling stops in Fiji and Darwin,
Australia, the report said. A malfunctioning cabin pressurization
system prevented the plane from climbing above 3,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
The two planes were mobilized to fly troops and emergency
supplies for the Australia-led peacekeeping mission in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Defense Minister Art Eggleton was quoted as saying
Thursday that problems sometimes arise, but what is important is
that the planes were able to land safely and still able to do a
good job.

<HEADLINE> France, Italy to Build New Railway, Merge Oil Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- France and Italy have agreed to
build a new high speed railway between the French central city
Lyon and the Italian city Turin and will give greenlight to a
possible merger of the oil industries of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said on Friday in Nimes,
southern France, where he had his annual summit with Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema on Thursday and Friday, that the two
countries will present the final plan to build the Lyon-Turin
railway in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have confirmed the project after a fire
disaster in the automobile tunnel in the Mont Blanc mountains in
the Alps took place in the spring this year.
</P>
<P>
The construction of such a railway, called "trans-Alps rail
expressway", will be completed in 13 to 16 years and will cost 11
billion euros (11.6 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The French president and Italian prime minister also said that
they would not oppose a merger between the French oil group Elf-
Total-Fina and the Italian group ENI, although such a move should
be decided by the enterprises themselves.
</P>
<P>
Elf and Total-Fina have recently struck a merger deal to build
the world's fourth largest group in oil and chemical field.
</P>
<P>
The general director of ENI, Vittorio Mincato, said this week
that his group is ready to set up an alliance with Elf-Total-Fina.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister: PLA Foreign Exchange Achievements " Notable" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian said here today that high-level foreign exchanges
conducted by officials of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (
PLA) have scored "notable" achievements since the People's
Republic of China was founded 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and
a state councilor, made the statement during an interview with
Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi pointed out that the PLA exchange with foreign militaries "
was established by the elder proletarian revolutionaries" and has
"grown steadily thanks to the care of the three generations of
China's Communist Party (CPC) leadership."
</P>
<P>
No sooner had New China been founded than Chinese leaders Mao
Zedong and Zhou Enlai began their trailblazing efforts to set up
friendly ties between Chinese armies and armies of Soviet Union
and other socialist countries.
</P>
<P>
Chi noted that "China's military exchange has contributed
positively to the worldwide campaign for national independence and
liberation."
</P>
<P>
Since the convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th
CPC Central Committee, the second-generation leadership with Deng
Xiaoping at the core "not only gradually established and promoted
army exchanges with the third world countries, but also
steadfastly increased military exchange with some industrialized
countries like the United States."
</P>
<P>
"PLA foreign exchange has stepped into an era of unprecedented
vigor and vitality when it comes to the current CPC leadership,"
Chi said, adding that President Jiang Zemin and other state
leaders not only offer important suggestions, but themselves meet
with foreign army leaders.

"In the wake of the reforms and opening-up, China's military
foreign exchange has entered a new development period," said Chi.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has carried out military exchanges with over 100
countries, and has stationed military attaches in more than 90
countries. China has sent 1,300 military groups abroad, while more
than 2,100 delegations have visited China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, military foreign exchange has successfully expanded
to middle and lower levels, and to specialized areas like military
scientific research, military medical science, academic exchange,
and technical cooperation. Both the "scope and depth" of military
exchanges have been broadened.
</P>
<P>
It is worth noting that the Chinese navy, following its maiden
voyage in the 1980s to three South Asian nations, for the first
time crossed the Pacific Ocean in 1997 and arrived on the American
continent where it visited the U.S., Mexico, Peru and Chile.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Chinese army has "responsibly
attended regional bilateral and multi-lateral security dialogue of
all-levels and all-forms, participated in global arms control and
disarmament and the UN. peacekeeping activities, thus becoming an
active force in the international military stage."
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, China has dispatched over a thousand engineering
troops and military observers to attend UN peacekeeping missions.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Decides to Delay Enactment of Security Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to delay the promulgation of the State of Danger
Management Bill passed by the House of Representatives (DPR) on
Thursday, a military spokesman told reporters here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Indonesian Military (TNI) Information Service Maj.
Gen. Sudradjat said the promulgation of the bill will be delayed
until all layers of Indonesian society have gained a thorough
understanding of its contents and purpose.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision was announced after two days of
student-led mass protests that degenerated into bloody clashes
with security forces in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Sudradjat said the mounting protests had occurred because of
the public's poor understanding of the purpose and substance of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
Initiated by university students, the demonstrations had also
been infiltrated by hoodlums and criminals, he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts had to be made to familiarize the public with the bill
so that they would have a better knowledge and understanding of
its substance, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the street clashes over the bill in Jakarta, dozens of
civilians were wounded while three civilians and a policemen died,
according to hospital and police sources.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Intensify Efforts in Combating Corruption: Han </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua)-- China's top prosecutor pledged
here today that procuratorates at all levels will intensify
efforts to combat corruption.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhubin, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, said China has made notable progress in curbing
bribery, embezzlement, abuse of power and other crimes relating to
official duties, but the results are far from satisfactory in the
eye of the public, he said.
</P>
<P>
Han made the remark at a national conference on anti-
corruption drive. Participants have been discussing draft
regulations on standardizing investigation procedures and
improving the prosecutorial mechanism used in corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, people's procuratorates' anti-corruption
departments have dealt with more than 103,000 bribery and
embezzlement cases, arrested some 115,000 suspects, and recovered
10 billion yuan worth of lost property, statistics show.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel is deploying
thousands of extra police and soldiers all over the country in
preparation for the week-long Jewish holiday of Succot, which
begins at sunset Friday.
</P>
<P>
Roadblocks and patrols will be beefed up and security
forces will be deployed in public areas such as bus stations,
markets and shopping malls, the police have said.
</P>
<P>
The public is also called upon to be alert.
</P>
<P>
There seems to be no closure of the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip this Succot.
</P>
<P>
Israel customarily sealed off the two areas one day ahead of
Jewish holidays out of security considerations, a move that is
condemned by the Palestinians as "collective punishment."
</P>
<P>
Following closely on the heels of the solemn Jewish New Year
and Yom Kippur, or Day of Atonement, Succot is a joyous holiday to
celebrate a good harvest, when people often live in small huts or
booths made of boards and leafy branches on their balconies.

<HEADLINE> WHO Recommends Influenza Vaccine for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO has decided on the components of the influenza vaccine for
the year 2000 (the influenza season for the southern hemisphere)
and informed vaccine manufacturers of their decision.
</P>
<P>
According to a WHO press release Friday, the influenza vaccine
for the year 2000 should contain the following:
</P>
<P>
-- An A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2)-like virus;
</P>
<P>
-- An A/Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus;
</P>
<P>
-- A B/Beijing/184/93-like virus or a B/Shandong/7/97-like
virus.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations health agency recommends the use of vaccine
as an effective preventive measure against this potentially fatal
disease.
</P>
<P>
It estimates that about 50 to 80 percent of vaccine recipients
will be protected against the disease when there is good match
between the vaccine and strains of influenza virus that are in
circulation.
</P>
<P>
Most of the population has been previously infected with or
exposed to influenza A (H3N2), Influenza A (H1N1) and influenza B
viruses. The population is also known to have some degree of
residual immunity, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, it said, one dose of influenza vaccine should
be sufficient for all ages except young children. Previously
unimmunized children should receive two doses of vaccine with an
interval of at least four weeks.
</P>
<P>
WHO recommends the vaccine composition for the northern
hemisphere each year in February. In 1998, it began to hold
consultations in September to formulate a recommendation for the
composition of inactivated influenza vaccines intended for winter
in the southern hemisphere which occurs from May to September the
following year.
</P>
<P>
The timing of WHO's recommendations is critical to allow
sufficient time for companies to produce the vaccine before the
new influenza season starts.

PYONGYANG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) will freeze test launches of long-range
missiles during talks with the United States, the Korean Central
News Agency (KCNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We will, for the time being, hold talks aimed at solving
pending issues between Korea and the United States at the request
of the United States. And in order to create an atmosphere more
favorable for the talks, we will not launch a missile for the
duration of the talks," a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman told the
KCNA.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. announcement last week about partially
easing economic sanctions against the DPRK had created a positive
atmosphere for negotiations to help solve issues between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged the U.S. not to stop at just announcing
decisions to ease sanctions related to trade and investment, but
to put the words into deeds at an early date as well as totally
abandon policies hostile to the DPRK and lift all remaining
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He said Pyongyang would respond in good faith and seek to
eliminate suspicion on the U.S. side if the U.S. abandons the
hostile policies and genuinely works for better relations.

<HEADLINE> Few Southern African Women Work in Media: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Less than 15 percent of the
media workers in southern Africa are women, a study on gender
employment patterns in the media shows.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of African Media Women in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) has looked at the employment trends
in 37 media organizations in the country with a view to
ascertaining the needs of women workers and the barriers to their
advancement.
</P>
<P>
The study report released in Harare Thursday also found that
there were low numbers of women working in senior and mid-level
media structures, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the majority of cases, the study revealed that most of the
women employed in media organizations worked as secretaries and
that lack of well- trained female workers reduced chances for
women in senior positions.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, Mavis Moyo, chairperson of the
Federation of African Media Women, said that the findings could be
used as a guideline for media organizations and development
agencies in their efforts to redress the prevailing gender
imbalances.
</P>
<P>
"If gender training becomes an integral part of media training,
this will pave the way and create more opportunities for women in
management positions in the media," Moyo said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Schools, Firms to Undergo Quake Drills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Schools and big corporations
are the first targets of the Philippine government in drills to
prepare for any possible occurrence of an earthquake, the
Presidential Palace said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Secretary Orlando
Mercado of the Department of National Defense has already worked
out a program for such drills.
</P>
<P>
"We will start with the schools and corporations. These are
probably the best places and locations for earthquake drills, and
we will be doing that pretty soon," Zamora said at a meeting held
in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Mercado, who also chairs the National Disaster
Coordinating Council (NDCC), has already stressed the need for
earthquake drills to minimize the impact of such calamities.
</P>
<P>
Zamora pointed out that the Philippines is an earthquake-prone
country, with many of its provinces likely to be severely affected
when a major earthquake strikes.
</P>
<P>
Also, Zamora said the Department of Public Works and Highways
is continuing its risk assessment of structures that may be prone
to earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mercado urged local government units (LGUs) to
fulfill their responsibilities to hold drills and prepare their
constituents for disasters such as earthquakes, floods and fires.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the NDCC would hold next year a "Disaster
Olympics" to heighten public awareness of the need for
preparedness, adisaster
preparedness of the public, following a powerful pre-dawn
earthquake that hit Taiwan, China, last Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Break Up Telecom Monopoly Through Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to set up, through
open biding, a competitor of the Nigeria Telecommunications
Limited (NITEL), the state owned and only existing telecom firm,
said the country's Communications Minister of State Alhaji Elewi
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, this was to ensure probity and
accountability, which is a "focal point of this administration",
the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Friday quoted the
minister as saying during his inspection trip in Lagos, Nigeria's
commercial capital.
</P>
<P>
He said, the government was worried at the low level of telecom
 infrastructure in the country, and lack of additional telecom
carriers to compete with NITEL thereby creating choices for end
users.
</P>
<P>
In addition to overhauling NITEL and preparing it for
competition, the government was bent on reviving the Nigerian
Postal Services (NIPOST) to make it more viable and efficient,
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government was doing everything to solve
the interconnecting problem between NITEL and private operators.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the evaluation of telecom equipment is on because
government is anxious, but not desperate to improve the
telecommunications situation. We want to correct the ills of the
past 20 years", he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Host South Africa in Davis Cup Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- British number one Greg
Rusedski will open his team's Davis Cup relegation battle against
South Africa on Friday, knowing victory is essential if he is to
help his country stay in the competition's top flight.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski, sixth best in the world, will play outsider Neville
Godwin, 198th in the rankings, in the first rubber of the Davis
Cup group decider at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena.
</P>
<P>
South Africa are rank outsiders but both sides are aware that
defeat this weekend means relegation from the elite World Group of
16 nations for next year's competition.
</P>
<P>
Instead of ties against the likes of the United States, who
beat Britain so narrowly in Birmingham to put David Lloyd's team
on the brink of relegation, they will face only "second-division"
countries such as Israel.
</P>
<P>
Tim Henman and Rusedski, whose gripping five-set defeat to Jim
Courier saw America win by the narrowest of margins, are among the
world's top ten but relegation could have a damaging effect on
grass roots tennis in the country, says Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
"If we go down to the second division for want of a better word,
then that would be a disaster for British tennis, it really will
be a disaster.
</P>
<P>
"We spent four years getting up to the World Group, to go out
of it now when we've got a team that's actually capable of winning
it if things go right, that would be very, very bad for British
tennis," he said.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Solicit for 160-Million-Dollar Aid for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- World Food Program (WFP) will
ask the international community for a 160-million-u.s. dollar
humanitarian support for Angola, a WFP official was quoted as
saying here by Friday's Jornal de Angola newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Namanga Ngongi, visiting WFP's Assistant Director-Executive,
made the statement after a meeting with the Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos, adding that the appeal for aid, which will be
formulated in Rome in October, is not enough for the war-torn
country, because the number of the displaced people is increasing
day after day.
</P>
<P>
Ngongi, who considers the humanitarian situation in Angola as
"really tragic", said that he will solicit for additional support
in mid next year.
</P>
<P>
The high-ranking official of WFP said that the activity of his
organization in Angola in 1999 is estimated at more than 100
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
With the deterioration of the situation in the crowded cities
and the turbulent rural areas, Angola is confronted with a serious
humanitarian crisis, with most of the population suffering hunger
and pain caused by the war.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Angola and the United States signed a protocol on
humanitarian aid worth some 500,000 dollars, which will be used in
the construction of medical infrastructures, such as medical
center, sanitary equipment and the training of workers for
community health.

<P>
SINGAPORE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Share prices plunged across
the board on Singapore Stock Market Friday, dragged down by the
sharp fall on Wall Street and the bourse in Japan.
</P>

The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) dropped 49.39 points to
end at 2,019.01 in light dealings.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover was 191.74 million units valued at 493.03
million Singapore dollars (288.49 million U.S. dollars). Losers
outstripped gainers by 265 to 37 with 149 counters unchanged.
</P>

and the bourse in Japan, saying some funds were definitely getting
out with all the uncertainty on Wall Street.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling
Taliban militia Friday described as unfounded the Indian
allegation that Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden is involved in the
freedom struggle in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Osama has neither issued any statement nor met any person
since November 1998 and a recent statement about Kashmir
attributed to him was totally baseless," the News Network
International quoted Taliban representative in Islamabad Saeed-ur
Rahman Haqqani as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban were very surprised to see a fake statement that
Osama has declared Jehad (holy war) against India, Haqqani said,
adding that India has been making a hue and cry over the false
Osama statement to take benefit of the anti-Osama sentiments in
the western world.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban have already withdrawn all communication
facilities from the Saudi dissident and no one, including
journalists, was allowed to meet him.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani renewed the Taliban commitment not to allow the Saudi
dissident to use Afghan soil against any other country or
individual.
</P>
<P>
"Osama is a guest of Afghanistan and will be protected in
accordance with Afghan and Islamic traditions," said Haqqani.

<HEADLINE> Large LNG Plant Closed down in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The 3.8 billion U.S. dollar
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant located in southeast Nigeria has
been shut down following the continued siege by local protesters,
local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Jamieson, managing director of the Nigeria LNG, Ltd.,
who announced the closure of the plant Thursday said the
protesters from Bonny Island community in Rivers State still
blocked the roads leading to the plant and its outlying
facilities.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Indigenes of the Bonny Kingdom had
disrupted the normal operations of the plant since last Monday
when they began to demonstrate against alleged non-implementation
of the memorandum of understanding reached last year between the
local community and the companies operating in the area on
community development.
</P>
<P>
According to the plant's Deputy Managing Director Alhaji Gana,
the protesters have taken over the entire plant area and the roads
leading to the plant and its residential areas, thereby stalling
access to the nine water wells used in the production of LNG.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the shutdown, Jamieson said the plant which started
operation earlier this month was producing 6,000 tons of LNG per
day to enable the company to meet its October 1 deadline for the
export of the first LNG cargo.
</P>
<P>
By this development, he added, the October 1 scheduled delivery
of its first liquefied natural gas to overseas customers would not
be met.
</P>
<P>
Earlier,T.A.T. Allison, spokesman for the community, enumerated
 grievances over that the plant failed to provide potable water
and regular electricity to the local people and failed to employ
qualified indigenes of Bonny either as contract or permanent
staff.

<HEADLINE> New Technique Against Autoimmune Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli medical researchers
have developed a new genetic method to treat autoimmune diseases
and have claimed success in tests on mice, a local daily reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nathan Karin and his colleagues at the prestigious
Technion, or Israel Institute of Technology, used genetic
engineering to "vaccinate" the body with DNA, thus preventing the
immune system from mistakenly attacking tissue of the body, the
Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
In autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid
arthritis and type-I diabetes, the body's immune system attacks
the body's own tissue that it misidentifies as "enemy" or
"foreign" and triggers an inflammatory process.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Karin's group planted some segments of DNA into a viral
vector (carrier agent) through genetic engineering. After the
viral vector is injected into the leg muscle of lab animals,
antibodies against the proteins which are likely to cause
inflammation are created and the inflammatory process is quickly
controlled.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Irun Cohen, director of the Minerva Center for Research
into Autoimmune Diseases at the Weizmann Institute, was quoted by
the newspaper as calling the concept of naked DNA vaccination
"very significant."
</P>
<P>
"It is another example of how the immune system can be enlisted
to regulate its own affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said using this technique on humans at this point, however,
will be very premature, as its side effects are still unknown.
</P>
<P>
A Haifa scientific "incubator," a kind of support organization
that gives fledgling entrepreneurs an opportunity to develop
their innovative technological ideas, will be established to
complete the animal experiments and prepare for eventual clinical
trials on patients, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Urged to Adopt Positive Attitudes towards Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Singaporeans are urged to
adopt positive and realistic attitudes towards aging and the
elderly as the young nation is fast becoming an aging society.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan, who is
also the chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on
Aging Population, made the urging at a public forum organized by
the Community Development Ministry and the Institute of Policy
Studies on the recommendations to be made by the IMC.
</P>
<P>
Mah said that Singapore is one of the fastest aging societies
in the world as it is expected to take only about 21 years for the
proportion of persons, aged 65 and above, to double from current 7
percent to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that such a time-frame is much shorter compared
with Sweden which took 85 years, the United States which is
projected for 68 years and Japan which took 26 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Singapore now has about 235,000
older persons (or 7 percent of the population) and this will
increase to 796,000 (or 19 percent of the population) by the year
2030.
</P>
<P>
The dependency ratio, which is the ratio of those in the
economically inactive age group to those of working age is
currently 42 per hundred and this will remain relatively steady
till 2010 and then rise significantly to about 56 per hundred in
2030.
</P>
<P>
Mah said his committee will propose to embark on a national
drive of effective public education to change the individual's and
society's attitudes and perceptions of aging and elderly.
</P>
<P>
He noted all six IMC Workgroups recommended public education to
promote personal responsibility, life-long planning and early
preparation for the different phases in life, including old age.
</P>
<P>
Mah also said that his country's social security system should
be structured to put the onus for financial planning on the
individual and his committee will propose to do this through
promoting "Basic Needs CPF (Central Provident Fund) model" to
emphasize that CPF savings are only for subsistence living,
medical and housing needs.
</P>
<P>
This is to drive home the point that every individual has to
take responsibility for their desired retirement lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
Mah revealed that another IMC recommendation is to set up a
wide network of community-based services to support families and
the elderly to help them continue living in the community.
</P>
<P>
There must be integrated and proactive planning and delivery of
these services with a view to promote "aging in the place" so that
the elderly can stay in the community they are familiar with well
into old age, Mah said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mah, other recommendations include developmental
and preventive programs to harness the contributions of the
elderly and to support inter-generational cohesion and family care
in a bid to enable them to give service instead of just receiving
service.
</P>
<P>
IMC will also propose the government to review and extend its
policies for 2-tier families to 3-tier families so as to foster
inter-generational cohesion.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Official Lauds Improving Ties with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Sudanese official on
Friday spoke highly of the improvement of the relations between
his country and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Cairo for home after a three-day visit, Sudanese
Minister of Health Mahdi Babour Nimir told reporters that although
"disputes still exist" between the two countries, the
Sudanese-Egyptian ties "are improving in a smooth way."
</P>
<P>
The leadership of both countries have underlined the
development of the bilateral ties and officials of the neighbors
are meeting regularly to seek ways of solving the problems, Nimir
said.
</P>
<P>
He described the differences between the two countries as "only
summer clouds."
</P>
<P>
The ties between the two Arab countries became tense in early
1990s after Sudan adopted political policies which were based on
Islamic laws. Egypt blamed Sudan for backing extremists who
attempted to topple its secular government and install strict
Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
The relations deteriorated in 1995 when Cairo accused Khartoum
of masterminding an assassination attempt on President Hosni
Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Sudan has denied both charges.
</P>
<P>
A thaw has set in after the two countries repeated readiness to
make efforts to normalize their relations in recent two years and
exchanged visits by senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Nimir praised Egypt's relief aid under Mubarak's initiative to
flood-beleaguered Sudanese people in the area of Dongola.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese people and government will not forget the support
of Egypt and its president, government and people in times of
difficulty in Sudan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Sudan is carrying out a health cooperation
protocol with Egypt on a regular basis. Under the protocol signed
last year, Egypt extends expertise and help to stand up to
epidemics in Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Threatens Marine Fisheries in Bay of Bengal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Massive pollution in the Bay of
Bengal is threatening the stock of marine fisheries, and the
volume of fishing in Bangladesh has declined alarmingly in the
last few years, the official BSS news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Experts apprehended that fisheries resources might be reduced
further, and fin-fish and shell-fish would once be on the verge of
extinction if pollution in the Bay of Bengal's water continues.
</P>
<P>
Industrial toxic waste, oil spilling, dumping of trash fish,
illegal and over-fishing, siltation and flood water stagnation,
increase in inland wastes, artificial hatcheries, ignorance of
fishermen about the bay's fish stock and mismanagement of the
marine sector have caused the decrease in fisheries resources,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The Bay of Bengal is enriched with nutrients, supplied by a
network of rivers and their tributaries. The marine fisheries
resources in the water area of the bay covering an area of about
70,000 square kilometers are highly potential and the fishing
ground in the bay is considered to be one of the best in tropical
countries.
</P>
<P>
Around 1.5 million people in Bangladesh depend on fishing in
the Bay of Bengal, and nearly 350,000 of them are marine fishermen
along the country's 710-kilometer coast.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen operating about 16,000 coastal fishing vessels,
of which only around 6,000 are licensed, produce an average
250,000 tons of marine fish every year.
</P>
<P>
There are indications that chemical ingredients used in dry
fish and pesticide residue seeping into sea waters have
deteriorated the marine eco-system which ultimately will also have
adverse effect on zoo-plankton and phyto-plankton, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial effluent including that of shrimp hatcheries is also
threatening the future fish growth, and the degradation of the
marine environment will subsequently affect the prospects of fish
resources development and various economic development in the bay.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the Fisheries Resources Institute of the Department
of Fisheries, Chittagong University, revealed that the use of
pesticides has increased by 400 percent since 1977. Agro-chemicals
are major sources of marine pollution, and frequent spills during
oil transportation also contribute to the degradation of marine
environment.
</P>
<P>
And hundreds of tons of oil from prolonged anchored vessels
around the country's sea ports and thousands of other fishing
trawlers is degrading the marine environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial belts close to the bay are continuously discharging
solid and liquid wastes into the coastal and marine water.
</P>
<P>
If such wide-scale marine water pollution continues, the marine
fishes one day will be compelled to change their habitation and
migrate to Indian and Myanmar ocean, Khan said.
</P>
<P>
To sustain a healthy and balanced environment, the experts
urged the government to bring the violators of environmental laws
to book and suggested introducing mother vessels for collecting
small fish thrown away by small fishing boats and creating
awareness among fishermen to prevent the hunting of small and
low-priced fish fry.

<P>
MACAO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The chief executive-designate
of the future Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) has
appointed seven persons as legislators of the SAR's First
Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued Friday afternoon by the
office of the chief executive-designate, the seven persons include
Joao Baptista Manuel Leao, Ho Teng Iat, Stanley Au Chong Kit,
Philip Xavier, Vong Hin Fai, Cheong Wai Kei and Jose Manuel de
Oliveira Rodrigues.
</P>
<P>
The First Legislative Council of the Macao SAR, which will be
set up on December 20 this year, will be composed of 23 members,
the same number as that in the current Legislative Assembly of
Macao under Portuguese rule.
</P>
<P>
Among the 16 elected legislators of the Legislative Assembly,
15 have been given continued membership in the Macao SAR
legislature. A new SAR legislator was chosen earlier this week to
fill the vacancy left by the person who had failed to request
continued membership.
</P>
<P>
However, the seven current legislators appointed by the
governor of Macao cannot go through Macao's transfer of power from
Portugal to China.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, all the 23 members of the First Legislative Council
of the Macao SAR have been decided and they shall make legislative
preparations necessary to ensure the smooth operation of the SAR
government beginning December 20.

Supplies in DRC
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister for
Defense Steven Kavuma has refuted some media reports that the
country's troops deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) are suffering shortage of supplies.
</P>
<P>
In a press release obtained here Friday morning, the minister
described the allegations untrue, saying:"We always have reserve
supplies in stock in the DRC for our soldiers."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that due to some bureaucratic bottlenecks in
the process of effecting payments, it had not been possible for
the ministry to settle some bills from some transporters. But he
added that a solution to the problem had been found and the bills
would soon be settled.
</P>
<P>
"The situation with regard to supplies to members of the army
in the DRC is under control and there should be no cause for
alarm over it," the minister explained.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports dated September 22 indicated that the
government had acknowledged that it had been unable to provide
for the troops in the DRC for the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the chartered planes which had been used
to transport military supplies from Entebbe Airport to the DRC
has been idle for as long as two weeks due to delay of payment
from the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Kavuma, in a recent report presented to the parliamentary
committee on defense and internal affairs, admitted that the
ministry was fund-strapped and demanded for more money to cater
for soldiers in and out of service.

<P>
JAKARTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- At least four persons,
including a policeman, have been killed and more than 70 injured
in clashes between protesters and police here since Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ciptomangukusumo General Hospital, two persons
died on Thursday afternoon and another on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Ketut Arman, a member of the Jakarta Police Mobile Brigade, was
found dead on Thursday night after an unidentified car struck him,
Jakarta Police spokesperson Zainuri told reporters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At least six security officials were injured in the clashes, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Widespread protests and mass street demonstrations broke out in
many cities across the country following the passage of the state
security bill by the parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta saw the biggest rally against the bill, as thousands of
angry protesters aggressively attacked security troops, who were
unrelenting in barring the protesters' way to the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Students and local residents hurled stones, Molotov cocktails
and scores of flaming sticks at the security troops, who fired gas
canisters and rubber bullets and angrily beat the protesters they
apprehended.
</P>
<P>
The protesters blocked public busses passing the Sudirman
thoroughfare in Central Jakarta Friday and set several cars on
fire.
</P>
<P>
Zainuri told reporters that the police had detained nearly 40
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
After the passage at the House of Representatives, the security
bill will wait for the approval of President B.J. Habibie to
become law.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the president is given authority to declare a
state of emergency in a province if it is requested by the
provincial legislature and governor after obtaining the consent of

<HEADLINE> Angolan Native Elected Leader of Inter-African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 24 (xinhua) -- Josefa Sacko, native of
Angola, has been elected as Secretary-General of the Inter-African
Coffee Organization (IACO), becoming its first woman leader, Local
newspaper Jornal de Angola reported here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
During a vote by ballot held in London on Wednesday, Josefa
Sacko gained support from the members of the extra-ordinary
council of IACO, defeating competitors from Nigeria and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general-elect, an agronomy major of a Nigerian
university who entered in 1996 Angola's National Secretariat of
Coffee, will come into power in October.
</P>
<P>
Angola, with an over-100-year history of planting coffee, was
the fourth largest coffee-producing country of the world and the
second largest in Africa in 1974 when the country's annual output
hit 225,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
After the independence of the former portuguese colony,
however, Angola saw sharp decline in the coffee production,
essentially due to the long- term civil war.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, its coffee output in 1998/1999
year is " expected" to reach 10,000 tons. But the deterioration of
the situation in the battle-field and the abnormality in weather
will possibly reduce the output to only 5,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Angolan government hopes that the new leader of IACO can help
promote the coffee production in her motherland.

LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- British boxer Michael Watson
will get to know whether he can win his claim for one million
pounds damages from the British Boxing Board of Council.
</P>
<P>
The boxer, who suffered brain damages during a world title
fight in 1991, claimed suitable medical facilities were not on
hand at the ring during his fight in London with then world
champion Chris Eubank and it took too long to get him to surgery.
</P>
<P>
If the High Court in London rule in his favour in the civil
lawsuit, the BBBC could face bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Middleweight boxer Watson collapsed after losing the 12th and
final round. He had two operations to remove blood clots from his
brain and remained in a coma for 40 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Watson, 34, has made a partial recovery but is paralysed down

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan agreed Friday to
provide to Cambodia a loan of 4.1 billion yen (39 million U.S.
dollars) for the expansion and renovation of Sihanoukville Port.
</P>
<P>
An exchange of notes and a loan agreement were signed
simultaneously at the Council of Ministers in the presence of
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Keat Chhon, who signed the loan agreement,
expressed his thanks to Japan, saying an expanded port will play
an important role in Cambodia's economic stability and
development.
</P>
<P>
The project for the expansion and renovation of Sihanoukville
Port will be the first major renovation since the port opened in
1960. It is badly needed in order to meet the increasing number of
container ships.
</P>
<P>
When the renovation is completed in 2003, the port is expected
to enable several 10,000-ton ships to dock at the same time.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that after the renovation, about 1.2 million
tons of goods would come through the port.
</P>
<P>
Japan has granted more than 500 million dollars to Cambodia
since 1993, according to the Japanese Embassy here.

LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and South Africa have
resolved to ensure total co-operation and integration of the
African continent, said Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
Thursday during his trip to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Friday quoted
Obasanjo as saying when meeting his South African counterpart
Thabo Mbeki in New York that both countries, now under thriving
democracy, have special responsibility to work together and uplift
Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries would soon sign an agreement on
establishing a joint commission to promote all-round co-operation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that posterity will not judge us kindly if we do
not bring about the necessary co-operation and integration in
Africa," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mbeki said that South Africa's major interest in the
 democratization of Nigeria is on the impact the transformation
would have on the continent.
</P>
<P>
And his meeting with Obasanjo provided an opportunity for them
to reflect on matters concerning Africa, he added.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents are currently on an official visit to the
United States to attend the 54th session of the U.N. General
Assembly.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- International Business
Machine (IBM) India is planning to manufacture personal computers
(PCs) in India and has chosen Pondicherry of Tamil Nadu, where it
has a warehouse, as the site for building the PC plant.
</P>
<P>
According to Express Computer, which will be published on
September 27, the company is now setting up an in-house team for
conducting a feasibility study on operational logistics.
</P>
<P>
The company will assemble a few PCs as a test case before
full-scale manufacturing is started.
</P>
<P>
IBM has been contemplating manufacturing in India for a few
years but had not actually started it due to "unfavorable duty
structure and changing government policies."
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts said IBM's decision was prompted more by
competitive pressure as Hewlett Packard and Compaq, which are
IBM's biggest competitors in the Indian PC market, have already
started large-scale PC assembling in their Bangalore facilities.

<HEADLINE> Blair Wants Man United FA Cup U-Turn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair has joined the calls for Manchester United to compete in the
FA Cup, according to local reports here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Mirror, which was published today,
Blair said: "Like most fans, I'd love United to re-enter the
competition.
</P>
<P>
"I still very much hope and believe that can be achieved. If
they can get together with the FA to think through some way of
resolving the situation we would all applaud them."
</P>
<P>
Blair stressed he did not blame the Treble winners for their
decision to withdraw so they could take part in the World Club
Championship in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Saluting the club's incredible achievements, Blair said: "I've
never been one of the anti-United brigade. I think what they did
last year was great for the country, not just for the United."
</P>
<P>
"So they are not to blame here. Heaven knows, they have massive
fixture demands."
</P>
<P>
Blair also denied the government had pressured United to go to
Brazil to help England's bid to host the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
He said: "There has been a lot of baloney talked about the
government piling pressure on United to pull out of the FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
"Yes we support the World Cup bid and if it helps that United
play in Brazil, that's great.
</P>
<P>
"But the bottom line is that United took a very difficult
decision and I fully understand the problems involved that led to
that decision being taken.
</P>
<P>
"I also know that most football fans in the country would love
them to re-enter the competition and I still very much hope and
believe that it can be achieved," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Index Nose-dives Through 400-Point Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The stock market in Thailand
tumbled Friday by nearly 5 percent, dragging the Stock Exchange of
Thailand (SET) index down below the important 400-point level to
380.66 points.
</P>
<P>
The SET index lost 19.8 points in Friday's trading, with trade
value standing at a rather high level of 7 billion baht (175.4
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Bank and finance stocks led the plunge right after the morning
session started.
</P>
<P>
Local traders said the sharp decline stemmed from investors'
concern about the lack of fresh funds and massive non-performing
loans (NPLs).
</P>
<P>
NPLs in the Thai banking system stood at 2.65 trillion baht
(66.3 billion dollars) at the end of June this year, accounting
for about 47 percent of the total outstanding loans.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the announcement of the country's largest industrial
conglomerate Siam Cement Plc early Friday morning to cancel its 30
million new share offering dealt another blow to the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the country's National Economic and Social
Development Board announced the figures for the country's economic
performance in the second quarter, saying the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) grew 3.5 percent in that period.
</P>
<P>
The figure disappointed investors and analysts as earlier
reports suggested that second-quarter GDP growth could be as high
as 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the disappointing figures could be another factor
which led to the gloomy sentiment in the stock market late this
week.

economy.
</P>
<P>
The central committees of non-communist parties, the All-China

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Disgraced Chelsea coach Graham
Rix has vowed to "rebuild" his career after serving half the 12-
month sentence he received for having unlawful sex with a 15-year-
old girl.
</P>
<P>
The former Arsenal and England star was rushed away from
Wandsworth Prison in south London on Friday morning, past waiting
reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
But in a statement issued through his agent Dennis Roach Rix
said: "I made a serious mistake, for which I have been punished,
so now with the help and support of Chelsea Football Club I want
to get back to my work and re-build the remainder of my life. I
would appreciate being given that chance."
</P>
<P>
Rix added: "This last six months has been extremely difficult
for me. During the period I have been well and fairly treated and
would sincerely thank those friends and people in football whose
letters and support have kept me going through the most difficult
period of my life."
</P>
<P>
Police arrived outside the prison at about 6.15am and left 45
minutes later, saying he had gone.
</P>
<P>
The father-of-four, from Richmond, south west London, had
pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful sex and one of indecent
assault, committed on two separate occasions early last year.
</P>
<P>
The court heard that he had sexual intercourse with the girl,
who was a virgin, in his London hotel room on the eve of a Chelsea
Premiership match with Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the sentence was passed, Chelsea announced that
Rix, who was capped for England 17 times and is regarded as one of
the country's top coaches, would not lose his job.
</P>
<P>
He was told by the judge that he would have to remain on the
sex offenders' register for the next 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Nestle's Trading Profit Margin Improves in First Half of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nestle Group improved its
trading profit margin to 9.8 percent in the first half of 1999 at
3.461 billion Swiss francs (about 2.268 billion U.S. dollars) from
9.5 percent in the same period of 1998, the Swiss food company
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The gains in profitability were most marked in Asia, Oceania
and Africa, said Nestle. Profitability also strengthened in
Western Europe and North America, as well as for the other
activities (water, pharmaceuticals and breakfast cereals).
</P>
<P>
Nestle's net profit rose slightly to reach 2.079 billion francs
(about 1.362 billion dollars) representing an unchanged margin on
sales of 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The company said that its sales of 35.3 billion francs (about
23.13 billion dollars) in the first half of 1999 remained stable
compared with the corresponding period of the preceding year in a

<HEADLINE> Confucianism Given Due Attention in Modern China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kong Fanjin, a professor at Shandong University, said that the
anti-Confucianism attitude adopted by either Westerners or Chinese
was irrational to a large extent.
</P>
<P>
Actually, he added, Confucianism, which regards humans as the
essence of everything and advocates the paramount position of
morality, is a treasure of the modern world.
</P>
<P>
He cited the United State, boasted all sorts of laws, but also
suffering from the most serious crimes. "In the economy-dominated
society, it's more important to promote morality," said Kong. "
Confucius held that self-restraint and inward-cultivation are the
bedrock to keep us from any guilt."
</P>
<P>
Sun Jiazheng, minister of culture, has acknowledged that China'
s modernization depends on whether the advantages in this
traditional thought can meet the needs of modern society, and says
that to reach this goal, people should correctly understand what
Confucius really meant.
</P>
<P>
The Analects, a collection of Confucius' instructions complied
by his disciples 2,000 years ago, still remains the most valuable
reference for understanding Confucianism. The book has been
reprinted tens of thousands of times and has actually become a
bestseller since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Many scholars think that the nation's increased interest in
Confucianism today reflects a renaissance of China's old
civilization. Chinese culture is one of the few cultures in the
world that has lasted 5,000 years without interruption. During
this process, Confucianism, as a leading component of the culture,
has played a vital role in piecing different groups together.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing Confucius celebrations will enable the people in
China to regain a sense of national pride and cohesion, just as
the 200th anniversary of Pushkin's birth brought to Russian this
year, said philosopher Lu Zhongfeng of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, adding that Confucius's ideal of maintaining a
sound social order is still beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Confucianism is also vital to the cultures of the countries
where overseas Chinese live, and in East and Southeast Asia.
Scholars believe that Confucianism has the capability to ease and
soften alienation among people and nations in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
However, Confucianism is no longer the dominant philosophy
today. A descendant of Confucius, Kong Xianglin, head of the
Confucius Museum in Qufu, said it is reasonable that controversy
arose in the study of Confucianism, and people can just pick out
and make use of Confucius's concepts and adapt them to the modern
age.
</P>
<P>
His words were confirmed in Qufu, where the image of Confucius
appears on advertising billboards throughout the city, despite the
fact that Confucius himself took a dim view of commerce.
</P>
<P>
But, Kong said, "Confucius would not be angry if he saw his
commercial image, for he wanted people to live a well-off life."
</P>
<P>
Confucius does not mention science and technology in his
Analects but, indeed, Confucianism is often considered to be the
cornerstone of the autocratic system in China, which requires that
the state be governed by a powerful man rather than by law.
</P>
<P>
"In these respects, we should sincerely learn many things from
the West," Liu Weihua said. "By doing so, our civilization can
survive and go on developing."

<HEADLINE> Confucianism Given Due Attention in Modern China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- About 2,500 years ago, the
great philosopher, educator and thinker Confucius traveled around
for 14 years to spread his thoughts to his countrymen, only to
find all his efforts in vain.
</P>
<P>
He attributed his misfortune to fate.
</P>
<P>
If Confucius were alive today, he would recognize that fate is
just.
</P>
<P>
It is his philosophy, which none of the kings of his day would
adopt, that has established his reputation for thousands of years
since his death in 479 B.C..
</P>
<P>
An unprecedented celebration for the 2,550th anniversary of
Confucius' birth is expected to be held in his hometown of Qufu,
in east China's Shandong Province, on his birthday September 26.
Confucius' residence and temple have been renovated, and for the
first time, Chinese official TV stations will telecast the
celebrations live worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, cultural and educational ministries have already
sponsored a symposium at the Great Hall of the People, the first
time the Chinese government has commemorated Confucius. Among
those attending the symposium was Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, who is
also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations will include theatrical performances,
exhibitions, publications, souvenirs and the like, and it will
last for two months.
</P>
<P>
These practices are a renewal of an old tradition in which the
school of thought known as Confucianism developed out of the
master's ideas of "Benevolence" and "Morality," and has dominated
China's political, cultural and social life for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
No matter who administered China, he made Confucius a model,
and governed the country according to Confucianism, including
Kublai Khan of the Mongolian Empire.
</P>
<P>
However, an interruption of Confucianism finally took place in
this century. In the 1920s, Confucianism was blamed for the China'
s underdevelopment. And during the turmoil of the Cultural
Revolution (1966-76), Confucius was even criticized as the
representative of the feudal exploiting class.
</P>
<P>
"But there appears to be a renaissance of Confucianism at the
advent of the new millennium, as China meets challenges both at
home and abroad that is prompting us to once again value Confucius,
" said Liu Weihua, deputy director of the International
Confucianism Association.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, cultures of developing countries are being
threatened by Western powers who are attempting to spread their
values globally. As a result, "great attention should be paid to
the recognition of the independence of our traditional culture,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the attitude of some Western scholars who insist that
Confucianism will be one of the sources of global conflict in the
future, Liu said Confucianism, which advocates "Benevolence," will
lead to a peaceful coexistence.

the country was 18 percent in 1998. The government is going to
implement a 10-year master plan to reduce its poverty rate by
uplifting the living standard of its rural population.

<HEADLINE> Fake Foreign Passports Rampant in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A racket involving forged
passports of a southern African country is rampant in Kenya when
some people from Great Lake Region countries try to seek asylum
in European countries via Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The forged passports are purchased in downtown or airports of
the Kenyan capital Nairobi and port city of Mombasa. The main
advantage of southern African passports, especially Zimbabwean,
Namibian and South African ones, is that they do not need visas
to enter Europe.
</P>
<P>
The syndicate running the racket is in collusion with officials
at Kenya' s Immigration Department. Some immigration officials can
provide any entry or exit stamps necessary for forgery, the Daily
Nation newspaper revealed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The picture on the bogus passports is replaced by that of the
buyer although the original name remains and travel stamps are
updated to reflect recent journeys.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan immigration officials claimed that such a passport was
"valid" to board a plane at most airports around the world.
</P>
<P>
"The demand for these passports is so much that at times we
have a shortage," said one seller, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
"The price paid ranges from 500 U.S. dollars to 1,000 dollars,
but these buyers like Rwandans, Burundians and the Congolese are
desperate and could pay anything for it," said the seller.
</P>
<P>
Kenyans have also become major customers of such passports due
to increasing difficulties for them to obtain a visa to European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean High Commission in Nairobi is aware of the
rampant use of its passports by refuge seekers to Europe, but it
does not know the extent of damage caused, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> PKK Leader Says Amnesty Should Include PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Imprisoned leader of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) Abdullah Ocalan has said
that the draft Amnesty Law on Turkish parliament's agenda has to
include the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Daily News reported here Friday that Dogan
Erbas, one of Ocalan's lawyers, quoted Ocalan as saying that an
amnesty law that includes the PKK will bring about a period of
peace in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that the failure to include the PKK can
open the road to difficulties in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested in Kenya by Turkish special agents in
February and was sentenced to death by the Ankara No. 2 State
Security Court on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea in western Turkey
in June.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan-led PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey which has claimed
over 37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Minister of Science Speaks About Science Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Vice-Minister of
Science and Technology, Xu Guanhua, today explained China's latest
science policies to envoys and representatives of several dozen
countries and international organizations in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China and the State Council decided to encourage technological
innovation and the commercial use of new technology, and a
national congress to this effect was held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
These are of vital importance to China's scientific development
and modernization, Xu said, explaining that the unsatisfactory
progress in adapting China's scientific research to its rapid
economic development has greatly restricted the development of
ability in technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, he pointed out, some 81 percent of the
scientists and engineers work for companies and only six percent
are in research institutes, but in China, companies have only 35
percent of the scientists and more of them are in research
institutes.
</P>
<P>
The main point in China's technological innovation effort is to
promote the commercial use of scientific and technological
developments, and at the same time, international cooperation
should be increased to bring in technology from outside, he said.
</P>
<P>
Key areas of technological innovation include agricultural
technology, high-tech industrial development, traditional industry
reforms, improvement of the service sector, and vigorous
development of military and civilian technology.
</P>
<P>
Xu explained that other policies encourage technical training,
preferential treatment in terms of finances and taxation, risk
investment, new rewards, and intellectual property rights
protection.
</P>
<P>
The 242 central research institutes of the country were
transformed into enterprises in the first half of this year, he
said, adding that all the institutes for applied technology
development will be managed as enterprises before the end of the
next year.

<HEADLINE> China Olympic Chief Upbeat about Beijing's 2008 Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China will enhance the
integration of the civilization between the east and west and
provide a boost to the world peace and human progress with the
staging of the 2008 Olympics, said China sports chief Wu Shaozu on
Friday here.
</P>
<P>
Wu, Chairman of the Chinese Olympic Committee, made the remarks
at a ceremony where the sports chief received the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) official invitations for the Sydney Games
which had begun its one-year countdown on September 15.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that if China, an ancient country where the Oriental
civilization derived from, wins the bid, it will be a historic
complement to the Olympic Movement which has originated from the
West.
</P>
<P>
"The Olympics is a global event, so it is supposed to be a
bridge of the civilization between the east and west." stressed
the official.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of China, which failed in its bid for the 2000
Olympic Games, has officially launched its bidding campaign and
submitted the application to the IOC earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"China is a big country. The global games will be defective
without the involvement of the country with the biggest population
in the world." Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu, however, painted a rosy picture of the Beijing bid, saying
that their advantages overwhelmed the disadvantages in the bidding
campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Though China is a developing country, it has developed greatly
over the past eight years and the conditions have been mature for
us to stage such a great event." said Wu.
</P>
<P>
"We have weak points but anyway we are making improvement. The
efforts in environmental protection has paid off and the existing
sporting facilities, though remained to be improved, has been able
to meet the demand of hosting the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
The official also held that since the games is global it should
be rotated between the continents.
</P>
<P>
"Spain of Europe hosted the 1992 Games, and the 1996 Games went
to the United States with the 2000 to Australia. Greek has won the
right to host the 2004 Games, so it is the turn for Asia to stage
such big event."

JERUSALEM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli currency shekel depreciated 0.47 percent
against the dollar Thursday, setting a new 10-month low. The
representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 4.274
shekels. Dealers attributed the decline to investors' nervousness
concerning future developments on the global capital market. The
recent depreciation of the shekel has also prompted fears that
the Bank of Israel will maintain its strict monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Contacts for a resumption of the negotiations between
Israel and Syria are currently focusing on the formulation of
a broad document of understandings, which will serve as a
framework for a peace settlement and as an agreed agenda for
the talks, diplomatic sources say. The document, they said, will
encompass all the elements of the future agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak told a meeting of Jewish
leaders in France Thursday that Syrian President Hafez Assad is
a strong and credible leader who has proved that his word is
reliable. He said he has no doubt that the talks between
Israel and Syria will resume, noting that Assad negotiated with
previous Israeli governments.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Thousands of extra police, border policemen, and Israeli
troops will be deployed throughout the week-long Succot holiday,
which begins Friday evening. Special emphasis will be placed on
security in Jerusalem, due to the many activities to take
place during the holiday, police said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> China leads Pakistan 2-0 at Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Host China took a 2-0 lead
over Pakistan in the third round playoff of 1999 Davis Cup Asia/
Pacific Zone Group A tennis tournament which opened here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
China, which lost to New Zealand in the first round of the
group, had a good start when their number one player Zhu Benqiang
beat world ranked 998th Hamid Haq in straight sets 6-1, 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Baseliner Zhu, ranked 894 in the world, dominated the match
with his angled returns and shots which had Pakistan national
champion Mohammad Khaliq making many mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad's teammate Alsam Qureshi, ranked 531th in the lates
ATP world rankings, controlled the game in the first three sets by
leading at 6-3, 4-6 and 6-4 over Chinese number five Li Si, 1,
299th in the world.
</P>
<P>
But 19-year-old Alsam was injured in the fourth set and made
too many errors.
</P>
<P>
After losing the set 6-1, he had no more time for treatment and
gave up the match at the beginning of the fifth set.
</P>
<P>
"Alsam has played too many tournaments, and format of Davis Cup
is too long, maybe that's the reason, " explained Pakistan captain
Hamid ul Haq.
</P>
<P>
"We have little chance to beat China because of Alsam's
retirement," added Hamid.
</P>
<P>
The latest meeting between the two teams was in 1995 when China
outclassed hosts Pakistan 3-2 on grass in the same event.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Chinese pairs Li Si and Yang Jinzhu will take on
Pakistan duo Mohammad Khaliq and Alsam Qureshi in the double.
</P>
<P>
The winners of the tie will stay in Group A while the losers
will be dropped to Group B next year.

<HEADLINE> UK Assistance to Improve Rural Services in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
provided 130 million rupees (1.9 million U.S. dollars) of
development funds to improve rural access in Nepal, the Rising
Nepal reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the British Embassy Thursday said an
agreement was signed between the governments of Britain and Nepal
for the development fund, which is going to be used for a Rural
Access Program.
</P>
<P>
Over the next year, the two governments will work closely to
design a long-term (five to seven years) program which aims to
provide better access to services and markets in the remote areas
of Nepal, thus improving human development and rural livelihoods,
such as health and education.
</P>
<P>
The implementation phase of the program is expected to cost an
additional 2.2 billion rupees (32 million dollars) of grant
funding, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
British development assistance to Nepal is expected to total
around 1.8 billion rupees (26 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Israel Seeks Extensive Understanding Before Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Contacts for a resumption
of negotiations between Israel and Syria are currently focusing
on the formulation of a broad document of understanding, which
will serve as a framework for a peace settlement and as an agreed
agenda for the talks, the local daily Haaretz reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted diplomatic sources as saying that the
document of understanding will encompass all the elements of the
future agreement, including principles for security arrangements,
water distribution, the Lebanon issue and the relations between
Israel and Syria after peace agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak promised that after he receives
replies from Syria on these issues, he will agree to set a line of
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria
in the 1967 Middle East war, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to draw up a list of broad understanding ahead of
the talks on the final settlement was discussed in recent weeks by
Barak and officials of the United States.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
presented the idea to Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Sharaa in
their meeting on Wednesday at the United Nations headquarters in
New York.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharaa rejected the proposal, saying after the meeting
that the approach is focused on reaching understanding on "side
issues."
</P>
<P>
Syria wants to renew the talks on the basis of an Israeli
agreement to withdraw to the line of June 4, 1967, and acceptance
of the May 1995 document regarding security arrangements, which
was discussed between Syria and the former Israeli Labor
government, Sharaa said.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the Israeli Television Channel 1 Thursday that he
has no doubt that the talks with Syria will be resumed, though he
could not say whether this will take "three, six or nine months."

<HEADLINE> Manila Assures No Need to Panic on Peso Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
assured the public Friday that there is no need to be alarmed over
the peso, whose exchange rate fell Thursday to a 10-month low of
40.6 against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a news release that
the local currency is still doing better than other currencies in
the region, such as the baht of Thailand and the rupiah of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Zamora stressed that the peso's decline stemmed not from
weaknesses in the Philippine economy, but from developments
affecting other currencies in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand that the peso does not stand alone. It
flows with the other regional currencies. So comparatively, we are
doing a little better than the other regional currencies," Zamora
said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the case of the Thai baht, which is now "2 to 3
percent weaker" than the peso. It used to be 2 to 3 percent
stronger, he noted.
</P>
<P>
A similar case holds true for the Indonesian rupiah as compared
with its strength three to four weeks ago, Zamora added.
</P>
<P>
He said the concerned government agencies are continuously
monitoring the currency situation and will respond accordingly.
"We are making sure that we keep a watchful eye on this," Zamora
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Child Immunization Rate on Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The immunization rate
among U.S. children reached a record high of 80.6 percent in 1998,
federal officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks in large part to these high immunization rates, we have
seen a breathtaking decline in suffering and death from most
vaccine-preventable diseases," Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The immunization rate has been steadily climbing since 1995,
when it was 76.2 percent, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDCP).
</P>
<P>
Walter A. Orenstein, director of the CDCP's National
Immunization Program, said that the 20 percent of children not
immunized are generally poor and a large percentage come from
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
The rate refers to the percentage of youngsters between 19 and
35 months old who have completed a series of recommended
vaccinations against diphtheria, tetanus, polio and measles.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Say More Genes Exist Than Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 24 (Xinhua) -- There may be 60,000 more
human genes than currently believed, suggesting that scientists
trying to unravel genetic disorders may have a far more difficult
job ahead, a Californian pharmaceutical company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Palo Alto, California-based Incyte
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., one of several private entities competing
to map every human gene, believe about 140,000 genes make up the
proteins that program cells in the human body. Previous estimates
put the number between 80,000 and 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Incyte scientists came up with the new estimate by combining
data from two decoding methods.
</P>
<P>
In one, they decoded the heads and tails of transcribed copies
of DNA, known as RNA, and determined there were 130,000 genes in
the genome.
</P>
<P>
In the second method, based on a feature that occurs in about
half of known genes, they calculated 143,000 genes in every human
cell. The two figures produced the 140,000 estimate.

<P>
PYONGYANG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) will not launch any missile during its
high-level talks with the United States, the Korean Central News
Agency (KCNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said that as the DPRK will
hold high-level talks with the United States, it will launch no
missiles during the talks in order to create a more favorable
atmosphere for the talks.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. announcement last week to ease economic
sanctions against the DPRK has created a positive atmosphere for
the talks aimed to solve the pending issues between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged the U.S. to implement its decision of
lifting trade and investment sanctions as early as possible,
totally abandon its hostile policies and lift all the remaining
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pyongyang will respond with good faith and seek to
eliminate suspicion on the part of the U.S. side if the U.S.
abandons hostile policies and genuinely works for better relations
with the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Keen on Setting up Embassy in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Cuba is working to
establish its embassy in Abu Dhabi as part of the efforts to forge
diplomatic relations and enhance trade ties with the United Arab
Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
"We are keen on developing diplomatic relations with the UAE
and enhancing commercial ties in the region's trading hub," Jorge
Leon Cruz, the Cuban envoy in Doha, Qatar, was quoted by the
Dubai-based Khaleej Times daily as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, who was in Dubai, said he will be making an
official tour to Abu Dhabi next month to hold talks with senior
officials of the foreign ministry, besides meeting the ruling
family members.
</P>
<P>
Cuba currently has diplomatic ties with 167 countries, and
Qatar is the only Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) state where a
Cuban mission has been functioning for the past 10 years, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon relations of the Central American country with
the Arab world, Cruz said Cuba has been a strong supporter of the
Arab causes.
</P>
<P>
Stating that the GCC states, comprising the UAE, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, are home to about 250 Cuban
expatriates, the diplomat said the number of people travelling to
Cuba for business and tourism was very negligible.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the unimpressive level of trade and tourism
between Cuba and GCC states to the vast geographical distance
between his country and the Gulf region, although a Dubai-based
business house has been dealing with Cuba's famous cigars for the
last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"We are keen to see more Gulf Arabs visiting Cuba in the coming
years. Cuba is targeting to receive nearly 2 million visitors next
year, up from the present 1.7 million," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that Cuba can export more qualified
and experienced labors to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is working on expanding its political, diplomatic and
trading contacts with different countries since the easing of the
37-year-old United States trade embargo in January this year.

<HEADLINE> COMESA, WB Talk on Political Guarantee Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has started consultations with the World
Bank on introducing a political guarantee facility within the
grouping's restructured clearing house.
</P>
<P>
COMESA is currently working with the World Bank to ensure that
the facility can be operational by June, 2000, Assistant Secretary
Sindiso Ngwenya said at COMESA Center in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Friday's Times of Zambia newspaper as saying
that the facility would enable the private sector to obtain export
credits on terms comparable to their counterparts in other parts
of the world.
</P>
<P>
It would also cover risks for imports and exports of
participating countries which feel insecure about conducting
business in the COMESA region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Political risk, coupled with relatively poor infrastructure and
high utility costs, means that the COMESA region can not compete
with regions with lower political risk in attracting foreign
investors, Ngwenya emphasized.
</P>
<P>
For example, while companies in other regions of the world can
borrow in hard currency at an interest rate of five percent, the
companies in COMESA region has to pay premiums as high as 12
percent due to the political risk involved, he added.

<HEADLINE> 2 UN Peacekeepers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Two soldiers of the United
Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) were wounded
overnight by a roadside bomb in south Lebanon, the Voice of
Lebanon radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two soldiers of Fijian contingent inside the UNIFIL
were injured when a bomb exploded under their armored
personnel carrier on the Mansouri-Majdal Zoun road just north
of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There has been no group claiming responsibility for the
blast, a UNIFIL spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Since the inception of the UNIFIL in Lebanon in 1978, a
total of 226 soldiers have been killed and another hundreds
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. forces made up of soldiers from Ireland, Ghana,
Nepal, Fiji, Norway, Finland, Poland, France and Italy were
installed to help the Lebanese government restore authority over
its soil in the south from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
Israeli occupation forces in a bid to oust them out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Defense Ministry Told to Stick to Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Parliamentary
Committee on Defense and Internal Affairs has warned the Defense
Ministry against violating the approved budget.
</P>
<P>
The committee is not satisfied with the way the ministry
manages its budget, Friday's New Vision newspaper quoted MPs as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament has been made to pass a budget which is
different from that the ministry implements, the committee said,
adding that the ministry has a tendency of budgeting for items it
does not spend money on.
</P>
<P>
In a report yet to be presented to the House, the MPs warned
that the ministry expenditure should be kept within the confine of
the money provided in the budget and passed by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the new national budget has provided 166
billion shillings (120 million U.S. dollars) for defense
expenses, but State Minister of Defense Steven Kavuma recently
demanded an addition of 33 billion shillings (23 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Uganda's defence budget occupies the top position on the
expense list in the national budget. There has been increasing
domestic pressure for withdrawal of troops from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and a slash in the military expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The donor community, which has been urging the Ugandan
government to put more money in such priority areas as
infrastructure, is also watching closely. Any big increase of
defense budget could prompt suspension of big sums of foreign
donation.

<HEADLINE> Livestock Slaughtering at Record Low in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The total number of
livestock
slaughtered in New Zealand in the second quarter of this year was
the
lowest recorded for a second quarter since 1982.
</P>
<P>
According to a media release issued Friday by Ian Ewing, New
Zealand's deputy government statistician, the number of livestock
slaughtered decreased 19.4 percent, compared with the second
quarter
of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"The decrease reflects lower livestock availability following
the
heavy culling of sheep and cattle during the drought-affected
season
of 1997-98," Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the number of lambs slaughtered fell 20.2
percent,
the result of a reduction in the number of breeding ewes following

the 1997-98 season's drought and a 3.6-percent fall in the spring
lambing percentage.
</P>
<P>
According to the same media release, the volume of sawn timber
produced in the second quarter of the year was 7.8 percent higher
than in the second quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Strong growth in domestic residential building construction
and
increased demand from overseas markets are likely to have
contributed
significantly to this rise," it said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Current Account Deficit Worsening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The current account
deficit
of New Zealand had reached 6.3 billion NZ dollars (3.26 billion
U.S.
dollars) by the end of June, NZ Government Statistician Len Cook
said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, Cook said the figure represents 6.3 percent
of
the country's GDP and was also 1.45 billion NZ dollars (750
million
U.S. dollars) more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit of 6.3 billion NZ dollars was the
worst for 13 years. This reflected the worsening trade picture as
import growth outstripped exports.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand firms lost 170 million NZ dollars (88 million U.S.
dollars) in the second quarter of this year on their foreign
investments while overseas firms made 1.7 billion NZ dollars (880
million U.S. dollars) on their holdings in New Zealand, ironically

increasing the overall deficit, according to local media.
</P>
<P>
It is said the worsening of New Zealand's current account
deficit
would reinforce international credit rating agency concerns about
the
poor state of its external account.
</P>
<P>
Local economists predict that there would be little significant

improvement in the deficit till late next year "at the earliest,"
with the deficit expected to worsen to 7 percent of GDP.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Supports Ocalan's Call for Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit has reacted favorably to a call by imprisoned Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan who demanded some of
his militants to surrender to the Turkish authorities.
</P>
<P>
On Ocalan's call, Ecevit said on Thursday that those who
surrender themselves along with their weapons will be shown
tolerance, the local Daily News reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that "the surrender of armed
militants will be evaluated as a positive development."
</P>
<P>
"We have been encouraging such a development for years. As you
know, the Repentance Law has been approved by the parliament. In
the framework of Turkish justice, militants who hand over their
arms will be shown maximum tolerance," Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by Ocalan's lawyers on Wednesday, the
PKK leader called on a PKK group to surrender to Turkish soldiers
in order to show their sincerity in their calls for peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a written statement by the pro-Kurdish People's
Democracy Party (HADEP) declared the party's support for Ocalan's
call.
</P>
<P>
However, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported that
some PKK militants in prison and in southeastern province of
Tunceli opposed Ocalan's calls for the withdrawal of the PKK from
Turkey and for the surrender of the militants.
</P>
<P>
The out-lawed PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey which has claimed
over 37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia Gives Priority to IT Industry Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 24 (Xinhua) -- In keeping up with the
times, Malaysia has placed priority on the development of the
multimedia and information technology (IT) into the new growth
engine of the future.
</P>
<P>
The on-going Multimedia Asia '99, a conference-cum-exhibition
in the country this week with the theme "Re-Aligning for a New
Economy," is the latest move to show its commitment to the
application of multimedia and IT for the future development.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 local and foreign hi-tech companies put on display the
latest multimedia and IT products, software and equipment.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Malaysia launched a study on Tuesday
aimed at the development of strategic plans for the communication
and multimedia industry in the country.
</P>
<P>
The study to be carried out from this month to December this
year would devise short and long-term plans to achieve 10 policy
objectives for the industry with particular emphasis on
establishing Malaysia as a global communication and multimedia
hub, Energy, Communications and Multimedia Minister Leo Moggie
said at the launching.
</P>
<P>
To spearhead multimedia and IT development, the Multimedia
Super Corridor (MSC), Malaysia's Silicon Valley, was launched as
early as August 1996.
</P>
<P>
The MSC, a 70 by 15 kilometer zone stretching southward from
here, is specially designed for multimedia and IT industries.
Technology companies in the MSC, which obtain MSC-status, are
given special privileges, including tax breaks, liberal hiring and
capital sourcing rules, freedom of ownership and priority
treatment via a one-stop agency, the Multimedia Development
Corporation (MDC), to cater to their needs.
</P>
<P>
On the administration side, the government not only set up the
National IT Council but also changed the name of a particular
ministry into the Ministry of Energy, Communication and
Multimedia, which showed that the authorities are serious about
multimedia development.
</P>
<P>
The Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 provides for
granting of incentive-based licensing to operators in the
communications and multimedia industry to ensure a competitive
environment.
</P>
<P>
On the road to economic recovery, the National Economic Action
Council (NEAC) last year identified the IT-related industry as one
of the three pillars of economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The IT sector, shielded from the economic crisis as a result of
the government's strong commitment, continued to make progress. In
particular, the MSC, set to attract 50 world-class companies by
the year 2003, is progressing well and gaining momentum.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Becoming Paradise For Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial center, is becoming a paradise for both
overseas and domestic investors.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, when the first joint venture was established in the
city, investors from outside Shanghai have set up about 30,000
businesses here, including some 20,000 overseas-funded enterprises,
with total contractual overseas investment of 35 billion U.S.
dollars and actual overseas investment of 25 billion U.S dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among these businesses are 156 funded by 59 of the world's top
100 multinational manufacturers, with combined committed overseas
capital of 9.57 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We have benefited from investing in China, and Shanghai is our
first stop in the country," said a senior executive of Bristol-
Myers Squibb of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Bristol-Myers Squibb established a joint-venture pharmaceutical
company in Shanghai in early 1982, and has since earned more than
300 million yuan in profit.
</P>
<P>
This year, it spent an additional 30 million U.S. dollars to
open a China investment company in Shanghai which would coordinate
its investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of overseas financial institutions,
including those which used to do business in Shanghai early this
century, have also opened branch offices.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics indicate that there have been more than 60
overseas-funded financial institutions in the city, including 10
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Bank Group, one of the world's largest banks,
upgraded its Shanghai representative office to a branch in August.
</P>
<P>
"Deutsche Bank started its international business in Shanghai
in 1872," said Thomos Fischer, a member of the bank's board of
directors. "And the upgrade is of great importance because it
represents our global strategic foresight and our confidence in
the Asian market."
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the investment fever in Shanghai started at the
beginning of the 1990s, when the central government introduced the
policy of developing the Yangtze River valley with Shanghai at
center.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Shanghai municipal government has made
remarkable progress in improving its business environment. It has
enacted related laws and regulations, and granted investors from
outside Shanghai and their dependents residence status.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's final goal is to become an international center for
economy, finance and trade in the 21st century, analysts say, and
the process of reaching the goal provides numerous business
opportunities to investors.

...and gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
So far there are more than 200 MSC-status companies, the
vanguards of the country's IT revolution, of which 29 are
world-class companies, according to MDC Executive Chairman Othman
Yeop Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
On September 2, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi urged Malaysian and foreign-owned IT companies to form
strategic alliances and joint ventures to enhance Malaysia's role
in the global digital revolution.
</P>
<P>
While local IT companies have been urged to establish
indigenous creative IT industry as Leo Moggie said the government
wants to encourage these companies to be bold and spread their
wings by leveraging the opportunities in the digital economy.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian IT industry, as NITC Secretary Mohd Azzman
Shariffadeen said, has achieved its objectives of putting in place
the infrastructure and technology to form a multimedia society.
</P>
<P>
The sector is now facing its next challenge, the need to
identify the benefits multimedia technology can offer to
Malaysians, he said.
</P>
<P>
To create greater IT awareness, the authorities and businesses
often organize seminars, workshops or exhibitions to enlighten the
public on the benefits, problems and solutions in regard to the IT
industry.
</P>
<P>
For example, in mid-May, a four-day InfoSoc Malaysia '99
conference and exhibition was held aimed at getting views of the
public, private and non-government sectors for establishing a
national framework of principles, guidelines and rules for a new
governance agenda in the IT industry in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and
Industry of Malaysia (ACCCIM) launched a two-year action plan to
promote IT usage among the Chinese community and Chinese
businessmen, especially small and medium-scale entrepreneurs and
to lead the Chinese business community into the IT era.
</P>
<P>
Even Malaysian libraries have been asked to upgrade the
conventional library services by fully exploiting the latest IT
available to function as a gateway to digital information
resources and as one-stop knowledge and information centers
through proper utilization of communications infrastructure, to
expedite the acculturation of IT and knowledge among Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
In line with the national objective of creating a knowledgeable
society in the coming millennium, a senator has proposed that the
government establish a special bank to finance the growth of the
IT sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has targeted 1,000 IT and multimedia small and
medium-sized enterprises in the MSC by the year 2003 from the
current 400 with a forecast that their number would reach 700 by
the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The MDC executive chairman has regarded the creation of the
Malaysian multimedia hub as an economic strategy which would focus
on new technologies. He felt that developments in the MSC could
help raise the total productivity factor of various economic
sectors such as manufacturing and services.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Two British were arrested
Thursday on suspicion of circulating forged British Sterling
notes in Cyprus, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police said that tourists Diane Margaret Jones, 32, and Allan
William Smith, 37, had been "nabbed" by an eagle-eyed store owner
in Cyprus' Ayia Napa town.
</P>
<P>
Case investigator Haris Paraskeva said Jones, a civil servant,
and Smith, who runs a company in England, entered the shop
in the resort on Wednesday night and asked to change five 10
Sterling notes. The shopkeeper noticed that all five notes
bore the same serial number and alerted police.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested the two tourists and carried out a search of
their Ayia Napa holiday flat. Bundles of 10 and 20 sterling notes,
with a total face value of over 1,400 Sterling, were found in the
apartment.
</P>
<P>
Paraskeva said that many of the notes carried the same
serial number.
</P>
<P>
He said police had reason to believe the two suspects
could be members of an international forgery ring. Since they
have been on the island since September 17, it was likely
the tourists had tried to palm off more counterfeit bills, the
investigator said.

JAKARTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian girls' team
won the gold medal, while Thailand took the gold in the boys' team
event at the first Asian School Tennis Championships concluded
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian girls' squad defeated Thailand 3-0 to clinch the

</P>
<P>
Girls' coach Yosafat Sihombing said after the match that he was
very satisfied with his team's performance at the championships.
</P>
<P>
"We applied the right strategy and our girls followed it
through perfectly. I just boosted their motivation. They didn't
need much of a pep talk to play so well. I just told them to force
the Thai girls to run all over the court, because I think they don
't really like to run on the clay court. If they played hard
against the Thais, they would have lost," he said.
</P>
<P>
With six gold medals up for grabs in the championships,
Indonesia still has the opportunity to add to it's tally.
</P>
<P>
Frederika and Angelique have chances for gold in the girls'
singles, while Angelique and Novianti are top seeded in the
doubles. In the boy's doubles, Naharuddin and Prima are the

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshis Spend $200 Mln Yearly for Treatment Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi people spend some
200 million U.S. dollars every year for getting medicare services
abroad, The Financial Express daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of patients are going abroad every year, specially to
India, Thailand, Singapore, Britain and the United States, for
better treatment, spending huge amount of money, experts were
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In view of the poor facilities and services here in the health
sector, the government has called upon the private entrepreneurs
to come forward with their investment in health services, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 500-bed multi-disciplinary hospital, the country's
first private sector tertiary hospital, will be set up in the
capital city by the year 2001, which is aimed at providing
world-class services.
</P>
<P>
Under a contract signed here on Thursday between the
Continental Hospital Limited (CHL) and a British health care
company, the International Hospital Groups (IHG), the CHL will
have a wide-range of health-care services which would match the
highest level of standard available in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes well, the 1.8 billion taka (36 million
dollars) project which is to be operated and managed by the IHG,
will start functioning by 2001.
</P>
<P>
The hospital, once completed, would reduce the number of people
going abroad for medicare, according to Commerce and Industries
Minister Tofail Ahmed. If anything, "there will even be influx of
people from India to Bangladesh," CHL chairman M.M. Hossain said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Produces 3,100 Tons of Rubber Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Forest
Industries Development Corporation (BFIDC) produced about 3,100
tons of rubber worth 133.3 million taka (about 2.67 million U.S.
dollars) during the 1998-99 fiscal year, daily newspaper Observer
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The output of rubber of the country increased steadily since
fiscal 1993-94 except 1997-98 when the production decreased due to
cyclone.
</P>
<P>
So far the BFIDC has brought 32,265 acres of land under rubber
cultivation in three zones, where there are a total of 4,132,955
rubber trees, are growing, including 1,533,679 productive (mature)
trees.
</P>
<P>
The production would rise to 8,300 tons considering the volume
of plantation and the age of the trees, experts said. The present
demand of rubber in the country is 7,000-7,500 tons, and the
demand is expected to reach 10,000 tons at the beginning of the
next century, BFICD sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has been trying to reduce dependence
on rubber imports by making use of locally-produced rubber
resources, according to Environment and Forest Minister Syeda
Sajeda Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
Rubber plantation was first started in Bangladesh in 1955 on an
experimental basis, and a comprehensive program was undertaken in
1975 to attain self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
The country's rubber farming has a bright prospect since the
climate, chemical components of soil and yearly rate of rainfall
in many parts of the country are favorable for rubber cultivation,
experts said.

<HEADLINE> 7 Indonesian Govt Officials Involved in Bank Scandal: House Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Seven high-ranking Indonesian
officials have been allegedly involved in the Bank Bali scandal, a
special parliamentary team said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The House special committee has implied that seven government
officials and six other people were involved in the Bank Bali
scandal," the Head of the House ad hoc committee on the case Lili
Asjudirdja told a plenary meeting of the House of Representatives
(DPR).
</P>
<P>
The seven government officials who have been allegedly involved
in the banking controversy are Chairman of the Supreme Advisory
Council A.A. Baramuli, Finance Minister Bambang Subianto, Bank
Indonesia's Governor Syahril Sabirin, State Minister for Promotion
of State Enterprises Tanri Abeng, Head of the Indonesian Banking
Restructurization Agency (IBRA) Glenn M. Yusuf, as well as IBRA's
deputy chiefs Farid Harianto and Pande Lubis.
</P>
<P>
The Bank Bali saga began when a top official of the ruling
Golkar Party colluded with high ranking officials to help Bank
Bali collect interbank loans totaling 904 billion rupiah (about
129 million U.S. dollars) from a liquidated bank at a huge fee of
546 billion rupiah (78 million dollars), although under the
recapitalization scheme, the government fully guarantees interbank
borrowings.
</P>
<P>
As top-level cover-up became obvious, international lenders
halted their lending to Jakarta pending a thorough and transparent
settlement of the case.

<HEADLINE> Thai Consumers Turn to Local Pharmaceuticals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The imported drug market in
Thailand continues to grow this year but business prospects for
importers are declining, the Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to grow to 28 billion baht (700 million
U.S. dollars) this year, an 18 percent increase from 1998 or close
to that of 1997, Somgiat Mahapun, president of the Pharmaceutical
Producers' Association (PPA), was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Taking the import volume into account, the market this year
will expand only five to six percent from 1998 but will fall 25
percent from 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged economic slump has forced consumers to shift to
locally-made drugs.
</P>
<P>
Somgiat said the PPA's 50 members, mostly involved in drug
imports, are suffering from financial trouble. Some have seen
their operating profit decline while others have posted losses.
</P>
<P>
The weaker baht, at 40 to the dollar, compared with 25 baht two
years ago, has forced up the prices of imported drugs but retail
prices could not immediately catch up with the higher cost because
drugs are subject to price controls in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Next month the PPA will ask the Internal Trade Department to
consider raising drug prices, in view of the fact that the baht
has recently slipped further.
</P>
<P>
Somgiat said he hopes the drug can be free from state control
given the fluctuation of exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, although consumers have turned to
locally-made drugs rather than imported ones, local manufacturers
are also suffering from poor financial results because they have
resorted to price cutting strategies in bidding to supply
state-run hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The PPA president said it is crucial for local manufacturers to
invest more to improve drug quality to international standards and
the association is also pressing for a law to control the quality
of drugs from the production stage to monitoring after sale.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Finland will provide Vietnam
with 40 million Finnmark (about eight million US dollars) to help
its development in rural areas, said an agreement signed by the
two governments during Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai's
four-day official visit here started on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Phan had a meeting with Finnish Prime
Minister to discuss economic cooperation and collaboration between
EU members and Asian countries.

mainly exporting machinery and equipment, and importing furniture,
clothes and shoes.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, being Finland's major assistance target in Asia,
receives 40 million Finnmark (about 8 million US dollars) per year
to mainly improve its water supplying, sewage system and rural
development projects.
</P>
<P>
Finland is the second leg of Phan's Northern Europe visit after
Sweden, considered part of Vietnam's efforts to improve it
international economic relations.
</P>

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- "The '99 Fortune Forum will
open in Shanghai in several days and will draw the attention of
the whole world."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, John S. Needham, president of the
Fortune Conference Division, said, "It is China's rapidly
developing economy that has attracted the attention of the
presidents of world's great multinationals."
</P>
<P>
Each year, Fortune magazine ranks the world's top 500
enterprises and chooses the city with the most vigorous economy in
which to hold their global forum, according to Needham.
</P>
<P>
He said the Shanghai Forum, with the theme "China -- The Next
50 Years," will enable multinational executives to learn more
about China, which is now experiencing "a magic change" and
bringing about huge commercial opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Needham predicts that these giant enterprises will greatly
increase their investment in China over the next few years,
especially in the country's insurance, aviation, and hotel sectors.
</P>
<P>
In addition to government officials and economists, most of
the 200 Chinese representatives attending the forum are
entrepreneurs who expect to have cooperative talks with their
foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
"They are here as participants rather than as observers,"
Needham noted.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his satisfaction with the way Shanghai has
organized the event.
</P>
<P>
"The Shanghai International Conference Center, the major venue
for the Forum, was built quickly, and the new Pudong Airport has
also gone into operation. The municipality's infrastructure also
has been perfected. As it further improves its services, Shanghai
will certainly become one of the world economic centers, like Hong
Kong and Singapore," Needham added.
</P>
<P>
Needham has been kept busy ever since coming to Shanghai in
January. "I've been too excited to get much sleep, organizing such
an important conference," he said with a sense of humor.

<HEADLINE> China Embarks Upon 21st Century as Giant Country: Arab League Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid has said that China is stepping into
the 21st century as a giant country with a mounting and effective
role in a new world.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid expressed confidence that China will become an
economic power in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum made the statement in
a recent interview with Xinhua on the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the eventful ceremonies marking the return of Hong
Kong to China in July 1997, which he attended, Abdel-Meguid said
he is deeply impressed by China's sincere desire to safeguard
world peace and stability without relinquishing its legitimate
rights.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the Arab League's support for and adherence to
the "One China Policy," and expressed hope that China will
eventually accomplish the cause of reunification under the
principle of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Praising China's immense economic achievements over the past 50
years, Abdel-Meguid said that China has achieved great success in
carrying out the policies of reform and opening to the outside
world in the last two decades, and building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese leaders have succeeded in steering the
process of reform and economic modernization by securing political
and social stability, which has led to development and prosperity
of the Chinese society in economic, social and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid stressed the importance of strengthening the
cooperative relations between Arab countries and China. He said
close Arab-Chinese relations are in the best interests of both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Both the Arab world and China have broad prospects for closer
cooperation in the political, economic and cultural fields, the
Arab League chief said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on China's role in regional and international
affairs, the Arab League chief spoke highly of China's independent
foreign policies, saying that China adheres to maintaining world
peace, opposing interference in the internal affairs of other
countries, and setting up cordial relations and cooperation with
all states.
</P>
<P>
China bases its international relations on the five principles
of peaceful co-existence and spares no effort for the
establishment of a new, fair, stable and peaceful international
economic and political order for the sake of peace and human
development, Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>

BELGRADE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government on
Thursday said that to redesignate the Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) into the Kosovo Protection Corps is illegal aimed at
legalizing the acts of the terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, it said the deal of redesignating
between the U.N., NATO and KLA reached on Monday night grossly
violated the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 on the Kosovo
issue.
</P>

Connivance and predilection on the part of U.N. and NATO will
lead to disastrous consequence, the Yugoslav government noted,
pointing out that the KLA which is directly responsible for

disarmed and demilitarized.

<HEADLINE> Baby Panda Twins in Good Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The one-month old baby giant
panda twins born at the Beijing Zoo are in good health, according
to zookeepers.
</P>
<P>
The two cubs now weigh 1,200 and 800 grams, increasing their
weight by 1,040 grams and 694 grams since they were born on August
23.
</P>
<P>
Yong Yong, the 18-year-old mother panda is also in good
condition, the keepers said, adding that she has given birth to a
total of 11 cubs, including four sets of twins.
</P>
<P>
To ensure their healthy growth, the zookeepers have been
carefully looking after the twins by feeding them formula milk
alternatively, as the mother panda can only feed one cub during
her lactation.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species,
with only approximately 1,000 left in the wild, 80 percent in
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that these animals have a very low reproductive
capacity, and female giant pandas become pregnant no more than
once a year, delivering one or two cubs each time. Only 10 percent
of giant pandas are able to mate naturally.
</P>
<P>
China has tried many ways to increase the number of the species,
and succeeded in breeding the first giant panda by artificial
insemination in 1963. Since then, 12 zoos and one animal reserve
worldwide have bred more than 140 giant pandas, but the survival
rate has been a rather low 29 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Urged to Discuss Asiad Bidding With Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's State Minister of
Youth Affairs and Sports Agung Laksono urged the National Sports
Council (KONI) to sit down with Malaysia to discuss their bids for
the 2006 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with KONI Chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar and Vice
Chairman Arie Sudewo at his office on Thursday, Agung said it
would be better for the two countries to come together and discuss
their bids in a show of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) spirit.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Malaysia is willing to show the ASEAN spirit by
featuring in their bid sports in which Indonesia has an
opportunity to win gold medals, which would allow us to support
their bid. Failing this, they should officially withdraw from the
bidding. But if Malaysia fails to show this spirit, I think we
must fight to win the bid," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will face Malaysia, Qatar, Syria, India, Hong Kong
and Uzbekstan in its bid to host the 2006 Asiad. The host country
will be named during the Olympics Committee of Asia executive
meeting in October next year.
</P>
<P>
Agung said Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad asked
President B.J. Habibie during their meeting in Kuala Lumpur
earlier this month to reconsider Indonesia's bid for the Asiad and
throw its support behind Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mahathir expressed Malaysia's desire not to
compete against Indonesia in the bidding, preferring instead to
have Indonesia's support in a show of ASEAN unity.
</P>
<P>
Agung also said the Indonesian sports community must be
realistic in view of the country's current economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"I think the new government, which will be elected in the
General Session of the People's Consultative Assembly in early
November, will prioritize economic recovery. Maybe we'll start to
pay attention to other aspects of life, including sports, in 2006,
" he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Agung also urged KONI to pay more attention to its athlete
development programs in order to climb back to the top of the
athletics ladder in the 2001 Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Spend Mid-Autumn Festival With Ease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 24 (Xinhua) -- People in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, north China, no longer busy themselves with
making moon cakes before the Mid-Autumn Festival that falls today,
and holidays are no longer as special as before in the eyes of
many Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"My family used to make dozens of moon cakes themselves
whenever Mid-Autumn Festival came when I was a child," said Liu
Yuelong, a 37-year-old man working in an insurance company. " But
this year we just bought some moon cakes."
</P>
<P>
Chinese used to attach extreme importance to holidays, for only
on holidays when they usually eat better and dress in their best
clothes. But now, people don't look forward to these occasions as
eagerly as they once did thanks to nationwide economic growth and
improved living conditions.
</P>
<P>
"It used to be the case that we could not afford to buy meat,
fish or fresh vegetables every day because of high prices and low
salaries. So holidays were the only occasions when we could become
a little bit extravagant, but now it is totally different," said
Gai Wenshan, a civil servant.
</P>
<P>
And nowadays more and more people spend the days outside rather
than at home. "I just bought a swimsuit and a fishing rod because
my family wants to spend the Mid-autumn Festival at a tourist
resort. Spending holidays at home is a little bit dull and boring,
" said Zhang Yongli, who works in an Inner Mongolian hospital.
</P>
<P>
Also, more people now like to have dinner in restaurants rather
than cook themselves on holidays. "I don't want to make my wife
tired on this occasion, though she is an excellent cook," said
Hong Weiguo, a company manager.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth has brought great changes to every aspect of
social life, and also to people's attitude towards life, according
to sociologists in the autonomous region.

ear after an successful operation performed at the Shanghai
Huashan Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The girl and her parents are very satisfied with the result of
the operation because the new ear looks exactly like a normal one.
</P>
<P>
The operation employed a new method of skin grafting developed
by Dr. Wu Jianmin under the direction of Prof. Lin Zihao,
according to source at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The traditional prosthesis method is imperfect because the
rebuilt ear appears a bit swollen and some hair grows out of the
new skin. Dr. Wu's new method avoids these flaws and leaves
patients much more satisfied with their appearance.

<HEADLINE> Vancouver Grizzlies Sold to New Owners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Vancouver Grizzlies,
set to begin their fifth season in the NBA, have been sold from
the Orca Bay organization to St. Louis Blues owners Bill and Nancy
Laurie.
</P>
<P>
The sale is pending approval from the NBA Board of Governors.
</P>
<P>
It is rumored that the franchise will be moved to St. Louis
after the 1999-2000 season, but Bill Laurie did not confirm or
deny it when repeatedly asked at today's news conference. The
Lauries reside in Missouri and bought the Blues and the Kiel
Center earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"It'll probably be hard for me to convince you we have made no
decision of moving the team at all," Bill Laurie said. "Our main
concern is getting approval by the NBA Board of Governors."
</P>
<P>
The Price that the Lauries paid was not disclosed, but former
Grizzlies owner John McCaw of Orca Bay said the total was more
than the $125 million he originally paid for the team.
</P>
<P>
The Lauries previously were involved in negotiations to acquire
the Denver Nuggets, and reportedly looked at the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
"We've been looking for the right opportunity for many years,"
Bill Laurie added. "We had a brief encounter with Denver, which is
ancient history. We now want to focus our attention on the
Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
"The first order of business is to improve the ballclub on and
off the ballcourt. It is much too soon to settle on long-term
plans or on the future."

<HEADLINE> NBA to Launch New Television Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The NBA is about to supply
its fans with all the basketball they can watch.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner David Stern will announce on Friday that the NBA
is set to become the first sports league to create a full-time
television network -- NBA.com TV -- that will debut when the 1999-
2000 season begins on November 2.
</P>
<P>
"NBA.com TV represents the convergence of the Internet,
television and basketball," Stern said. "By combining the
immediacy and depth of information from NBA.com with current and
historical television programming from the NBA, NBA.com TV will
offer our fans complete, round-the-clock coverage of the league.
</P>
<P>
"NBA.com TV will be the place to turn for anything and
everything about the NBA as it's happening."
</P>
<P>
The launch of NBA.com TV comes despite a substantial fall-off
in ratings after last season was almost lost to an owner-imposed
lockout.
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan's departure from the three-time defending
champion Chicago Bulls and a decrease in the qualify of play
because of the lockout also contributed to the low ratings.
</P>
<P>
The league already has contracts for its games to be shown
nationally on NBA, TBS and TNT.
</P>
<P>
Produced by NBA Entertainment, NBA.com TV will include real-
time statistics, scores and news from the leagues's web site, NBA.
com.Also being planned is live studio-based programming, live "
look-ins" of games in progress, highlights, talk shows and
basketball-related movies.
</P>
<P>
"We see this as an opportunity to tap into the rich array of
information available on NBA.com and the vast television
programming from NBAE's video and film library," said Adam Silver,
President of NBA Entertainment. "This is also an opportunity to
produce and a acquire new and original basketball-themed
programming specifically for the network."
</P>
<P>
The NBA is estimating that the 24-hour network will be
available in 5.6 million homes through DIRECTV, the nation's
largest satellite service, and in more than one million homes with
upgraded digital cable systems.

<HEADLINE> Mitchell Confident of N.Irish Talks Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. mediator George Mitchell,
in his first public comments since returning to Northern Ireland
three weeks ago to try and break a deadlock in the peace process,
said on Thursday he was still confident of success.
</P>
<P>
"I believe very strongly that it is possible to meet the remit
of the prime ministers although at the same time I recognize the
difficulties involved and I understand the grounds for pessimism,"
Mitchell told reporters in the Northern Ireland capital Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Under the former U.S. senator's mediation, the main opposition
parties in the province signed a historical peace deal in April
last year.
</P>
<P>
But attempts to implement the deal failed because of a row over
whether the Catholic-backed Sinn Fein party should enter
government before its Irish Republican Army (IRA) allies disarm.
</P>
<P>
So British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern asked Mitchell to see if he could get the process
back on the rails.
</P>
<P>
Trying to dispel gloom around the process, Mitchell said a
similar atmosphere had existed before agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after opening a plant for the U.S.-owned Meridian
Medical Technologies Inc, Mitchell said all the parties were
serious in trying to make progress.
</P>
<P>
"They want to try to get the job done. The difficulty is in
translating that attitude and state of mind into concrete action
which will accomplish the objective," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Meets Palestinian Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton met with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat Thursday at
the White House, during which he pledged that the United States
will continue to assist Palestine and Israel to reach an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We should first meet our obligations under the Wye River
agreement," Clinton said during the meeting. "We're into the final
budget legs now, and I'm quite hopeful."
</P>
<P>
He called on U.S. Congress to approve funding for Israel and
the Palestinians promised under a deal forged with U.S. help in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Clinton helped as a go-between for Arafat and new Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak in the weeks leading up to their breakthrough
September 4 land-for-security deal. Thursday's meeting between
Clinton and Arafat was seen as his first foray into the next phase
of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak have set a one-year timetable for talks aimed
at a permanent status agreement that will deal with the issue of
Palestinian statehood and, hopefully, a lasting peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We're heading toward the moment of truth, difficult times in
negotiations," Arafat said after the meeting. "But we're going to
continue striving to achieve the comprehensive peace we've wanted
in the region."
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Washington Thursday after his visits to
Egypt, Ireland and the United Nations in New York. He has spoken
positively of the peace process along the way.

<HEADLINE> TV Program for Mid-Autumn Festival Revised After Taiwan Quake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Oriental TV
Station and Taiwan Television Enterprises Ltd. has revised the Mid-
autumn Festival program they jointly produced in the wake of the
strong earthquake that jolted Taiwan Tuesday morning in a order to
show sympathy for Taiwanese compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The program made through satellite two-day transmission will be
broadcast in Shanghai and Taiwan simultaneously Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying hard to readjust our program so the Taiwan
audience will feel the warmth of the motherland on the Mid-autumn
Festival," said Bei Genyuan, director of the Shanghai TV station.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai and Taiwan started broadcasting a Mid-autumn Festival
TV program via satellite in 1997. But the program was suspended
last year because of the heavy flooding in the Chinese mainland.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks
plunged Thursday in fears of higher interest rates and on
the weaker dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 205.48 at
10,318.59. The blue chip index fell 505.31 points in the three
consecutive tradings.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 30.10 at 1,280.41 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 108.33 at 2,749.83.
</P>
<P>
Stocks went down after the Labor Department reported that
the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment
benefits fell unexpectedly last week to the lowest level in 25
years. The low jobless rate sparked fears of the hike in
interest rates because investors believed that companies would
have to increase wages and benefits in order to attract skilled
workers, thus putting more pressures on inflation.
</P>
<P>
The weak dollar helped to drive the market down. The dollar
inched higher to 103.95 today up from 103.93 Wednesday against
the Japanese yen but it is still lingering near the lowest
levels since 1996. The weaker dollar will make imports more
expensive and therefore could add to inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The market was also hit by a warning given by Microsoft
president Steve Ballmer. The executive said at a conference that
technology stocks are overvalued.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 10.18 at 590.98 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 4.95 at 777.50. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 7.32 at 420.21.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,186 down, 900 up and 475
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 873.98 million shares from 808.23
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Hold Open Discussion on Small Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council is expected to meet on Friday morning in an open session
to discuss the illegal spread of small arms, which has made it
harder for the international community to curb the armed conflict,
a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will open the discussion at
the ministerial level, Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Council met in a closed-door session to make
preparations for the upcoming meeting.
</P>
<P>
The open meeting will be convened at the initiative of the
president of the Council, Arnold Peter van Walsum of the
Netherlands, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Small arms are widely used in conflicts in which a high
proportion of the casualties are civilians, and in which violence
has been perpetrated in gross violation of international
humanitarian law.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Says World Moves into New Century With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka said
Thursday that the mankind leaves the 20th century with many
spectacular achievements, but will move into the 21st with old,
intractable problems, so the United Nations should inject more
vigor into solving these problems.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Lakshman Kadirgamar, foreign minister
of Sri Lanka, addressed the General Assembly here.
</P>
<P>
"We leave the 20th century with many spectacular achievements
behind us," he said. "But let us make no mistake -- we move into
the 21st carrying with us old, intractable problems that have been
with us since the dawn of time."
</P>
<P>
"As the present century draws to a close new problems of
unparalleled menace and danger have emerged," he said. "They will
undoubtedly occupy our attention well into the next century."
</P>
<P>
"Poverty, illiteracy, ill-health, hunger, unemployment,
uncontrolled urbanization, the growth of mega cities -- these are
old problems which deeply affect over half of humanity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have not addressed these problems with sufficient vigor
over the past decades," he said. "While the U.N. systems were set
up to tackle these problems the capacity of the system to deliver
results has been grossly inadequate."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on the international community to adopt
a development agenda which must contain a social dimension and
assure the protection to the most vulnerable elements of the
society.

<P>
The Ministers "underlined the need for the adoption of a new,
comprehensive resolution, based upon the disarmament and
humanitarian objectives of the Council," according to a statement
issued by the Ministers.
</P>
<P>
They instructed their representatives to continue consultations
to resolve the remaining differences, with the aim of "reaching
agreement on a new resolution to be adopted by the Council as soon
as possible".

The Council is still sharply divided over the arms inspection
in Iraq and sanctions against Iraq.

forms, the statement said.
