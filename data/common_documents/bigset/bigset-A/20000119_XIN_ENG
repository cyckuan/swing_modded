<HEADLINE> Bangkokians to Have Holiday Thanks to UNCTAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 18 (Xinhua) -- People living in the Thai
capital city will have an extra public holiday on February 11
thanks to the upcoming 10th United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD), to be held here between February 12 and 19.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet agreed Tuesday to give Bangkokians a public
holiday on February 11, one day ahead of the opening day of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
By setting the extra holiday on a Friday, the government hoped
the long weekend will encourage exodus of city dwellers to
provinces and therefore alleviate the notorious traffic problem in
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Thailand estimated that there will be about 10,000 people
visiting Thailand during the meeting, including 3,000 to 4,000
delegates from 188 members of UNCTAD, 1,000 to 2,000 foreign
reporters and 3,000 to 4,000 family members of the delegates and
tourists.
</P>
<P>
Traffic arrangements for the participants will require 1,905
policemen and a 12.2-million-baht (326,200 U.S. dollars) budget,
local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai warned all groups,
local or international, planning protests during the conference
not to resort to road blockades or violence, for fear that the
first global gathering in the new millennium would be spoiled by
protests like last month's World Trade Organization Ministerial
Meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
A special task force will be set up by the Interior Ministry to
increase security during the meeting, the biggest that Thailand
has ever hosted.

<HEADLINE> France Rejects Annan's Nomination of Ekeus as UNMOVIC Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- France rejected on Tuesday the
nomination by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan of Rolf Ekeus as
the head of the new U.N.disarmament regime in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry assistant spokesman Francois Rivasseau
said that it is doubtful that Ekeus, who was chief of the former U.
N. Special Commission in charge of disarmament in Iraq, could
represent "the will" of the U.N. in resuming its cooperation with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ekeus was for six years (1991-1997) the president of the
former special commission on disarmament in Iraq. One can doubt
that he could incarnate this will of renewal and change," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the new U.N. Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) should be "a new organism
which is characterized by more professionalism, more collegial
structure, independence and authority."
</P>
<P>
France is the second permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council to reject the nomination after Russia.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of the chief of UNMOVIC must be approved
unanimously by all the 15 members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has categorically rejected the nomination, which was made
by Annan on Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Tuesday it will provide development assistance of 400 million
euros (404 million U.S. dollars) to Peru and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for External Relations Christopher Patten
announced the plan when meeting with the vice ministers for
Foreign Affairs of Peru, Jorge Valdez Carrillo and Ecuador,
Francisco Carreon Meta.
</P>
<P>
Patten also assured the two vice ministers of support for the
donors meeting in Paris on January 24 and 25 which will focus on
the development of border regions.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU's initial aid plan will contribute to the cross-
border development for the two countries in the reconstruction of
the main Guayaquil-Piura road, the principal transport and
economic trade route.
</P>
<P>
Patten also expressed his satisfaction at the implementation of
the October 1998 peace agreement between the two countries which
brought an end to a 150-year cross-border argument.
</P>
<P>
Patten stressed the importance of this act for the stability of
Latin America. Both the Latin American countries have set up an
economic development plan for the common border area and have
asked for the financial support of the international community.

<HEADLINE> Acting President of Seychelles Meets Chinese Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTANANARIVO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Acting President of
Seychelles James Michel met Chinese foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan
in the city of Victoria on Tuesday to exchange views on bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Both them expressed satisfaction over the healthy and smooth
development of the bilateral friendly and cooperative ties over
the past 24 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations
between the two countries, and wished to further expand exchanges
and cooperation in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Tang said his current five-nation tour is his third official
visit to Africa and Seychelles the last stop of the trip. All the
five nations sincerely hope to strengthen and expand cooperation
with China in all fields, particularly in economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both sides need to make joint efforts to explore
new ideas, ways and channels for cooperation. For example, he said,
China and Africa can expand their substantial cooperation in
agriculture as China has accumulated successful experience in the
area and has acquired highly sophisticated technology while Africa
has favorable conditions and urgent needs for agricultural
development.
</P>
<P>
Tang said, with the current visit, China has enhanced its
confidence for the success of the Sino-African Cooperation Forum
to be held this autumn. China is willing to continue listening to
the constructive advices and opinions from African countries so as
to ensure the good results of the forum.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Michel reiterated Seychelles' "One China" policy
and support to China's sacred task of unifying the country. He
hoped that the Taiwan issue could be solved at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Tang's view on the affairs in Africa, and willing
to strengthen cooperation with China on international issues by
promoting the world's multi-polarization, Michel said uni-
polarization is unfavorable to the developing countries,
especially the small- and medium-sized ones. The developing
countries should be protected in the process of economic
globalization, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tang and his group arrived in Seychelles on January 17.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Foreign Minister Reaffirms U.S. Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi indicated on Wednesday that Iran has no intention to
soften its attitude toward the United States at present.
</P>
<P>
The tone of the statement appeared in contrast with a big
fanfare of so-called "soccer diplomacy" between Iran and the United
States earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian national football team, completing its three-game
visit to the U.S., played an exhibition match with the U.S. team
before a crowd of nearly 50,000 football fans at the Pasadena
Stadium, California, Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the pre-game introductions, the American players
presented flowers to the Iranians. At the 1998 World Cup, Iran's
players had given flowers to U.S. players in an exchange of gifts.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we are not intending to build friendly relations
with the U.S.," Kharrazi told reporters at Istanbul's Conrad Hotel,
reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi accused Washington of disregarding the fact that Iran
is an important and powerful country in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Recently, friends of the U.S. are changing their relations with
Iran," he noted, referring apparently to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi recently paid an official visit to London upon
invitation, a move that was described as a breakthrough in the
relations between Britain and Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. will also have to alter its attitude toward Iran,"
Kharrazi said. "If they change their attitude, start understanding
us and act sincerely, then maybe our opinions will change."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister arrived in Turkey for a two-day
visit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Ankara, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit received him respectively. An
memorandum of understanding between the two big Islamic neighbors
was signed by him and his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem.

<HEADLINE> Positive Turko-Greek Relations to Continue: Turkish official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkey hopes positive steps in
Turko-Greek relations to continue, Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy
Spokesman Sermat Atacanli said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem will hold talks with
his Greek counterpart George Papandreou, who arrived in Ankara
later Wednesday for a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou's tour to Turkey is the first of its kind by a Greek
foreign minister in almost three decades.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the two sides will sign four agreements
concerning tourism, fight against illegal immigration, terrorism
and cross-border crime, and economic, scientific and technological
cooperations.
</P>
<P>
The Greek foreign minister will also be received by Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel and Parliament Speaker Yildirim Akbulut,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister will go to Athens in the beginning
of February for a return visit, but the spokesman did not give a
specific date.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, Cem said Turko-Greek relations has so improved
that the two countries may now begin talks on substantial problems
such as Aegean Sea sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Cem said there is already good cooperation between Greece and
Turkey in many areas, setting a foundation for future relations.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey remains committed to solve all its differences with
Greece by peaceful means, the same as Greece wants to do," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers have been considered the main
architects of a rapprochement between Turkey and Greece, which are
NATO allies but have been at odds for a long time over a various
issues including Cyprus and borders in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries started talks on relatively non-
controversial issues last year and boosted relations by an
unexpected outpouring of public sympathy and support when both
countries suffered deadly earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Partly because of the new atmosphere, Greece lifted its
objections to acceptance of Turkey as a formal candidate for
European Union membership at an EU summit in Helsinki last
December.

<HEADLINE> Over 80 Percent of Algerian Militants Disarmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's interior minister said
on Wednesday over 80 percent of the Islamic militants have laid
down their arms under the president's general amnesty decree and
the civil reconciliation law.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, more than 80 percent of the men who took up
arms against the country have set them down," Interior Minister
Yazid Zerhouni told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Zerhouni estimated that another 1,500 former fighters from other
armed groups have turned themselves in.
</P>
<P>
"Among the remaining 20 percent, some are being pressured and
receiving orders from abroad," he added, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
However, Zerhouni said it is difficult to estimate the total
number of those who were intended by the amnesty, adding that the
identification and census process is still going on.
</P>
<P>
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika issued a civil
reconciliation decree on July 13, 1999 to help those who were
involved in terrorist and sabotage acts reintegrate into the
society and express themselves in peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika granted a blanket to members of the Islamic Salvation
Army (AIS) last week after they announced their disbandment.
</P>
<P>
The north African country has been wrecked since 1992 by
violence that has claimed more than 100,000 lives. The insurgency
was triggered by the army's cancellation of the second round of
legislative elections in January 1992, which the Islamic Salvation
Front was poised to win.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Nominated Candidate for Russian Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Yevgeny Primakov, Russian ex-
premier and leader of the Fatherland-All Russia movement, was
nominated a candidate for Russia's presidency by a decision made
at a meeting of his sponsoring group here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Primakov have kept receiving numerous telephone
calls and letters from citizens who would like him to be president,
said Boris Shkolnikov, chairman of the executive committee of the
Central Public movement in support of Centrist Forces, who
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's optimism and wish to join the presidential race have
increased considerably lately, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at a session of the Political Council of the
Fatherland movement, Fatherland leader Mayor of Moscow Yuri
Luzhkov said that, as before, he would support Primakov's
nomination as a presidential candidate. Luzhkov categorically
denied assertions about a chill in his relations with Primakov
following the parliamentary elections, noting that on the contrary
these relations have improved, said well-informed sources of the
sponsoring group of Primakov.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Putin Registered as Candidate for Russian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Central Election
Commission (CEC) Wednesday received documents for the registration
by the initiative group nominating acting President and Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin for the next president.
</P>
<P>
The law gives the commission four days for registration and it
may consider the question at one of its nearest meetings scheduled
for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Putin was nominated on January 12.
</P>
<P>
The CEC has already registered seven initiative groups and
election associations, which have nominated their candidates for
presidency.
</P>
<P>
CEC chairman Alexander Veshnyakov confirmed that he knows of
almost 30 initiative groups which plan to nominate their
candidates.
</P>
<P>
He said nomination is the easiest part of the race. It is not
hard to find 100 people to set up an initiative group. But then it
will have to do meticulous organizational work, including the
collection of 500,000 signatures in support of their candidates.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the submission of lists of signatures and
documents for the registration of candidates is 6 p.m. (1500 GMT)
on February 13.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Lashes out at Attacks against Civilians in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The resolution, adopted at the end of an open Security Council
debate on Burundi, "strongly condemns" the murder of United
Nations Children's Fund and World Food Program personnel and
Burundian civilians in October 1999, and urged that "the
perpetrators be effectively brought to justice."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reiterated its "strong support" for the
renewed Arusha peace process and Nelson Mandela, the former South
African president, to act as the new mediator for Burundi, the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, the new mediator for Burundi, came to the U.N.
headquarters in New York, from the Tanzanian city of Arusha, where
he sharply criticized the country's 18 political parties and rebel
leaders for allowing the slaughter of 6 million people in the tiny
African nation.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's civil war has been raging for six years and killed
more than 200,000 people, but it has not received the
international attention of other conflicts, particularly those
from the donor community.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts, in Burundi and other African countries have been
long neglected by the Western countries compared with the war
victims in Kosovo, the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who delivered his first speech at the Security Council
Wednesday, was appointed by African leaders in December last year
to mediate Burundi's stalled peace talks and use his diplomatic
skills, widely respected on the African continent and in other
parts of the world, to try to put an end to the conflict in the
small central African country.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called for all parties to ensure safe and
unhindered access of humanitarian workers and human rights
observers to all regroupment camps, and called for internees to
have access to their livelihood outside these camps.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also encouraged further progress between the
United Nations and the Government of Burundi and political parties
in the country in establishing appropriate security guarantees for
United Nations humanitarian agencies to resume field operations.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also called on neighboring countries to
take measures to halt cross-border insurgent activity, and the
illicit flow of arms and ammunition, and to ensure the neutrality,
security, and civilian character of refugee camps, said the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "calls for donors to provide humanitarian
and human rights assistance to Burundi and to resume substantial
economic and development assistance with due regard to security
conditions," the resolution said, urging "the international
community to examine the economic development needs of Burundi
with a view to establishing stable long-term conditions for the
well-being of the Burundian people and for the return of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Some 350 Congolese Civilians Killed in Ethnic Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- About 350 civilians have been
killed in the ethnic clashes near the eastern town of Bunia in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in the past two weeks,
Reuters reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Most of them died when whole villages were burned down, Ernest
Dia Wamba, leader of the DRC rebels with the headquarters in
Bunia, was quoted as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the Hema and Lendu ethnic groups over land
rights escalated into fighting with bows, arrows and machetes
early this month, Wamba said.
</P>
<P>
The Lendu farmers outnumber the pastoralist Hema in this area,
but the Hemas own most of the land.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts between the two groups have been intensified by the
17-month- old civil war in the DRC when arms were poured in from
neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Urges IMF to Cooperate in Fight Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has urged the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank to demonstrate a more positive cooperation in terms of
financial support for Kenya's continued fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
The president made the call when speaking at the summit of the
African heads of state and government on poverty reduction and
growth in sub- Saharan Africa in Gabonese capital Libreville
Wednesday, according to the Kenyan Presidential Press Service.
</P>
<P>
"In our endeavor to fight poverty, we welcome the new focus of
our development partners on poverty eradication as the primary
objective," Moi said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya hopes its development partners to be more flexible and
more innovative, especially with regard to their conditionalities,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that his country has made substantial progress in
privatization and such activities are underway in several key
sectors, especially in the telecommunications and banking sectors
which have expanded opportunities for private investments in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, which opened Tuesday, has been jointly
organized by the Gabonese government and the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The Libreville summit on poverty reduction and economic growth
was aimed at identifying and kick-starting an economic strategy to
match Africa with the world's industrialized countries.

<HEADLINE> Less Israeli Soldiers Killed in Southern Lebanon in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua)-- Only 13 Israeli officers and
soldiers were killed in the year 1999 inside the security zone in
southern Lebanon, a senior Israeli officer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters at the Israel Defense Force (IDF)
headquarters in Tel Aviv on the IDF's performance in 1999 and its
operation plans for the new year, IDF Chief of General Staff Shaul
Mofaz said the casualties have been reduced by half as compared to
the figure of the year 1998.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Hezbollah (the Party of God) and another military group
in southern Lebanon conducted a total of 1,408 military operations
against the IDF and the South Lebanon Army (SLA) inside the
security zone in 1999 as compared to 1,083 in 1998, but the IDF has
reduced its casualties due to the adoption of new methods in
dealing with the situation there, Mofaz said.
</P>
<P>
Such methods included the proper use of intelligence, the change
of operational procedures and the reinforcement by the Israel Air
Force, he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the security zone in 1985 with a self-proclaimed
purpose of protecting its northern security. The SLA sided with
Israel to strengthen the IDF's military presence in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
As for the military plans for the year 2000, the military chief
said the IDF will continue its structural reform in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IDF is ready to address new challenges as the
Middle East peace process moves forward in the new year, he said.
</P>
<P>
As Israel pushes ahead its peace talks with the Palestinians,
the Syrians and later the Lebanese, terrorist attacks might occur
to offset these talks, he said, adding that the IDF must be ready
for that.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the IDF will do everything it can to
facilitate the peace process in the new year.
</P>
<P>
The IDF is not leading the peace talks, but it has assigned
senior officers to join the negotiating teams in order to provide
military professional positions on military issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the peace agreements Israel tries to sign with its
neighbors can not eradicate immediately all threats to Israel, the
IDF is ready to safeguard the peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel resumed its peace talks with the Syrians last December
and the two sides have already held two rounds of negotiations in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, the third round slated for Wednesday in the United
States has been postponed. Syria wants Israel to write down its
promise for a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights which it has
occupied in the 1967 War, but Israel refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks also made no progress
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat flew on Wednesday to
Washington to request U.S. President Bill Clinton to exert pressure
on Israel to move this track forward.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Lawmakers Slam U.N. Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Belgian parliamentary
delegation has denounced the U.N. sanctions on Iraq as a crime
committed against the Iraqi people without any justification.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Belgian delegation, Jak Leiver, told the Iraqi News
Agency on Wednesday that they came to Iraq on a fact-finding
mission to find out how the unjust embargo affected the lives of
Iraqi civilians.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss with Iraqi officials the possibility of
resuming bilateral ties, Leiver added.
</P>
<P>
The 13-member delegation, which groups most of the Belgian
political parties, arrived here on Tuesday to participate in the
activities marking the 9th anniversary of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling U.N. economic sanctions imposed on
the country following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which triggered
the Gulf War on January 17, 1991. The U.S.-led multinational forces
drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait on February 28 of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to Iraq, the harsh sanctions have claimed the lives of
over 1.2 million Iraqi children in the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
A number of delegations, including a 100-member-plus Spanish
popular delegation and a 60-member non-governmental U.S. delegation
led by former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark who is an advocate
of lifting the sanctions on Iraq, are in Baghdad to mark the
anniversary.

LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Futures
Authority (SFA) has issued an Intervention Order against Austin
Friars Securities Limited because the firm had a deficiency in its
financial resources.
</P>
<P>
The Intervention Order directed the firm to cease from carrying
on investment business from 5 p.m. on 12 January 2000, the SFA
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In November 1999, the SFA issued the firm with a direction
requiring the firm to remedy the deficiency in its financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the firm has failed to comply with the direction
and as a result the SFA decided it was necessary to intervene,
according to the regulatory organization.
</P>
<P>
The SFA was established under the Financial Services Act 1986
with responsibility for regulating members of all the organized

LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Britain has
fallen for the 10th month in a row and the claimant count tumbled
21,900 to 1.164 million in November, the lowest total since March
1980.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
show that 4 percent of the workforce were out of work and claiming
benefit.
</P>
<P>
On the alternative Labor Force Survey (LFS), the unemployment
rate has fallen below 6 percent for the first time in the survey's
15-year history.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the picture of employment growth is even stronger,
with the number of people in work rising by over 300,000 to an all-
time high of 27.5 million, according to the LFS.
</P>
<P>
The ONS also said earnings growth remained steady at 4.9
percent in the three months to November, in line with expectations.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England considers a figure above 4.5 percent to be
"incompatible" with its 2.5 percent target for underlying
inflation and may be tempted to raise interest rates again.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Sees Burundi Peace Good to Regional Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It is not possible to establish regional peace unless
component parts of a region establish domestic foundations for a
stable democratic order," he said. "Peace in Burundi will give
hope for the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries in
the region. And it will prove an effective example of African
intervention in an African problem."
</P>
<P>
"If Burundians can reach an agreement on a way to live together,
they will be setting an example to neighboring countries, to
Africa and to the world," he said, referring to the efforts to put
an end to the conflict in Burundi that has left more than 2,000
people dead and tens of thousands in a worsening humanitarian
situation.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, the new mediator for Burundi, came to the U.N.
headquarters in New York, from the Tanzanian city of Arusha, where
he sharply criticized the country's 18 political parties and rebel
leaders for allowing the slaughter of 6 million people in the tiny

</P>
<P>
"In this regard we shall seek to send a clear message to the
Burundi government that in spite of the manner in which they came
to power, they and through them the Burundi Army have a particular
responsibility to defend and protect the civilian population and
not just a given part of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have no doubt that the Burundi peace talks represent the
only way in which Burundi can achieve peace and embark on the task
of reconstruction and development," he said. "For this process to
be successful it must be inclusive, and to the extent that players
are not represented at Arusha, we shall regard it as our task to
make the process as inclusive as possible."
</P>
<P>
Mandela is invited to speak at the Security Council, which is
expected to adopt a resolution condemning a recent surge of
violence in Burundi.

MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian customs at Moscow's
Sheremetyevo-2 International Airport seized a large consignment of
smuggled diamonds worth 3 million U.S. dollars Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Among these expensive diamonds the biggest ones weigh more than
10 carats. This is the most valuable case of precious jewel
smuggling exposed by the Moscow airport customs in latest years,
said a source from Russian security agencies.
</P>
<P>
The smugglers, a man and a woman from Belgium, intended to move
these precious gems out of Russia by hiding the diamonds in their
private parts, said Alexander Vorobyov, press secretary of the
Russian Interior Ministry's Main Department on the Fight against
Economic Crimes.
</P>
<P>
The operation was carried out by Russian Interior Ministry and
security officers, assisted by customs representatives at its
concluding stage, Vorobyov said.
</P>
<P>
Both of the individuals held are currently under investigation
and will presumably be indicted on two counts in line with
appropriate criminal code clauses: contraband and the illegal
circulation of precious stones and metals, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, was speaking at an open
Security Council debate on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"China fully supports the facilitating efforts by Mandela,"
Shen said. "We believe that with his outstanding wisdom and
experience, he will instill new vitality into the Arusha pace
process."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that many views and proposals put forward by
President Mandela merit serious attention and study by the
Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We, at the same time, also believe that the realization of
peace and national reconciliation in Burundi ultimately depends on
the people of Burundi and leaders of various factions," he said. "
Any other people cannot replace them in achieving peace."
</P>
<P>
"A political solution to be achieved through negotiations is
the only way to put an end to the internal conflict and realize
national reconciliation in Burundi," he said. "Any military means
can only render futile any achievement made so far in the peace
process and plunge the people of Burundi into war once again."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we call on the relevant parties of Burundi to
proceed from the fundamental interest of the Burudian people,
cease immediately hostilities, and fully take part in peace talks
for an agreement at an early date," he said.
</P>
<P>
The severe economic situation is the main cause of the
turbulence in Burundi, he said. "Without a fundamental and
complete elimination of poverty, it is hard to achieve peace and
stability in Burundi."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we appeal to the international community and donor
countries to intensify their economic assistance to Burundi," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will, as always, provide assistance to
the peace process in various aspects, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said Wednesday that a mountain brigade has been
established to finish off the rebels of the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF) who have been terrorizing the western region.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the brigade would leave the ADF rebels
with no sanctuary in the Rwenzori Mountains, Museveni said when
addressing local leaders in Bundibugyo district.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he assured local people that the insecurity problem
would soon be solved with more deployment of Uganda People's
Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
The president also called upon the rebels to take advantage of
the recently passed Amnesty Law and come out to surrender to the
government.
</P>
<P>
This is the only way out for the rebels, Radio Uganda quoted
Museveni as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels have been attacking civilian targets recently,
killing more than 40 civilians and injuring many others. A lot of
local people fled their homes to avoid rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
In the latest rebel attack on a displaced camp last Saturday,
more than 25 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels reportedly entered western Uganda from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo late last year after being
repulsed by the Ugandan government troops there.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls for End to Foreign Forces in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Wednesday called for an end to the presence of foreign
forces in the Gulf region, stressing that regional states are
capable of ensuring security for the region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf is a source of
tension and crisis and is an insult to regional governments and
nations, Khatami said at a flag-hoisting ceremony of the armed
forces in Bandar Abbas, capital city of the southern province of
Hormozgan.
</P>
<P>
He said western countries sent their troops to the region
in order to maintain their illegitimate control over the sensitive
region which sees great potential, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami did not mention the name of any country, but he was
obviously referring to the U.S. and its allies that have deployed
troops and military facilities in the region with a claimed aim of
thwarting perceived threats to the oil-rich Gulf sheikdoms and
ensuring the flow of oil to outside world.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which is vehemently opposed to the presence of foreign
forces in the Gulf, had on several occasions called on regional
states to maintain peace and security through cooperation among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The regional countries are interested in peaceful coexistence
in the region," said Khatami, "we believe that foreign forces must
leave the entire region."
</P>
<P>
He called on the regional states to show their ability to
safeguard regional security and independence. He also expressed
hope that solidarity will be promoted among the Gulf littoral
states.
</P>
<P>
Repeating the detente policy of his government, Khatami said
Iran has been a forerunner in advocating the establishment of a
region free of foreign forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the naval forces of the Iranian army and the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) launched a military exercise in
the waters of the Gulf in the presence of President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
A submarine, some destroyers, missile boats, speed boats and
helicopters took part in Wednesday's war games.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects Syrian Demand on Commitment to Pullback from Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel Wednesday rejected a
reported Syrian demand that Israel make a written commitment to a
full pullback from the occupied Golan Heights before the next round
of negotiations can be resumed.
</P>
<P>
"We did not accept preconditions for negotiations in the past,
and we will not accept preconditions now, " Haim Ramon, minister in
the Prime Minister's Office, told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a Lebanese newspaper report published
Wednesday that Syria will not go back to the negotiating table
until Israel makes such a commitment to withdrawing troops from the
Golan Heights back to the June 4, 1967 border, the line Syria
controlled before Israel captured the strategic plateau.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk al-Shareh was quoted by the As-
Safir newspaper as saying that Damascus is waiting for Washington
to inform it that Israel agrees to withdraw to the June 4, 1967
line.
</P>
<P>
The third round of Israeli-Syrian talks, which were scheduled
for Wednesday in the United States, has been postponed indefinitely
by the two sides following a dispute over one of the key issues, a
possible Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Syria has demanded that Israel commit to returning the whole
Golan, saying the late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin made a
commitment to pulling Israeli troops back to the June 4, 1967
border. Israel has denied the existence of such a commitment.
</P>
<P>
In his interview with Israel Radio, Ramon repeated the Israeli
position that an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan should be part
of the negotiations rather than a precondition.
</P>
<P>
"Any dictation by Syria will not accepted by us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The last round of talks, which were held early this month, once
came to the edge of collapse after disputes emerged over the agenda
of the talks. Syria threatened to leave the negotiations because
Israel rejected its demand that the issue of withdrawal be given
priority in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The crisis resolved only after the intervention of U.S.
President Bill Clinton. The working teams from the two sides on the
border issue met on the last day of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We told the Americans frankly we will not tolerate this style
any longer, and we might not come back if we do not feel
seriousness on the Israeli part to enter into the fundamental
subject-withdrawal to June 4 lines," Shareh told the As-Safir.
</P>
<P>
When announcing the resumption of the Israeli-Syrian talks last
December, Washington said that the two sides had agreed to restart
the talks from the point they broke down off in early 1996, but did
not reveal what the point was.
</P>
<P>
There were speculations that Washington prompted Damascus back
to the negotiating table by giving it assurances that Israel would
meet its territorial demand in a future peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
But Ramon told the radio that Washington understands Israel's
objection to any precondition, saying it had never pressured Israel
to make a commitment to a withdrawal before the talks began.
</P>
<P>
The minister denied a report by Israeli newspaper Yedioth on
Wednesday that Prime Minister Ehud Barak has agreed in principle to
the Syrian demand that the June 4, 1967 lines serve as a basis for
demarcating the future border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The report said Barak wanted "small changes and adjustments" to
that June 4, 1967 line for security considerations. It said Clinton
conveyed Barak's position to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad before
Damascus agreed to resume the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ramon dismissed the report as "not true."

<HEADLINE> Israeli MKs' Controversial Wage Hike Frozen Under Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Minister
Avraham Shochat Wednesday froze a six-percent salary increase for
Knesset (Parliament) members (MKs) and other senior public service
officials, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Shochat informed Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg that he wants to
wait for more discussion about the issue in Knesset Finance
Committee and in the whole House.
</P>
<P>
Shochat took this action after the Committee voted Wednesday
morning to go ahead with a scheduled six-percent pay hike for MKs,
which means each of them will get some NIS 1,500 (about 370
dollars) added to their NIS 25,000 salaries (about 6,100 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the wage hike will be extended automatically to other
senior public servants, including presidents, judges, government
ministers and directors of public corporation.
</P>
<P>
Coming out at a time when the country is suffering form
recession, unemployment rate is running over 9 percent and the cost
of living index is increasing by only 1.3 percent in 1999, the
large pay rise immediately sparked heated debate both in and out of
the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Some MKs charged those who had vote for the hike with isolating
themselves from their voters and tarnishing the Knesset's image.
</P>
<P>
Media reports also pointed out that the Knesset hike was
approved at a time when over one million Israeli children have been
away from school for four days because of the strike of their
teachers, who are fighting against the Finance Ministry for only a
1.2 percent pay rise.
</P>
<P>
The Teachers Union claimed that the teachers' salaries have been
eroded by 15 percent over the past five years. But the Treasury
refused to compensate them and don't care their demands, according
to the Union.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Sells Five-Year Bonds to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Thailand began to sell
five billion baht (135.1 million U.S. dollars) government bonds to
the public Wednesday to help finance the 110 billion baht (2.9
billion dollars) government deficit expected for the fiscal year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The bonds will offer an interest rate of 6.4 percent, paid
every six months. After-tax returns are 5.44 percent, considerably
favorable given that bank deposit rates are now between 2.75
percent and 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minimum investment is 10,000 baht (270.2 dollars).
Investors can sell the bonds to local financial institutions after
six months.
</P>
<P>
Once the bonds are fully sold, the Finance Ministry is expected
to approve a second five-billion-baht issue for individuals, which
will carry a term of seven years and pay an interest rate of 7.25-
7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on bank deposits have declined to their lowest
level in Thai banking history and may continue their downward
trend, forcing depositors to seek alternative destinations for
their savings.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls on Parties to Strive for Peace in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing an open Security Council meeting on Burundi, Annan
said, "No party in Burundi should assume that the justice of its
cause, or the iniquity of its opponents, is as obvious to the rest
of the world as they may seem to itself."
</P>
<P>
"And certainly no party should assume that outsiders will come
to rescue it from the consequences of its own folly and
intransigence," he said.
</P>
<P>
"One side may think itself entitled to the world's sympathy
because it represents an ethnic minority -- the same ethnic group
which has been the victim of genocide in Rwanda," he said. "The
other may equally plausibly see itself as the victim, right now,
of oppressive minority rule."
</P>
<P>
"But neither can escape its share of responsibility for the
escalating violence, or for the lack of progress towards a
political solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the verge of another humanitarian catastrophe, for
which the world will undoubtedly hold the government of Burundi
responsible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan also reported what he described as "the appalling
humanitarian consequences of the present political stalemate."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Burundians have died over the past 10
years, and the number of Burundian refugees has now reached 500,
000, and "is growing by the day," he said.
</P>
<P>
"More than 800,000 people -- 12 percent of the country's
population -- are internally displaced, many of them as a result
of a deliberate government policy of forcibly relocating civilians,
in circumstances where it cannot be justified under international
humanitarian law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since September alone, more than 300,000 innocent men, women
and children in the region surrounding the Burundian capital of
Bujumbura have been herded into camps, where they are deprived not
only of their freedom but of the most elementary means of
subsistence, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The humanitarian impact of this policy has been disastrous,"
he said. As the World Food Program reported this week, thousands
are now in special feeding programs, and more are entering every
day.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between Burundi's Hutu rebels and Tutsi-dominated army
has killed more than 200,000 people since 1993.

ATHENS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A bomb Wednesday exploded
outside a supermarket in Souda, the southern Greek island of Crete,

The blast completely destroyed the car and blew out the windows

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Generates Biggest Hiring Binge in Ottawa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The high-tech sector will
generate the biggest hiring binge in Ottawa-Hull, with new jobs to
total 16,000 in 2000, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The "sizzling double-digit growth" for the fourth consecutive
year in 2000 for the country's high-tech industry will benefit
most the capital city by a 2.9 percent increase in job creation
from 1999, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In the past six months alone, employment in the technology
sector increased by 8,000 people to 63,000, the largest ever
recorded by the Ottawa Economic Development Corp. (OEDC), the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
If that growth continued, technology could approach or even
overtake the federal government as the largest employer in the
region this year, the OEDC was quoted as forecasting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Conference Board of Canada, the country's
another economic monitor, rates the capital city second to
Edmonton in this year's economic race.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa-Hull will see a 3.9 percent increase in real gross
domestic product, compared with Edmonton's 4.1 percent, the
Conference Board said in its latest forecast.
</P>
<P>
Toronto ranks third with 3.5 percent GDP growth this year, but
it will lead the country over five years, the board said.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Gov't to Introduce Tighter Regulations for GM Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government will
introduce tighter regulations for producers of genetically-
modified organisms, but might not impose a complete ban on the
planting of GM crops, according to Swiss Radio International
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its draft proposal aiming to protect bio-diversity and the
dignity of living creatures, the seven-member Swiss cabinet
indicated that a complete ban on GM crops was unlikely. Instead it
chose to extend controls on the planting of such crops.
</P>
<P>
Crucially, the draft proposal calls for the legal liability
associated with GM crops to be extended from 10 to 30 years. This
means producers and farmers could be sued for up to three decades
after planting the crops, if it could be proved that they had a
negative effect on human health, bio-diversity or the environment.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also proposed that the criteria for planting GM
crops be tightened to further protect consumers and the
environment.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges More Active EU Involvement in Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday called on the
European Union (EU) to become more actively involved in efforts to
help resolve the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Greece's Alternate Foreign Minister
Christos Rokofyllos following his meeting here with Leonardo
Matias, the EU Portuguese presidency's special representative for
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
While asking Matias to relay to the EU presidency the need for
the EU's more active participation, Rokofyllos stressed the need
for all activity by international factors to be conducted within
the framework for the finding of a solution outlined by the United
Nations Security Council resolutions, which set out clearly the
need for the consolidation of a bizonal, bicommunal federation
with one sovereignty, guaranteed territorial integrity and
independence.
</P>
<P>
Greece also promised Wednesday that there would not be any
change in its policies on a resolution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said at a press
briefing that Athens' policy towards the Cyprus issue remained the
same.
</P>
<P>
"We have to use the framework of the decisions of the United
Nations, the summit agreements which have been made earlier, in
the attempt to ensure a resolution, and it is in this direction
that the Cypriot and Greek governments are moving," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece, a firm supporter of Cyprus, has signed with Nicosia a
joint defense pact and backs Nicosia's EU accession.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged To Set Up HIV/AIDS Public Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Ten social and civic groups in
Zimbabwe Wednesday called for the setting up of a public fund to
mobilize resources for the response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
"The AIDS pandemic is a national disaster that demands a
response from all quarters of society," the groups said in a joint
statement.
</P>
<P>
They said such a fund should be derived from a multitude of
sources including direct government budget allocations from a
share of proceeds of the sale of publicly listed companies, money
market and foreign exchange transactions.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the funds would not be misappropriated, the
groups suggested that there should be an agreed legally-defined
mechanism for the receipting, management and accounting of the
fund.
</P>
<P>
The fund should be semi-autonomous, under a fund management
board separate from the AIDS Council but enjoying policy and
program priorities from the council, they said.
</P>
<P>
There should be, they said, an agreed plan of priority areas
for its use and a mechanism for identifying beneficiaries and
ensuring that it can efficiently reach poor communities and their
support groups and organizations.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is second to Botswana on the world list of countries
worst affected by AIDS. About 1.4 millions or 25.8 percent of the
sexually active adults aged between 15 and 49 in the country are
thought to be infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Spend 500 Million Dollars on Hydropower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Angola will mobilize some 500
million U.S. dollars for a program on recovering the productive
capacity of the National Energy Enterprise (ENE) by rehabilitating
most of the hydropower stations.
</P>
<P>
Technicians and workers have started repairing generator groups
in some key hydropower stations in the regions with access, said
Eduardo Nelumba, a high-ranking official of the ENE, here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In three months, the generator groups in most key hydropower
centers around the country will be rehabilitated and all the
systems currently under repairs will begin functioning to produce
enough electric power for the Angolan population and some
neighboring countries, Nelumba said.
</P>
<P>
Angola is one of the largest power-producing countries in the
south African region, with an annual hydro capacity of 17 million
kilowatts. The country has three power-generating nets, supplying
power for the north, central and south regions respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, according to local analysts, only 15 percent of the 11
million Angolan population have access to electric power.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan made by the Angolan government, the
rehabilitation program should have gone into operation in 1997 and
be completed five years later.
</P>
<P>
But at the moment, only the North Hydro System is working
regularly, while the production of the Central System and the
South System has decreased by 30 percent and 70 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attributed this situation to the rampant civil
conflicts, which have destroyed most of the civil facilities for
traffic, communication and power generation in the country.

BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Shangdong Flaming Bulls smiled
again as they stormed past Beijing Ducks 99-83 while Hubei Mei'
erya tastes its first win in 18 games by edging Nanjing Army 85-84
in the 18th round of the Chinese Basketball League on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shangdong, who lost to Beijing Ducks in a road game earlier on
December, assured its victory by an outstanding performance in the
second quarter with 30-14 though they suffered a shaky start 18-
21 in the opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
19-year-old star Jiao Jian led the Beijing Ducks with a game
high 30 points and Ducks center Bateer added 23. But the Ducks
trailed most of the game due to lack of effective team attacks
after the sounding first quarter.
</P>
<P>
"It is a tough game. We beat the Ducks because we are fully
prepared, especially blocked out their center Bateer," said Ye
Peng, head coach of Shangdong.
</P>
<P>
The 2.02-meter tall power forward Gong Xiaobin drilled in 27
points and grabbed 11 rebounds for Shangdong.
</P>
<P>
Hubei won a game between the last two teams on the bottom of
the league rankings, and claimed their first victory of this
season.
</P>
<P>
Mei'erya tied the Nanjing Army 47-47 at the interval and went
on to power their rivals with a fierce fourth quarter run of 21-9.
</P>
<P>
"Both teams are struggling in the bottom of the league, so we
had to win the game and fortunately we are lucky to get it." said
Yuan Zhanhong, the head coach of the Hubei side.

<HEADLINE> India To Set Up Aviation Security Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government had
decided to set up an aviation security force and deploy commandos
on flights operating on 37 sensitive domestic and international
routes, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Chaman Lai Gupta said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government is also considering deployment at every airport
of rapid action force, which has already been deployed at some of
the major airports in the country, Gupta told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed a week-long hijacking drama towards the
end of last year, during which a passenger was killed on board an
Indian flight that was hijacked on its way from Kathmandu to New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Gupta said that two to six commandos of the National Security
Guard (NSG) had been deployed on the identified sensitive routes
depending on the size of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Training crew members in security operation is also under
consideration for better coordination with the commandos,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Security Force would need 20,000 to 25,000
personnel with a financial allocation of five billion rupees (
approximately 116 million U.S. dollars), Gupta said, adding that
to start with it would draw upon paramilitary forces and make its
own recruitment at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
A three-tier security check had been introduced at airports for
checking passengers while entering the airport, before entrance
into security zone and finally before boarding a flight, he added.
</P>
<P>
The aviation ministry is also considering canceling at least 50
percent of passes for VIPs for driving up to the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements are being made to ensure that the door of cockpit
could not be opened from outside in the course of a flight to bar
access to hijackers, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> India Seeks ICAO Help On Extradition of Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- India is seeking assistance
from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on the
issue of the apprehension and extradition of the hijackers
involved in last month's hijacking of the Indian Airlines aircraft,
a foreign office spokesman said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
India has urged the ICAO to ask Pakistan to honor its
international obligations and apprehend and extradite the
hijackers and their accomplices, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi insisted it has strong ground to believe that the
hijackers were all Pakistani nationals and that they were in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign office spokesman, a note verbale
addressed to Assad Kotaite, president of the ICAO Council, was
already handed over in Montreal by India's representative A P
Singh.
</P>
<P>
It was conveyed to the ICAO that India has asked Pakistan to
make all efforts to locate the offenders and extradite or
prosecute them as mandated under a series of international
conventions concerning civil aviation security, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
India contended that it has jurisdiction over the offenses
committed by the hijackers and their accomplices on board an
aircraft registered in India.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman went on to say that Pakistan is required under
the international conventions to inform the ICAO of the steps it
has taken for the apprehension and extradition of the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
"We have requested that this issue may be followed up by the
ICAO with Pakistan with a view to apprehending the hijackers and
their accomplices and extraditing them to India," the spokesman
added.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Kazakhstan to Expand Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov and Kazakhstan Prime Minister
Kasymzhomart Tokayev signed here Wednesday a series of agreements
to expand bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov, who led a Russian government delegation to talk with
Kazakhstan delegation, told a joint press conference after the
talks that the two states reached an accord to settle the energy
debt problem. Kazakhstan's 239 million U.S. dollar debts for
Russian electricity service will be repaid by passing a stake in
the Kazakhstan Energy Company to the Russian UES (Unified Energy
System) energy utility, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev, head of the Kazakh delegation, said that a 50-to-50-
percent open joint- stock company will be established with the UES
on the basis of the GRES-2 electric power plant. "All the debts
for electricity have been settled," Tokayev said.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov said that Russia "reaffirmed its adherence to the
agreements" on the Baikonur cosmodrome. The sides agreed that in
2000 Russia will supply civil aviation equipment to Kazakhstan in
part-payment for its debts on the Baikonur rent.
</P>
<P>
The sides stated that the Caspian pipeline project is being
successfully implemented and they will make every effort to
complete it in the summer of 2001, as planned.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov said that during the talks "the sides discussed in
detail the entire spectrum of issues pertaining to economic
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The officials said that "economic integration between the two
countries is on the rise despite a certain decrease in trade."
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, the sides signed a protocol on economic
cooperation and a protocol on increasing the transit of Kazakh oil
to countries outside the Commonwealth of Independent States
through Russia.
</P>
<P>
Tokayev arrived in Moscow for a working visit Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Drug Suspects Arrested in Vancouver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 suspected drug
dealers have been arrested in Canada's west coast city Vancouver,
the country's Globe and Mail newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police swooped down on a total of 157 suspects Tuesday after a
month-long undercover investigation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, of whom 63 are refugee claimants from Central
America, are facing 236 drug-related charges ranging from
possession to trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Police caught some of the suspects peddling crack cocaine at
SkyTrain stations in Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster and Surry.
</P>
<P>
The sweep was in response to community alarm that the stations
of Vancouver's elevated commuter railway had become drug dens of
choice for dealers.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver police chief Terry Blythe described the local drug
problem as "horrific," vowing to keep the pressure on suspected
dealers.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Brings Burundi's Civil War to Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mandela, the new mediator for Burundi, came to the U.N.
headquarters in New York, from the Tanzanian city of Arusha, where
he sharply criticized the country's 18 political parties and rebel
leaders for allowing the slaughter of 6 million people in the tiny
African nation.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is invited to speak at the Security Council, which is
expected to adopt a resolution condemning a recent surge of
violence in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's civil war has been raging for six years, but it has
not received the international attention of other conflicts,
particularly those from the donor community. The conflicts in
Burundi and other African countries have been long neglected by
the Western countries compared with the war victims in Kosovo, the
Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was appointed by African leaders in December last year
to mediate Burundi's stalled peace talks and use his diplomatic
skills, widely respected on the African continent and in other
parts of the world, to try to put an end to the conflict in the
small central African country.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been attaching great
importance to peace and development in Africa, is also expected to
deliver a speech at the 15-nation Security Council, which has been
largely concentrating on African issues in recent years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Rise Sharply in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report said that builders, helped by nice weather, began
work on new units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.71
million units last month. It was the largest monthly increase in
housing starts since a 7.7 percent gain in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
December's performance surprised many analysts, who were
expecting a modest rise of 0.6 percent because of rising mortgage
rates.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1999, builders started construction on 1.66 million
new units, up 3 percent from 1998. That followed a 10 percent
annual advance the year before and was also the highest level
since 1.80 million units were started in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Last year, rising mortgage rates cut into demand but housing
activity still remained brisk. Plentiful jobs, rising incomes, low
inflation and a strong stock market fueled the buying mood.
</P>
<P>
But many economists predict slower growth this year as mortgage
rates are expected to continue their upward climb. Builders also
continued to report shortages of skilled workers and available
lots for development, factors that can delay or disrupt
construction schedules.
</P>
<P>
In December, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate
mortgage was 7.9 percent, up from 6.7 percent in December 1998.
Last week, mortgage rates climbed to 8.18 percent, the highest
level since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last month, all parts of the country posted gains in housing
starts except for the West, where housing starts fell.
</P>
<P>
Starts of single-family homes surged 7.9 percent in December to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.4 million units. Starts of
apartments and condos rose 3.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted
rate of 310,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, building permits applications, a barometer of future
construction, dropped a slight 0.1 percent in December to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.61 million.

<HEADLINE> New Time Table Drawn Up For Congo Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of countries
involved in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) conflict
and rebel representatives has drawn up a new calendar for the
peace process, Zimbabwe News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs Minister Stan Mudenge told a press
conference after a two-day meeting here in Harare that under the
new calendar, the United Nations Security Council is expected to
deploy observers, monitors and peacekeeping troops in the
war-torn country within three months.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign troops in the DRC should withdraw in six
months.
</P>
<P>
"We revised the calendar and we hope next week a resolution
will be passed by the Security Council authorizing the deployment
of monitors to the DRC," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mudenge, a report by U.N. Secretary-General on the
mission to the DRC recommends that the Security Council authorize
the deployment, making it almost certain that the recommendation
would be carried through.
</P>
<P>
Belligerents in the DRC conflict have been meeting at the U.N.
headquarters in New York since Monday to press for the speedy
deployment of troops who would supervise and monitor the peace
process as stipulated in the Lusaka cease-fire agreement signed in
July and August last year.
</P>
<P>
Civil war broke out in the DRC in August 1998 when rebels
backed by Uganda and Rwanda sought to topple the government of
DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent their troops to help defend
Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Gets 60 Percent of Orders Worldwide in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The European aeronautics group
Airbus Industrie SA got 60 percent of the orders for planes
worldwide in 1999, said Airbus Chief Administrator Noel Forgeard
in an interview with local daily Le Monde published on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account the firm intentions (from buyers), Airbus
has obtained 60 percent of the orders in 1999," he said.
</P>
<P>
The total number of the orders received by Airbus amounted to 1,
444 planes at the end of 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The year 1999 is no doubt the best year of Airbus in terms of
performance in comparison with Boeing. We have at least a share of
the market of 55 percent in volume and 52 percent in value," said
Forgeard in a lowest estimation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Boeing lost 20 percent of the orders from their
clients during the year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Officials Urged to Study Finance, Taxation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper,
People's Daily, will carry an editorial Thursday, urging officials
to become more knowledgeable about finance and taxation so that
they can contribute more to economic development and social
progress.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, echoing President Jiang Zemin's speech at a
national seminar on finance and taxation Wednesday, which was
attended by leading officials at provincial and ministerial levels,
stresses that a good command of economics, particularly finance
and taxation, will help officials better perform their duties,
which, in due course, will contribute to sound and sustained
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses the pivotal role of finance and taxation
in the growth of the national economy and social development,
citing President Jiang as saying that "Financial policy is an
important means in macro-economic control and solid financial
strength is the foundation of a nation's power, stability and
safety."
</P>
<P>
"Taxation is not only the major source of state revenue, but
also an important economic lever for the nation to realize macro-
economic control," it adds.
</P>
<P>
"All Party officials, especially those in leading positions,
should be fully aware of the importance of the finance and
taxation work, and should learn hard how to better manage money-
related matters for the people," the editorial notes.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government has adopted a series of positive and
successful financial policies while achieving breakthroughs in
reforms of China's financial systems over the past years, which
effectively protected the country from getting mired in the Asian
financial crisis in 1998 and 1999. Last year, the nation's total
tax revenue hit an all-time high of 1 trillion yuan (about 120
billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Chinese Officials Urged to Study Finance, Taxation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, the editorial acknowledges that there still exist some
outstanding issues hampering the smooth development of the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
"Both the proportions of revenue in the country's GDP (gross
domestic product) and the Central Government revenue in the
national coffer are relatively low, and the structure of fiscal
expenditure needs to be further rationalized," it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial blames some wrongdoing in concerned departments,
such as rampant fee-charging, saying that they not only "seriously
affect the macro-control function of the revenue system" but also
"are a hotbed of corruption."
</P>
<P>
"A complete and unified monetary and taxation system should be
established in the course of continued reforms," it notes.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that consistent study of economics, politics,
science and technology, laws and regulations, history and
literature is a prerequisite for improving the quality of
officials at all levels.
</P>
<P>
In an era of knowledge-based economy, globalization and multi-
polarization, the pace of scientific and technological advancement
and that of knowledge renovation are accelerating.Competition
hinges more on a growing contingent of qualified personnel, the
editorial says.
</P>
<P>
To do a good job in their posts, the editorial points out that
Chinese officials should keep themselves abreast with the latest
fruits of scientific and technological advancement, be more
knowledgeable about economics, and improve their ability of macro-
control.
</P>
<P>
The editorial concludes by calling on officials across the
country to study harder in order to scale new heights in the
course of China's socialist modernization.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Kill Leader of Islamic Militant Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police killed the leader
of an Islamic radical group and captured two others in a shootout
in the country's largest city of Istanbul, Turkish Daily News
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish outlawed Hezbollah, or Party of God, was suspected
of abducting 40 businessmen across the country in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The paper said two days ago, the Turkish police attacked a villa
that was reported to house Hezbollah members, in Kavacik district
of the city.
</P>
<P>
After forcing into the building in fire-exchanging, the police
found one was killed and arrested the two others. Besides, they
also discovered a sackful of documents containing information about
names, addresses and habits of the abducted businessmen,
ammunition, explosives, cell phones, computers and documents of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
It was determined later that the militant killed was Huseyin
Velioglu, leader of the outlawed group.
</P>
<P>
The two captives are Cemal Aydin, head of the organization's
military wing and Edip Gumus, head of the organization's Istanbul
branch.
</P>
<P>
The operation was carried out after the police eavesdropped the
phone calls of Huseyin Velioglu.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Hezbollah is thought to have no connection with the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, which was leading a guerrilla
war against Israeli occupation troops in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Hezbollah began its operation in late 1980s and it
used to target mainly the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, which
was seeking to establish a Kurdish state in southeast Turkey, and
other sympathizers of Kurds.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Retail Sales Up 3.4 Percent in November 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's retail sales in
November 1999 rose by 3.4 percent over the previous month,
according to data released by the Singapore Department of
Statistics (SDS) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Total retail sales value in November 1999 was estimated at 2,
145 million Singapore dollars (1,284.43 million U.S. dollars),
compared with 2,074 million Singapore dollars (1241.92 million U.S.
dollars) in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
Compared with October 1999, almost all retail activities
registered higher turnover in November 1999, largely on the back
of the 5.1 percent gain of textiles and personal effects, and the
3.9 percent gain of furniture and household equipment.
</P>
<P>
Provision and sundry shops, however, encountered lower sales of
2.7 percent in November 1999.

<P>
As to the catering trade, the sector's overall index at current
prices in November 1999 rose by 1.3 percent over October 1999.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly due to a higher taking of 4.7 percent
at fast food outlets as well as a 0.9 percent growth at other
eating places, but restaurant business remained unchanged from the
previous month.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Continues Peace Talks With MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Peace negotiators between the
Philippine government and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
went on with their formal peace talks Wednesday in the southern
island of Mindanao, Philippine News Agency (PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
For the last two days, the technical committees of the two
sides have been meeting at Dawah Center in Sultan Kudarat,
Maguindanao province to pave the way for the following days of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At the same conference center, Defense Undersecretary Orlando
Soriano spearheaded the government panel in Wednesday's
negotiations while Aleem Abdulaziz Mimbantas led the MILF side.
</P>
<P>
According to the PNA, agenda of the meeting would center on
three issues, namely the immunity guarantee from arrests of the
panel members; application of international humanitarian laws; and
the solving of the ethnic Bangsamoro problem.
</P>
<P>
The formal peace talks should have been resumed late last year
after the two panels formally opened the negotiation last October
25. But the resumption was delayed by occasional fighting of their
respective combatants in the field.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said MILF chief Hashim Salamat also reiterated on
Wednesday his group's commitment and sincerity to the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The commitment of the MILF stays. We are determined to solve
the(Mindanao) problem at the negotiating table," Salamat was
quoted as saying in a radio interview Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing new in the MILF. We are sincere in finding a
peaceful solution to the problem here in Mindanao," he added.

<HEADLINE> UK Factory Output Surges To Four-year High in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 19 (Xinhua) - UK factory output surged to a
four-year high late last year, according to the latest figures
released by the Office for National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output in November rose by 0.6 percent to give an
annual rate of 2.2 percent growth, the strongest since June 1995.
</P>
<P>
November's surge produced a 1.1 percent increase in
manufacturing output over the past three months, illustrating a
dramatic turnaround in the sector's fortunes from early last year,
when it was in recession.
</P>
<P>
Leading the way between September and November was the
chemicals sector, where output rose 4.3 percent compared to the
previous three months.
</P>
<P>
In joint second place, recording an output growth of 2.5
percent, were electrical and optical equipment and transport
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Production volume of mobile telephones increased by 11 percent
in the quarter and output of TV receivers -including digital set-
top boxes - by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the hi-tech products, sectors suffering
declines in output included textiles and leather and machinery and
equipment. Among them, underwear production was down almost 4
percent in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the surprising strength of the data reinforced
expectations of further interest rate rises in the wake of last
week's 0.25 percent increase to 5.75 percent.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Chief Backs Russia's Euro 2008 Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 19 (Xinhua) -- UEFA President Lennart Johansson
gave his support to Russia's bid to host the European Championship
in the year of 2008.
</P>
<P>
"This is a huge country and they have an impact on all the
other countries in the former Soviet Union," the Swede told local
media at the opening of a soccer exhibition.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt Russia can host such an event. And it must
also go to Eastern Europe."
</P>
<P>
If Russia will be the first country in Eastern Europe to host
the European championship  if they get the right to host the
championship eight years late.
</P>
<P>
Johansson said he was particularly impressed with the
reconstructed 84,000-seat Luzhniki Olympic Stadium, which hosted
the UEFA Cup final in May.
</P>
<P>
"When the Russians say they are prepared, I see no reason why
we should not seriously consider their bid." the UEFA chief added.
</P>
<P>
Johansson also predicted that Russia's recent poor record in
the international arena would be temporary.
</P>
<P>
"This country has a tremendous history in football and if they
didn't qualify this time, don't worry, they will be in the World
Cup next time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia failed to qualify for World Cup finals in 1998 and Euro
2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China today launched its spring
college entrance exam as part of the Ministry of Education's
attempt to increase college enrollment.
</P>
<P>
This three-day event marks the start of a new era in the
country's national college entrance testing, which traditionally
has been held only once annually in July.
</P>
<P>
"I failed last year's college entrance test, but now I have a
chance to try again only a few months later," said Shi Dawei, a
Beijing middle school student who just completed the first day of
the testing.
</P>

try again.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, the country will hold a spring college
enrollment exam. But in this first year, only students in
municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai and Anhui Province will be
permitted to take part.

<HEADLINE> China Holds Corporate Governance Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Establishing a system of
corporate governance is at the heart of the reform of China's
state-owned enterprises (SOEs), an economist from the Development
Research Center (DRC) of the State Council said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinglian made the remark during the Senior Experts Meeting
on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises in China which
closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that the establishment of a corporate governance
system for Chinese SOEs requires resolution of two major issues.
</P>
<P>
The first is to set up a complete ownership system which would
resolve the problems previously faced when the control of
enterprise management is divided among various government
departments.
</P>
<P>
The second is to develop a supervision and incentive system for
SOE management which would wipe out the phenomenon of internal
control.
</P>
<P>
Charles Pigott, principal administrator of the Non-Member
Economies Division of the Economics Department of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), said that China
has taken many powerful measures to reform the SOEs, including
both short-term and long-term policies. He noted that China is
looking for answers to some problems that go hand-in-hand with the
process of restructuring the economy according to the practical
conditions of the country.
</P>
<P>
Lu Weichuan, president and general manager of one of the top
500 enterprises in China, the North China Pharmacy Group (NCPC),
said that the state-owned company has shifted to a system of
multiple ownership through privatization and absorbing foreign
investment. It has set up a corporate governance system in line
with international practice in order to guarantee effective
control by and maximum returns for investors.
</P>
<P>
Corporate governance has attracted great attention around the
world since the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 personages from the DRC, the OECD, the ADB (Asian
Development Bank) and nearly 20 countries in the world attended
the two-day meeting, which was co-sponsored by the DRC, the OECD
and the ADB.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Report on Possible Ties With Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Wednesday denied a newspaper report
that Iran may resume diplomatic relations with Afghanistan which is
under the rule of the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said the issue of the establishment of relations with the
Taliban group is not included in the agenda of the Iranian Foreign
Ministry, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The conservative daily Tehran Times reported on Wednesday that
Iran has its terms and conditions for resumption of ties with
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"First, there should be a broad-based government in Kabul with
the participation of all ethnic and religious communities," an
official from the Iranian Foreign Ministry told the daily, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Cross-border trade between the two countries was resumed after
Iran reopened its borders with Afghanistan last November following
the United Nations sanctions on the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"We opened border with Afghanistan on humanitarian grounds and
we are ready to do more for the oppressed people of our neighbors,"
the official said, also calling for punishment of those responsible
for killing Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Taliban militiamen stormed the Iranian consulate general in
Mazari Sharif, a stronghold of anti-Taliban United Front, killing
eight Iranian diplomats and one IRNA reporter inside the building
when the Taliban took over the city in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly demanded that the Taliban identify and
punish the killers and offer an official apology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the Taliban, which controls most of
Afghanistan but was not recognized by the international community,
has announced readiness to talk with Iran to remove any "
misunderstandings" for a rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Motawakil sent a letter
last month to his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi, voicing his
regime's willingness to establish ties with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's Information Minister Qudratullah Jamal on Tuesday once
again expressed the wish. "The Iranians can reopen their embassy in
Kabul according to diplomatic principles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran have supported the United Front, formed by the deposed
Afghan government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, after it was
driven out of the Afghan capital Kabul in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry announced recently to dispatch a
delegation to Kabul to check its embassy building and other
affairs.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Take Decisive Action Against Rioters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Following spreading unrest in
Mataram, capital of Indonesia's West Nusa Tenggara Province,
Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid on Wednesday vowed to take
decisive action against rioters and provocateurs.
</P>
<P>
"In a plenary cabinet meeting (held Wednesday morning) and even
earlier, the president insisted that incidents in Mataram and
other places should be dealt with by decisive action," Secretary
of Cabinet Marsilam Simandjutak told a press conference at Bina
Graha Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid would take tough action against anyone,
including government officials found involved in the riots,
Simandjutak added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security Gen.
Wiranto said he regretted the sectarian clashes now going on in
Mataram.
</P>
<P>
"That (sectarian conflict) violated law. It should not happen.
Nobody is allowed to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said that so far at least 50 people allegedly involved
in the riot have been questioned.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto also explained that at least two people have died in
the clashes while six others were reportedly injured.
</P>
<P>
"We'll calm down (the situation) altogether. This is our
obligation. Not only for security forces, but also elite
politicians including journalists and the media," he added.
</P>
<P>
Antara News Agency reported that at least 3,180 people have
taken refuge in safer places since the clashes took place on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The displaced people have crowded into nearby military
compounds, such as the local military airbase, naval base and
regional police headquarters while some of them were evacuated to
Bali.
</P>
<P>
The Mataram unrest occurred following a religious gathering
protesting the protracted ethnic bloodshed in Maluku Province.
</P>
<P>
After the gathering, thousands of angry people destroyed places
of worship and houses. Dozens of places of worship have been set
ablaze by angry mobs.
</P>
<P>
The mobs also vandalized houses and took out the household
furniture and goods to be torched and burned on the street.
</P>
<P>
Governor of West Nusa Tenggara Province Harun Al-Rasjid said on
Tuesday that he had never thought such an unrest would take place
in his region.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime at least six companies of troops of the
Indonesian Military have been deployed in the conflict area to
calm down the situation.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Australian and Japanese embassies
reportedly have banned their citizens to visit West Nusa Tenggara
Province.
</P>
<P>
"The office of the local government has received letters from
the two embassies banning their citizens from visiting the
province and it will cause losses to the West Nusa Tenggara
tourism sector," head of the local Tourism Arts and Culture Office,
Jodi S. Soesilo, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mataram, capital of West Nusa Tenggara Province, is one of the
tourist destinations in the eastern territory of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
It has a spectacular landscape and a beautiful beach known as
Lombok Beach.

NEW DELHI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers Wednesday linked lifting of U.S. sanctions on
India in the wake of India's nuclear blasts to the outcome of the
on-going Indo-U.S. dialogue on security-related issues.
</P>
<P>
Summers, who is in Bangalore as part of a four-day visit to the
country, said that he is confident that the two countries would
come to an understanding on security issues.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that resolving security issues forms the basis for
"normalization" of all economic relations between the United
States and India.
</P>
<P>
Asked how long India would have to wait for the U.S. to
withdraw sanctions, he said, "It will depend on how the talks
proceed."

The U.S. official said that there are certain issues between
the two countries which are beyond the question of sanctions, but
he did not elaborate.
</P>

Summers, who arrived in Bombay Monday and met with Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and other Indian leaders in New
Delhi Tuesday, is scheduled to leave for Indonesia Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Wants India To Speed Up Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Wednesday asked India to speed up the process of
economic reforms to fully exploit the benefits of globalization
and realize the vast untapped economic potential of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on "Globalization in the New Millenium"
here, the visiting Singapore leader said the pace of India's
economic liberalization should accelerate over the next few years
out of necessity.
</P>
<P>
"When India liberalizes its economy and plug itself into the
global network, it will fulfill its vast economic potential," said
Goh, who arrived here on Monday for a six-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The success of India's computer software industry was testimony
to what the country could achieve via an outward-oriented and
competitive industrial sector, Goh said at the seminar, organized
by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).
</P>
<P>
The Singapore prime minister told the media here Tuesday that
his country is keen on broadening its relations with India and he
wanted New Delhi to look forward to South East Asia including
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He said today that "economies, which continue to keep their
borders closed to foreign goods and services, will loose out and
gradually find themselves marginalized."
</P>
<P>
Globalization is a powerful vehicle for economic growth though
it is considered by many as a process that threatens economic and
social stability, challenges national sovereignty and erodes local
culture and tradition, Goh said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Singapore leader said, "the forces of
globalization have resulted in an unprecedented expansion of
economic activity and wealth, and powered by relentless
technological advances, they will continue to drive the expansion
in world trade and international capital flows."
</P>
<P>
Goh expressed his dissatisfaction Tuesday over the slowdowned
relations between Singapore and India in recent years due to
economic crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that relations between the two countries were very good,
but "unfortunately because of the recent economic crisis in Asia,
our contacts were slowed down and I am, therefore, here to
strengthen our ties."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Goh met Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
and his cabinet ministers during which India invited investments
from Singapore into its infrastructure and called for
institutionalizing arrangements between the two countries to
facilitate trade and investment exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said after the meeting
that they discussed issues of bilateral cooperation and
multilateral cooperation including trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Goh, who is leading a high-powered delegation, is scheduled to
open on Friday a 650-million-U.S.-dollar international technology
park, a joint venture between India's TATA Industries, a Singapore
consortium and the government of the Karnataka State located in
Bangalore, 1,050 kilometers south of here.
</P>
<P>
During his last visit in 1994, Goh laid the foundation stone
for the park.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada on Wednesday challenged the Catholic Church to promote
responsible parenthood by employing the method of contraception.
</P>
<P>
The president raised the challenge in a radio speech as he
expressed alarm over the rise in population growth that has now
reached 1.7 million a year.
</P>
<P>
The previous administration was also reportedly at odds with
the Catholic Church over the effort in promoting artificial
contraception,including the use of condoms, contraceptive pills
and the injectible drug to prevent pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Estrada said, the Church leaders should encourage
couples to have only the number of children that they could afford
to raise.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has been having difficulty providing the
basic services to its people, considering the increase in the
population.
</P>
<P>
The 1.7 million growth in population each year, he explained,
requires that the government employs more teachers, provides more
housing units, increase the number of hospitals and provide more
means to increase the country's revenues.

Federation and started at midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
Surface Transport Minister Rajnath Singh Tuesday appealed to
the strikers to resume work while keeping doors open for talks,
the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The 11 strike-hit ports, namely Kandla, Mumbai, Jawaharlal
Nehru, Goa, New Mangalore, Cochin, Tuticorin, Madras,
Visakhapatnam, Paradip and Calcutta, together handle around 250
million tons of cargo each year.
</P>
<P>
However, according to official sources, the talks between the
government and the five key port workers' federations spearheading
the current strike have so far not resumed since it broke down on
January 17.
</P>
<P>
The talks ended in a stalemate after the two sides failed to
reach consensus on issues like the periodicity of wage revision
and when the government allowances for the port workers would come
into effect.
</P>
<P>
Asked by the PTI whether the government would attempt to get
the port strike declared "illegal," Surface Transport Secretary R.
Vasudevan said that the government would not like to adopt a "
confrontationist" attitude towards the workers for the present.
</P>
<P>
Vasudevan revealed that conciliation proceedings had been
started under the Regional Labor Commissioner in Mumbai.
</P>
<P>
At the Visakhapatnam Port, private workers were deployed to
load two vessels with coal, but the operational efficiency was
only 60 percent as much as that before the strike, the PTI
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Angry workers at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust of Mumbai have
tried to intimidate those entering the port, while cargo shipment
agents in Mumbai have been told to arrange for movement of
containers by themselves and have been assured police protection,
the PTI added.

<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada reiterated Wednesday there will be no let-up in the
renewed offensive against smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a regular radio speech that he is giving
the elite anti-smuggling unit called Task Force Aduana his full
backing in the fight against smuggling.
</P>
<P>
"I will support Task Force Aduana head Jose Calimlim all the
way. If what he's doing is for the good of the country, he has my
full support," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president added that Task Force Aduana has instructions to
ignore claims that some groups were "forced" into smuggling
because of poverty.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no distinction between the rich and the poor
when it comes to wrongdoing. Law enforcers would catch you if you
did wrong," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government scored anew against smugglers over the weekend
as anti-smuggling operations seized some 600 motorbikes and other
items in Ilocos Sur province in western part of Luzon.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Allocates UNHCR Site to Host Burundi Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has agreed to
allocate United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
another refugee site for emergencies in its western Kagera Region
to cope with the new refugee influx from Burundi.
</P>
<P>
 Briefing reporters at Dar es Salaam International Airport
before ending her four-day official visit to Tanzania on
Wednesday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata
said the new site would be quite useful because the infrastructure
is already there.
</P>
<P>
 According to the UNHCR Senior External Relations officer for
Tanzania Vincent Kwesi Parker, the new site, which was located in
Musuhura in Ngara District, was once used to host 80,000 refugees
in 1996 and closed in the same year because the refugees returned
to their home countries.
</P>
<P>
 Tanzanian government has agreed UNHCR to use Musuhura site as
long as the Karago Camp now hosting 20,000 Burundian refugees
reaches its full capacity of 40,000, said the official.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR sources say the allocation of the new site was made
during Ogata's talks with Tanzanian Minister for Home Affairs Ali
Ameir Mohamed at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for South Africa and Zambia to continue her
ten-day, three-nation tour, Ogata said her visit to Tanzania
reaffirmed close cooperation between the UNHCR and the Tanzanian
authorities. She said the reception of refugees in the area she
visited is very well organized by the UNHCR and the Tanzanian
local authorities.
</P>
<P>
She particularly singled out the newly opened Karago camp,
saying it was well organized to receive the new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
"It's located in a forest area which has been kept very well
as a national park. I was very glad to see the refugees are being
told to keep the environment clean," said the UNHCR boss.
</P>
<P>
Over security issues in refugee camps, Ogata said their
concern was very much to make sure security in the camps be
maintained, and the camps remain a civilian camp, not be used as
any kind of militarized base.
</P>
<P>
"We have given some assistance to the Tanzanian government to
strengthen the capacity of the police. The presence of well
trained, equipped police is having a good effect. I was very
pleased to find that we will consult further to make sure the
security question in the camps will not be deteriorated," the
UNHCR chief said.

six million U.S. dollars to ease the critical shortage of
medicines in hospitals of the country, Times of Zambia reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Health Minister David Mpamba as
saying on Tuesday in the north of the country that more money will

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Federal Road Safety
Commission (FRSC) Tuesday urged the state governments to cancel
the siting of markets along major highways of the country, the
Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have problems of market places being located along the
highways such as Panbegua and Kachia. Many people were victims of
road accidents in these places," said FRSC Chief Executive Malam
Yakassai when visiting the country's northern city Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
"We are appealing to governments to move market locations along
highways because of the incident that occurred at Suleja recently
where many people lost their lives and property and we call on the
state governments to help us to achieve this cause," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to Yakassai's call, Kaduna State Governor Mohammed
Makarfi said "in spite of warnings by government in Kaduna State,
the highways have been turned to street markets but we are going
to enforce order to ensure that there is sanity."
</P>
<P>
"Due to personal reasons or factors, drivers of Kabukabu or
other commercial vehicles engage in activities that result to
avoidable accidents and lead to loss of lives," the governor
noted.
</P>
<P>
He advised FRSC officials to adopt stringent measures against
traffic offenders.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Reiterates Need of African Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has reiterated the need for African countries to pursue
continental economic integration to avoid further marginalization
in the new world economic order.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in the Nigerian capital Abuja on
Tuesday when receiving members of the Association of African
Central Banks (AACB), which was holding its 23rd extraordinary
meeting in Nigeria, the Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo urged African countries to translate into reality the
vision of the African Economic Community, saying that unless this
is done, they would continue to be marginalized in the world
economic system.
</P>
<P>
The concept of an economic community embracing the entire
continent, he said, would remain a pipe dream unless Africa's
political and economic leaders realized the imperatives of greater
integration in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said concerted efforts should be made to strengthen the
sub-regional economic groupings like the Economic Community of
West African States as a prelude to continental monetary and
economic union.
</P>
<P>
"We have to hold ourselves together at the sub-regional level
before aspiring towards African regional integration," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that most African political leaders are currently
facing very difficult choices between the immediate needs of their
long-suffering citizens and the pressure to open up their
economies to the vagaries of market forces.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo urged AACB governors to offer more help to their
political leaders by preferring credible alternatives to the harsh
realities of market forces in the short term to allow for a
smoother transition from regulated economies to deregulation.
</P>
<P>
He praised AACB for establishing a special organ to meet more
regularly to promote the cause of economic integration in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
AACB, which was set up by the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) in 1970, was designed to facilitate effective coordination
of monetary and financial policies among African countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Says ECOWAS Traveler's Check Needs Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Acceptance of the traveler's
check of the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS)
has to be gradual, said Nigeria's Central Bank Governor Joseph
Sanusi in the capital Abuja on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Along with his Tanzanian and Zambian counterparts, Sanusi said
at a briefing to mark an extraordinary meeting of the Association
of African Central Bank (AACB) Governors that it will take time
for the public to build confidence on the check.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS Traveler's check, which was launched last year, is an
important step toward economic integration in the West Africa
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
According to Sanusi, AACB has set up an executive panel headed
by him.
</P>
<P>
The revived AACB would strive to be cost-effective, he said,
adding that a new structure of its headquarters might emerge at a
meeting slated for January 29 in Nigeria, during which a report on
it would be submitted.
</P>
<P>
AACB aims to strive toward monetary integration and
co-operation in Africa and a central bank for the continent, he
said, noting that this would ensure a bigger market, improved
economy and reduced cost in North America, Mexico, Canada and the
Europe Union.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the pessimism raised over difficulty in converting
African currencies and non-acceptability of the ECOWAS traveler's
check, Sanusi said the process of convertibility lies with the
monetary authorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua)-- President Jiang Zemin stressed
here today that the country's financial revenue should be
rationally used to first solve difficulties encountered by the
common people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and chairman of the Central
Military Commission (CMC), made the remark at the closing ceremony
of a week-long seminar on finance and revenue, which ended here
today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said at the ceremony of the seminar attended by leading
officials of the provinces and ministries that doing a good job of
caring for the life of the people "warm-heartedly and sincerely"
is of top significance in the work of the Party and government at
present and leading officials at all levels must in no way "
neglect" it.
</P>
<P>
People are satisfied with the marked improvement of their life
since the beginning of the reform and opening-up, Jiang noted.
However, he pointed out that still some people have difficulties
in their life due to the uneven development of economy, the
deepening reform, the restructuring of the economy and some deep
rooted problems left over from the history, among other factors.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has always put great emphasis on improving the living
conditions of the common people, the president said, calling on
relevant departments to jointly find ways to solve the financial
and employment difficulties of the people.
</P>
<P>
The president urged all leading officials to be thrifty and
hard work, and combating waste and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials at all levels should share the happiness and
woes of the common people, and sincerely help them solve basic
problems arising in their everyday lives, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chinese senior leaders Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Wei

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Officials to Fully Understand WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said here
today that leading officials at all levels should fully understand
the importance and the impact of China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark to more than 100 high-ranking central
government officials and provincial leaders attending a week-long
seminar on finance and revenue which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
China's efforts to enter the WTO, which has lasted for 13 years,
means the country wants to participate more fully in international
competition, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Today's world is an open world," Jiang said. "It has been
proved in China and other countries that any attempt to develop a
national economy will fail without opening to the rest of the
world."
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that China must continue to open its markets
wider to the rest of the world, and fully utilize overseas capital,
technology, resources, and advanced management skills to further
develop its economy and society.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the officials that it is necessary for China to
fully enter into international competition to become stronger, as
economic globalization is accelerating and the world's technology
changing day by day.
</P>
<P>
"Our country's economy has been greatly improved and we are
quite experienced after 20 years of economic reform and opening to
the outside world," Jiang said. "China is fully capable of
participating in global competition."
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked the officials to fully understand what it means
for China to gain WTO entry, saying they should seize the
opportunity, work hard, and boost their confidence for the
upcoming international competition.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the president asked the officials to study , and
become familiar with international regulations regarding trade
and economic cooperation, and use these regulations to serve the
country's modernization drive.

<TEXT>
<P>
Describing the African continent as a vast land with abundant
resources and enormous development potential, Li said that it is
regrettable that unequal and unreasonable political and economic
order in the international arena hinders the economic development
of the African countries, and affects social stability there.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China believes that the international community
should work for establishing a new order and advancing
multipolarity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li also pointed to the strengthening of Sino-African relations
in recent years, and said the Chinese people have deep, friendly
feelings for the African people. He added that promoting unity and
cooperation with African countries and other developing countries
is the basis of China's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese NPC is fully prepared to promote its
relations with the Congolese National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Koumba said that the two countries have a long-standing
friendly relationship, and China is one of the countries to
restore its embassy in the Congo after a chaotic period in the
country ended, adding that his country highly praised China's
achievements in economic development and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Congo supports the peaceful reunification of
China, and will continue to follow the one-China policy.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong, HK Officials Discuss Food Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Quarantine officials from
south China's Guangdong Province and the neighboring Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region today agreed to jointly intensify
the monitoring of food sent to HK from inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the newly reshuffled Guangdong Bureau for Entry-
Exit Inspection and Quarantine, and a Hong Kong department of food,
environment and health, attended a meeting that opened today in
Guangzhou to discuss further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions also focused on the quality control of
poultry, pork, seafood, genetically modified food, and prevention
of pesticide contamination in vegetables.
</P>
<P>
With a high population density and limited space for
agricultural production, Hong Kong secures its food supply by
importing products from inland areas, mainly vegetables, fruit,
and meat.
</P>
<P>
Quarantine departments in Guangdong have long played a leading
role in food safety inspection, since Guangdong is the only land
exit to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that during the meeting scheduled for three days,
Hong Kong officials will visit several food-processing plants and
vegetable production bases in Guangzhou.

</P>

Democratic Party.

party and former prime minister, will restore all his confiscated

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Expects Greater Tension Between Developed, Developing Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Goh Chok Tong,
who is in India on a six-day official visit, expects greater
tension between developed and developing economies as a result of
globalization and urged developing economies to embrace and ride
the wave of globalization.
</P>
<P>
While delivering a key-note address to the Confederation of
Indian Industry in New Delhi Wednesday, the prime minister said, "
The gap between the developed and developing economies will widen
considerably. Such a huge disparity in national wealth will only
fuel greater tensions between the developed and developing
economies."
</P>
<P>
"The world could evolve into a two-tiered system in which
developed and globalized economies are linked by trade and
technology while excluded developing economies seek refuge in
isolationist policies," the prime minister said, according to a
press release from the Singapore government.
</P>
<P>
"The arrival of the new millennium finds more of the world's
population living in good health and prosperity and secure from
territorial aggression," Goh said. "Yet more of the world's people
also live in poverty and despair."
</P>
<P>
"As some celebrated the dawn of the new millennium with much
joy and anticipation, for others, it was another grim moment in
the struggle for survival," he added.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that globalization is a powerful vehicle
for economic growth, he said, "But to many, it is also a process
that threatens economic and social stability, challenges national
sovereignty and erodes local culture and tradition."
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the size of the 'globally contestable economy'
reduces the control of nation states," he added.
</P>
<P>
Citing the failure of the recent WTO meeting in Seattle, the
prime minister said, "It is, therefore, not surprising that we
have begun to see some backlash against globalization."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the growing doubt about benefits of free
capital flow as well as globalization, the threat the developing
countries have felt to their cultural value and national identity,
a new generation of disputes which go beyond pure economies and
more trade battles that will increasingly be fought.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the consequences of the backlash, Goh said, "In
reality the outcome in Seattle hurt everybody, particularly the
developing countries which are denied enhanced market access into
developed economies."
</P>
<P>
He also said, "If member countries of the WTO do not redouble
efforts to address the failure of Seattle, the survival of the
multilateral trading system could also be threatened."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, "Resisting the forces of globalization is not a
solution, ultimately a futile exercise, and global capital and
trade will go where they are welcome and are most productive."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister warned that "economies, which continue to
keep their borders closed to foreign goods and services, will lose
out and gradually find themselves marginalized."
</P>
<P>
Goh said, "No economy is strong enough to stop the tide of
globalization, neither is there a viable alternative."
</P>
<P>
"As such, what governments must do is to embrace globalization
and strengthen domestic institutions to cope with the strains it
places upon the society," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> France Not to Publish Secrets on Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 19 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard said in a statement Wednesday that France will not publish
the secrets on the 193 nuclear tests which were conducted on the
Polynesian islands in the South Pacific from 1966 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
The statement published by the army bulletin "Actu Defense",
was in response to a request by a deputy of French Polynesia for
an opening of the archives on these tests, in order to prove they
did not leave any danger to the health of the locals.
</P>
<P>
Richard said that according to a decree made in December 1979,
all the defense secrets and documents linked with state secrets
and secrets of national defense cannot be published in 60 years.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account the sensitive character of the documents
related to nuclear tests linked with national defense, the texts
and the duration it fixes should be strictly respected," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled a "comprehensive, thorough and independent"
study on the effects of the nuclear tests on the health of the
locals, which was published by the International Atomic Energy
Agency in June 1998 .
</P>
<P>
The report said, "Clearly, there could be no effect on the
health as can be medically diagnosed, and no corrective measure is
necessary on the atolls (of Mururoa and Fangataufa) for the
purpose of radiological protection."

<HEADLINE> Nanjing Massacre Survivors Denounce Japanese Right-Wing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Survivors and relatives of
victims of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre met here today to denounce
the attempt of Japanese right-wing forces to deny historical facts
and whitewashing wartime crimes committed by Japanese aggressors.
</P>
<P>
They referred to the massacre as an irrefutable and widely-
known atrocity, and called on the authorities in Osaka to stop the
planned anti-China rally scheduled by Japan's right-wing forces
for the International Peace Center in Osaka on January 23.
</P>
<P>
"Japan's right-wing forces have been trying to negate
historical facts," said Qin Jie, 74, who survived the massacre. "
They are real liars."
</P>
<P>
Qin recalled that he saw piles of bodies of local people killed
by Japanese soldiers in a river during the massacre in December
1937.
</P>
<P>
Qin and his parents had a narrow escape, but one of his aunts
was raped and killed by Japanese soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiuying, then pregnant, was stabbed 37 times when she
resisted the ferocity of Japanese soldiers on December 19, 1937.
</P>
<P>
"The debts of blood owed by the Japanese aggressors haven't
been paid yet," said Li, 81. "Now the Japanese right-wing forces
are hurting us again by trying to deny the atrocity publicly."
</P>
<P>
Shang Deshou, whose father and eldest brother were both killed
by Japanese soldiers, said that the Japanese right-wing forces
will never succeed in whitewashing wartime crimes committed by the
Japanese aggressors.
</P>
<P>
Another of Shang's brothers bore witness at the Far East
International Military Tribunal in 1946, which tried Japanese war
criminals and pronounced them guilty.
</P>
<P>
Invading Japanese troops massacred about 300,000 innocent
Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers, and raped more than 20,000
local women in Nanjing in December 1937, according to Zhu
Chengshan, curator of the Memorial Hall to Victims of the Nanjing
Massacre.
</P>
<P>
"Nanjing people will never forget the extremely cruel massacre,
" said Zhu. "The Osaka authorities should take effective steps to
stop the planned anti-China gathering and safeguard friendship
between the Chinese and Japanese peoples."

<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua)-- President Jiang Zemin said here
today that great progress has been made toward the goal of lifting
state-owned enterprises (SOE) out of the red during the central
government's three-year campaign.
</P>
<P>
SOEs stand as the pillar of the country's national economy, and
also the economic foundation of China's socialist system, the
president said at the closing ceremony of a seminar on finance and
revenue attended by high-ranking party and government officials.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged SOEs to record new achievements in deepening
reform and increasing profit in this final year for realizing
those strategic objectives.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to adapt these enterprises to the market,
increase their competitiveness, and expand their ability to fend
off risks, he stressed, reaffirming the party and the government's
support for the reform and development of SOEs.
</P>
<P>
The president also pointed out that many irrational problems in
the country's economic structure, which increasingly affect
overall economic and social development, should be adjusted as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Decisions should be made to settle such problems as irrational
product mix, repetitive construction, and low economic profits, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The president also emphasized scientific and technological
development, especially in the creation of the country's high-tech
sector. When the economic structure becomes rational, the overall
economic level will ascend to a new stage, he added.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Urges Establishing Balanced, Powerful Financial System (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang said the basic criteria for judging financial and
taxation efforts can be determined according to whether or not
they aid the development of socialist market economy and the
consolidation of the socialist system, satisfy the fundamental
interests of the people, and are conducive to maintaining national
unity and security, and promoting ethnic unity and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
He said it is also imperative to view financial and taxation
work from a long-term perspective, adding that as China is a
populous country and not rich, government spending should focus on
bettering the lives of the people, as well as construction.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is important to do things economically, Jiang
said, noting that relevant departments should manage finances and
taxation according to the laws.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, Zhu Rongji and Li Lanqing also delivered
reports on the current economic situation and financial and
taxation work.

<HEADLINE> China to Revise Patent Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China plans to revise the
patent law for the second time to prepare for a more effective
patent system.
</P>
<P>
Ma Lianyuan, deputy commissioner of the State Intellectual
Property Office (SIPO), released several major revision proposals
today at the ongoing national patent conference.
</P>
<P>
The state hopes the patent law will be suitable for the
socialist market economy, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The law should also be in synch with international conventions
and regulations made by the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO), he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the existing law does not keep abreast with the country
's economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, China's top legislature approved the first patent law,
which was adopted the next year.
</P>
<P>
The existing law stipulates that state-owned enterprises cannot
transfer their patents without permission from upper
administration, and this is a vestige of the planned economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that between 1985 and 1997, patent
applications received by the government increased by an average
annual rate of 18.9 percent, and 1999 saw a record high of 134,240
applications.
</P>
<P>
After the first revision in 1992, China's patent law has
basically complied with international conventions.

<HEADLINE> CAS to Attract More Foreign Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) will invite more outstanding foreign scientists to work in
China, said CAS President Lu Yongxiang today.
</P>
<P>
The academy has already invited more than 30 overseas experts
from North America and Europe to become science advisors, and is
planning to expand such cooperation, Lu told an ongoing working
conference of the CAS.
</P>
<P>
He said the CAS will try to attract overseas scientists who
wish to work in China for an extended period of time, as well as
those who can only come on a short-term basis. The academy will
also invite overseas scholars as senior visiting scholars and help
them establish research groups and laboratories in China.
</P>
<P>
The CAS already has 331 young overseas scientists working at
the academy, and is striving to improve its environment and
organization to attract more outstanding overseas personnel.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Chinese government announced that it will grant
600 million yuan (72 million U.S. dollars) to the CAS to employ
300 young and middle-aged overseas scientists working in China.
This is the largest amount of money the government has ever
provided for a project aimed at attracting overseas personnel.
</P>
<P>
The employment of foreign scientists is still at the
preliminary stage, and the CAS plans to adjust its policy on such
employment according to the results achieved by the foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Storm of Criticism in Cyprus Over "Swiss Model" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The remarks about a confederal
solution to the Cyprus issue made by Agriculture Minister Costas
Themistocleous have caused a storm of protests in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Themistocleous said last weekend that a confederation and a
federation are the same thing. The Swiss model, though called a
confederation, was in essence a federation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Demetris Christofias, leader of leftist AKEL, the main
opposition, said that any "direct or indirect reference to
confederation could only harm the country."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the political leadership of Greece
and Cyprus "en masse, should repeat the message of their commitment
to what have been agreed upon - a bizonal, bicommunal federation."
</P>
<P>
The socialist EDEK leader Vassos Lyssarides called for the
resignation of Themistocleous.
</P>
<P>
EDEK demanded that Themistocleous' remarks be discussed at the
next meeting of the National Council, the presidential advisory
body on the Cyprus problem comprising political party leaders of
the island, headed by President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
The democratic DIKO party also criticised the minister. Spyros
Kyprianou, leader of the DIKO and speaker of the House of
Representatives (parliament), claimed that the governments of
Athens and Nicosia were leading Cyprus to "the completion of the
1974 treachery."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
to seize the northern third of the island following a short-lived
coup in Nicosia seeking union with Athens, engineered by the then
Greek junta.
</P>
<P>
The internationally-recognized Cyprus government, controlled by
Greek Cypriots in the south, has been pressing for a solution under
a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula but all efforts have so
far failed due to insistence of the Turkish Cypriots on the
recognition of their breakaway regime in the north, backed by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou also said on Tuesday
that agreeing to discuss the Swiss model for a solution to the
Cyprus issue does not mean the Greek Cypriot side accepts
confederation.
</P>
<P>
"We don't accept the Swiss confederation in its entirety but we
are ready to to discuss chapters," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution of the Swiss Confederation, each
Swiss canton is a sovereign canton with its own constitution and is
under supervision of national legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss central government is responsible for foreign,
defense, transportation, customs, currency, taxes and other
national issues. Other issues are under administration of the
cantons.
</P>
<P>
The national constitution stipulates rotation of presidency and
numerically equal representation of cantons in the central
government.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Cambodia
rose year-on-year by 28.35 percent in 1999, according to figures
of the Tourism Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 367,743 tourists, 262,907 visited Cambodia's two

1 percent compared with 186,333 in 1998.

United States and China were the highest. France and Taiwan, China,

</P>
<P>
While meeting visiting Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian at

<HEADLINE> Sales of Electric Household Appliances Booming in Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Sales of color TVs,
refrigerators, and washing machines were brisk in Chinese cities
last year, according to a survey released here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 13 percent of the residents in 14 major cities
purchased new color TVs, most of which were large-screen,
according to the survey conducted by the Beijing-based China
Marketing Research Company and 13 other information agencies.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted last month, said city residents purchased
640,000 refrigerators, and large freon-free refrigerators were
gaining popularity.
</P>
<P>
The cities surveyed were Beijing, Dalian, Changchun, Harbin,
Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou,
Chengdu, Xi'an, and Lanzhou.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that air conditioners, microwave ovens, VCDs,
DVDs, computers, electronic organs, and other electric household
appliances are now widely used by urban families.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, city residents purchased electric household appliances
worth 24.1 billion yuan (about 2.9 billion U.S. dollars), an on-
average spending of 4,600 yuan per family.
</P>
<P>
Respondents said they expect to buy fewer color TVs,
refrigerators, and washing machines this year. However, the need
for other electric household appliances is expected to climb.
</P>
<P>
Total spending on electric household appliances in the 14
cities, with a total population of 40 million, may top 30 billion
yuan this year, the survey predicted.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein decided Tuesday
to prepare an indictment against Knesset (parliament) member and
former Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi for his role in a non-profit
organization he established while serving as head of the Knesset
Economics Committee.
</P>
<P>
Last August, the police concluded a 16-month investigation with
a recommendation that Hanegbi be prosecuted for taking bribes,
grand larceny, breach of faith, and false registration of company
documents relating to the operation of the non-profit organization.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A series of talks at the highest level between the United
States and Syria has not been enough to break the impasse between
Israel and Syria, which has led to an indefinite postponement of
the talks to have started Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Tuesday declined to respond to a Syrian demand
that it present a written commitment to full withdrawal from the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
In another setback to the process, the members of the U.S.
Senate Appropriations Committee delegation that visited Israel last
week told senior diplomatic officials in Jerusalem that the Senate
has no intention of providing aid of any kind to Syria, either
civilian or military.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- A senior Israeli security source claimed that Palestinian
National Authority knew the Hadera terrorist attacks in advance but
failed to do anything about it. The reason, according to the
source, is its displeasure of intense negotiations between Israel
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six people were lightly injured when a bomb exploded in
the coastal city of Hadera in northwestern Israel on Monday.
</P>
<P>
-- New research by Haifa University showed that Israel Defense
Forces carried out massacre in Tantura village in 1948.
Approximately 200 Arab residents were killed in a battle for the
village.
</P>
<P>
The research is based on evidence provided by surviving
residents and soldiers who participated in the battle.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Gale-force winds, with speed of over 100 kilometers per hour,
lashed the country through Tuesday night, forcing temporary closure
of two local airports, knocking out power supplies and traffic
lights, and uprooting trees in some areas, but no serious injuries
were reported.
</P>
<P>
The storm was expected to abate later Wednesday and pick up
again before the weekend.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 Groups Formed to Combat Crime in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 community-based
groups have been formed in the Philippines since 1999, as part of
the government's continuing efforts to get the public involved in
fighting crime, a presidential report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report prepared by the Presidential Management Staff on the
one-and-half-year performance of the government said that so far,
470 student crime prevention councils and community crime
prevention councils have been organized, with 218 of them
monitored nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The government also established and maintained 4,488 community-
oriented policing system centers, whose primary aim is to foster
closer police-community relations.
</P>
<P>
These centers, supervised by police personnel and manned by
members of civilian volunteers organizations, bring law enforcers
closer to small communities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining peace and order is one of the five priority
programs of the Estrada administration alongside food security,
housing, fighting graft and corruption and electoral reforms.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of community-based anti-crime groups have
been complemented by government efforts, through the National
Prosecution Service, to ensure the speedy and efficient
prosecution of criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that the successful implementation of a
street-watch program, which helps solve neighborhood crime and
related concerns, has also enhanced the cooperation of the people
in the community.
</P>
<P>
The program has yielded 9,348 legitimate calls from the public
providing information or asking for police assistance on crimes
and problems in their community.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Mission Sees Economic Recovery in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Head of a visiting U.S.
business delegation Michael Gadbaw said on Wednesday that
Indonesia's economy would recover soon and he himself is
optimistic about this.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, minutes before meeting with
Chairman of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) Amien Rais,
Gadbaw said the key issues (of the Indonesia's recovery) is how
the government implements the policies it has adopted and how the
people of Indonesia work together.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that American businesspeople will come back to
Indonesia to invest, Gadbaw said American businesspeople are ready
to work with Indonesian counterparts in joint ventures and
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
"I think the relationship (between American and Indonesian
businesspeople) will be strengthened," said Gadbaw who is also
vice president of the General Electric company.
</P>
<P>
He said American investors may be interested in investing in
the sectors of gas, manufacturing and services.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to reveal the value of the investment American
businesspeople may make in Indonesia in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the security and political situation here, Gadbaw
expressed his optimism that the government of Indonesia will be
successful in dealing with the problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are watching that (the security situation) very
closely. We are clearly concerned about how the situation is being
handled but I am hopeful that the government will be successful in
managing the integration of all regions in Indonesia. We are
optimistic that all(problems) will be resolved," Gadbaw said.
</P>
<P>
He also said his mission will meet with donor countries in
early February, which will confirm donations from their
governments to help the Indonesian government make the budget
successful.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid is scheduled to present
the draft of the 2000 state budget on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation of 60 businesspeople started its three-day
visit here on Tuesday. The businesspeople represent 30 U.S.
corporations, most of which have a presence in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Wahid on Tuesday, Gadbaw said one
of the reasons he organized a business mission to Indonesia was to
break the ice on the issue of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Investors remain wary of making a commitment in Indonesia amid
widespread pockets of unrest, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he was optimistic that the Indonesian government
would be able to tackle the mounting problems because "we feel the
government enjoys broad support" from the people.

<HEADLINE> Africa Loses $250 Million Annually in Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The African countries are
losing over 250 million U.S. dollars annually in telecommunication
services, the state- run Kenya Times newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Zambian Communication and Transport Minister Nkandu
Luo disclosed the figure in Kenya's capital Nairobi on Monday when
 addressing the handover ceremony for the incoming and outgoing
secretaries general of the African Telecommunication Union.
</P>
<P>
Luo said that African countries have not established a unified
 communication body and a regulatory system which is capable to
harmonize tariff for the international telecommunication services.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged African states to be active in streamlining
the telecommunication services and forge a closer relationship
with the private sector to put in capital for the development of
the sector in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Jan Mutai, new secretary general of the union and former
managing director of Kenya Posts and Telecommunication
Corporation, said he would endeavor to ensure the teledensity in
Africa is to increase from the current one percent to 10 percent,
which reflects the global scenario.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks Ways to Push E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China's first forum on
electronic business (e-commerce) was held here today with over 400
participants.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the information technology (IT) industry,
renowned companies, and financial and research institutions
offered theoretical and practical suggestions on how to develop e-
commerce in China.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine companies, 58 of which are internet content
providers (ICP), announced at the forum they intend to build a new
cooperative relationship to explore China's e-commerce market.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce, an entirely new method of doing business via the
Internet, is experiencing rapid growth worldwide, with e-commerce
trade volume estimated to reach 25 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese websites have been actively engaged in e-commerce
during the past few years, seeking customers who are learning to
shop via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
China's e-commerce, however, is facing problems such as a less-
developed Internet infrastructure and a lack of regulations and
laws.
</P>
<P>
Today's forum was designed to address these issues. The forum
is scheduled to be held twice a year in order to catch up with the
development of e-commerce around the world.
</P>
<P>
The forum was held jointly by Chinese Entrepreneurs magazine,
the IBM corporation, and the Beijing Youth Daily.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Rial's Rise Hits Dubai's Re-export Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The recent rise in value of
the Iranian currency rial has hit the re-export trade of Dubai,
particularly in commodities, as local traders are finding it
difficult to import from that country due to increase in cost.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been a major supplier of commodities to Dubai, the
second largest emirate of the United Arab Emirates and a trade
center of the Middle East region famous for its re-exporting
business.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the fluctuating rial has introduced another element
of uncertainty to the trade which has not been very satisfactory in
recent periods, the Dubai-based Khaleej Times daily reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iranian rial, which used to be on a path of decline, is now
getting stronger against the U.S. dollar, particularly in the past
10 days. The appreciation of rial is attributed to a more positive
outlook for the Iranian economy following the recent increase in
oil prices, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Rial has risen from 9,100 to 8,500 against one dollar. As a
result, domestic prices for commodities have gone up and traders
cannot get the same prices in dollar terms as before.
</P>
<P>
Most of cargoes coming from Iran are destined for re-exports to
India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Canada and some European countries.
</P>
<P>
For example, price for cumin seeds, the main commodity coming
from Iran, went up to 1,600 dollars per ton, while earlier it was
at about 1,100 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
The costs of other commodities such as sultana raisins,
pistachio, chick peas, coriander seeds have also risen up due to
higher rials as well as poor crops last year.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the local market in Dubai is idle at the moment as
everybody is watching the situation carefully, traders said, adding
that there is hardly any trading with Iran.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Further Step up Anti-Drug Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government on
Wednesday ordered the anti-drug abuse councils nationwide to
spearhead a campaign against drug abuse, Philippine News Agency (
PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
Interior and Local Government Secretary Alfredo Lim was quoted
as saying he has urged local chief executives to submit reports on
the operation and activities of their councils to the department.
</P>
<P>
He said he will meet with members of the councils once he
visits the provinces and cities for inspection.
</P>
<P>
"The anti-drug abuse council is a potent force to reckon with
in our fight against illegal drugs. Hence, it must be functional
and its activities be supported by all sectors of society," Lim
said.
</P>
<P>
Records by the department showed that there are some 83 anti-
drug abuse councils organized in cities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a press report on Wednesday also hailed the gains
achieved by the National Drug Law Enforcement and Prevention
Coordinating Center in the anti-drug drive in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The national coordinating center reportedly conducted 24,600
operations which led to the arrest of 36,335 persons, together
with the seizure of 2.82 billion pesos (70 million U.S. dollars)
worth of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the report said, a total of 2,903 communities in
Metro Manila have been declared drug-free by the national anti-
drug center.
</P>
<P>
The center was established last year to consolidate drug
enforcement and prevention efforts of various units, such as the
Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force, the Philippine
National Police Narcotics Group and the National Bureau of
Investigation.

<HEADLINE> Former Pak Premier Formally Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Anti-Terrorism Court in
the southern Pakistani city of Karachi Wednesday formally charged
ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif with a number of crimes
including attempted murder, terrorism and hijacking.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from Karachi, Sharif and his brother,
Shabaz Sharif, and the five other co-accused, pleaded not guilty
after the charges were read out at the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
If convicted on some of the charges, the former prime minister
could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
However, charges of waging war against Pakistan and treason,
which had been reported to be possible charges, were dropped.
</P>
<P>
The formal charge, which had been delayed by legal wrangling,
came three months after Sharif was ousted in a coup in October
last year.
</P>
<P>
Judge of the court Rehman Hussian Jaffry adjourned the hearing
till January 26.
</P>
<P>
The military authorities have accused Sharif of attempting to
kill Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf and some 200 other
passengers when their plane was refused landing at the Karachi
airport on October 12, 1999.
</P>
<P>
On the same night, the army launched a bloodless coup and
dismissed the Sharif government.

They also agreed to give further financial support to joint
ventures specializing in building materials, household utensils
and other products of daily use.
</P>
<P>
A joint-venture hospital project in Laos was also agreed upon
that will serve both the local people and the Vietnamese
community in Laos.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and Laos last year recorded a trade turnover of more
than 300 million U.S. dollars, a 1.5-fold increase over the
previous year.

So far six Vietnamese-invested projects with a combined
investment of 9.2 million U.S. dollars have been licensed for

<HEADLINE> Overseas Filipinos to Be Exempt From Service Fee Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs),
the Philippines' major foreign exchange earners, will be granted
exemption from a proposed increase in service fee for passports, a
senior economic official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Budget and Management Secretary Benjamin Diokno said in a radio
interview that this is the government's commitment to improve the
lot of these workers.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it clear that the OFWs are exempted from the
proposed passport fee hike," Diokno said, adding that students of
state colleges and universities shall also receive such exemption.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada reportedly ordered his economic team
last week to focus on meeting the government's target collection
for 2000 and raise enough revenues to bankroll pro-poor programs.
</P>
<P>
Adjusting service fees is one of the measures eyed by the
government to raise revenues. According to Diokno, some of these
service fees have not been adjusted for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier records said the government had deployed a total of 664,
000 overseas Filipino workers between January and September in
1999, up by 1.56 percent compared with the 654,000 registered in
1998.
</P>
<P>
For the January-July period last year, foreign exchange
remittances of overseas workers amounted to 4.47 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government expects foreign remittances this year to reach 8
billion to 10 billion dollars.

Species (CITES) will visit India and Japan this month.
</P>
<P>
The visit is aimed at promoting urgent actions to reverse the
alarming decline in wild tiger populations.
</P>
<P>
"Tigers are so highly endangered that they may soon be extinct
in the wild," said CITES Standing Committee Chairman Robert
Hepworth in Geneva, according to a news release issued by the U.N.
Environment Program based in Kenya's capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"This tragedy can only be prevented if tiger range states do
more to protect habitat and combat poachers, consumer states
stamp out the market for tiger parts and derivatives, and rich
countries help to fund tiger conservation efforts," said Hepworth.
</P>
<P>
Hepworth and other major CITES officials will start a four-day
mission to India on January 23, which still boasts the world's
largest wild tiger population.
</P>
<P>
They will meet with conservationists and tiger reserve managers
in Khajuraho before travelling to New Delhi to discuss strategies
for protecting tiger habitat with high-level government
officials.
</P>
<P>
On January 31, the team will visit Japan, the only country in
Asia that still permits the legal sale of tiger parts. Tiger
parts are used by certain traditional medical practitioners and
by some people who believe they can increase virility.
</P>
<P>
From a population of over 100,000 in the 19th century, the
earth's wild tiger population has plummeted to an estimated 5,000
to 7,000 individuals.
</P>
<P>
Tigers range from India and Russia to China and Southeast Asia,
but with several sub-species thought to be already extinct, the
species' long-term survival is now at stake.
</P>
<P>
Tiger hunting is now illegal everywhere, and international
trade in tigers and tiger products is completely banned under
CITES. Nevertheless, habitat destruction continues at a rapid
pace, live tigers enter the illegal exotic pet trade, tiger skins
are bought and sold, and tiger parts are sought for presumed
health benefits.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Protests to Czech Republic Over Visa Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has lodged a protest
with the Czech Republic over its tightened control on South
Koreans' entry into its territory due to a new immigration law
which came into effect on January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Since the new law became effective, South Koreans, especially
businessmen, suffered great inconvenience when they were entering
the Czech Republic, the South Korean Foreign Affairs and Trade
Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, 26 nations, including the United States,
Japan and European Union member states, are classified into the "
second group," while all other nations were put into the "first
group."
</P>
<P>
Unlike the citizens from the second group countries who can
enter the Czech Republic on a visa-only basis, those from the
first group have to show visas, two photos, an invitation letter
and other documents.
</P>
<P>
The ministry complained that the new law runs counter to the
1994 bilateral agreement between South Korea and the Czech
Republic, under which South Koreans and the Czechs could enjoy a
visa-free stay of up to 90 days in the other country.
</P>
<P>
The two countries established diplomatic ties in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Study Forecasts U.S. Coal Demand to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A new study released
Tuesday forecasts increased U.S. coal demand despite dramatic
declines in coal exports in recent years and even-more-stringent
environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of U.S.-produced coal will increase 131 million
tons or 12 percent between 1999 and 2020, according to the
forecasts by Resource Data International (RDI), a U.S. strategic
information firm focusing on all fuels in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Domestic utilities, which account for some 80 percent of demand
for U.S. coal, are anticipated to fuel this growth. The RDI
projects that consumption of U.S. coal among existing utility coal-
fired power plants will increase from its current estimated level
of 895 million tons to 1,002 million tons by 2020, an increase of
107 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The study also projects that new coal-fired power plants
anticipated to be built in the United States between 2010 and 2020
may consume an additional 39 million tons by 2020.
</P>
<P>
The RDI said increased consumption among both existing and new
utility coal plants is noteworthy in light of increasingly
stringent regulations forcing reductions in emissions of sulfur
dioxide and nitrogen oxide, because the target emission reductions
will require costly control equipment, thereby raising coal-fired
generation costs.
</P>
<P>
The RDI anticipated that continuing productivity improvements
in coal mining and transportation will mitigate upward pressures
on coal prices. Future productivity gains, combined with
oversupply conditions, are expected to hold coal prices close to
current levels.
</P>
<P>
The study also finds that, despite the projected sizable long-
term increases in consumption of U.S. coal, coal's majority share
of the generation mix is anticipated to give way gradually to new
gas-fired generating sources. The RDI projected that, as a result
of the trend toward natural gas nearly fulfilling all new plant
development, coal's share of total U.S. generation will shrink
from its current 53 percent share to 43 percent by 2020. Gas'
share of overall generation in the U.S. is projected to increase
from 13 percent to 37 percent during the same period.

<HEADLINE> Gas Storehouse Set Up to Reduce Pollution in Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a large
liquefied gas storehouse was completed yesterday in Guiyang,
capital of southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The storehouse is capable of storing 200,000 ton of liquefied
gas a year and providing gas to 1.6 million households a month,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The storehouse will help reduce pollution by dust and sulfur
dioxide from coal burning, as most urban citizens are now able to
use gas instead of coal, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The storehouse was established by the Guiyang Liquefied Gas
Company of the Tianjin American Group at a cost of 270 million
yuan (32.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company also set up smaller storehouses and distribution
outlets in all cities and towns in the province to ensure a quick
and immediate gas supply for every households.
</P>
<P>
The environment of Guizhou, one of the major coal producers in
China, has been damaged for years by coal burning, and the local
government has worked hard to improve the situation, the officials
said.

<HEADLINE> New Animal and Plant Species Found in SW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A group of some 100 Chinese
scientists have found nine species of animals and plants and 69
species of fungus in Yunnan Province, southwest China, after two
years of investigation.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yuming, a well known Chinese bamboo expert, said the new
plants, found in the Dawei Mountain Nature Reserve, include five
varieties of crabapple, three varieties of bamboo, and one
amphibian.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve, which covers 2,000 hectares of virgin
forest, is one of China's most well-preserved tropical rain
forests. And this is the first systematic scientific investigation
ever carried out there.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, there are 3,619 seeded plant varieties in
the reserve, about 40 percent of China's total. He attributed the
reserve's rich bio-diversity to its low latitude, thick forests
and high elevation.
</P>
<P>
To better protect the nature reserve, the provincial government
has applied for State government's approval to have the reserve
listed under national protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Liu Chengxing, a cotton grower in
east China's Shandong Province now plans to grow and produce
mushrooms to make more money.
</P>
<P>
Liu lives in Gaotang County, one of the major cotton producers
in the province, and was once a leading cotton grower.
</P>
<P>
Liu earned 300 yuan from each mu (one fifteenth hectare) of
cotton growing the year before, but a trial planting of mushrooms
last year earned him 6,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Cotton production was one of the major economies in Gaotang
County and accounted for more than half of local agricultural
output.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, cotton-growing areas in Shandong Province were reduced
from 413,000 ha. in 1998 to 380,333 ha. A growing number of local
farmers have taken up more lucrative crops such as mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
The net income per capita of local farmers was 2,550 yuan in
1999, a four percent rise on 1998's figure.

<HEADLINE> China Making Greater Efforts to Exploit Ocean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China intends to expand its
exploitation of marine resources, prevent the ocean from pollution,
and protect China's maritime territory in the 21st century, said
Zhang Dengyi, director of the State Oceanic Administration.
</P>
<P>
The country will strengthen work in this field to narrow the
gap with developed countries, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Through oceanic research, many of the ocean's mysteries will be
discovered to promote scientific development and resources
exploitation, which is of great importance to national economic,
scientific, and military development, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Currently, scientific research on the relationship between
ocean and climate and earthquakes and ecological systems is
drawing world attention. It is believed that these studies can
also shed light on the origins of universe, life, and human beings,
and will deepen people's understanding of ecological change and
bio-diversity.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, China will give more support to research on
marine cultivation, utilization of sea water and energy, and the
monitoring and surveying of ocean pollution. At the same time, an
oceanic observation system with satellites as the core technology,
a digital oceanic information system, and an ocean-disaster
forecasting system will be established in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China now has the basic conditions for
exploiting the ocean thoroughly, with the total output value of
ocean-related industries reaching 326.9 billion yuan (about 39.4
billion US dollars) in 1998.

<HEADLINE> China to Intensify Support for Chinese Language Education Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to attach
great importance to the teaching of the Chinese language abroad
and provide greater support to overseas Chinese who teach the
language, senior lawmaker and former diplomat Li Daoyu said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Spreading Chinese language education is a task of strategic
significance," said Li, vice chairman of the Overseas Chinese
Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Li once served as China's ambassador extraordinary and
plenipotentiary to the United Nations and as China's ambassador to
the Untied States.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese language helps maintain cultural relations with
overseas Chinese, and disseminate Chinese traditions and culture
in foreign lands, the former diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the schools run by overseas Chinese are doing
well, there are still many lacking necessary funds and qualified
teachers, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We must provide more support to Chinese schools in foreign
lands," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
To spread the use of the Chinese language, the Chinese
government has set up a special team, headed by Minister of
Education Chen Zhili.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics show that there are more than one million
people in Japan now studying Chinese.
</P>
<P>
And an increasing number of overseas Chinese and foreigners are
taking the Chinese Language Proficiency Test for non-Chinese
speakers, the Chinese version of the TOEFL test.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Quality of China's Alcoholic Beverages Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A selective examination prior
to the traditional Chinese Spring Festival has shown that the
quality of China's alcoholic beverages is relatively satisfactory,
and famous-brand spirits are more reliable than ordinary ones.
</P>
<P>
The examination, by the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision, of 80 alcohol products from 78 enterprises found that
80 percent met qualifications, and the content of methanol and
lead was lower than national standards.
</P>
<P>
However, these products came from major cities, while the
markets in small cities and rural areas were not covered by the
examination. So the problem of too much methanol should not be
ignored, warned bureau officials.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said, the production and sale of fake spirits
have been checked after a series of crackdown campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The famous-brand alcoholic drinks, the most reliable on China's
market, make up only two percent of the total alcohol output, and
the more ordinary spirits need quality improvement, according to
the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the total national output of spirits was 6.
5 million tons in 1999, compared with seven million tons in the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Reports 22 Percent Profit Rise For 2nd Fiscal Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., the
world's largest software maker, Tuesday reported that its net
income rose 22 percent to 2.44 billion U.S. dollars, or 44 cents a
share, in its second fiscal quarter ending on December 31,
according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
The earning was 1.98 billion dollars, or 36 cents a share, in
the same period of the previous year, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Excluding a special charge, the company earned 47 cents a share,
compared with analysts' expectation of 42 cents a share, according
to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
Despite the threats from its anti-trust case, Microsoft's
results painted a picture of a company still managing to grow. Its
revenue climbed to a record 6.11 billion dollars for the quarter,
up 18 percent from the previous year's 5.20 billion dollars. A
surge in investment earnings and strong Office sales helped boost
results.
</P>
<P>
In its results statement, Microsoft said the second-quarter
profits were helped by strong demand in Asia and sales of the
latest version of its Office business software.
</P>
<P>
Revenues for the current quarter could be larger as many
business and corporate users waited for the Windows 2000 operating
system, which is to be officially launched on February 17,
industry sources predict.
</P>
<P>
"It was a solid quarter" for Microsoft, said William Epiphano,
an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Epiphano said he expects Microsoft to continue
to be a strong performer, with momentum building toward the end of
its fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
"I think Windows 2000 is going to have an enormous upside, but
it's going to take a little while to kick in," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be looking at very strong product cycles for
Windows 2000, Office 2000 as well as a lot of the other products
that they sell," he explained.

<HEADLINE> Low-income Families Move into New Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the government's
special settlement project, 50 low-income families in Chengdu,
capital of Sichuan Province in southwest China, moved today into
new apartments provided for poor families.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed for helping local families each with
annual income lower than 5,000 yuan (602 U.S. dollars) and per
capita living space less than six square meters.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the 50 families were first
selected from 319 applications on a trial basis, and the rent of
the 60-square-meter apartment is low enough for them to afford.
</P>
<P>
The officials said Chengdu will continue to carry out the
settlement project.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has helped 20,000 poor families move
into new houses in the past two years. The average per capita
living space is now 10.4 square meters in the city. However, there
are still many poor residents living in very tiny apartments and
three generations under one roof is by no means a rare occurrence.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A highway opened to traffic
recently at Yangla Township in Deqin County, a Tibetan-inhabited
area in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 147-km-long road began in 1991 at a cost of
85 million yuan. It took nine years to complete as the region has
a rugged geographical feature and frequently plagued by natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Completion of the road makes it possible for Yunnan to link all
its townships with national or provincial highway networks.
</P>
<P>
Yangla Township lies on a mountainous area where Yunnan and
Sichuan provinces and the Tibet Autonomous Region intersect. In
the past, local residents used to cross over the snow-clad
mountain carrying some 1,000 tons of daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
The highway will greatly help Deqin's economic development,
said the county head.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 19 (Xinhua)-- Asia's largest trans-sonic wind
tunnel is completed in Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan
Province in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The trans-sonic wind tunnel is an indispensable testing
infrastructure for complex spacecrafts. Only several developed
countries in the world have built such tunnels, according to some
Chinese experts engaged in the project.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel is 66 meters long and 33 meters wide. It was
designed and built independently by Chinese experts and its cost
was only one sixth of the same type of wind tunnel overseas.
According to Chinese astronautic experts, major function
specifications of the tunnel are of international standards.
</P>
<P>
China has spent nearly six years on building the tunnel since
its construction began in July 1994. Now that the tunnel is
complete, flight experiments have been carried out on various new
airplanes, missiles and rocket carriers.

<HEADLINE> Australian Farmers Furious over U.S. Assistance  to Its Lamb Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. decision to funnel an
extra 160 million U.S. dollars in assistance to its lamb producers
added insult to injury for Australian farmers, the country's peak
rural body said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
National Farmers' Federation spokesman Brendan Stewart said the
assistance package was a slap in the face for Australian farmers
who last year offered to help fund a major campaign for U.S. lamb
market.
</P>
<P>
"This proposal was accepted by the major commercial lamb
producers in the United States but was rejected by smaller
producers who farm an average of 100 sheep," Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
"Our producers were prepared to inject 750,000 Australian
dollars (495,000 U.S. dollars) of their own money over four years
into the campaign and will take offense at U.S. producers'
readiness to accept taxpayers' funds," he said.
</P>
<P>
The latest move comes after Washington last year outraged
Australian farmers with a decision to hold lamb imports at the
1998 levels and impose a tariff of nine percent on current
tonnages.
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the latest funds would be provided to lamb farmers
in the United States in direct cash payments, casting a cloud over
that country's free trade credentials.
</P>
<P>
"Australian lamb exports to the United States have fallen by 10
percent since the United States made the decision to impose
tariffs on Australian and New Zealand lamb exports in July last
year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sheepmeat Council of Australia President Bill Whitehead also
said Australian lamb growers had funded the development of export
markets out of their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
"The (U.S.) decision can only lend weight to Australia's appeal
against the U.S. tariff decision to the World Trade Organization,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Raises Key Interest Rate Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's central bank,
the Reserve Bank, Wednesday announced an increase in the Official
Cash Rate (OCR) from five percent to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash said the move is prompted by
strong economic growth both in New Zealand and internationally.
</P>
<P>
He said the strong growth is creating inflationary pressure,
and the bank has opted to adjust the cash rate gradually in a move
to dampen that.
</P>
<P>
But the figures released two hours later by Statistics New
Zealand showed lower than the expected inflation rate of 0.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistical department of the New Zealand
Government, the consumer price index, which measures changes in
the price of goods and services, rose only by 0.2 percent in the
fourth quarter of last year and the inflation for the year 1999
was 1.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Expects 7.2 Percent Growth in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will achieve a growth
of 7.2 percent in gross domestic product (GDP) this year due to
the steady increase of exports and domestic consumption, said Bank
of Korea Governor Chon Chol-hwan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said exports, led by semiconductors and other information
and telecommunications-related products, will reach 158.4 billion
U.S. dollars this year, a 10-percent increase from 1999. And
imports will reach 146.8 billion dollars, up 23 percent due to
increased domestic consumption and oil prices.
</P>
<P>
He said the trade surplus is estimated to be 11.5 billion
dollars this year, compared with 7.2 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
He said the inflation rate will hit three percent in 2000
because of the pressure of wage hikes, rising prices of new
materials on the world market and higher domestic real estate
prices.
</P>
<P>
He also said South Korea's foreign exchange reserves will
increase.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, South Korea announced that it will raise its
foreign exchange reserves to 90 billion dollars at the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The nation's foreign exchange reserves rose to 74 billion
dollars at the end of 1999 as domestic banks and financial
institutions returned their debts to the central bank.

<HEADLINE> Intel Unveils Fastest Pentium III Chip for Laptops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's
largest chip maker, Tuesday unveiled a speedy version of its
flagship microprocessor, the Pentium III, for laptop computers
with a SpeedStep technology that helps extend battery life.
</P>
<P>
Intel's new technology allows for two power modes, one for
maximum performance and one for optimal battery life. Industry
sources say the new battery-optimized mode means that notebooks
can operate with 40 to 50 percent less power to the processor and
still maintain 80 percent of the maximum performance of the Mobile
Pentium III processor running at 600 and 650 MHz.
</P>
<P>
"We've never been able to offer portable computer users this
level of processing power in a notebook PC," said Ken Willett,
Vice President of Portable PC Division of Compaq Computer
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"Whether connected or unplugged, Compaq customers can do
everything on their notebooks that they can do on a desktop PC,
including accessing the Internet, transferring data, communicating
with customers, clients and friends, and conducting business
anywhere in the world, any time," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Compaq, the largest global supplier of computer systems, late
Tuesday announced that its Armada commercial notebook PC series,
Prosignia small and medium business notebook series, and Presario
consumer notebook series supports the new Pentium III processors
at 650 and 600 MHz featuring SpeedStep technology.
</P>
<P>
With the faster processors now used in laptops, industry
experts believe the distinction between desktop PCs and laptops is
blurring. More and more consumers and businesses, analysts said,
are using mobile PCs as their sole work computer.
</P>
<P>
One such business is Intel itself. A growing number of its
employees -- such as those who travel a good deal -- now use a
laptop as their primary work computer and plug it into a docking
station at their desks.
</P>
<P>
HP, Gateway, Toshiba and other computer makers also said they
will follow suit and support the new Intel processor.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Interceptor Fails to Hit Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. prototype missile
interceptor went lost in space on Tuesday night after failing to
hit a mock warhead target launched from California, the Defense
Department announced.
</P>
<P>
The failure is an apparent setback in the Pentagon's drive to
develop a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
"An intercept was not achieved for reasons unknown at this time,
" Pentagon spokesman Rick Lehner said.
</P>
<P>
The interceptor rocket was launched from a U.S. Army missile
range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 20 minutes
after the target missile lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base
in California at 9:19 p.m. EST (0219 GMT on Wednesday) and headed
over the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The mock warhead was meant to simulate a nuclear attack on the
United States, and a successful intercept would have provided a
dramatic boost to the Pentagon's effort to show missile defense
can work.
</P>
<P>
Lehner said the Pentagon would conduct an extensive review of
the test data to determine why the interceptor missed the target.
</P>
<P>
Defense Department officials said before the test that even if
the interceptor failed to hit its target, there were other
important goals for the test, including the first test of a
computerized battle management system that is designed to
communicate with the interceptor as it soars into space.
</P>
<P>
The first major test of the missile interceptor -- known as a "
kill vehicle," or by its Pentagon nickname, "smart rock" -- was
last October 2.
</P>
<P>
The officials said earlier that if Tuesday's test succeeded, it
could lead to a decision by U.S. President Bill Clinton this
summer to commit the United States officially to building a
defense against missile attacks by other countries at a cost of at
least 12.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said that the U.S. decision to set up the
national defense system will aggravate the arms race, thus
affecting world peace and stability.

DHAKA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The new Dhaka Metropolitan Police

</P>
<P>
the shoot-on-sight order will be applicable in the cases of

</P>
<P>
The order, however, will not be applicable in the case of
controlling the "political unrest on the streets," he told the
police officials.
</P>
<P>
Despite the major change in DMP, law and order situation in the
city is yet to improve, according to police department sources.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Schaeuble Remains German Opposition Head Despite Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's opposition Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) still supported Wolfgang Schaeuble as its
leader after a five-hour emergency session on Tuesday, despite
sharp criticism within and out of the party over his involvement
in a party fund scandal.
</P>
<P>
He and his 17-member executive had survived a vote of
confidence by the party board. "The board gave its support to the
executive," Schaeuble told the press after the meeting, which was
convened in a bid to save the party out of what Schaeuble
described as "the worst crisis in its history."
</P>
<P>
The 17 members of the core CDU executive leadership had said
they would resign collectively should Schaeuble quit.
</P>
<P>
It had been widely speculated that Schaeuble would be forced to
quit after he and other party officials were strongly criticized
for contravening party funding law by taking undeclared political
donations.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Schaeuble admitted that he had illicitly accepted
100,000 German marks (some 51,000 U.S. dollars) in cash donated by
arms dealer Karlheinz Schreiber. His confession added fuel to the
already intense attack for weeks on CDU for its irregularities in
party funds.
</P>
<P>
The fire was sparked last November when Helmut Kohl, former
Chancellor and honorary chairman of the CDU, revealed that he ran
a web of secret accounts and accepted some 1.9 million marks (
about one million dollars) in anonymous donations during his 16
years in power.
</P>
<P>
Parliament and criminal investigators have both begun probe
into the scandal, which has led to sharp decline in support for
the CDU in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, 69, resigned as the CDU honorary chairman after Tuesday's
emergency meeting gave him an ultimatum to clear up the scandal or
quit.
</P>
<P>
In a short statement, Kohl admitted making mistakes but refused
yet to name the secret donators, insisting he could not break
promises.
</P>
<P>
His resignation followed the exit of Manfred Kanther from
parliament on Monday evening, who admitted Friday that he was
responsible for falsifying party accounts to conceal undeclared
funds in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Kanther, former interior minister under Kohl and former chief
of the Hesse state, said the CDU in his state had taken a total of
about 14.5 million marks (some 7.5 million dollars) since the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe the CDU crisis would shore up the chances of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his Social Democrats' victory in
an upcoming important state election. Schroeder, however, has
voiced the fear that the affair would "damage Germany's image
abroad."

Italy said on Tuesday that Italy's inflation rate in 1999 stood at
1.7 percent, the lowest since 1931.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1999, Italy had planned to bring down its
inflation rate to 1.5 percent to match the average in the Euro
zone, through cutting its public spending and reforming its
telecommunication, electricity and railway sectors.
</P>
<P>
However, near the end of last year, the sudden rise of the
crude oil price in the world market pushed Italy's fuel price up
by 2.1 percent in December from the November level.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the cost of healthcare and transportation increased by
2.3 percent and 2.5 percent respectively last year.
</P>
<P>
This year, Italy plans to reduce its inflation rate to 1.2
percent.

WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. prototype missile
interceptor streaked into space on Tuesday night in search of a
mock warhead launched from an Air Force base in California, but
failed to hit the target, the U.S. Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
The failure is an apparent setback in the Pentagon's drive to
develop a national missile defense (NMD) system.
</P>
<P>
The interceptor rocket was launched from a U.S. Army missile
range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 20 minutes
after the target missile lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base
in California at 9:19 p.m. EST (0219 GMT on Wednesday) and headed
over the Pacific Ocean.

</P>
<P>
By 1998, the province's urbanization rate was 26 percent, three
percent lower than the national average. And the low urbanization
standard has caused inadequate demands and slump in market

In the future, Hainan will concentrate on building small towns
while continuing nine new urban centers.

More funds will be raised to build urban infrastructure such

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Lift Existing Barriers for Chinese Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
soon implement a new immigration policy that will lift the
existing barriers for Chinese tourists entering Indonesia,
Director General of Tourism and Culture I Gde Ardika said.
</P>
<P>
He said the policy would, among other things, allow Chinese
visitors to enter Indonesia through the 13 main entry points
instead of only five as currently allowed.
</P>
<P>
"The policy is expected to be implemented sometime in April,"
he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ardika said his office had recommended the government give
citizens of China the "free visa short stay" facility or at least
allow Chinese visitors to arrange their visas on arrival in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was being discussed and had yet to be
decided upon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Introduced in 1983, the free visa facility allows citizens from
48 countries to enter Indonesia without having to obtain a visa
prior to arrival.
</P>
<P>
The facility, which is not available to citizens of China,
South Africa and several other countries, also allows the eligible
visitors to stay in Indonesia for a maximum of two months, to
travel and to attend conventions and seminars.
</P>
<P>
Ardika said current regulations demanded citizens of China
obtain the proper visa before entering Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said the new policy was being prepared in response to
President Abdurrahman Wahid's recent criticism of the country's
stern immigration regulations for Chinese visitors.
</P>
<P>
Wahid, during a visit to China late last year, blasted
Indonesia's overly-strict immigration regulations for Chinese
citizens entering Indonesia. Wahid then instructed concerned
ministries to phase out the immigration rules.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Reimpose Import Duty on Sugar, Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had agreed to reimpose an
import duty on sugar and rice to protect local farmers from cheap
imports.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Trade Yusuf Kalla said that the new
duty would be contained in the next government letter of intent to
the IMF, which would be published some time this week.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided on a 25 percent (import duty) for sugar, and
about 30 percent for rice," Kalla was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IMF earlier opposed plans to reimpose duty on the two
commodities. The duty was earlier cut to zero percent following
pressure from the fund, which has been championing a free and open
market.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is providing a multi-billion U.S. dollar bailout to
finance Indonesia's economic programs.
</P>
<P>
But the Indonesian government insisted that a zero percent duty
would kill local farmers as the price of imported rice had
declined sharply due to the strengthening of the rupiah to the U.S.
dollar. The availability of cheap imported rice has severely hurt
prospects for local farmers.
</P>
<P>
The government initially proposed a higher duty for both sugar
and rice, but it was rejected by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia imported 4.8 million tons of rice in the 1998/1999
fiscal year ending March 31, because of a series of harvest
failures largely attributed to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
The country's annual rice demand is estimated to be 32 million
tons, including 27 million tons for consumption, 3 million tons
for industrial use and 2 million tons as a reserve for the State
Logistics Agency.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro to Enhance Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia, Albania and the
Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro agreed on Tuesday to enhance their
economic cooperation as part of the joint effort to implement the
Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a meeting in Macedonia's tourist
resort of Ohrid between Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievsky, Albanian Prime Minister Ilir Meta, and their
Montenegrin counterpart Filip Vujanovic, said reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the one-day meeting, Georgievsky was quoted as
telling reporters that the discussions were focused on economic
cooperation and the implementation of the stability pact.
</P>
<P>
The pact was proposed by the Western countries and signed by
many eastern European countries in June last year. The pact
focuses on reconstruction work in southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Georgievsky, who proposed the gathering, also expressed the
hope that enhanced economic ties between the three countries would
help them join the European Union.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued at the end of the meeting said that at
the current stage, the three countries will repair and construct
roads and railways linking them and improve the communications and
power supply networks between them.
</P>
<P>
Vujanovic told reporters that Montenegrin would soon open its
borders with Albania. Montenegrin, which together with Serbia
constitutes Yugoslavia, sided with the West during NATO's months-
long bombing of Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders also exchanged views on cooperation in
fighting organized crime, corruption, terrorism, arms-trafficking
and the smuggling of drugs and humans.

<HEADLINE> UNSC Lacks Consensus on Annan's Nomination of Ekeus as Chief Arms Inspector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council (UNSC) held private consultations late Tuesday on
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's nomination of Rolf Ekeus,
Sweden's Ambassador to the United States, as chairman of the new U.
N. arms inspection regime for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after the consultations, President of
the Security Council Richard Holbrooke of the United States said
no consensus was reached and the members of the Security Council
would continue consultations in New York.
</P>
<P>
"The Council displayed unanimity in a preference to support the
Secretary-General but there is no consensus," he said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said the Council would discuss candidates and not
refer the issue back to Annan, who had informally proposed some 25
names, all of whom were rejected by one or the other of the five
permanent members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted a resolution on December 17, 1999,
which created the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) for Iraq to replace the present
defunct United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requested that the Secretary-General of U.N.
appoint the chairman of UNMOVIC within 30 days after the adoption
of the resolution, subject to the approval of the 15-member
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Annan on Monday notified the Council of his nomination of Rolf
Ekeus, who once served as Executive Chairman of United Nations
Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization from 1991 to 1997,
as the chairman of UNMOVIC.

WELLINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Deputy Prime

cope with imports from Australia and New Zealand.

subsidize sectors of their own economy when they face real
competition," said Anderton, who is also economic development

<HEADLINE> New Zealanders from Pacific Islands Have Poor Status: Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- New Zealanders immigrating
from Pacific Islands have a poor socio-economic status.
</P>
<P>
According to the briefing papers prepared by Pacific Island
Affairs Minister Mark Gosche and made public Wednesday, Pacific
Islanders' incomes are among the lowest of all New Zealanders,
with the median annual income for a Pacific Islander at 12,400 NZ
dollars (6,440 U.S.dollars), compared to 15,600 NZ dollars (8,110
U.S. dollars) for other New Zealanders.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 37 percent relied on a benefit as their main source of
income. In March 1998, Pacific Island unemployment was 16.4
percent,compared to the national average of 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The health of Pacific Islanders is extremely poor, the briefing
papers said. They were less likely to use healthcare and medical
services for children under five, and hospitalization rates for
infants under one year was nine percent higher than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
Pacific people generally had a high incident of heart defects,
preventable respiratory and communicable diseases, tuberculosis,
impetigo and scabies.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, only two percent of Pacific Island people gained a
degree, and Pacific Islanders were not being enrolled in pre-
schools to the same extent as other groups.
</P>
<P>
They were over-represented in prisons. About seven percent of
the prison population in 1996 were Pacific Islanders, the papers
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the papers, most Pacific Islanders did not own
their own homes in 1996 when they made up six percent of the
population.

SANTIAGO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Chile ended 1999 with a trade
surplus of 1.641 billion U.S. dollars, which reversed three
consecutive years of deficit, the Central Bank said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The positive balance is the result of exports for 15.615
billion dollars which exceeded imports of 13.975 billion dollars,
the Central Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank attributed the 1999 trade surplus to the
growth of exports and the fall of imports.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the decrease of imports was due to the economical
crisis that hit the country in the middle of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Italian President Reopens Rome's Fountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi attended the re-opening ceremony of the famous fountains in
Villa D'Este, located on the outskirts of Rome.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi said in his brief speech, "Art, nature and modernization
are the great resources of Italy."
</P>
<P>
"Today's ceremony is important not only for Villa D'Este but
for the whole of Italy," Cultural Heritage Minister Giovanna
Melandri remarked on the same occasion.
</P>
<P>
Only part of the remarkable fountains of Villa D'Este have been
in operation for the past decade due to the pollution of the river
Aniene, which provides the water.
</P>
<P>
The water system has been purified and the fountains gradually
restored.
</P>
<P>
Melandri noted that 7 billion lire (about 3.7 million U.S.
dollars) had so far been invested in restoring the fountains and a
further 13 billion lire (about 6.9 million dollars) would be
earmarked to overhaul and update the tourist services at the Villa,
the second best-loved monument by U.S. tourists after the 1,900-
year-old Colosseum.
</P>
<P>
The spectacular fountain garden was created by Pirro Ligorio
for Cardinal Ippolito II D'Este (1509-1572), a rich Renaissance
prince, collector and patron of the arts.  Over the following 150
years, numerous additions and restorations were carried out.
</P>
<P>
One of the most original and famous features of the garden is
the monumental Fontana dell'Organo, built around a water-operated
organ.

<P>
CAIRO, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic news
briefs on Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel and Egypt are to establish joint teams to
develop package tours that cover both countries. The decision to
work together came at a recent Taba-Eilat tourism conference
sponsored by the Peres Center for Peace.
</P>
<P>
The conference also decided to tackle technical issues such as
problems in the issuing of visas at borders.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- At the end of November 1999, the Israeli public
held 949.80 billion shekels (237.25 billion U.S. dollars) in
financial instruments ranging from checking accounts to stock
portfolios, a rise of 3.35 billion shekels (837 million dollars)
from the previous month, figures released by the Bank of Israel
said.
</P>
<P>
The public had cash of 10.54 billion shekels (2.635 billion
dollars) in November, 10 million shekels (2.5 million dollars) less
than the figure in October.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Officials in Israeli banking industry said they are
puzzled by the continuing decline of the U.S. dollar against
Israel's currency shekel, saying that the shekel's strength against
the dollar has reached the unjustified high.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, the shekel's exchange rate for the U.S.
dollar was around 4.30 to one dollar, but now it stood at 4.058 to
one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said that the situation could change rapidly,
in case of a freeze in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The inflation in Israel stabilized in the last four
months of 1999 at a annualized rate of nearly 1.1 percent, the
Central Bureau of Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
Adjusting for seasonal factor, the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
also showed stability in the period following a decline in the rate
that began at the start of 1999. Not counting housing or fresh
products, the CPI trend for the four months was about 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's Postal Bank's revenues reached 204.6
million shekels (51.15 million dollars) in 1999, up 8.2 million
shekels (2 million dollars) from that of 1998, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
A large amount of this was derived from serving payments, such
as telephone and electricity bills and on-line service, it added.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey will hold its first-ever export products fair
in Shanghai, China, on October 26-29.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Turkey Yao Kuangyi said at a press
conference that Turkey and China can develop cooperation in such
fields as energy, thermal and wind power plants and the renovation
of
railways.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The PSG Consortium, which will build the trans-Caspian

natural gas pipeline, announced that an agreement will be signed by
Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkmenistan during the last week
of March to finalize details of the construction, Turkish Daily
News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the pipeline is expected to be completed in
the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Under the "Istanbul Declaration" signed during the summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in
Istanbul last November, the four countries decided to build a
trans-Caspian pipeline to transport the Central Asian natural gas
to
world market via Turkey.

resumed.
</P>
<P>
"We did not accept preconditions for negotiations in the past,
and we will not accept preconditions now, " Haim Ramon, minister in

<HEADLINE> Italian Government to Give Craxi State Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government stands
ready to give Bettino Craxi, Disgraced former Socialist leader and
prime minister a state funeral, according to circles at the
Italian premier's office.
</P>
<P>
Craxi, once one of Italy's most powerful politicians, died
Thursday in Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist leader, 65, who has been living in Hammamet in
Tunisia since 1994 as a fugitive from Italian justice, was
operated on in Tunis in late November last year, when doctors
removed a kidney which was found to have a tumor in it.
</P>
<P>
Under Italian law, state funerals can be held for persons, like
Craxi, who have played key institutional roles within the country.
</P>
<P>
The immediate cause of death is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
Craxi, Italy's longest-serving postwar premier from 1984 to
1987, slipped out of the country in 1994 after arrest warrants
were issued against him following the probes and fled to his
holiday home in Hammamet just south of Tunis.
</P>
<P>
He was tried in absentia and at one point had amassed jail
terms totalling almost 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema expressed "profound grief" at
Craxi's death.

<HEADLINE> Quito Indian Uprising Enters Third Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, January 19 (Xinhua)-- Indians and peasants keep
arriving Wednesday to Quito from different provinces, within the
framework of the popular revolt that began last Monday to oppose
the three State Powers.
</P>
<P>
Up to now over five thousand Indian demonstrators and people
from other sectors entered the capital city and will remain there
an indefinite time, until the dollar's repealed, president Jamil
Mahuad resigns, National Congress is dissolved and Supreme Court
of Justice is closed, as its leaders announced.
</P>
<P>
Since last Monday, Quito lives in a state of maximum alert due
to progressive popular mobilizing convoked by Confederation of
Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) and other social and
political organizations, which are protesting the government's
latest economic measures.
</P>
<P>
The closing of highways in several of the countries' provinces
has been the keynote of the protest demonstrations. Thousands of
vehicles loaded with merchandise have provoked a shortage of
products in several cities like Ibarra, Quito, Otavalo, Ambato,
Riobamba, among others.
</P>
<P>
The Indian group's latest protest began on Saturday but did
not gain force until Monday when they were joined by striking oil
workers and student groups unhappy with Mahuad's handling of
Ecuador's economy during his 17 months in office.
</P>
<P>
The protesters' latest target is Mahuad's plan to revive the
economy by adopting the U.S. dollar as the country's main currency.
The greenback would become the currency of choice for large
transactions, leaving the local sucre for small deals.

<P>
Mandela, who registered his first appearance at the Security
Council Wednesday as the new mediator for Burundi, made the
statement in answering to a press question outside the Security
Council chamber.
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, "for the last 25 years it has not been
possible for the West to bring about a solution, because they are
competing amongst themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The correct thing for them to do -- and I have explained this
to all the heads of state that I spoke to -- is for them to work
together and not to be competing," he said. "The question of peace
in the Middle East is absolutely critical. We have a Jewish
population in South Africa,. We have a big Jewish population in
the United States, the most powerful. They are all worried about
the situation in the middle east."
</P>
<P>
He said that he already issued invitations to U.S. President
Bill Clinton and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia as well as the
secretary-generals of the United Nations and the Organization of
African Unity to get involved in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The reason why I do so is the experience we have had in the
Middle East," he said. "No single individual can bring about peace
in any region unless he understands that this is essentially a
collective effort."

<HEADLINE> Canada to Introduce Tougher Cigarette Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Health Minister Allan
Rock proposed tougher rules for cigarette packaging Wednesday to
raise national consciousness about danger of smoking.
</P>
<P>
"Canadians who use tobacco products need to fully understand
the serious health hazard inherent in this lethal product," the
minister told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed regulations, cigarette companies are
required to print on the front of the packages illustrations of
diseased brain,cancer tumors and phallic drooping -- all resulted
from smoking.
</P>
<P>
The proposal came in the middle of the country's Non-smoking
Week 2000, beginning from January 16 to 22.
</P>
<P>
A national Decima Research survey indicated Wednesday that 47
percent of smokers in the country are contemplating quitting the
harmful habit this year, a two-fold increase as compared with 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the country's richest province of Ontario, the government
promised another 10 million Canadian dollars (about 6.9 million U.
S.dollars) Monday for initiatives to curb smoking.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says It May Take Weeks to Know Cause of Missile Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The interceptor, a key part of its proposed national missile
defense, was launched from a U.S. Army missile range on Kwajalein
Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 20 minutes after the target
missile lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at
9:19 p.m. (0219 GMT on Wednesday) and headed over the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
"It was extremely close," Pentagon spokeswoman Cheryl Irwin
said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. early-warning satellites, radars and other integrated
technical support apparently worked, but the interceptor weapon
missed the target for unknown reasons, Irwin said.
</P>
<P>
"An intercept was not achieved," the Pentagon said in a brief
statement nearly two hours after the failure of the missile test.
</P>
<P>
The failed 100-million-U.S.-dollar test, which followed a
successful intercept last October, could have a negative impact on
President Bill Clinton's planned decision this summer on whether
to begin building the anti-missile base in Alaska at a cost of at
least 12.7 billion dollars despite objection from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate announcement from the Pentagon on
prospects for a planned third test of the system in April or May.
</P>
<P>
The first major test of the interceptor -- known as a "kill
vehicle," or by its Pentagon nickname, "smart rock" -- was last
October 2.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is under pressure from the Republican-led Congress to
proceed quickly with a limited version of former President Ronald
Reagon's "Star Wars" national missile defense program in order to
protect U.S. cities against "attacks from other countries".

<HEADLINE> Panama to Reinforce Border with Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian government will
strengthen the frontier zone with Costa Rica, announced Wednesday
Panama's Interior and Justice Minister Winston Spadafora, during a
tour through the border zone between both countries.
</P>
<P>
A reinforcement of security in border zones is anticipated in
the new Strategic Security Plan the government of President Mireya
Moscoso will apply at a nearby date, said Spadafora.
</P>
<P>
The border with Costa Rica doesn't escape the insecurity
situation lived on the Colombia border, where constantly there are
paramilitary and rebel incursions of Revolutionary Armed Forces (
FARC), he said.
</P>
<P>
The official reported that local Panama authorities in the zone
are carrying out a detailed study of matters in the border zone
with Costa Rica.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Russia's New Defense Doctrine not Major Shift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at a regular news briefing, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said after reviewing Russia's new national security
doctrine, which was released last week, the administration does
not believe that it makes the use of nuclear weapons more likely.
</P>
<P>
Like the last major doctrine, in 1997, it asserts the right to
use available forces and nuclear weapons if all other measures of
resolving a crisis have proved ineffective, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"Both the 1997 and 2000 national security concepts assert the
right to use available forces and assets, including nuclear if all
other measures of resolving the crisis situation have been
exhausted and have proven ineffective," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Russian doctrine has rejected no-first-use of nuclear weapons
since the mid-1990s, so the fact that they are contemplating the
first use of nuclear weapons, there's nothing new there," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that Washington and Moscow will discuss the
doctrine. "We are going to discuss this with them. We try to
develop better understanding of each side's nuclear doctrine," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair to say that we recognize that there have
been some adjustments in the wording. But in terms of a major
departure going from, say, 'no first use' to 'first use,' we think
that isn't what happened here. They have always retained that
right," the spokesman concluded.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the Clinton administration made comments
since the Russian mapped out the plan.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Take Charge of Wizards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan is back and
determined to win more championships. But this time from the front
office.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and the Washington Wizards announced here this afternoon
that Jordan will come on board as the organization's president of
Basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
One of the sports all-time greats, Jordan will bring experience
earned with the Chicago Bulls to the process of building the
Wizards from a second-rate team into a contender. The agreement
includes a minority share of the team for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The NBA forbids players from owning teams, thus preventing
Jordan from being a player-owner even if he desired to do so.
</P>
<P>
As head of basketball operations, Jordan would oversee trades,
free agent signings, and the drafting of players as the hiring and
firing of front-office personnel.
</P>
<P>
Worshiped worldwide by young and old, men and women, fans and
athletes, Jordan retired for the second time as a player last
January, seven months after leading the Chicago Bulls to their
sixth NBA title in eight years.
</P>
<P>
With the NBA working on his behalf, Jordan has been pushing for
an ownership or front office role in the league. Last year, he
came close to purchasing the Charlotte Hornets, but backed off
when he was unable to gain majority control from George Shinn.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported last Friday that Jordan and
Wizards majority owner Abe Pollin reached an agreement in
principle that would make Jordan the head of the Wizards'
basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
The Wizards, without a playoff game in 12 years, are last in
the Atlantic Division with a 12-27 record and have not had a
sellout this season. The mere presence of Jordan in a business
suit could fill the seats at the two-year-old MCI Center, where
the Wizards will host the Dallas Mavericks tonight.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was a 12-time All-Star, 10-time scoring champion and
five-time Most Valuable Players in his 13-year career with the
Bulls.

<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Hasikos said that despite the fact
that negotiations toward the peaceful resolution of the Cyprus
problem were ongoing, the mechanisms for the strengthening of
defense should not cease.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that maintenance of defensive mechanisms were not
an end in themselves, but the peaceful course toward the final
resolution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
As a key guarantor of Cyprus, Greece, which supports the
establishment of a bizonal, bicommunal federation with one
sovereignty in the island republic, has signed a joint defense
pact with Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for U.N. Military Deployment for Peace in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The deployment of additional United Nations military personnel
should contribute to restoring and maintaining momentum for the
implementation of the Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement," he said. "In
this connection, the signatories bear a crucial responsibility for
ensuring the implementation of the Agreement."
</P>
<P>
"It is on the basis of their renewed and strengthened
commitment to the Agreement they have signed that the
international community will be ready to lend its full support and
allocate the significant resources that will be required," he said.
</P>
<P>
In this context, no new military offensive should be launched,
the security and freedom of movement of United Nations personnel
should be guaranteed, and the spreading of hostile propaganda,
especially incitements to attack unarmed civilians, should cease,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Until the full deployment of a United Nations force, the role
of the Joint Military Commission will remain crucial," he said,
referring to the joint body comprising all parties involved in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
African heads of state will join the U.N. Security Council in
deliberating on how to put an end to the conflict in Congo (K).
The United Nations has been asked to send peacekeepers to the
former Zaire but the United States has hesitated, saying that the
Lusaka Agreement, signed last July in Zambia, has not yet taken
hold.
</P>
<P>
Regional security experts say keeping the peace in Congo (K)
would need a force of upwards of 250,000 troops and air mobility
because of the non-existent road and railway network in the
African country.
</P>
<P>
This compares with a total figure of 10,000 proposed by France
this week and only 3,000 to 4,000 suggested by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda backed rebels of Congo (K) in fighting
against the government, headed by President Laurent Kabila, who
was supported by Angola, Zambia and Namibia.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls Again But Nasdaq Rises To Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the close of session, the Dow index fell 71.36 at 11,489.36.
The blue chip index lost 162.26 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 0.76 at 1,455.90 and the Nasdaq composite
rose 20.48 at 4,151.29, surpassing the record closing high of 4,
131.15 points set on January 3.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index moved lower after Microsoft, the world biggest
software maker, reported late Tuesday that it gained 44 cents per
share in its fiscal second quarter, beating expectations, but its
officials warned investors that the potential demand for the
company's personal computer would be slowdown.
</P>
<P>
An unofficial predication for higher earnings vs. real profits
also disappointed some investors. The company predicated on the
Internet earlier that its earnings was as high as 49 cents per
share in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Financial companies such as Chase Manhattan and Bear Stearns
reported their strong earnings but did not lift the Dow Index.
</P>
<P>
But the weak PC demand warning from Microsoft did not scare
investors away other technology companies. traders turned to
Qualcomm, Yahoo! and other big-name technology companies, thus
driving the Nasdaq index to the new record.

The NYSE index rose 1.45 at 645.37 and the American Stock

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces $110 Billion Dollars Health Insurance Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced Wednesday a 110 billion dollars health insurance plan to
cover about five million uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's new package is the largest proposed investment in
health care since Medicare was created in 1965. About 44 million
people still lack health insurance in America.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is in his final year in office, asked the
Republican-dominated Congress to approve his plan.
</P>
<P>
"These proposals are a significant investment in the health of
Americans, another step toward giving every American access to
quality health care," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The largest ingredients of Clinton's plan are a 3,000 dollars
long-term care tax credit, costing 28 billion dollars over 10
years, and a 76 billion dollars proposal to insure 4 million
parents of children who receive health coverage under Medicaid and
the state Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The program
will be paid from the nation's huge budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposals would create a new "family care" portion of
Medicaid and CHIP programs that insure needy children, and allow
workers as young as 55 buy into the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
"If you just look at what's going on in the election season
this year, the public cares a lot about health care and they're
talking a lot about it," Clinton said at White House.
</P>
<P>
Health care has become a hot topic in the presidential campaign
in an election year.

<HEADLINE> Residents Rocked by Pre-dawn Meteor Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Whitehorse resident Tuesday witnessed three bright pulses of
light "just went soaring across the sky like a pink flare.""
Everything was luminescent," she was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The meteor shot across the sky from the north, leaving a trail
of smoke in its wake. "There was a rumbling then it exploded right
overhead and went shooting to the south," said another witness.
</P>
<P>
A police officer on duty said he saw an extraordinarily bright
light in the sky, then it went dark and shortly thereafter a
section of the sky turned pinkish orange and an explosion was
heard and felt.
</P>
<P>
The meteor, which travels at 10 times the speed of sound, is
believed to have hit the earth near the small town of Carcross, 50
kilometers south of Whitehorse near the border with Alaska, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Last October, a fireball was seen streaking across the skies
in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, where witnesses reported feeling
the ground and buildings shaking as the meteor struck Earth.

<HEADLINE> Fed Reports Strong U.S. Business Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fed report, known as the Beige Book, said surveys of its 12
regions reported "strong economic growth in December and early
January."
</P>
<P>
Robust consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of
total economic activity, contributed to the strong growth.
Retailers reported strong holiday sales with purchases of
electronics, toys and jewelry nationwide and expect robust sales
early this year, the Fed said. A rebound in manufacturing also
contributed to the growth as overseas markets began to revive
after the Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said the U.S. banking system and other parts of the
economy weathered the Year 2000 date changeover without major
disruptions. It predicted few problems down the road in future.
</P>
<P>
"Few future disruptions are anticipated and few problems
concerning Y2K-related inventories are expected," the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
The Fed report noted that even though labor markets remained
tight around the country, there was still no sign that employers
were handing out large wage increases. "Most consumer prices
appear to be holding steady in much of the country, although a few
districts reported moderate increases," the Fed added.
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey will be used by the central bank when it meets
February 1 and 2 to review interest rate policies. Economists are
predicting that the Fed will increase rates for a fourth time in a
belief that more credit-tightening is needed to make sure fast
economic growth does not trigger inflation down the road.

<HEADLINE> Union Membership Rises in U.S. Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of union members
in the United States reached 16.5 million in 1999, an increase of
265,000 workers from the year before, data from the Department of
Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the largest increase in union membership in more than
20 years, labor leaders said Wednesday that they reversed a
downhill slide in union membership by appealing to white-collar
workers.
</P>
<P>
But while the country added 2.7 million jobs last year, the
overall percentage of workers who carry a union card remained at
13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, union leaders said they believe the numbers will
translate into more political clout for organized labor in the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"In the year 2000, you're going to see the largest and most
significant activity that grassroots workers have exercised in any
political election," said John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-
CIO, the largest labor federation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that 37 percent of government
workers, including local police and firefighters were union
members, compared with about 9 percent of private sector workers.

<HEADLINE> Romanian,Ukrainian DMs Meet for Substantial Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 19 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Ukrainian
Defense Minister Olexandr Zukmuk Wednesday hoped the ties between
Romania and his country will develop toward friendly cooperation,
while his Romanian counterpart Victor Babiuc believed in more
substantial bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Olexandr Zukmuk, who Wednesday started a two-day official visit
to Romania, and his Romanian counterpart Victor Babiuc told a
joint press conference that issues related to bilateral relations
and "matters of European interest" were approached during the
official talks.
</P>
<P>
According to Babiuc, during his talks with the Ukrainian
Minister, specific issues were discussed related to the conclusion
of three bilateral agreements intended to be signed by the end of
the current year, regarding steps for increasing the confidence of
the two neighboring countries in each other, to military equipping
and logistics and the protection of secret information.
</P>
<P>
Kuzmuk underscored that during the long expected visit he
agreed with his Romanian counterpart that starting from the
cooperation in 1999 and the plans for the future cooperation
agreed on the occasion of the current visit, not far from the
start of the 3rd millennium, "we can say that we started concrete
cooperation with Romania."
</P>
<P>
Kuzmuk let one understand that neither the Kremlin changes nor
Romania's firm option to join the North-Atlantic Alliance would
influence Ukraine's foreign and military policy and its bilateral
relations with the countries involved in the processes.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Defense Minister was received later on the day by
President Emil Constantinescu.

<HEADLINE> Italy Says Key Stability Pact Targets Met in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 19 (Xinhua) -- Italy's 1999 deficit-to-GDP ratio
is in line with the original euro-zone target of 2 percent,
Italian Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato said in a letter sent
Wednesday to the European Commission, up-dating it on Italy's
Stability Pact performance.
</P>
<P>
In May last year, Amato raised the hackles of European partners
by requesting and achieving a one-off concession for Italy to
exceed the 2 percent limit by as much as 0.4 percent, because of
slow growth in Italy, but Thursday's letter and accompanying
Stability Pact document stressed that the country had been able to
meet its euro-zone commitments after all.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to European Commissioner for economic and
monetary affairs Pedro Solbes Mira, Amato wrote that: "that
arduous target of 2 percent has been met. It was last May when,
with the agreement of the European Union's finance ministers, the
deficit for 1999 was revised up to 2.4 percent of GDP, to take
account of the impact on public accounts of slower growth
forecasts."
</P>
<P>
"Italy's public sector borrowing requirement came to 1.5
percent of expected GDP for 1999. This data suggests that the
public administration's net debt will be in line with the initial
target of 2 percent of GDP," Amato continued.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said the deficit was expected to fall to 1.5
percent of GDP in 2000, to 1 percent in 2001, 0.6 percent in 2002
and 0.1 percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Amato also informed the Commission that public debt was
expected to come to 114.7 percent of GDP for the end of 1999,
which is better than the previously forecast 115.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the improved figures for both the deficit and the
public debt reflected greater revenue from taxes than previously
expected, as well as the impact of lower interest rates.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Albright to Visit Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The visit will be the first by a senior U.S. official since
Vladimir Putin was named by former President Boris Yeltsin on New
Year's Eve as acting president until elections in three months.
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to meet with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
and chair with the Russians a multilateral conference to promote
understanding between Israel and its Arab neighbors through joint
economic programs and in other multilateral projects.
</P>
<P>
However, a State Department press release about Albright's trip
did not mention a meeting with Putin, who will likely meet
Albright before she leaves Moscow on February 1,an Associated
Press report said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Albright hailed Putin as "one of the leading
reformers" in Russia and"determined to move reform forward."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration was not "kind of starry-eyed" about
Russia, "but also understands the importance of pushing and
working with them and having it seen as being in our national
interest," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary will go to Davos, Switzerland, to deliver a
speech on January 30 at the World Economic Forum, where President
Bill Clinton will also attend.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Energy Secretary Vows to Fight Racial Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richardson made the announcement after receiving a report and
recommendations from the Task Force Against Racial Profiling that
he established last June to investigate the climate at the DOE
facilities and make recommendations to ensure that the DOE
policies against racial profiling are carried out effectively.
</P>
<P>
"The Department will neither commit nor tolerate racial
profiling," Richardson said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said he formed the task force because he was concerned that
Asian Pacific Americans at DOE labs were feeling their patriotism
and loyalty questioned in the wake of the so-called espionage of a
Chinese American scientist.
</P>
<P>
"As a Hispanic, I know firsthand the damage of racial
stereotyping, and I'm worried that this kind of atmosphere can
foment a dangerous 'brain drain' where we lose our best scientists,
hobbling our research quality, our leading edge science and
ultimately our national security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The actions outlined by Richardson include the appointment of
Chinese American Jeremy Wu to serve in a newly created position of
National Ombudsman and Director of the Office of the Ombudsman for
the DOE to be available for any employees who may have concerns
and to monitor and review diversity management matters, and the
Appointment of Daphne Kwok, from the Organization of Chinese
Americans, to serve on the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force, comprised of 18 senior DOE and contractor
employees and Commissioner Yvonne Lee, U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights, visited Department sites around the United States. At
Richardson's invitation, five Asian Pacific American leaders
observed and actively participated in additional fact-finding
delegation visits.
