<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Constructive Action Over Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday called for
constructive approaches from all sides over Iraq weapons
inspections to help avert new conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>
"All sides involved should do their best to ensure normal work
of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with overseeing
the destruction of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction," Foreign
Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
The comments came amid renewed tension after Baghdad refused to
let weapons inspectors enter the headquarters of the ruling Baath
Party, the most serious incident since UNSCOM returned to work
last month after a showdown which almost triggered U.S. and
British air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad maintains that the site is not included in the
inspection regime.
</P>
<P>
"This is a necessary condition for passing over to a
comprehensive revision of Baghdad's compliance with the
U.N. Security Council's disarmament demands and to the abolition
of the oil embargo against Iraq in the end," Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Moscow's stance that the situation in Iraq should
be settled peacefully through constructive talks.
</P>
<P>
The United States has said that unless Iraq complies fully with
the inspectors, sanctions would stay and military strikes remain
an option.
</P>
<P>
In London, a British Foreign Office spokesman said the Baath
Party building problem was a matter of serious concern.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has undertaken to provide full cooperation. Its
responses so far to UNSCOM requests for documents and its
behavior toward the inspectors isn't in our view consistent with
full cooperation," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> EU Summit Approves Euro External Representation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union council at
heads of state and government level approved on Friday the
external representation of the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger told the press that
the representation system, proposed by the European council of
finance and economy ministers, was approved. But he gave no
details.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to European Commission President Jacques Santer,
however, said that the approved external representation was not
quite in line with the commission's proposal.
</P>
<P>
The approved representation system consists of the holder of
the rotating presidency of the 11-nation euro zone and a spokesman
elected each year from Germany, France and Italy, the three euro
zone countries inside the Group of Seven.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, proposed on November 4 that the euro zone should be
represented externally by a tripartite consisting of the
commission, the European council of ministers and the European
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
But commission sources said that the approved system could
still allow the commission to exercise its responsibilities "in a
suitable manner".
</P>
<P>
The European council of ministers also put forward its external
representation proposal that appealed for a tandem representation
consisting of the council and the central bank.
</P>
<P>
France, in a counter-proposal, pushed for a representation
system consisting of another tandem of the holder of the rotating
presidency of the 11-nation euro zone and one euro zone member
from inside the G-7 group.
</P>
<P>
France's proposal later got the backing from Germany when the
two countries met in their Potsdam summit in east Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 United Front's
representatives from all walks of life hold a forum here today to
commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Third Plenum of the 11th
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the activity was Li Ruihuan, who is a
Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of CPC Central
Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
The meeting held 20 years ago has had epoch-marking
significance in the history of the Communist Party of China and
the nation, said Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National
Committee and head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
During the past 20 years, Wang said the united front work under
the leadership of the CPC had scored the most fruitful
achievements and has accumulated valuable experience.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang emphasized that the new-period united front
work should keep to the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the
leadership by the CPC, serve the national work focused on economic
development, uphold the two "great banners" of patriotism and
socialism, and recognize and correctly handle the relationships
among the people within the united front.

<HEADLINE> EU Not to Change Growth Forecast: Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Friday that it would not scale downward its forecast of economic
growth for the European Union in 1999.
</P>
<P>
European Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy told a
press conference during the European Union council at heads of
state and government level that the commission's October forecast
had already taken into consideration the slowdown in economic
activities caused by the crises in Asia and elsewhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had therefore no reason to amend the October
forecast.
</P>
<P>
In October, the European Commission, the executive body of the
15-nation union, reduced its forecast for the 1999 gross domestic
product in the union to 2.4 percent from the March forecast of 2.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
But the October forecast put the growth in 2000 at 2.8 percent
thanks to the fact that private consumption was holding up and
construction was performing better than expected.
</P>
<P>
Investment turned out problematic due to an apparent loss of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
The finance commissioner admitted that external factors were
having a negative impact on EU-wide growth and it would have to
take some time before normalization could take place. "I would
say that in the course of 1999 and at the beginning of 2000 the
international environment should be stabilizing."
</P>
<P>
The commission pronounces its forecast for economic growth
twice a year, once in March and another time in October.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), however, said on
Thursday that it would scale back its forecast of economic growth
for 1999.

<HEADLINE> APEC Preparatory Senior Officials Meeting Held in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- APEC has started its work
on its 1999 program by convening a two-day Preparatory Senior
Officials Meeting here Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Maarten Wevers, incoming Chair of APEC Senior Officials and
Director of the APEC Secretariat, told a press conference Thursday
evening that "APEC has made a positive and early start on APEC's
work for 1999."
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at senior official level with New Zealand in
the chair and attended by all APEC economies including new members
Peru, Russia and Vietnam, came two weeks after the 1998 APEC
Economic Leaders' Informal Meeting and Joint Ministerial Meeting
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, last month.
</P>
<P>
Wevers said with the next Economic Leaders' Informal Meeting to
be held in September 1999 in Auckland, New Zealand, APEC is keen
to get moving quickly on the tasks and directions set by Leaders
and Ministers in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Singapore meeting took stock of the outcome of discussion in
Kuala Lumpur and agreed on the tasks arising from those meetings
and allocated responsibilities within the APEC machinery for
carrying them out, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aris bin Othman, Chair of the APEC Finance Deputies and
Secretary -General of the Ministry of Finance of Malaysia, briefed
the meeting on the work program of Finance Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials agreed on the desirability of working closely
with Finance Deputies in following up on instructions of Leaders
and Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials also accepted a U.S. offer to lead a task
force on the social framework for growth in view with APEC
Ministers' direction to intensify APEC's efforts to address the
social impact of the Asian economic crisis as a high priority.
</P>
<P>
Singapore meeting also agreed on actions in: Individual and
Collective Action Plans, Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization,
economic and technical cooperation, management reform, electronic
commerce, recommendations from the APEC Business Advisory Council
and the agreement by Leaders to develop a framework for the
integration of women in APEC.
</P>
<P>
Other agreements at the Singapore meeting include an agreement
over a proposal from Japan to hold a Y2K awareness week in March
1999, approval of the second stage of a project on communicating
the impact of trade liberalization, which will include a seminar
in Auckland on June 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>

chair in Wellington, New Zealand, on February 7-9.

<HEADLINE> Brother's Wrongdoing Unacceptable: Ugandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni told a press conference Friday morning that his brother
Salim Saleh's wrongdoing in business is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made this comment when asked why he accepted his
brother's resignation as senior presidential advisor on defense
and security.
</P>
<P>
He said that previously, Saleh fully confessed his conspiracy
in getting commission in buying gunships for the country's army
and he forgave him because he thought Saleh was very useful to
the country's defense.
</P>
<P>
He said he had advised his brother in some business affairs,
but Saleh refused to take his advice.
</P>
<P>
Museveni described his brother as indisciplined and
disobedient because, he said, Saleh knowingly ignored his
well-intentioned advice and made contrary arrangements.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he is ready for a cabinet reshuffle, he said he
will not change many members of the cabinet, but is ready to sack
any indisciplined minister if there is enough evidence.
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to put any criminal behind bars and to confiscate
the property he got illegally," the 53-year-old president
pledged.
</P>
<P>
The reported rampant corruption in the privatization process
of parastatals seriously damaged public confidence in the
government. There is an outcry for sacking all corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
Salim Saleh bought Uganda Commercial Bank through illegal
channels and admitted his wrongdoing over the weekend under
mounting press pressure. Previously, he denied any involvement
in the deal.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary select committee is investigating the
privatization process of UCB and has found several ministers
involved in the matter. The final statement of the committee is
expected to come out next week.

<HEADLINE> Two Palestinians Killed in Clashes With Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- One day before
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and Palestinian
self-rule areas, two Palestinians were killed on Friday during
clashes with Israeli troops in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center, the clashes erupted in the West Bank town of Qalqiliya
when some 400 Palestinian hold demonstrations in protest against
the Israeli refusal to release Palestinian political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators threw stones at Israeli soldiers who
responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and also live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
A clinic in the area confirmed that two bodies of Palestinian
youth were sent to it and dozens of the demonstrators were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 2,000 Palestinians also held demonstrations in
the West Bank city of Nablus, but no clashes were reported.
</P>
<P>
The killing came just a day before President Clinton began his
three-day visit in the region as an effort to move forward the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel has suspended the implementation of the latest agreement
signed with the Palestinians in October and asked the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to make concessions over some issues
including the release of the Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel would release 750 Palestinian
prisoners in its jails before next January.
</P>
<P>
In the fist stage, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners last
month, but most of them were common criminal. And the PNA noted
that Israel should have freed prisoners who were arrested due to
anti-Israel activities.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb Erekat disclosed on
Friday that the U.S. has presented a compromise which calls to set
up a tri-party panel to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
But Secretary of Israel's Cabinet Danny Naveh rejected the
proposal, saying that this is not a matter of negotiation and
Israel has the right to decide who should be released.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Scale Down Political Involvement in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) will scale down its political
involvement in Lesotho following its success of getting
opposition in the country to negotiate, South African Safety and
Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi told reporters in Pretoria that Lesotho's Interim
Political Authority (IPA), comprising two representatives of each
of the country's 12 political parties, was competent to deal with
outstanding issues in the run-up to the country's next election,
scheduled to be held within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
IPA was sworn in on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi has led a SADC delegation since last month to mediate
political disputes between the ruling Lesotho Congress of
Democracy and opposition alliances.
</P>
<P>
"We are now at a stage where less mediation is needed and more
business needs to be done by the Basotho themselves," Mufamadi
said.
</P>
<P>
Basotho is a major nation of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The four SADC countries tasked with ensuring a peaceful
resolution of the conflict in Lesotho, South Africa, Zimbabwe,
Mozambique and Botswana, would remain on stand-by to provide
Lesotho with technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that SADC representatives met the IPA in
Maseru, the capital of Lesotho, Thursday shortly after the
authority's first meeting where it elected two chairmen.
</P>
<P>
They are Khauhelo Raditapole of the Basotholand Congress
Party, which forms part of the opposition alliance, and Lekhetho
Rakjoane, a representative of one of the eight parties which did
not contest the previous elections.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the withdrawal of SADC troops from Lesotho,
Mufamadi said this would depend on progress made by the IPA.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said the ruling LCD, which is also represented in the
IPA, had an obligation to help build a relationship of trust
between parties.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party should also consult the opposition in matters
of governance, while opposition parties should in turn show
respect toward the government, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Inflation Rate Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' inflation rate fell to
2.5 percent in the first nine months of this year, lower than the
3 percent limit set by the European Union (EU), the Cyprus Weekly
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This helps Cyprus, which is undertaking accession talks with
the EU, to meet the convergence level of the European political
and economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the Statistics Department attributed the
drop of 1 percent as against that of the same period of last year
to a much lower growth rate in prices of agricultural products and
services.
</P>
<P>
The prices of local products rose by 2.5 percent in the first
nine months of this year, compared with the 4.9 percent in the
corresponding period last year. And prices of imported goods
increased by 0.9 percent, compared with 0.4 percent in same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the economy continued its revival this
year thanks to the robust tourism and domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
But total exports fell by 8 percent to 447.6 million Cyprus
pounds (about 895.2 million dollars), owing to a sharp decline of
17.3 percent in re-exports which offset more than an increase in
direct exports.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the crude trade deficit for the first nine months
of the year widened to 950.7 million Cyprus pounds (about 1901.4
million dollars) compared with 841.8 million Cyprus pounds (about
1683.6 million dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The report also said it is estimated that the overall balance
of payments deficit increased to more than 37 million Cyprus
pounds (about 74 million dollars) compared with 9.3 million Cyprus
pounds (about 18.6 million dollars) at the end of September 1997.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Work out EU Employment Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union heads of
state and government commissioned on Friday incoming union
presidency, Germany, with the task to work out an employment pact
by next June.
</P>
<P>
The employment pact should include targets for reducing
long-term and youth unemployment and unemployment among older
workers and women, according to Josef Kalina, spokesman to the
Austrian federal chancellor whose country is serving as the
current EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
Kalina told the press that the commissioning still needs
formalization in the final declaration due out on Saturday from
the Vienna summit.
</P>
<P>
The issue of employment improvement was high on the agenda at
the two-day summit which meant to give the signal that employment
is one of the top issues in the European Union, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In a joint letter addressed to Victor Klima, prime minister of
Austria, German Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French
President Jacques Chirac wrote that an employment pact should be
drawn up so that EU member states will undertake in the future to
attain binding and verifiable goals in the guidelines for
employment, especially in the reduction in unemployment among the
young and long-term unemployed, and to eradicate the
discrimination against women on the labor market.
</P>
<P>
But the Franco-German demand met scepticism from conservatives
in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said that he had
found no new guidelines in the joint initiative.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1994, 4.6 million jobs had been lost in the
European Union. A net increase of 5 million jobs, however, had
been registered in the second half of this decade. In 1998 alone,
1.7 million jobs had been created.
</P>
<P>
In September this year, the union-wide unemployment rate
dropped for the first time in six years to below 10 percent. The
jobless rate remained stable at 9.8 percent in October.

<HEADLINE> Patriotism Can Curb Economic Woes: Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Friday called for patriotism and unity of purpose as the
major tools that may help curb some of Zimbabwe's financial and
economic woes.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who was giving a summary of the central committee's
report to the fourth national conference of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) in Gweru of
central Zimbabwe, advised all stake-holders to work together and
chart the way for economic prosperity, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to Zimbabweans to stop staging job stay-aways
as these disrupted economic activities.
</P>
<P>
"Unity of purpose and patriotism are a prerequisite for
tackling the economic problems that our country is currently
going through," said Mugabe, who is also the party's first
secretary and president.
</P>
<P>
"All stake-holders should come together to exchange ideas on
how to resolve the issues be-deviling our economy," he said,
adding that disruptions of the economy by staging stay-aways will
create more distortions and unbearable hardships for everyone.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past year, the economy has been going through a
traumatic experience marked by the fall of our currency, a rise
in levels of inflation and frequent increases in the prices of
basic commodities," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, these adverse developments,
including poor commodity prices at the world markets, had
seriously affected the standard of living of Zimbabweans.

dominant feature of our times. We do not wish to reverse it, nor
could we," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"But we do have to devise ways of managing it better. We have
somehow to maximize the benefits while addressing its
unpredictability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Fourth Annual Conference on the New York City
Economy, Annan said, "The United Nations has a special
responsibility to insist on the need for global solutions, based
on global rules that are fair to all."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said, "Today, as a result of globalization and
especially the global financial and economic crisis of the past
18 months, the global economy and the global politics are
increasingly entwined," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a world in which no country, and no city, can isolate
itself," he said. "Globalization draws us closer together."
</P>
<P>
"We have a responsibility to ensure that nations do not react
by turning away from each other, but by coming together to ensure
stability,, confidence and growth," he said. "And we have a
responsibility to see to it that the interest of those hardest hit
by the crisis are not forgotten."
</P>
<P>
On the relationship between the United Nations and New York
City, Annan said, "the United Nations is pleased to do its part:
every year, we contribute 2.2 billion U.S. dollars to the city's
economy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan also called upon the New York City to "support
us in Washington on the chronic and debilitating problem of U.S.
arrears."
</P>
<P>
The United States just saved its face by avoiding the loss of
its vote in the General Assembly next year with the payment of the
minimum sum in its back dues.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Members Fail to Agree on Cambodia's Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The nine members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) failed to agree on
the admission of Cambodia after their foreign ministers held
consultations for more than four hours here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"We were unable to reach consensus" on the matter, Foreign
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam of Vietnam, whose country is hosting the
Sixth ASEAN Summit, told reporters at the end of the informal
consultations held over dinner.
</P>
<P>
He noted that while some members believed that all the
conditions for admitting Cambodia were satisfied, others thought
the regional grouping should wait for some more time.
</P>
<P>
He said the question will be left to ASEAN leaders, who will
meet here on December 15 and 16, to decide.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kobsak Chutikul, spokesman of the Thai Foreign
Ministry, said that what the ASEAN countries looked for was "frank
discussion" and "free airing" of views.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be rushed into a decision," he declared,
saying the timing at present is "not opportune" for the admission.
</P>
<P>
He said that although a coalition government was formed in
Cambodia at the end of November, the conditions set for Cambodia's
accession into the ASEAN had not been fully met yet. Under the
conditions, he added, Cambodia should amend its constitution and
appoint senators.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, there existed a technical obstacle as some
foreign ministers did not have the mandate to sign the accession
declaration during the summit.
</P>
<P>
He also called for more time for the coalition government to
work and for not letting the Cambodia issue overshadow other
important issues such as the lingering financial crisis which hit
the region last year and the ASEAN Free Trade Area.
</P>
<P>
According to ASEAN sources, members favoring a delay of the
admission were Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, speaking of the ASEAN's failure to reach consensus
on the matter, Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Domingo
Siazon pointed out that the ASEAN has never reached immediate
consensus on many issues. "It just is a sort of reflection of
diversity of the membership of ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the nine ASEAN countries -- Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam -- will meet here officially Saturday to
prepare for the forthcoming ASEAN summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Friday challenged newly-elected provincial chairmen of his
Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party
to end factionalism that has be-deviled the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who is the party's first secretary and president, was
addressing the ruling party's fourth annual national conference
in Gweru, central Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said party cadres could not afford to fight among
themselves when there were a lot of enemies plotting the party's
downfall.
</P>
<P>
"Factionalism affected all our work. We do not need that," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe reminded the new chairmen -- seven out of the 10
provinces -- that they came into power by pledging to work for
unity.
</P>
<P>
He also slammed ZANU-PF members of parliament who attacked the
party and its leaders in the House using parliamentary privilege
and freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
The president reminded them that they were voted into their
positions by faithful party members who were "not amused" by
their rebellious utterances.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Urged to Tap Blue Nile Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Ministry of
Water Resources said Friday that only 1.2 percent of 55,000
megawatt of hydro-electric potential has been utilized from the
Abay river, also known as Blue Nile.
</P>
<P>
Abay river is Ethiopia's most famous river. Its total length
to its junction with the White Nile in Khartoum, Sudan, is 1,450
kilometers, 800 kilometers of which are inside Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
At the closing of a three-day workshop held in northern Gondar
town, the ministry said about 51 billion cubic meters of water
flows to the neighboring countries yearly, the Ethiopian News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 25 percent of the country's total population are settled
along the Abay basin that covers about 199,810 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said a study confirms that food crops which can
account for 40 percent of the country's overall food need can be
cultivated in the basin.
</P>
<P>
Although it is possible to develop through irrigation over
half a million hectares of land along the basin, 1.2 percent is
harnessed so far, the ministry said.

MOSCOW, December 11 (Xinhua) -- An official of the
International Monetary Fund said Friday that Belarus has to meet
the lending agency's conditions before receiving an emergency loan
of about 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be provided if the country fulfills
recommendations on the liberalization of economic policy,
Assistant Director of the Fund's Europe II Department Thomas Wolf
told reporters in Minsk Friday.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Belarussian government to tighten its crediting
policy in order to scale back inflation, stiffen its budget policy
and liberalize the currency market, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
If all the conditions are met, a positive conclusion will be
submitted to the IMF when it discusses the loan in early March
next year, Wolf said.

<P>
The IMF delegation arrived in Minsk on Monday and was scheduled
to leave the country later Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Price Index Drops in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Producer Price Index
(wholesale) fell 0.2 percent in November because of the price of
gasoline, vegetables and fruit all taking a sharp drop, the Labor
Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of this year, prices at the wholesale
level have been jumping at an annual rate of 0.7 percent as the
world economic crisis has decreased demand for oil and other
commodities.
</P>
<P>
The big energy prices drop and largest decline of food costs in
last 17 months made inflation a no-show in November.
</P>
<P>
The last month's 0.2 percent drop in the PPI was the sixth time
this year that wholesale prices have actually fallen.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was also contained excluding the volatile food and
energy sectors. The "core" rate of wholesale inflation rose just
0.1 percent in November. So far this year, the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) is rising at an annual rate of 1.6 percent as against
last year's 11-year low of 1.7 percent.

WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- For only the third time in
history, the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee
Friday took up impeachment articles against President Bill
Clinton. The proposed articles accuse Clinton of perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power.

<P>
Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican, laid the first of the four
proposed articles before the panel for debate. It accused Clinton
of perjury before a federal grand jury.

The committee also will debate articles accusing Clinton of
lying under oath in the Paula Jones civil lawsuit, obstruction of
justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Majority Republicans were primed to muscle the impeachment
resolution through the committee and to the full House.

ATHENS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Students from Greece's high
schools and technical colleges on Friday demonstrated in towns and
cities throughout the country to show their opposition to the
government's education reforms.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Athens, students blocked roads, causing
traffic chaos and some tension while in Peristeri, students threw
eggs at the local mayor when an Education Ministry official failed
to attend a meeting scheduled at a school.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, a number of
students also blocked a main thoroughfare and threw eggs at
passers-by and motorists.
</P>
<P>
Students, along with teachers, are protesting on a number of
issues, including teacher shortages, education ministry's changes
to grading and examinations at the primary, secondary and tertiary
levels, the introduction of open university type programs and
changes to procedures for appointing new teachers.
</P>
<P>
Recently, thousands of Greek students have done the similar
demonstrations around the country, set cars ablaze and smashed
bank windows.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has said that it will not back down on its
education reforms, but hopes to settle its dispute with students
through dialogue.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy, Lebanese Leaders Discuss Peace process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Middle East
Envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos Friday held talks with Lebanese
leaders over the Mideast peace process, especially on the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanon's newly elected President Emile
Lahoud, Moratinos told reporters that he had expressed to the
president the EU's interest to continue its efforts to reactivate
the Syrian and Lebanese talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He denied bringing any new ideas this time, saying he will just
try to put what he had said into reality. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Syria, Lebanon and Israel have been
deadlocked since the hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu came to power in June, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Syria and its ally Lebanon insist that talks must be resumed
from where they left off While the current Netanyahu
administration does not accept what the previous labor government
had reached with Syria and holds that talks should be restarted
from the scratch.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying Syria's Golan Heights since the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
It also set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon vow to hold talks with Israel simultaneously
while the Jewish state desires to make a separate peace deal with
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy stressed that the disconnection of the two tracks
will not lead to a full and just solution.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, who arrived here on Thursday, will also visit Syria
on Saturday.

MOSCOW, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Friday that the
Taliban movement is responsible for continued fighting in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The movement is still trying "to resolve the Afghan problem
through the use of force, bring the whole country under its
control and impose on it a regime based on religious fanaticism,
extremism and intolerance," Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He cited a resolution adopted several days ago at the U.N.
Security Council denouncing the escalation of hostilities by the
Taliban, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The council demands "that the Taliban abide by U.N.
resolutions, cease expansion and hold talks with other Afghan
groups with a view to setting up a representative government in
the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow "wholeheartedly supports the readiness, expressed in the
resolution, on the part of the Security Council to consider steps
leading to implementation of its resolutions on Afghanistan,"
Rakhmanin said.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Not to Withdraw Troops from Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Botswana's Deputy
President Lieutenant-General Ian Kahama said in Maseru, capital
of Lesotho, Friday that Botswana will not withdraw its troops in
Lesotho in a hurry as their work needed to be consolidated.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted Kahama as saying that
the present Botswana Defense Force (BDF) battalion would be
replaced next month in a troops rotation.
</P>
<P>
Kahama, who earlier visited the BDF deployed in the three
southern Lesotho districts of Mafiteng, Mohaleshoek and Quthing,
said Botswana was committed to deploying troops under the
auspices of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to
help restore law and order in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the costs involved in maintaining the troops
deployment, Kahama said his government would bear the costs.
</P>
<P>
Botswana and South Africa sent troops to Lesotho in late
September when the mountain kingdom fell into a nationwide
turmoil resulted from political disputes between the ruling and
opposition parties over the May elections.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the SADC's mediation led by South Africa, all
parties in Lesotho agreed to hold a fresh general election within
18 months.

<HEADLINE> EU Reaffirms Deadline for Agenda 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Jacques Santer warned on Friday that failure to complete the
Agenda 2000 for internal reforms by next March would throw the
European Union into chaos.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day the European council at heads of state and
government level reaffirmed the March 1999 deadline for completion
of internal reforms, better known as the Agenda 2000.
</P>
<P>
Though the reaffirmation was made at the first day of the
two-day summit, the heads of state and government were still
opposed to one another on the key debate as how the European Union
gets and spends its money.
</P>
<P>
The hardest nut to crack was the insistence of richer European
Union member states on reducing their net contributions toward the
union coffer.
</P>
<P>
Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Austria kept saying that
they have already been paying too much money to fund the union in
relation to the subsidies they get back for their farmers and
poorer regions.
</P>
<P>
Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece, on the other hand, argued
that the spending for the 2000-2006 period should not be frozen as
proposed by Germany and France or they will be left further behind
economically once the aid is diverted to the countries now going
through the accession process.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the EU annual budget of 86 billion ECU (100
billion dollars) go to farmers as subsidies and another one third
to poorer regions of the union.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the European
Union, calculated that the planned enlargement will cost the union
50 billion U.S. dollars in all.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France demanded that EU spending be frozen at the
current level of 1.27 percent of the combined gross domestic
product of the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
Germany, in another development, is demanding a rebate of its
contribution toward the EU budget. The country is footing the EU
bill with 22 billion mark (13 billion dollars) each year and has
been the largest net contributor to EU budget.
</P>
<P>
The rift over EU budget was recently highlighted by Britain's
annual rebate of 2 billion pounds (3.3 billion dollars) won back
by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1984.
</P>
<P>
"Failure would bring about a prolonged period of uncertainty
and crisis," said Santer at the summit. "The time for tactical
posturing and grand declarations is over."
</P>
<P>
The commission chief added that failure to conclude the reform
package would also send a "doubly disastrous message" to the 11
countries applying for EU membership.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Increase In November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. retail sales in
November picked up by a 0.6 percent, the Commerce Department said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sales increase, to a seasonally adjusted 229.4 billion U.S.
dollars, followed a 1.2 percent jump in October and a moderate 0.4
percent gain in September.
</P>
<P>
It was a good sign for sales before the Christmas, when
retailers ring up roughly a fifth of their annual receipts.
</P>
<P>
Sales in November increased more sharply than predicted and the
October gain was even larger than the 1 percent estimated by the
department a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Despite the negative effect to U.S. manufacturing and farming
by the Asian economic crisis, consumer spending has remained
strong. The stock market's sharp rebound in October and November
appears to be giving spending a boost just in time for Christmas.
But it's been supported throughout the year by plentiful jobs,
rising income and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, sales rose 1.4 percent last month at
department stores and other general merchandisers, the biggest
gain in nine months. Clothing shops and shoe stores reported a
substantial 0.8 percent gain, even though individual retail chains
had complained that unseasonably warm weather dampened shoppers'
enthusiasm for Winter coats, gloves and scarves.

The decision was made by IRA's ruling body at a meeting in
recent days", BBC quoted IRA'a sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The unambiguous signal came just hours after the Ulster
Unionist leader David Trimble insisted in his acceptance speech
for the Nobel Peace Prize there had to be a "credible beginning"
to the handover of weapons.
</P>
<P>
The same IRA sources confirmed that a new leadership of the
organization had been elected, an apparent reference to the
so-called seven-strong Army Council and 12-strong Executive.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time this year that the IRA has made clear
that it will not be handing over any of its weapons or explosives
despite intense political pressure.
</P>
<P>
The political process in Northern Ireland has been deadlocked
for months because unionists are reluctant to make any further
progress without the destruction or disposal of some IRA guns or
explosives.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the IRA leadership to rule out any movement on
the weapons issue at this stage will be seen, especially by
unionists, as a significant blow to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Northern Ireland peace agreement, none of the
paramilitary organization in Northern Ireland has begun the
process of decommissioning.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Moscow Values Ties With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Friday that broadening ties with the United States
is of primary importance for Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"We realize the place of the United States in the modern
world," Primakov told U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott. "We would like our partners to know more about today's
Russia, about our intentions."
</P>
<P>
Talbott, leading a U.S. delegation including Deputy Secretary
of Treasury Lawrence Summers, arrived here Wednesday on a five-day
visit. He earlier met several cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the meetings were important for the two sides to
better understand each other.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for us to speak on all subjects of mutual
interest," he said. "You have a lot of questions, and we have a
lot of questions."
</P>
<P>
"Clarifying positions on these issues is of crucial importance
for developing our relations," Interfax quoted Primakov as saying.
</P>
<P>
During Talbott's meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov, the two discussed preparations for a session of the
bilateral commission on economic-technological cooperation in
Washington next March.
</P>
<P>
Both sides "examined possible ways of invigorating bilateral
economic, scientific, and technical cooperation," Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed reduction of strategic offensive arms and
urgent international and regional problems, especially the key
aspects of European security.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Ivanov stressed the need for forming a
"balanced security system on the continent."

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Peace in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Security Council
on Friday issued a presidential statement, calling for a peaceful
solution to the conflict in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
The Security Council's concept of peaceful solution covers an
immediate ceasefire, the orderly withdrawal of all foreign forces,
arrangements for security along the international borders of Congo
(K), the re-establishment of the authority of the Government of
Congo (K) over the whole territory of the country, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It also includes the initiation of an all-inclusive national
reconciliation process in the country, which fully respects the
equality and rights of all, irrespective of ethnic origin, and of
a political process which leads to the early holding of
democratic, free and fair elections, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council is prepared to consider, in the light of
efforts towards peaceful resolution of the conflict, the active
involvement of the United Nations, in coordination with the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), to assist in the
implementation of an effective ceasefire agreement and in an
agreed process for a political settlement of the conflict," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council condemns any violation of human rights
and humanitarian law, including acts of an incitement to ethnic
hatred and violence by all parties," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council urged "all parties to respect
and protect human rights and respect humanitarian law, in
particular the Geneva Convention of 1949 and the Additional
Protocols of 1977, as applicable to them, and the Convention on
the prevention and punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also reaffirmed "the importance of
holding, at the appropriate time, an international conference on
peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region under
the auspices of the United Nations and OAU," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts broke out in eastern Congo (K) in August this
year. Angola, Namibia, Sudan and Zimbabwe are fighting alongside
with the government troops of Congo (K) to remove rebellions,
reportedly backed by Rwanda and Uganda.

MOSCOW, December 11 (Xinhua) -- About one third of the Russian
armed forces's weapons "are not combat ready" and 60 percent of
deployed strategic missile systems have been in use for twice
their service life, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The potential of the strategic warning system has drastically
diminished, while the proportion of armaments in the air defense
forces and the army air force that are out of order has
considerably increased," Sergeyev told Duma deputies.
</P>
<P>
Only 30-35 percent of military aircraft are in good repair,
"The state of the airfield network continues to deteriorate and
the resources for guarding the national air border have
substantially decreased," Interfax quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of Russia's naval vessels need repairing,
Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He told the lawmakers that this year the armed forces had
received "not a single nuclear submarine, not a single tank,
combat airplane, helicopter or piece of artillery."
</P>

Sergeyev said his ministry only received 2.4 billion rubles of
the 5.7 billion rubles earmarked by this year's budget for food
supplies to the armed forces.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Attend OAU Meeting for Settling Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Friday that he will attend a committee session of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) to seek solutions for African
disputes.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and armed
conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo will top the agenda
of the meeting of the 15-member mechanism for settling disputes
under OAU, slated for December 16 in Burkina Faso, Moussa was
quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt has been making efforts to help resolve the two
issues, as part of OAU's mediation endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes took place in May between Ethiopia and Eritrea
over border disputes. The OAU has proposed that Eritrea withdraw
from the disputed Badme area. Ethiopia has accepted the proposal
but Eritrea rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a U.S. bid to defuse the dispute, Moussa said
that there has been "some progress but efforts are still under
way."
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Anthony Lake, who was former U.S. national
security adviser, shuttled between Ethiopia and Eritrea days ago
to seek a peaceful solution to the seven-month row. But no major
breakthrough was reported.
</P>
<P>
In DRCongo, troops loyal to President Laurant Kabila have been
fighting against rebel forces allegedly supported by Rwanda and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan,
leaders of DRCongo, Rwanda and Uganda reached a ceasefire
agreement on November 28 in Paris in a bid to end the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Blasts U.S. over Alleged Biological </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Iran's State
Expediency Council (SEC) Hashemi Rafsanjani here Friday lashed out
at the United States for its allegation that Iran is producing
biological weapons with assistance of Russian scientists.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said, "this kind of insult is more serious than any
others."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayers congregation, he said that
Iran's missiles have been produced by Iranian experts and "Iran
does not need any country" in producing missiles.
</P>
<P>
The recent charge against Iran indicated the U.S. deep
hostility to the Islamic revolution and was aimed at hindering
Iran from access to sciences and technologies, said head of the
SEC, a powerful advisory body to the Iranian supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
The former Iranian president stressed that Iran, which
experienced eight-year war with Iraq, has the natural right to
have powerful defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Some western media reported recently that Iran intends to get
access to nuclear and biological weapons by employing Russian
scientists and the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
warned Russia over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Albright on Wednesday said in a meeting with new Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov that Moscow would lose millions of
dollars in American aid if it does not stop assistance to
Iran's missile programs.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian army and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
on Thursday tested four ballistic missiles and four cruise
missiles in war games in the Persian Gulf, arousing more U.S.
concern about Iran's weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Assefi
and the Iranian embassy in Moscow on Thursday rejected the
U.S. allegation on Iran's attempts to employ Russian scientists
to produce weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Assefi said that Iran's scientific cooperation with Russian
research and scientific centers is "quite transparent" and for
"peaceful purposes" and the results of many research projects
conducted jointly by Iran and Russia have so far been published
worldwide as scientific achievements.
</P>
<P>
Iran will go ahead with its peaceful scientific and research
projects, he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite of its mounting pressures on Russia, the U.S. has
had little success so far in persuading Moscow of its views
on Iran's nuclear and missile programs.
</P>
<P>
Russia signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Iran
last month on constructing more nuclear reactors in Bushehr,
southern Iran.

UNITED NATIONS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Ouch Borith, the new
Permanent Representative of Cambodia to the United Nations, on
Friday presented his credentials to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a resolution
on December 7, 1998 and granted Cambodia to resume its seat in the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Prior to assuming his current post, from 1993 to 1997, Mr.
Borith served as the Deputy Permanent Prepresentative of his
country to the Untied Nations. He served as Charge d' affairs of
Cambodia's Permanent Mission to the Untied Nations from 1992 to
1993.
</P>
<P>
Those posts with the United Nations followed an appointment as
the Cambodian Ambassador to Viet Nam from 1990 to 1992. From 1987
to 1990, he served as Director of the Department of Asia and
Pacific Affairs within Cambodia's ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
After earning a General Certificate of Education in Phnom Penh

<HEADLINE> Albright: Problems Exist in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of President
Bill Clinton's trip to the Middle East, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright conceded Friday that problems exist in carrying
out the Wye agreement, but she showed some confidence.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we can and will overcome the challenges we face,"
Albright said in previewing the trip Clinton began Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
She also tried to soothe Israel's concerns that the president's
trip to the Gaza Strip will be viewed as a symbolic U.S.
endorsement of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of the Palestinian state, as we have said many, many
times, is not an issue that is going to be declared unilaterally
or be strengthened by various symbols," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
She said any Palestinian state must be negotiated through the
peace process as part of so-called "final status" talks on a
permanent Middle East peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, briefing
reporters at the White House on the trip, said Clinton will lobby
for implementation of the Wye deal at every opportunity, in
speeches and in meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We know when we left Wye that we would be facing a bumpy
road," Albright said. "And some of those bumps have been jarring.
But there can be no question that Wye has moved us further down
the road towards peace and away from the long and dangerous
impasse that preceded it."
</P>
<P>
Berger said there still exists a possibility of a three-way
meeting between Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The global conference
on the "Year 2000 bug" (Y2K) opened Friday at the United Nations
Headquarters based in New York.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the delegates at the Untied Nations from more than
120 member states, Under-Secretary-General for Management Joseph
Connor said it was impossible to predict the full effect of the
problem on the world's computer systems which the global economy
depends on.
</P>
<P>
"All we know for sure is the timing, but the scope is simply
daunting," Connor said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to get used to the fact that some factors will not be
addressed," he said. But with proper planning, he added, "we
should be able to limit the millennium bug to an inconvenience
rather than a major disaster."
</P>
<P>
"We all know we are in a race against time," said Ahmad Kamal,
the Pakistan ambassador to the United Nations and chairman of the
U.N. Economic and Social Council's Working Group on Informatics.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we will reach some conclusions by the end of the
day on how to proceed," Kamal said.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem is expected to occur because some computer
programs, especially older ones, may fail when the date changes to
2000. As they were written to recognize only the last two digits
of a year, such programs could read the digits "00" as 1900
instead of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Assessments of what might happen vary wildly, especially in
developing countries. They tend to use much less sophisticated
technology relying on software that cannot be updated.

<P>
LUSAKA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of Zambia's
Foreign Ministry declared Friday that the summit on the crisis in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) scheduled for next Tuesday
in Zambian capital Lusaka is postponed.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman neither gave the reasons for the
postponement nor clarified if the meeting would be held later,
the Zambian National Broadcasting Corporation ZNBC reported
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the same spokesman announced that Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba had invited leaders of 12 African
countries to meet in Lusaka next Tuesday in an effort to foster a
cease-fire acceptable to all warring parties in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
These countries include DRC and its allies, Zimbabwe, Angola
and Namibia as well as Uganda and Rwanda which are supporting the
Tutsi-led rebels trying to topple the DRC government of President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here believed that the postponement of the proposed
summit is due to the objection of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Alfred Nzo, South African foreign minister, said Thursday that
his country was opposed to talks planned for next week in Zambia
to try to end the four-month old crisis in DRC unless the rebels
fighting to unseat Kabila were allowed to participate.
</P>
<P>
"This is our clear and firm position that talks without the
participation of the rebels would be useless and a waste of
time," Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
In the past months, Kabila has insisted that his government
only wanted to have talks with Uganda and Rwanda instead of the
rebels who claimed to have controlled half the territory of the
vast central African country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Panel Debating Impeachment Articles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Republicans and Democrats
on a U.S. House panel Friday fought over articles accusing U.S.
President Bill Clinton of perjury, obstruction of justice and
abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican, of the House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee, said the impeachment question
boils down to the president's oath of office. Clinton's conduct,
he said, "cheapens the oath; it is a breach of promise to tell the
truth; it subverts our system of government."
</P>
<P>
Democrats said Clinton may have lied but argued he deserved the
lesser punishment of censure. "I don't believe this constitutes or
rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors," said
Democratic Representative Howard Berman.
</P>
<P>
William Delahunt, another Democrat, said, "This is a capital
case. This case involves the death penalty, politically speaking,
for the executive branch of government."
</P>
<P>
Hyde laid the first of four proposed articles of impeachment
before the panel for debate.
</P>
<P>
Article I contends that Clinton lied before a federal grand
jury on August 17 when he was questioned about his sexual affair
with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
Partisanship erupted right away. Democrats demanded that the
article be amended to include the specific testimony by Clinton
that Republicans believed to be false.

<P>
"We're not dealing with fun and games here," Representative
Charles Schumer, a Democrat, said, insisting that his Republican
colleagues spell out the alleged "lies and mistruths."
</P>
<P>
Representative James Sensenbrenner, a Republican, dismissed the
Democratic request as a "clever ruse" designed to limit the type
of evidence that the Senate might consider during any impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
The committee also are considering articles accusing Clinton of
lying under oath in the Paula Jones civil lawsuit, obstruction of
justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Planning ahead for a House vote, White House chief of staff
John Podesta reportedly spoke with House Speaker-designate Robert
Livingston to appeal for a House vote on an alternative censure
resolution.
</P>
<P>
If lawmakers "were denied that choice, I think it would say
something about the fairness of the process," said White House
press secretary Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
In the hearing room, Democratic Representative John Conyers,
the only member who also served on the committee during Watergate,
said, "This charge of perjury fails because it is vague and does
not meet the minimal standards of due process."
</P>
<P>
Republican Representative Bob Barr said that Clinton, "through
his conduct and his arrogance," had "thrown a gauntlet at the feet
of the Congress" that required an impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
There were also Republicans renewing their call for Clinton to
resign.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, retiring Speaker Newt Gingrich has notified all 435
members to prepare to return to the Capitol next week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces More Aid to Central American Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced Friday that the combined relief effort of the United
States and other donors to the Central American countries in the
wake of Hurricane Mitch could reach 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Rose Garden after meeting four Central American
presidents and one vice president, Clinton said he plans to visit
the region early next year to survey the damage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the administration was providing an additional 17
million U.S. dollars in food aid, bringing the U.S. total
assistance package to 300 million U.S. dollars, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He also said he will ask Congress for tariff relief for Central
America as part of an effort to recast attention from short-term
relief to reconstruction of the devastated houses.
</P>
<P>
"We will help our brothers and sisters," he said in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the Central Americans, Honduran President Carlos
Flores expressed gratitude for the prompt U.S. assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States could help further with tariff
reduction measures and also said a solution is needed for the
problem of undocumented aliens from Central Americans who could
face deportation back to region.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Central Americans received a promise of one
billion U.S. dollars in interest-free, 40-year loans from the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is offering
the region 67 million U.S. dollars in short-term assistance with
the promise of more in 1999.
</P>
<P>
More than 9,000 people have been dead and 9,000 were missing
and perhaps also were dead while three million people were
homeless or displayed in the disaster several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Besides Flores, Costa Rican President Miguel Rodriguez,
President Armando Calderon-Sol of El Salvador, Nicaraguan
President Arnoldo Aleman and Vice President Luis Flores of
Guatemala also attended the meeting with Clinton.

<HEADLINE> U.S Says to Wait for UNSCOM Tests of Iraqi Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
take no military action against Iraq until it had the results
from a series of U.N. initiatives to test Iraqi compliance with
its agreements on weapons inspections, said National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"They are in the middle of that right now. We want to see this
process play its course," Berger told reporters at the White House
during a briefing on Clinton's trip to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States was backing away from a
pledge to strike Iraq if it did not cooperate with U.N. weapons
inspectors, Berger said: "I think we've said all along that the
best option here would be an UNSCOM that can do its job. If
UNSCOM can't do its jot, then we're left to take our own action.
And that continues to be our position."
</P>
<P>
He said a process of challenges by UNSCOM, headed by its
chairman Richard Butler, was testing the extent of Iraq's
willingness to comply.
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Butler -- and we -- will make a judgment as to
whether UNSCOM can do its job. If it can, that's su much the
better. If it can't, then we will be faced with our own
decisions about how to respond," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, also at the briefing,
rejected a suggestion that Washington, by not using the U.S.
military force still in the Gulf region, was giving Iraq the
green light to continue interfering with UNSCOM work.
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," she said

<HEADLINE> Japan Eliminated from Top Eight in Men's Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Hiroshima Asian Games bronze
medalists Japan was eliminated from the top eight after losing to
Chinese Taipei 72-63 in Group B in the basketball competition of
the Asian Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Japan, who has four world championship starters left home due
to injuries, suffered two straight defeats in their group. They
also went down to the United Arab Emirates 54-53 in their first
group game.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Chi-lung hit 19 points for Chinese Taipei while Asain
All-star guard Makoto Hasegawa scored a game-high 26, but still
not enough to save the Japanese who were no match to Chinese
Taipei under the baskets.
</P>
<P>
Japan blowed a 40-35 first half lead and was trailed 63-57 when
Chinese Taipei used a 13-3 run to take over the lead with only
three minutes to go on the clock.
</P>
<P>
Japan tried to turn the tide over with three-pointers but
failed to make any in five attampts.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Japanese men's cagers were edged out of
the top eight at Asian Games. Their previous worst results was a
seventh place finishing at the seventh Aisan Games in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese Taipei and the United Arab Emirates adavance to
the second round which starts on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the other men's match Saturday, defending chamopion China
were just too strong for the hosts Thailand. After a 68-29 lead
in the first half, China went on to beat the hosts 114-53 for
their second win in Group A.
</P>
<P>
But Thailand also went to the top eight with a win of 77-64
over Hong Kong of China on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Other teams qualifying for the second round are South Korea and
Iran from Group B, the Philippines and Kazakhstan from Group D.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Unionists Demand End to Prison Releases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's pro-British
Ulster Unionist Party Saturday demanded an end to the early
release of Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners in response to
the organization's refusal to give up its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Deputy leader John Taylor said republicans had failed to live
up to their side of the peace agreement and attacks were still
possible at any time.
</P>
<P>
"We now have a situation where the IRA have not decommissioned
any illegal armament and have said they will not do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, Her Majesty's Government have now released
over half the terrorist prisoners, over 200. They are retaining
their Semtex and they could hit Canary Wharf or Manchester,
anywhere, very easily.
</P>
<P>
"I do believe that there should now be a halt to the release of
further IRA prisoners," he added.
</P>
<P>
The IRA's supreme authority has decided to reject the
decommissioning recently at a secret meeting, thus dealing a
further blow to the peace process in the province.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the Ulster Unionist leadership has
demanded such a move. Under the peace agreement, all prisoners
jailed for the involvement in the Northern Ireland conflict would
be released within two years.
</P>
<P>
The issue has caused the Northern Ireland peace process to
stall in recent weeks as First Minister David Trimble has refused
to let Sinn Fein take its seats on the executive until the IRA
begins to decommission its weapons.

<HEADLINE> Japan Beats China 15-13 in Swimming (Day Seven) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan established itself as
the continent's top swimming power in the Asian Games on Saturday,
gaining a sweet revenge for its 5-25 loss to the Chinese in
Horoshima four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Japan beat China 15-13 in the gold tally as Masato Hirano
sealed the victory with a gold in the last of 32 events -- 1,500m
freestyle, in which China's only entrant Wang Chuan was 150 meters
away when the Japanese touched the pad.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Han Mingyan admitted he had underestimated the
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
"We have underestimated our Japanese rivals, and they are
stronger than expected," said Han, whose world champion student
Chen Yan failed to land a gold.
</P>
<P>
Japanese swimmer Mai Nakamura said they had worked hard to
challenge China in the Games.
</P>
<P>
"This time we set the goal of beating China and we've achieved
it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Xiong Guoming won the men's 200m individual medley
after South Korean Cho Hee-Yeon snatched the day's opening
women's 200m butterfly.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Tomoko Hagiwara grabbed the women's 200m backstroke and
then its men's team triumphed in the 4x100m medley relay.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Shan Ying got the women's 50m freestyle before Hirano
won Japan's 15th gold.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, Malaysia, Chinese Taipei and Thailand took one
gold apiece from swimming.
</P>
<P>
In shooting, China showed its prowess by sweeping all four
golds on Saturday to boost its total haul to 18.
</P>
<P>
"We felt relieved because we have reached the target of winning
15 golds here," said Chinese head coach Zhang Heng.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women's record-breaking performance continued in
weightlifting as Wei Xaingying lifted 115kg en route to taking
the 75kg class.
</P>
<P>
Wei's lift bettered by 4.5kg the previous world mark of
111.5kg set by compatriot Zhao Na earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"I had never thought of world record because my lifts in
training were never over 111.5kg," said Wei.
</P>
<P>
Twelve world records have tumbled in the Games competition.
Ten were created by Chinese with the remaining two claimed by
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The day's other weightlifting gold went to Kazakhstan's Andrey
Makarov, who totalled 385kg in the men's 94kg class.
</P>
<P>
China beat arch rival South Korea 3-1 to add the table tennis
team gold to the title won by its women players.

and aggressive," said Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
In other team finals, China defeated Japan in the rhythmic
gymnastics, South Korea beat Japan in the men's tennis, Chinese
Taipei won the women's trios and men's team of five bowling,

silvers and four bronzes on Saturday, remained atop with a 70-47-30
record.
</P>
<P>
Japan, who hauled in three golds, four silvers and six bronzes,
kept its second position with a 26-30-38 book, while South Korea
was third with 23-18-27.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan was fourth with a 12-14-17, followed by Thailand

<HEADLINE> Japan Beats China in Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Masato Hirano romped home in
the men's 1,500m freestyle to seal a Japan's 15-13 win over China
in the gold hunt as the swimming competition ended here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old just proved too strong for all his rivals when
he easily won the gold in 15:22.20. Torlarp Sethsothorn of
Thailand settled for the silver in 15:40.17, with Hisham Masri
third in 15:51.60.
</P>
<P>
Hirano said that had it not been China's National Games, which
was held in October in 1997, Chinese swimmers would have won in
the battle against their Japanese opponents.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Chinese swimmers concentrated on their national
games and had little time to prepare for this Games. That is why
we took more gold medals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese swimming team leader Tsuyoshi Aoki was satisfied with
the win, but warned his proteges against complacency.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time for us to beat China in the pool in 12
years, it is very encouraging. But the Chinese young swimmers are
very strong, and still pose a very serious threat to us."
</P>
<P>
Aoki's Chinese counterpart Zhang Xiong did not take it as a
loss. "Though we got less golds, our swimmers set seven of the
eleven new Games record," he said.
</P>
<P>
But it was Cho Hee-Yeon who stole the show when she won the
first gold in the women's 200m butterfly on Saturday, also the
first gold for South Korea in the pool in the Games.
</P>
<P>
Cho, 15, who won two bronzes, finally struck gold to prove
South Korea's existence in the pool.
</P>
<P>
She overtook pacesetter Ai Ota of Japan in the 25-meter mark,
and led all the way powering home in 2:11.34. She was followed by
China's Ruan Yi in 2:12.51. Ota was third in 2:13.26.
</P>
<P>
"This is the happiest moment of my life, " Cho said after win.
</P>
<P>
The teenager felt she did not release all her energy in the
race. "I was not tired after the win, I think I could swim more in
the winning pace."
</P>
<P>
The gold medal war between China and Japan heated up when Xiong
Guoming won the following men's 200m individual medley gold medal,
which brought China's gold tally to 12, the same as Japan's.
</P>
<P>
After a shoulder-to-shoulder tussle with Jo Yoshimi of Japan,
Xiong Guoming broke clear in the freestyle leg and touched home by
leading almost a length.
</P>
<P>
His winning time of 2:03.34 shattered the Games records.
Yoshimi finished second in 2:04.93. And Xiong's teammate Xie
Xufeng came in third in 2:05.45.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, put down his comeback to his girlfriend:"I originally
didn't want to come to games, but my girlfriend encouraged me to
have a try." he said. "So I thought she counts half for my win."
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Xiong said he had gone through a lot of twists
and turns in the past two years, and looked forward to proving
himself in the Games.
</P>
<P>
"I never stopped training during that two years, I craved to
prove myself with a gold in the Games."
</P>
<P>
"I was very lonely that two years, " he said. "Loneliness is a
kind of pain, but longliness from pain is a kind of blessing."
</P>
<P>
After Xiong's win, Japan showed their determination to beat
China by winning the next two events of women's 200m backstroke
and men's 4x100m medley relay.
</P>
<P>
Tomoko Hagiwara achieved a backstroke double when she won the
200m event in 2:12.25. Then Japan's quartet in the men's 4x100m
medley relay followed Hagiwara to win the gold, beating their
Chinese rivals into second place.
</P>
<P>
Though Shan Ying won a gold for China in the women's 50m
freestyle to pull China's gold tally only one shy of the Japan's,
Hirano was just too superior in the last swimming event of the
Games.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM, Finance Minister Face Impeachment Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The opposition has submitted
an impeachment motion to the parliament against Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai and Finance Minister Tarrin Nimanhaeminda, accusing
them of defying the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Thai News Agency reported on Saturday that the opposition
accused the two men of violating the constitution by committing
Thailand to a loan package of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) without seeking the consent of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The government recently approved the sixth letter of intent to
the IMF, under which Thailand would receive 4.74 billion U.S.
dollars from the IMF after agreeing to conduct IMF-dictated
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The opposition claimed that Thailand would lost control of the
economy by allowing foreigners to buy much more local assets if
the economic reforms deepened.
</P>
<P>
After submitting the motion on Friday, opposition key figure
Sanoh Thianthong admitted that the opposition did not really
intend to succeed in the impeachment motion but wanted simply to
keep checking the administration.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the motion, Senate Speaker Meechai Richupan said he
would have the Counter Corruption Commission examine it and if it
was verified, the parliament would proceed with the motion.
</P>
<P>
To remove the premier and the finance minister through
impeachment requires at least three-fifths of the votes of both
senators and House members.

<P>
PARIS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 60 people were killed
in fighting between pro-independence forces and government forces
on the Comoran island of Anjouan over the past week, said French
officials on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The officials, on the neighboring island of Mayotte, said
shooting was heard Saturday morning in Anjouan, whose "capital"
Mutsamudu has been subjected to heavy looting and part of it has
been burnt down during the violence over the past week.
</P>
<P>
A French humanitarian medical team is expected to arrive in
Anjouan Saturday afternoon by boat from Mayotte.
</P>
<P>
France is also expelling some 50 refugees who fled Anjouan to
Mayotte, sending them to the Federal Islamic Republic of Comoros,
which lies in the Indian Ocean between Madagascar and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Separatists in Anjouan declared independence unilaterally from
Comoros in August 1997.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Change in Palestinian Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi here on Saturday condemned recent decision by senior
Palestinian leadership to revise the its National Charter.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a Lebanese delegation, Kharrazi termed the
Palestinian decision to cancel anti-Israeli provisions in the
charter as "a humiliation to the Palestinian nation," the official
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He called for the continuation of Lebanese Islamic resistance
against Israel, adding that all Muslim countries have the duty to
defend the Palestinian nation.
</P>
<P>
The senior leaders in the Palestinian National Council on
Thursday met in Gaza to reaffirm the nullification of the clauses
in their national covenant calling for Israel's destruction, as
required in the latest Israeli-Palestinian accord.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi also
condemned the Palestinian decision, saying it would further
encourage the expansionist policies of Israel in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Such moves can not, as was witnessed over recent years, settle
the Palestinian issue and restore the Palestinian nation's
historical rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
The "humiliating" decision runs counter to the struggle of the
Palestinian nation, and the repeated retreats by the Palestinian
National Authority facilitate Israeli attempts to consolidate its
illegitimate rule over Palestine, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also charged the United States of pressuring the
Palestinians to submit to the Israeli demand for revising the
Palestinian National Charter.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Restraint in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders on
Saturday appealed to Israelis and Palestinians to refrain from
violence for the sake of confidence building.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders, who are here attending their annual summit,
called on both sides "to show restraint and to implement fully, in
time and in good faith, the remaining provisions (of the Wye River
peace accord) and thereby contribute to the rebuilding of the
confidence essential to the completion of the peace process".
</P>
<P>
They deplored the recent violence on the West Bank and mutual
recrimination between the two sides that threatened to unravel the
fragile peace process and to undermine the peace-for-security deal
reached in October.
</P>
<P>
The deal commits Israel to withdrawing from a further 13
percent of its occupied territory in the West Bank over three
months in exchange for security measures by the Palestinian
Authority and a renewed renunciation of the PLO Charter clauses
that call for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Israel also agreed to release 750 Palestinian
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
After releasing 250 Palestinian detainees, Israel said it would
not free those political prisoners, who, it said, have Israeli
"blood on their hands".
</P>
<P>
Israel's refusal to release more Palestinian prisoners led to
an upsurge of violence between Palestinian protesters and Israeli
soldiers on the West Bank, which has resulted in the deaths of
four Palestinians and plunged the peace process into another
standstill.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed this week to
use an iron fist to put down the protests and has suspended a
further troop withdrawal from the West Bank scheduled for next
week under the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that EU countries had been urging privately
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to risk blowing the peace
process by declaring sovereignty as soon as the interim period set
by the 1993 Oslo peace accord expires on May 4 next year.
</P>
<P>
They added that any premature declaration might give Israel
grounds for scrapping the Oslo agreement.

JINAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Israeli cooperative farm
has gone into operation in the city of Weifang in east China's
Shandong Province as the country's first pilot commercial farm.
</P>
<P>
The 4.25-million U.S. dollar, 63-hectare farm is the product of
a local agricultural school and an Israeli company, and is the
second joint agricultural project for China and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The farm uses equipment imported from Israel to grow flowers,
vegetables, fruits, and seedlings and vegetable dehydration
facilities, and produce flowers for decorative use. The majority
of its products will be exported to west Europe.
</P>
<P>
Its flower output is expected to be 10 times that of local
traditional greenhouses, with the amount of vegetables four times
the greenhouse figure.
</P>
<P>
The farm is expected to generate 2.73 million U.S. dollars
worth of output annually.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Urged to Make United Efforts for Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Saturday predicted an economically difficult new year for
Kenyans when the nation marked its 35th year of independence.
</P>
<P>
Despite "remarkable progress" made in 1998, "Kenya's economy
will continue to experience difficulties in the coming year," Moi
told thousands of Kenyans at the end of a grand celebration in
Nyayo Stadium, Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"The damage to our roads caused by the El Nino rains have been
a major setback to the growth of our economy," said Moi.
</P>
<P>
Due to government efforts, he said, interest rates have
declined to their lowest level in three years, the governmental
deficit is on a downward course and the unrest caused by general
elections held at the end of 1997 are now settling down.
</P>
<P>
However, "economic recovery is a slow and painstaking
process," he noted, adding that his government will continue with
its tight policies to control public spendings and transit cargo,
crack down on cheap imports and improve revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
"It is through the joint effort of all Kenyans that we will
succeed in building a strong economy, create more job
opportunities for our people and reduce the painful effects of
poverty in our society," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The major attraction of the celebration was demonstration
flights by Kenyan air force, traditional dances and choir
performances at the Nyayo National Stadium.

SHENYANG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred people
gathered today at the former residence of General Zhang Xueliang
in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province in northeast China,
to commemorate the Xi'an Incident of 1936.

the Chinese victory in the War of Resistance against Japanese
Aggression (1937-1945).

WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Following are the major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- After a passionate debate that was by turns solemn with
history, fiercely partisan and sometimes sorrowful, the U.S. House
of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted along party lines on
Friday to impeach President Bill Clinton and remove him from
office for perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
-- A Thai Airways jetliner carrying 146 people on a domestic
flight crashed into a swamp in southern Thailand Friday night as
it tried to land in a rainstorm. At least 50 of the 146 people on
the flight survived the crash.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton's dramatic apology and public
appeal for congressional "condemnation" on Friday reflected
deepening concerns among his allies about his prospects for
avoiding impeachment next week and their fears that a compromise
resolution to censure the president may never reach the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
-- Former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet sternly told a London
court at his first appearance in public since his arrest two
months ago that he did not acknowledge the right of any court
outside his own country to consider charges against him.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Satisfied With Outcome of PM's Visit to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan expressed its
satisfaction on Saturday with the outcome of Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif's recent visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing on the five-day visit starting from
December 1, Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed said "we had good
reason to be satisfied with the outcome of the visit. It has
resulted in a better U.S. understanding of our security concerns."
</P>
<P>
He said the main purpose of the visit was to secure a better
U.S. understanding of Pakistan's vital concerns particularly those
involving its security.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, its objectives have been fulfilled," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said the U.S. has publicly acknowledged
the need for an early resolution of the Kashmir dispute in
accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people and is ready to
lend its assistance to India and Pakistan for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has also acknowledged the need to move quickly to a
sanction free U.S.-Pakistan relationship, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to move towards this goal the ongoing U.S.-Pakistan
dialogue on security and non-proliferation will continue, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"What is most important is that the two countries have decided
to work together for a strong and more broad-based relationship
between them," the foreign secretary noted.
</P>
<P>
While meeting Sharif, U.S. President Bill Clinton reaffirmed
the United States' strong interest in a stable and prosperous
Pakistan and reiterated the United States' commitment to assist
Pakistan through its current economic difficulties, Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. now acknowledged the Kashmir problem as a root-cause
of all tensions and conflicts and indeed a threat to peace,
stability and non-proliferation in South Asia," he said, adding
the U.S. president indicated that he was keen to play an active
role in the resolution of the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said "the U.S. president gave an assurance that his
administration would continue to examine ways of furthering a
peace process."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign secretary said that "on our part, we
have been keen to renew our relations with the U.S. on the basis
of shared values and goals. We wish to develop a mutually
beneficial partnership for peace and development."
</P>
<P>
"We believe the interests of Pakistan and the United States as
well as of the peoples of our region can only be served in an
environment of cooperation and not coercion," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said "we shall continue to seek the effective engagement of
the major powers, especially the U.S., in facilitating a just and
lasting settlement of the Kashmir dispute."
</P>
<P>
"While maintaining a minimum credible nuclear deterrence, we
seek to promote nuclear restraint and stabilization and prevent an
arms race in our region," Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "we are prepared to enter into mutually
acceptable and verifiable confidence building measures with India
in nuclear and conventional fields."
</P>
<P>
On the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Shamshad said "our
adherence to the treaty shall take place only in an atmosphere
free of coercion and pressure."
</P>
<P>
He said "we also expected equality of treatment with India
whether in terms of status or incentives."
</P>
<P>
"Our stand is clear, unequivocal and consistent with our
security interests. We are not creating conditionalities but we
cannot also ignore the imperatives of our life and existence, our
dignity and our sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Fissile Material Treaty, the foreign secretary said
Pakistan has already agreed to participate in negotiations in the
Commission on Disarmament in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"Our participation in these negotiations will be constructive
and consistent with our legitimate security interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we remain committed not to transfer sensitive
equipment or technology to third countries or entities."
</P>
<P>
"We also are ready to enter into a mutually acceptable and
verifiable strategic restraint regime with India," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clan Fighting Resumed in Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Reports from the southern
Somalia's port town of Kismajo said Saturday that fighting has
again resumed between the Majerten dominated militiamen loyal to
General Mohamed Saeed Hersi Morgan and those of the Somali
National Front (SNF) led by General Ahmed Warsameh of Marehan
clan.
</P>
<P>
At least 19 people have been reportedly killed and more than
30 others wounded when the armed clashes escalated Saturday
morning on the outskirts of the town after five weeks of relative
calmness in the area.
</P>
<P>
A VHF radio owner in the area said the shelling began early
Friday evening, but the ground offensive flared up Saturday
morning at about 9:OO a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Jama Howleh, a spokesman for the Marehan clan here in
Mogadishu, said his forces have been provoked by the other side.
He claimed that his forces have captured three battle wagons and
neutralized one more from the other side.
</P>
<P>
Howleh also claimed that 21 war prisoners have been captured
from General Morgan's side with over 80 assault rifles.
</P>

The ground offensive which continued until mid-day Saturday
has left the Marehan militiamen outside the town of Kismaio. All
business and commercial centers have been closed Saturday where
the stray rounds of various weapons including the mortar rounds
have been reaching the heart of the town during the early hours
of heavy shelling.

<HEADLINE> Modern "Revolution" Sweeps Desert Village in Xinjiang(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 20 years ago, "revolution"
was a most prefered and fashionable political word in China. Yet
it is still on the lips of the farmers of the Yatonggusi Village
in the Taklamakan Desert of Northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, but in another sense.
</P>
<P>
"The folks think 'englav' ("revolution" in Uygur language) is
the best word to describe the tremendous changes that have taken
place in the village over the past 20 years," said Monlek Kork,
the 46-year-old village head.
</P>
<P>
Located some 90 kilometers from the edge of the desert, people
of this village, widely known as an "isolated island in the sea of
the desert," led an impoverished life until the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Now, per-capita livestock in the village stands at 30 head, and
per capita arable land has reached 0.67 hectares, much higher than
the national average. Of the 78 village households, over 30
have bank savings exceeding 30,000 yuan (3,614 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Monlek, who was chosen village leader through a direct
election, said that the village has, over the past 20 years, been
swept by at least eight "revolutions" to achieve today's economic
level.
</P>
<P>
The "lighting revolution," "furniture revolution," "garment
revolution," and "housing revolution", etc, have brought a pretty
comfortable life to the farmers. But the most important of all is
the "agriculture revolution," said Monlek.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, manual laborers and plows and horses were used to
grow wheat and maize, with a per mu (15 mu equals one hectare)
output as low as 30 kg.
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of the first tractor at the village in 1980,
the "revolutionary" method of deep-plowing was soon made
possible.

<HEADLINE> Modern "Revolution" Sweeps Desert Village in Xinjiang (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The village began to grow cotton more profitably in 1991, and
cotton output is expected to reach 100 tons this year.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the tractor also brought about a "transportation
revolution," reducing the period of time needed to travel to the
county from seven days to three.
</P>
<P>
After a desert highway was opened to traffic in 1995, the
farmers could take a regular bus ride to get to the county. But
because the village is separated from the highway by a distance of
18 km and seven huge sand dunes, they still have to ride a horse
or a camel to reach the road.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "transportation revolution" triggered a
"business revolution." Before the existence of the highway, there
was only one store in the village selling daily necessities, at
prices 700 percent higher than in the county seat.
</P>
<P>
Now there are six stores where these items are sold only
slightly above county prices.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the arrival of the first television in 1995 brought
about an "information revolution." At that time, the entire
village joyfully watched the one television together, though only
a few could understand the only channel, which broadcast in
the Chinese or Han language.
</P>
<P>
Now, over half the village families have TV sets, and they can
receive five channels in the Chinese language and five others in
the Uygur language.
</P>
<P>
"Now our horizon is wide open. We can follow our state and
autonomous regional leaders wherever they go," one villager said.
</P>
<P>
"The television has also helped enhanced our awareness of law,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, a farmer filed a lawsuit against
a business partner in north China's Hebei Province, and won his
case.

</P>
<P>
The official said that so far clay objects, including a unique
"cup of dialogue among civilizations," have been unearthed in the

meeting point for the provinces of Kerman, Sistan-Baluchestan and

<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Wei, Chinese 100 meters
national record holder, was plagued with an pulled muscle in his
right leg and could give up the most eye-catching race of the
Asian Games, his coach Long Jinbiao said.
</P>
<P>
"The injury was sustained early in November at a warm-up
competition in Bangkok and it has affected his training in the
past weeks," Long said.
</P>
<P>
Long said Zhou is not feeling pain in the leg but the injury
had exerted some mental pressure on him.
</P>
<P>
"He will try to use all strength in the 100m heat tommorrow,"
Long said. "If he cannot tolerate the pain, we will think about
giving up the efforts of winning the gold and focus on the 4x100m
relay."
</P>
<P>
Zhou won the Asian Athletics Championships against a head wind
in Japan last August with a time of 10.39.
</P>
<P>
But his personal best of 10.17 was far behind Japanese Koji
Ito's Asian record-equalling time of 10.08, which was clocked last
October.
</P>
<P>
Koji Ito is the hot favorite to win the 100m sprint final which
will take place on Monday.

PARIS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A Frenchman held hostage in the
Russian republic of Chechnya for 10 months was released by his
kidnappers and is due to arrive in Geneva on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old man, Vincent Cochetel, was a humanitarian
worker for the Geneva-based United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees.
</P>
<P>
He was kidnapped on January 29 in Vladikavkaz, capital of North
Ossetia, and was believed to have been kept in captivity in
neighboring Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who was in Geneva
attending an European Union summit, called Cochetel after he
arrived at the French embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac called on Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to help bring about Cochetel's release during a telephone

<P>
ABUJA (Nigeria), December 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian authorities
have started rebuilding the parade ground in the capital Abuja,
preparing for the military's handover ceremony to a civilian
president in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
A source within the presidency told Xinhua Saturday that the
parade ground in downtown Abuja would be renamed "Unity Square"
upon completion of the reconstruction work.
</P>
<P>
The multi-million Naira (one U.S. Dollar equals to 85 Naira)
work was started about a fortnight ago and is handled by Julius
Berger, a major construction firm in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"My responsibility is to ensure that the job is consistent
with the agreement signed with the government and that it is
delivered on time," a company official said.
</P>
<P>
The parade ground has been used in the past for various
occasions, including Independence Day celebrations and the
farewell ceremony for former military ruler General Ibrahim
Babangida, who stepped aside in August 1993 in the heat of the
controversy over the annulled elections on June 12 that year.
</P>
<P>
According to the transition to civil rule program announced by
military leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar, the present
government would hand over the power to an elected civilian
president on May 29, next year.
</P>
<P>
The coming civilian president would be the first in Nigeria
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
As part of the transition program, the government has had nine
political parties registered and a local government election was
held last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election is scheduled for March next year.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Meets With Korean Political Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, met today met with a delegation
from the National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) from the
Republic of Korea (ROK) led by Yang Sung Chul.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and the Chinese government place great importance to
Sino-ROK ties, Wei said, and the two countries have developed
rapidly politics and the economy, after forging diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Wei mentioned President Kim Dae Jung's recent successful visit
to China, where he and President Jiang Zemin set up a framework
for 21st century development of bilateral ties, and said that he
believes that the good-neighborly, friendly, and cooperative
relations will continue to develop with joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the CPC will continue to develop friendly
and cooperative relations with all ROK political parties on the
basis of independence, full equality, mutual respect, and
non-interference in the other's internal affairs and that this
could contribute to the 21st-century China-ROK cooperative
partnership.
</P>
<P>
Yang attributed the rapid growth of bilateral ties to the
proximity of the two countries and friendly exchanges between
their people in the past. He said he believes that bilateral
cooperation will be better still than ever in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP places importance on its ties with the CPC, a leader
of 1.2 billion Chinese people, Yang said, and he hopes the two
parties can push forward the development of state-to-state and
people-to-people relations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Loses Opener in Asiad Water Polo Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China lost its opener in the
water polo competition here on Saturday but the referees were to
be blamed most at the 13th Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"How can we compete in such a condition when three of our
attacks were ruled against and three of our players were ruled out
of the water with a penalty awarded to our rival, all in the first
period," said Chinese coach Peng Zhaorong.
</P>
<P>
"It's sheer rididule that our players were always to be blamed
wherever a foul was committed in front of either goalmouthes, and
we usually had to sacrifice one player whenever we scored," Peng
said.
</P>
<P>
Out of the favor of both Kazakhstan and Kuwaiti referees, China
lost to Uzbekistan 7-10 in Pool B despite its protests on the spot
two times.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan established its lead 3-0 in the first period, a
winning cushion against China eventually, with its center Sergei
Voronin scoring six goals alone in four periods.
</P>
<P>
"These referees were clearly biased against us by ruling off
our last goal which actually flew over the goaline," said the
Chinese coach.
</P>
<P>
The unsportsmanship ruling of the referees was jeered by a
on-looking Japanese coach and the athletes from Singapore and Hong
Kong, China as well as the audience who even resorted to cans of
soft drinks to express their angry, which interrupted the game for
a while.
</P>
<P>
Both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are republics of former Soviet
Union, "it looks like elder brother sits on the refereeing chair
to look after his younger brother in the game," Peng said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese coach acknowledged that his players were affected
much by such a ruling, saying "how can they remain calm under the
circumstances?"
</P>
<P>
Prior to the game, China even did not classify Uzbekistan as
obstacles to its goal of winning the gold, only Kazakhstan, Japan
and Iran were rated as major rivals.
</P>
<P>
"Nowsdays, we have no way to go but to fight for each of the
following games" as the premilinaries were be accounted in the
finals, said the Chinese coach.
</P>
<P>
In other games of the day, Kazakhstan routed Singapore 16-1 in
Group A while Japan outscored Iran 8-7 in Group C.
</P>
<P>
The water polo competitions were started on Friday when Japan
whitewashed Kuwait 31-1 in Group C, Uzbekistan nipped Hong Kong,
China 27-3 in Group B and Singapore defeated Thailand 8-4 in Group
A.

<HEADLINE> Usha Dreams of Gold at Her Fifth Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- India's sprint queen P. T.
Usha, 39, said she still has the chance to win a gold medal in her
fifth Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Usha, who dominated the sprint races in the early 1980s, will
take part in four events including 100 and 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
"I will try to win a gold," said the mother of a six-year-old
boy.
</P>
<P>
The Indian, who returned to the track in 1993 after a lay-off
of three years, showed her best performace during the 1990s in the
Asian Athletics Championships last August, winning a bronze in the
200m and sealed a gold for India in the 4x100m relay.
</P>
<P>
Usha who will also competed in the 4x100 and 4x400 relays, said
she will leave the track for ever should she fails to achieve
satisfying results.
</P>
<P>
"If I cannot get good results, this will be the last
competition," she told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Asked why she is still running at such an age, Usha said: "I
love athletics in my blood."
</P>
<P>
J. S. Bhatia, Usha's coach since 1995, declined to predict
whether Usha can win a gold or not, but he believed she can run a
faster time in the 200m than 23.27 seconds clocked in the Asian
Championships.
</P>
<P>
"She has just recovered from a leg injury sustained in the
national championships last month," Bhatia said. "She is in a
better shape than in the Asian Championships."
</P>
<P>
Bhatia also said that Usha will retire if she fails to run good
time.
</P>
<P>
"She had to train at the camp far from home," Bhatia said. "She
always misses her son and husband. This might be the last time for
her to compete in an international meet."

<HEADLINE> 69 Percent of Mozambicans Below Poverty Line: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A survey published here
Saturday by the Noticias newspaper said 69 percent of the
population in Mozambique, or more than two thirds, are living
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the government on 8,274 urban and
rural families throughout the country. The result shows that
71.3 percent of those surveyed from the rural areas and 62
percent from cities are in poverty.
</P>
<P>
A total of 80 percent of Mozambique's 17 million population
are living in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, an average family of six has only 2.4
hectares of arable land.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that only nine percent of Mozambicans
own some kind of farm tools, seven percent are able to use
machines in farming, two percent make use of fertilizer and
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
The very low level of production skills has hampered
productivity, resulting in poor returns on the part of farmers.
Mozambique is thus one of the countries with the least per capita
income in the world.
</P>
<P>
The survey calls for more government efforts to eliminate
poverty in the southern Africa country, which include enhancing
management of natural resources, increasing output of economic
crops such as sugar, and spreading agricultural technology.

<HEADLINE> Canada, Japan Win Golds in World Cup speedskating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Olympic gold medalist Catriona
Lemay Doan of Canada and Hiroyasu Shimizu of Japan took the gold
medals Saturday in the Nagano World Cup speedskating tournament.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Lemay Doan won the women's 500m and 1,000m titles
while world-record holder and Olympic champion Shimizu claimed a
gold in the 500 meters before a capacity crowd of 5,500 at the
M-Wave Arena.
</P>
<P>
Jan Bos of the Netherlands, Olympic silver medalist, won the
fourth gold at stake for the men's 1,000m.
</P>
<P>
In all, Canada and Japan bagged four medals each, while Bos
also won the bronze in the 500 meters. The United States, Germany
and Russia each had a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
The two-day competition is the first of five sprint
speedskating World Cups scheduled for the 1998-1999 season.
</P>
<P>
The first two of another five speedskating World Cups for
1,500 meters and longer distances were held in Europe last month.
</P>
<P>
Lemay Doan won the 500 meters in 38.67 seconds, or 0.50 second
faster than second-place Eriko Sanmiya of Japan. Svetlana Zhurova
of Russia was third in 39.19 seconds.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, the 27-year-old Canadian triumphed in the
1,000 meters with a time of 1:18.07, again ahead of Sanmiya, this
time with a margin of 0.42 second.
</P>
<P>
Shimizu, the first Japanese ever to win a speedskating gold,
overcame his shaky physical condition to outrace Jeremy
Wotherspoon in 35.40, or 0.64 seconds faster than the
second-place Canadian.
</P>
<P>
Shimizu set his world record of 34.82 at a world championship

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Budget Row Threatens EU Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- European Union leaders are
working themselves into a divisive argument over how the EU raises
and spends its money and fear the rift could plunge the bloc into
a confidence crisis.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, meeting at their year-end summit, tried to mend a
north-south feud over the 2000-2006 spending plan, but the
bickering remained as bitter, if not more so, than before the
two-day council got underway.
</P>
<P>
On one side of the rift are the rich countries of the 15-nation
group led by Germany, France and Britain. On the other are the
poorer countries headed by Spain, Portugal and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The rich nations, also including the Netherlands, Sweden and
Austria, have called for a freeze on EU spending to pay for the
proposed enlargement that is reckoned to cost upwards of 50
billion U.S. dollars, whereas the poorer nations are urging higher
outlays for the existing EU members with below-average wealth.
</P>
<P>
The only acceptable proposal to both sides now is the spending
ceiling put forward by the European Commission, the executive body
of the union.
</P>
<P>
The proposal includes a contributions ceiling of 1.27 percent
of combined EU gross domestic product, although Spain would like
the limit to be exceeded.
</P>
<P>
The EU now has an annual budget of 86 billion ECU (100 billion
dollars), of which more than half goes to farmers in subsidies and
another third to poorer regions as support payments.
</P>
<P>
Spain, Portugal and Greece have described as "vital" the
support payments from the EU's cohesion fund.
</P>
<P>
Joining the poorer Mediterranean EU states for what seems to be
a fixed budget are Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Cyprus,
Slovenia and Estonia -- the six countries that have already
started formal entry negotiations for union membership.
</P>
<P>
And to further complicate matters, Germany, hitherto the
largest net contributor toward the EU budget, has also put its
finger on the pie by demanding a rebate.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made it clear that his
country can no longer be the "milk cow" of the union and that the
EU budget must be reformed. Germany pays 22 billion marks (13
billion dollars) each year to the EU budget.
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Schroeder, elected federal chancellor in September,
wants to use the first half of next year when Germany holds the EU
rotating presidency to push for reforms of the financial system.
</P>
<P>
Germany is pointing to Britain for a precedent, recalling that
former prime minister Margaret Thatcher obtained a large rebate of
two billion pounds (3.3 billion dollars) each year from its
contribution to EU coffers.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Jacques Santer warned the EU
leaders at the Vienna summit that failure to conclude the reform
package would "bring about a prolonged period of uncertainty and
crisis" and would send a "doubly disastrous message" to the 11
countries applying for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Though the EU leaders failed to achieve much in Vienna, they
managed to reaffirm next March as the deadline for completion of
the conclusion of the reform package, better known as the Agenda
2000.
</P>
<P>
But the tensions will not easily be waylaid as the spending and
financing row seems set to shadow the reform negotiations which
will be a daunting challenge to Germany that has to double as both
the architect of the new EU financing system and guardian of its
own interests.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders made a profound gesture at the summit when they
awarded former German chancellor Helmut Kohl an honorary
citizenship of Europe for his contribution toward European unity.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, in his turn, urged the EU leaders to keep in mind the
bigger vision of European integration and not to be tripped up in
the process by over-concentration on money and national
interests.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Enter Into Fuel Market in Namibia And </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan National Fuel
Corporation (Sonangol) has decided to expand its fuel supplies to
Namibia and South Africa starting from next year.
</P>
<P>
According to a Sonangol document available here Saturday, the
corporation is conducting research on the prices and transport
market in Namibia and South Africa in a bid to start setting up
filling stations and marketing branches to sell gas, disel and
lubricants.
</P>
<P>
The Sonangol has invested over 500,000 Dollars this year to
repair the fuel storage tanks in Namibe Province near Namibia to
ensure future supply to the new markets.
</P>
<P>
Sonangol intends to increase its storage capacity gradually
and to transform the previous Tombua fishing harbor into a port
for large oil tankers.
</P>
<P>
Angola is the second largest oil-producing country in Africa,
second only to Nigeria, with a daily crude output of 735,000
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Sonangol is a national monopoly of oil production and fuel
marketing. Last year, its crude export registered 270,000
barrels daily, which accounts for 40.7 percent of the country's
total oil export.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers Discuss Hanoi Declaration to Prepare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN foreign ministers finished
their one-day meeting here Saturday afternoon after discussing the
drafts of three documents that will guide the nine-member regional
grouping into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Foreign Minister
Nguyen Manh Cam of Vietnam, which is hosting the meeting and the
Sixth ASEAN Summit, said the ministers discussed the drafts of the
Hanoi Declaration, the Hanoi Plan of Action to implement the ASEAN
Vision 2020 and a report on the achievements the ASEAN has made
since the last summit in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to Cam, the ministers agreed to all the three draft
documents which are to be submitted to the ASEAN summit scheduled
for next week for consideration and adoption.
</P>
<P>
He said the Hanoi Declaration focused on ASEAN cooperation in
various areas to overcome difficulty and achieve sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperation has to be strengthened in a comprehensive manner,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Cam described the discussion among the foreign ministers as a
demonstration of unity among members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
On the Hanoi Plan of Action, the Vietnamese foreign minister
said it will provide guidance to ASEAN members for the
implementation of the ASEAN Vision 2020 from now to the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
Also discussed were measures to strengthening cooperation among
ASEAN countries and between the ASEAN and other countries for
economic recovery and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Cam said the Hanoi Declaration and the Hanoi Plan of Action
"will serve as a message that the ASEAN is sending to the outside
world about its commitments, its forward-looking, future-oriented
approach. The message is also that in spite of the present
difficulties, ASEAN member countries are self-confident and
confident in the future of their development."
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN region, which used to be one of the fastest-growing
areas in the world, was struck by a financial crisis and some
countries such as Indonesia and Thailand had to seek outside
assistance in overcoming their economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
On the question of Cambodia joining the ASEAN, Cam said the
ministers also talked about this issue, but no consensus emerged.
He added that while most countries were of the view that it is
time to admit Cambodia before the coming summit, others believed
that Cambodia should wait for more time to see how stable the
situation in the country will be.
</P>
<P>
He said the question will be referred to the heads of state and
government at their summit, but Vietnam wants to see Cambodia
become a member now. "This is time the ASEAN should be ASEAN 10"
as envisaged by the founding fathers 30 years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, Thai Deputy Prime Minister and
Commerce Minister Supachai Panitechpakdi described the discussion
among ASEAN economic ministers, who also met here Saturday, on the
Hanoi Plan of Action as "very productive."
</P>
<P>
The plan of action is for implementing the ASEAN Vision 2020,
which foresees the ASEAN as "a concert of Southeast Asian nations,
onward looking, living in peace, stability and prosperity, bonded
together in partnership in dynamic development and in a community
of caring societies" in year 2020.
</P>
<P>
Supachai called the plan of action "a blueprint for all of us
into the future because it's a step forward from the Vision 2020,"
which was adopted by ASEAN leaders at their informal summit in
Kuala Lumpur last year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign and economic ministers are scheduled to hold a
joint meeting Sunday before the heads of state and government from
the nine member countries -- Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- meet
on December 15 and 16.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Coaches behind Thailand's Shooting Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign coaches are behind
Thailand's sudden rise in the Asian Games shooting competitions,
said team manager Boriboon Vuthiphakdi.
</P>
<P>
"The coaches from Ukraine are instrumental to our success,"
said Boriboon, whose team had won three gold medals up to
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Although that number appeared of little significance when
compared to China's 18, it surpassed that of the whole Thai
delegation at last Games in Hiroshima, Japan.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented move to gather 30 shooters in a 10-month
training camp, including two months in the southern Rayong region,
was also a factor in the formula of success.
</P>
<P>
Another reason, Boriboon said, was the increase of daily
training budget to 450 bahts (about 13 U.S. dollars) per shooter
from the previous 250 baht (7 dollars), remarkable when the
financial crisis is affecting the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The easy-going attitude before the Games also helped, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We exerted no pressure on the players and told them we were
expecting only one gold medal from the women's air rifle team,"
said Boriboon.

<HEADLINE> Record Amount of Cocaine Seized at HK Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Customs Spokesman said here
Saturday that Customs officers last Saturday (December 5) made a
record seizure of 156 kilograms of cocaine worth about 180 million
HK dollars (23 million U.S. dollars) at the Hong Kong
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The seizure was found concealed inside an aircraft tire among
the supply items of a cargo aircraft under maintenance, said a
spokesman for the Customs and Excise Department Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an operation conducted at the maintenance area at the
airport late last month, Customs officers inspected the supply
items, including aircraft tires, spare parts and tools, of the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Suspicion was established when a tire was found unusually heavy
and without safety certificate, the spokesman said. Examination by
a hi-tech equipment, the ion scanner, suggested the presence of
cocaine inside the tire, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The tire was eventually dismantled last Saturday. As a result,
we discovered a total of 144 slabs of cocaine, weighing about 156
kilograms, concealed inside the tire," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Follow-up investigations by Customs found that the cargo plane
had stopped at various cities in Europe, South America and North
America before arriving Hong Kong for maintenance inspection late
last month.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the drug is not intended for the local market
as cocaine has a very small market in Hong Kong," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers have contacted their counterparts overseas to
trace the source and destination of the drug consignment.
Investigations are continuing in a bid to track down the
syndicate.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR's Prosperity, Stability Enhanced with a Better Police: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The crime rate in Hong Kong
has been on a downward trend in the past two years and law and
order has been stable, partly attributable to the continuous
improvements in the police force, a senior police officer said
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Police Recruitment Day,
Tsang Yam-pui, deputy commissioner of police, said that in order
to live up to the reputation of "Asia's Finest," the police had
been upgrading their equipment and adopting top science
technology.
</P>
<P>
Tsang pointed out that after the implementation of a
large-scale information network system last year, different
formations in the police had become fully computerized, ranging
from administration to crime detection.
</P>
<P>
To continue development in the next century, the police had
employed consultants and worked together with three local
universities to study future computer strategy and computerized
communication system respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the plans is to equip front-line patrolling officers
with palm-top computers so that they can handle reports from the
public, process and check relevant data at the scene. The public
will be better served and the efficiency of the force will be
greatly enhanced.
</P>
<P>
"We have been cultivating a 'service-oriented' culture within
the force in the past two years with an aim to further upgrading
the quality of service," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "To attain a high standard of professionalism in
formulating future development strategies, planning various
improvement projects and managing on a daily basis, we invest
heavily on personnel training, with a view to equipping senior
officers with professional management knowledge and widening their
horizons so that they can lead the force into the new era."
</P>
<P>
The Police Recruitment Day was organized with an aim to
introducing the different aspects of police work to visitors so
that they could have a better understanding of the force.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Vows to Save PAL "At All Costs" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has vowed to save Philippine Airlines (PAL) at all costs
because the airline's closure would affect business of the
country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters here Friday night, Estrada said
that it is his duty as president to save PAL because all
businesses will suffer once the country's flag carrier closes
down.
</P>
<P>
"We'll, I would say that at all costs we will save PAL because
it is the flag carrier of the Philippines. It is the first
commercial airline of Asia. So at all costs we will save
Philippine Airlines," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the President said he will let the PAL management choose
the airline's strategic partner.
</P>
<P>
Estrada reiterated his position Saturday morning that he is
still hopeful PAL can clinch a deal with Hong Kong-based Cathay
Pacific Airways.
</P>
<P>
"We are not losing hope on Cathay because we know PAL means a
lot not only to big business but to the common farmers and
fishfolk as well," he said in a weekly radio program.
</P>
<P>
Citing claims by PAL that the airline is losing 21 million
pesos (500,000 U.S. dollars) a day, Estrada said the airline
suffered from over-staffing and the "open skies" policy adopted by
the previous administration, which allowed foreign airlines to
compete with PAL in domestic routes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Dual Olympic table tennis
champion Liu Guoliang, who lost in China's 3-1 team final victory
over South Korea on Saturday, said he was ready for tough battles
in the individual competitions.
</P>
<P>
"I could hardly find my accuracy in the team final," said
Liu, whose loss to Kim Taek Soo was the third in as many months.
</P>
<P>
"Because of my poor form and nagging back problems, I might
suffer an early exit in singles. But I will try to bring out the
best of me," he added.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who had won most of his encounters with Kim, twice fell
victim to the tenacious South Korean before the Games.
</P>
<P>
"Kim is the most dangerous rival to Chinese," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Liu said players from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
were difficult to deal with too.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fast-attacker will take on DPR Korean Kim Song-Hui
in the early stages.
</P>
<P>
"Kim will be the first obstacle in my singles run," Liu said.
"I will be very careful."
</P>
<P>
If the competition goes as seeding, Liu will meet Japanese
Iseki Seiko in the semifinals, the former Chinese who led his
adopted country to extend China to five sets in Friday's team
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Seiko, whose Chinese name is Wei Qingguang and who had won a
doubles gold for China in the 1988 Olympic Games, had beaten Liu
in the Asian championships in October.
</P>
<P>
"I lost to him because of overconfidence," Liu said. "Now I
am on the alert."

TOKYO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's two opposition parties,
mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and some anti-nuclear groups
gathered Saturday to protest against the United States for its
subcritical nuclear test Friday.

The New Komeito party, in a statement, criticized the fifth

The party urged the government to demand both the U.S. and
Russia, which also conducted a subcritical test Tuesday, to cancel
their plans for more nuclear tests in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Communist Party (JCP), another opposition party,
also condemned the U.S. and Russian tests, pressing the government
to protest such tests from Japan's position as the sole victim of
a nuclear attack.
</P>

Meanwhile, mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, two cities which
were hit by U.S. atomic bombs at the end of World War II, sent
letters to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to protest the test.

The Japan Council Against A and H Bombs, a local anti-nuclear
groups, also sent a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton calling

<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran scored a come-from-behind
win of 2-1 over China in a crucial match at the Asiad football
tournament here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, which had two wins in the second round and
virtually ensured a berth in the quarter-finals, started strongly
and got awarded at the 9th minute when Li Jinyu beat the charging
out Iranian goal-keeper with a left-footer.
</P>
<P>
But the Iranian team would not give up as only a win could keep
them in contention for the other qualifying ticket from the group.
</P>
<P>
Enjoying a domination of the midfield, the Iranian team kept a
constant pressure on the Chinese defence line. They outshot their
Chinese counterparts and levelled the score at the 16th minute
when Karim Bagheri powered home a long-distance shot.
</P>
<P>
Only three minutes later, the Iranian team surged 2-1 ahead,
this time with a header from their star forward Ali Daei.
</P>
<P>
The second half saw a even fierce battle. The Chinese team
made several substitutions but failed to get an equaliser.
</P>
<P>
The 2-1 victory was not enough to put the Iranian on top of the
group as the Chinese team had a better goal difference.
</P>
<P>
Iran now rank second in the group. Their fate will be decided
by the group's another match between Oman and Tajikstan.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said Saturday that the country's constitution should not
be seen as "a dogma," but any amendments should be contemplated
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation on the Constitution Day, Yeltsin said
the Fundamental Law should be brought into line with new
conditions, but any amendments should be introduced "with great
caution."
</P>
<P>
"All citizens must read their country's constitution at least
once in order to learn the system of the country they live in,"
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia, an immense country, must have powerful supreme
authorities. Without such authorities we will not be able to deal
with the acute problems Russia is facing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But even when being tough and resolute, the authorities must
follow the letter and the spirit of the constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only when relying on the constitution is it possible to erect
a solid barrier against extremism, to preserve the free market
and to maintain Russia's integrity," he added.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Sacks Board of Two Indian Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
announced late Friday night to sack the entire board of Air India
and India Airlines, which run international and domestic flights
respectively.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, official sources here said, the government
constituted a separate board for each of the airlines with new
head.
</P>
<P>
Anil baijal, a joint secretary in the Civil Aviation Ministry,
was appointed chairman and managing director of India Airlines
while civil aviation secretary P.V. Jayakrishna was appointed
chairman of Air India.
</P>
<P>
The announcement to separate and reconstitute the two boards
followed a decision of the Joint Board of the two airlines on
Monday to set up a holding company with a joint management group
in a bid to synergize operations of the two national carriers.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Ministry said on Tuesday that it had no plan
to have the two government-run airlines merged, showing a
contradiction between the government and the airlines' management.
</P>
<P>
Air India sustained a loss of 1,290.8 million rupees
(approximately 30.73 million U.S. dollars) in the first half of
the current financial year beginning from April 1, the Civil
Aviation Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a written reply Tuesday to Rajya Sabha, the upper house of
the Indian parliament which has been in session since Monday,
Civil Aviation Minister Ananth Kumar cited increased expenditure
and reduction in yield as main reasons for the loss.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons the minister listed for the loss were rising
interests costs, increased competition and operational costs, rise
in wage bill and other staff costs, depreciation in rupee value
and spurting landing, handling and navigational charges.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Board of the two Airlines had accepted suggestions by
the international consultancy firm A F Ferguson &AMP; Co's for the
merger of the two corporations on a three-year timeframe.
</P>
<P>
It has decided to implement the merger in a phased manner
beginning with the merger of various departments such as
operations and engineering of both of the airlines.

Israel during which he will visit the Palestinian territories. The
White House said that a tripartite summit between Clinton, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is only a possibility.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Spends 372.8m Dollars on Edible Oil Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has spent 17.15
billion rupees (about 372.8 million U.S. dollars) on the import of
edible oil in the past five months of the 1998-1999 financial year
starting from July 1.
</P>
<P>
This is 6 billion rupees (about 130.4 Million U.S. dollars)
more than the money spent for importing edible oil in the same
period of last year, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
During the period of July to November this year, Pakistan paid

<HEADLINE> No Breakthrough Means a Fall for Chinese Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- In the Asian Games, the
Chinese men shuttlers had to swallon the 0-4 defeat against
Indonesia in Friday's team final, a humiliation depicting a tough
future for the Chinese men.
</P>
<P>
"The results really shocked me. It's unbelievable and shows
that our men's singles players have become rusty in their skills
after they reached the peak last year," lamented the Chinese head
coach Li Yongbo.
</P>
<P>
While badminton powerhorses Indonesia and Denmark were
up-and-coming, the former two-time world double title-holder
confessed that its singles players were stepping downwards
gradually because of lack of new training methods.
</P>
<P>
"From the Asiad's finals we can see that the Chinese players
are weaker in net-play and their adjusting ability. That is why we
suffered the crashing defeaty," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's top player Hendrawan, who outwitted every opponent
in the Thomas Cup finals this year, was never in serious trouble
against second-ranked Sun Jun of China, winning the first singles
15-7, 15-6 with his net tricks and quick pace. Hendrawan beat Sun
in Singapor Open this season.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champions Rexy mainaky and richy Subagdja encountered
stiff challenges from China's rising pairs Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei
before edging out the Chinese 15-11 and 15-8.
</P>
<P>
In the second singles, 17-year-old Taufik Hidayat, who
triumphed in the Brunei Open this season by trouncing 1996 World
Cup winner Dong Jiong of China, led all the way with his steady
placements and sudden attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian, who is expected to vie for the gold medal in
the 2000 Sydney Olympics, beat World number four Luo Yigang of
China 15-6 and 15-5, making the Indonesians the winners of the
men's team finals.
</P>
<P>
Only months ago in the semi-finals of the World badminton men's
team championships - Thomas Cup finals held in May in Hongkong,
China, the Indonesians were still afraid of the Chinese singles
wherein they only cherished the hope for one singles' victory as
they were strong enough in the doubles.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, China lost two doubles and one singles but took two
wins from the singles through Sun Jun and Dong Jiong who beat Arby
Heryanto and Joko Suprianto respectively. Hendrawan sealed his
country's win over China by toppling the Chinese second single
player Luo Yigang.
</P>
<P>
But six months later, the Indonesians, fielded in many a young
players in the Asian Games, turned the tide by blanking China to
revive their confidence in the singles over the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the dire situation, China recalled former Indonesia
nationla coach Tang Xianhu, who has a full knowledge of the
Indonesian badminton, to coach the Chinese national team in
October. But all the efforts turned in vain.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- World champion China beat
South Korea 3-1 to win the men's table tennis team final at the
Asian Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
World No. 3 and 1995 world champion Kong Linghui wrapped up the
Chinese victory with a 21-17, 21-18 win over Kim Taek Soo in the
fourth rubber, taking a sweet revenge over the South Korean who
had ousted him in the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"We prepared very carefully for this match since the South
Koreans are tenacious and aggressive," said Chinese head coach
Cai Zhenhua. "However, we have never lost confidence. Just as I
told you before the final, China is a sure bet for the team
title. "
</P>
<P>
World Cup runner-up Kim snatched the opening match for South
Korea as he outlasted dual Olympic gold medalist and world No. 2
Liu Guoliang.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who lost the opening set, played a desperate attacking
game to win the following two sets, 21-14, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
Kim, ranked 11th in the world, had beaten Liu twice before
today's match. In the World Cup in October, Kim routed Liu 3-1
en route to finishing second to Jorg Rosskopf of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Kim vowed after the World Cup that he would bring at least one
gold medal for South Korea in the Games.
</P>
<P>
Kong, Olympic doubles gold medalist, made it 1-1 as he outfoxed
Oh Sang-Eun in the second rubber.
</P>
<P>
Kong, who plays an all-around game, overcame mid-match setbacks
to beat the 51st-ranked South Korean 23-21, 19-21, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
Kong clinched the first set when Oh hit a wayward shot.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Oh, who snatched the second set, equalized the
score at 15-15 before Kong used his deceptive backhand serves for
a 6-1 run.
</P>
<P>
"This game is crucial," said Kong. "The tall Oh played a
strange game which I found very difficult to adapt to.
</P>
<P>
"If I had lost to Oh, South Korea would have been unstoppable."
</P>
<P>
Kong said Oh misjudged the amount of spin on his serves in the
third set. "Oh's returns on my serves were poor and it cost him
too much," he said.
</P>
<P>
World No. 7 Wang Liqin sent China 2-1 ahead in the third
rubber, beating Lee Chul-Seung in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Wang overcame the 69th-ranked South Korean with top spin
attacks from both wings, winning 21-14, 15-21, 21-8.
</P>
<P>
Wang, from Shanghai, is tipped to be the best Chinese player in
future. He has posted the best results in China's intra-squad
competitions.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua received a warning from umpire
for shouting instructions to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Chinese Taipei shared the team third place.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Warned of Terrorist Activities in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian political group
has warned the moderate President Mohammad Khatami that his
opponents have started to resort to terrorism against his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
The recent killings of Iranian writers indicated that the
enemies of freedom have taken arms and martyred one by one
supporters of the civil society, freedom and people's rule, a
statement issued by the Islamic Association of University
Students and the Educated said.
</P>
<P>
The statement, a copy of which was faxed to Xinhua on
Saturday, said that the recent assassinations and the future ones
have been and will be carried out by the groups which think that
law and security in Iran pose threat to them.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a veteran Iranian opposition leader Dariush
Forouhar and his wife were knifed to death at home and two
dissident writers were found dead near Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Another famous writer Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh was found
missing on Wednesday, the day when dissident poet Mohammad
Mokhtari was found dead after missing in Tehran last week. Both
were among the six prominent writers and secular intellectuals
questioned in October by an Islamic revolutionary court for their
activities.
</P>
<P>
The group criticized the country's security bodies for failing to
prevent such terrorist activities and blast the conservatives for
keeping silence over the incidents.
</P>
<P>
"The failure of those state organs which have the
responsibility to ensure security for the society and the people
gave a serious warning to Khatami," it said, adding that President
Khatami must take the issue seriously before it becomes too late.

TEHRAN, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian First Vice President
Hassan Habibi stated here on Saturday that Iran and Syria are
against any attempts to disintegrate their neighbor Iraq.

<P>
Upon his return from a two-day visit to Damascus, Habibi said

JOHANNESBURG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Foreign

South African Foreign Ministry spokesman, Marco Boni, would

South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said Thursday that
his country was no longer interested in attending meetings from
which the rebels were excluded.

The DRC President Laurent Kabila has refused to recognize the

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Probes Tank Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's military authorities
have begun investigations into the alleged impropriety in the
importation of 62 tanks from Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The probe follows allegations recently made by a member of
parliament members about the poor conditions of the military
equipment, the New Vision paper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A senior army officer, who preferred anonymity, was quoted as
saying Friday that this investigation had begun and that he could
not rule out corruption.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Defense Steven Kavuma told Xinhua Saturday
morning in a telephone interview that although the issue was
classified information, he would clarify the matter in a
statement to be issued soon.
</P>
<P>
Aggrey Awori, an outspoken MP, said in parliament Wednesday
that of the 62 imported tanks, only eight were operational.
</P>
<P>
The report said the consignment was worth 28 million U.S.
Dollars and the tanks, shipped through Tanzania, arrived in
Uganda this week.
</P>
<P>
A six-man team, including two Russian engineers who handled
the deal, were in Kampala, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan defense authorities have denied allegations that these
tanks were bought to bolster forces deployed in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Defense Ministry said the purchase was
within its budget and was part of its army modernization drive.

<HEADLINE> China Tourism Chiefs Warn Of Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Further plans to crack-down on
overcharging and other unscrupulous activities in the tourism
industry have been announced by officials in China's southernmost
tropical island province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
Hainan, a popular tourist destination in China, was one of the
first regions in the country to establish rules of conduct to
protect its much needed visitors.
</P>
<P>
Tourists are encouraged to lodge complaints with local
government departments who have been instructed to deal strictly
with offenders.
</P>
<P>
Keeping a tight rein on the lucrative tourism sector has been
a long term goal in Hainan. Since the start of this year the
Provincial Tourism Department has successfully handled 86 cases of
violation of the rules. This has resulted in compensation for
those affected to the tune of 1.56 million yuan (around 195,000
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Now that the peak tourism season is looming Hainan officials
are determined to enforce the regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Supervisory Management Bureau for Tourism
Quality has warned hotels and other tourist service operators in
the two leading cities of Haikou and Sanya that it will impose
severe penalties for such misdemeanors as overcharging.

</P>
<P>
Closing a five-day national AIDS conference Friday in the
northern city of Arusha, Regional Commissioner Daniel Ole Njoolay
said the media should not support irresponsible individual AIDS
cure claims which have not been scientifically proved.

<P>
"At a time when the information superhighway is operating
toward globalization of knowledge, it is modern science and
technology which is going to guide the way forward," Njoolay was
quoted Saturday by local press reports as saying.

"Any unproven claims should find no support by an informed
media," he told 750 participants including media representatives

The regional commissioner called on the media to cover the
HIV/AIDS threat to national development and intensified AIDS

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific PC Market to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific PC market
will enjoy a 5 percent surge in the fourth quarter this year from
the same period last year, predicted the International Data
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening currency and stock markets in the fourth
quarter bodes well for the current regional PC market and even
into the next year, said IDC in its report, ignoring a 2.3 percent
decline of PC shipments in the third quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, regional PC shipments in 1999 are forecast to
increase 16 percent compared with 1998, a considerable rally from
an expected one percent decline in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since the Asian financial crisis broke out last year, many
Asia-Pacific countries have suffered huge losses in their PC
sales. Indonesia was the most affected country with a 82 percent
plunge in PC shipments. In Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia,
shipments also decreased 44 percent, 35 percent and 27 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, IDC said, China and India have offset the
slowdowns in the rest of the region with a buoyant growth. PC
shipments in China increased almost 28 percent in the first three
quarters this year, and India up 24 percent.

James Adams, the World Bank Country Director for Uganda and
Tanzania, said Uganda deserves the assistance because the country
has maintained an appropriate economic policy framework.
</P>

The framework gave confidence to donors and President Yoweri
Museveni assured the meeting of a more concerted fight against
growing corruption and reduction in military spending, Adams was
quoted as saying.

BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Pakistan split
the two gold medals of squash competitions at the 13th Asian
Games.
</P>
<P>
The competition, not as popular as at the Commonwealth Games,
attracted little attention at the Asian Games compared with such
sports like soccer, swimming, volleyball and table tennis.

Nicol-Ann of Malaysia and Zaraq Jehan of Pakistan turned to be the
final winners of women's and men's categories.

Zaraq Jehan met a stiff resistence from compatriot Amjad Khan
in the men's final. He was extended to full sets before wrapping

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Promises to Accelerate Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee has promised to accelerate India's economic reforms in
order to remove poverty and unemployment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 78th annual general meeting of the Associated
Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India on Friday, Vajpayee
underlined the need for rapid economic restructuring accompanied
by credible social safety nets to guard against the possibility of
a meltdown as was the case in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Hindu reported Saturday that the Government planned to come
out with policies on telecommunications, health, population
control and a scheme to provide free education to women.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that the aim of his government to promote higher
growth was not to benefit just the rich and the middle class but
the common man who was at the very core of its developmental
efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We do realize that we cannot improve the lot of the poor
without achieving high rates of growth in the economy," he said,
adding that only an expanding economy could ensure growing
employment and rising incomes
</P>
<P>
Public employment schemes, food provision for the vulnerable,
credit allocations for small business and low income households,
and subsidies for community groups could be designed to protect
the common, he told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister regretted that developments in various
fields had been stunted by the unchecked growth of population, the
growth of which remained high in the states which accounted for 40
percent of the population in the country.
</P>
<P>
He called population boom the number one hurdle facing the
nation on the path of development, saying "all good things the
country had achieved, all the plans that are laid, the enormous
power projects, dams, industries, urban infrastructure, and
housing will diluted in their impact, if the growth of population
remains unchecked."
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee hinted that the government would soon come up with
major policy initiatives in the fields of telecommunications,
health and population.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a high-powered group he had set up would soon
formulate a policy on telecommunications, which he said was
closely linked to human development, particularly in rural area.
</P>
<P>
Giving details of the government's focus on education and the
benefits from it, Vajpayee proposed to increase the expenditure on
the area to 6 percent of the Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
He told the leaders of the Indian commerce and industry that
his government would focus on rapid development of the agriculture
sector and upgradation and modernization of infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: U.S. House Panel Approves Three Impeachment Articles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Judiciary
Committee on Friday night passed three articles of impeachment
against President Bill Clinton, ignoring Clinton's last-minute
expression of "profound sorry" for his words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
The votes, for the third time in American history having
approved articles of impeachment against a president, showed an
obvious party division in the Republican-dominated committee and
initiated the stage for a showdown next week on the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made a last-ditch effort to stem the momentum for
impeachment, appearing in the White House Rose Garden minutes
before the first vote to say he was profoundly sorry for
misleading the country about his affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"Mere words cannot fully express the profound remorse I feel
for what our country is going through and for what members of both
the parties in Congress are now forced to deal with," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The committee will debate and vote Saturday on one remaining
article of impeachment alleging abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
If any of the articles is approved by the House next Thursday,
the Senate would convene to vote on only the second impeachment
trial of a president in history. A two-thirds majority would be
needed to remove Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The first article, approved on a 21-16 party line vote, alleges
Clinton committed perjury during his August testimony on the
Lewinsky affair before independent counsel Kenneth Starr's grand
jury. The second, approved on a 20-17 vote, alleges perjury during
his January deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
The third article, approved 21-16, alleges seven instances when
Clinton attempted to "delay, impede, cover up, and conceal"
evidence related to the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
Committee Republican Lindsey Graham was the only committee
member to cross party line, voting against the second article.
</P>
<P>
The White House, anxious to avoid a prolonged Senate trial and
the stain it would leave on Clinton's presidency, stepped up its
efforts to woo a bloc of undecided lawmakers, mostly Republican
moderates from the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was willing to accept censure by Congress, a
suggestion pushed hard by Democrats as an alternative to
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"Should they determine that my errors of word and deed require
their rebuke and censure, I am ready to accept that," Clinton
said, but he stopped short of admitting perjury demanded by many
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
"I never should have misled the country, the Congress, my
friends and my family. Quite simply, I gave in to my shame,"
Clinton told reporters in a hastily arranged White House
appearance that was televised nationally.
</P>
<P>
Many House Republicans were not impressed. "This is certainly
not the kind of admission that may help the president with
undecided moderate Republican members. This changes nothing," said
Representative Marge Roukema of New Jersey, who has already
declared she will vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who has denied lying in his testimony, is liable for
criminal prosecution on perjury charges after his presidency ends.
</P>
<P>
Committee Democrats have offered a censure motion, endorsed by
the White House, that would harshly condemn Clinton's behavior and
leave him open to civil and criminal penalties.
</P>
<P>
The censure motion is expected to fail in committee on
Saturday. Incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston has not indicated
if he will allow a censure vote on the House floor next week,
although Republican committee aides said it was unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Flow to Kenya Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign investment in
Kenya fell drastically in 1998, undermined by the weakness in the
economy, said Joseph Ng'ok, head of Kenyan Investment Promotion
Center (IPC).
</P>
<P>
Ng'ok said foreign investment monitored by his center stood at
1.722 billion Shillings (27.91 million U.S. Dollars) so far this
year, down from 4.703 billion Shillings in 1997, the Daily Nation
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The tough economic conditions occasioned by high interest
rates and the prevailing poor state of roads have discouraged
foreign investors," Ng'ok said.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the decline in foreign investment on the
strength of Kenyan Shilling, saying "Shilling is slightly
overvalued. That discourages exports -- conversely cheering up
imports."
</P>
<P>
Ng'ok said the IPC expects an upturn in 1999 on the back of
falling interest rate. The rate on Kenya's benchmark 91-day
Treasury Bill fell to 12.95 this week from 14.35 percent
previously.
</P>
<P>
A total of 25 companies with foreign origin set up their bases
in Kenya this year, creating an estimated 2,946 jobs, compared
with 31 companies and 4,701 job in 1997, the IPC said.

<HEADLINE> Dark Horse Makes History for Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December (Xinhua) -- A baby-face high school student,
Lim Keng-Liat never expected to make history for Malaysia in the
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
But it was the 18-year-old Malaysian with Chinese origin who
won the first gold for Malaysia in the 13th Asian Games Friday
night when he sprang the biggest surprise so far in the men's 100m
backstroke, breaking the Japan-China monoplay in the pool.
</P>
<P>
This is also the first-ever Asian Games gold for Malaysia in
the 100m backstroke.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian set an Asian Games record of 55.53 to deny
pre-race favorite Fu Yong of China a backstroke double.
</P>
<P>
But the triumph came as a surprise for Lim himself. "I'm a
little bit surprised," admitted the teenager, runner-up to Fu in
the 200m backstroke. "I had not really expected to win, I just
wanted to finish in the top three."
</P>
<P>
Fu said Lim's win was no fluke. "I'm not disappointed to finish
second. He is a dark horse and swam better than me."
</P>
<P>
Lim, who won a gold and three silvers in last SEA Games, made a
poweful start in lane three and led all the way home in the 100m
backstroke.
</P>
<P>
His winning time broke the old Games mark of 56.08 and is
ranked among this year's world top 10.
</P>
<P>
"My parents watched my performance on TV, and they will be very
surprised, and happy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lim, who had been training for three years in Florida, the United
States, said: "I will go on training and attend university in the
United States, I'll stay there maybe for another six years."
</P>
<P>
When asked his goal in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Lim quipped:
"Who knows."

<HEADLINE> NZ Subantarctic Islands Granted World Heritage Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has welcomed a
recent announcement of the formal World Heritage listing of the
New Zealand subantarctic islands by the United Nations
Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
"This is a red-letter day for the Conservation Ministry of New
Zealand. The international community has christened another of New
 Zealand's rich conservation assets as being of the highest
conservation status," Conservation Minister Nick Smith said in a
recent statement.
</P>
<P>
Smith lodged the application for World Heritage Status of the
Auckland, Campbell, Antipodes, Bounties and the Snare Islands in
July 1997. The application was recently approved by UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
"These islands are the most unspoiled in the world. The bird
life is unbelievable. The many different species of penguins,
albatross, petrels, ducks and shags outnumber all the birds in
Europe. They're also a haven for the world's rarest sea lion and
Southern Right Whales. The plant life is equally special with
nearly 200 indigenous species including the unique daisy trees,
tree ferns, buttercups and flowering megaherbs," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, UNESCO granted World Heritage Status to New Zealand's
Tongariro National park and Te Wahipounamu (greenstone).

<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China won the women's sport
pistol team event but had to protest to get their total score
right at the Asian Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team manager Feng Jianzhong lodged a formal protest
when one of their shooters Cai Yeqing had been scored as 584
points instead of 585.
</P>
<P>
China finally registered the official total of 1,742 from Cao
Ying, Li Duihong and Cai, 14 points ahead of silver medalists
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
"It was confusing that they had the correct score on the score
sheet signed by Cai but minutes later the score was changed by
someone to become one point less," Feng said.
</P>
<P>
He said the carbon copy of the score sheet that Cai proved a
key evidence for China's successful protest.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia came home with the bronze at 1,726.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Resettlement Process on Acquired Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The process of resettling more
than 150,000 Zimbabweans on the 841 farms acquired by the
government recently has already begun, according to Lands and
Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai.
</P>
<P>
The land issue was heatedly discussed in a central committee
meeting of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic
Front (ZANU-PF) Thursday, Saturday's Daily Herald quoted the
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Delegates of the meeting, including President and ZANU-PF
First Secretary Robert Mugabe, expressed concern at the slow pace
of resettlement and the overlapping of responsibilities of
ministries in charge of the exercise, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the current farming season, plot-holder farmers in
all provinces invaded commercial farms in a clear indication of
their impatience with the government which promised them land
since independence in 1980 but had not yet delivered.
</P>
<P>
Kangai told the party's national conference which began in
Gweru, central Zimbabwe on Friday that the problem had already
been solved by the formation of an inter-ministerial committee to
coordinate the resettlement exercise which is expected to see
more than half of the 150,000 people given land by the end of
next year.
</P>
<P>
"The other problem was that we believed the farms should be
paid for before people can be moved in but the government has
decided to take the farms and resettle people and then source
money to compensate owners of acquired properties later," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Mugabe said recently that commercial farmers whose
land would have been acquired would be compensated in cash or
government bonds and other schemes such as being given
alternative land.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said the capacity of the acquired land was 2.238
million hectares but the number of people to benefit would only
be known after the demarcation. The government needs to acquire
more than five million hectares of prime land to resettle the
150,000 black farmers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese School Children Surf on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of school children
from four major cities in China attended a computer painting
contest on Internet, that concluded today.
</P>
<P>
Though many of the school students from Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Hong Kong had not made even a single stroke on the
screen, 63 students have excelled and received prizes in Beijing
today. More than 20 primary and middle schools in the country have
won collective prizes.
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old winner from Hong Kong said that he has made
several friends in Beijing and Shanghai through the on-line
painting contest, though they speak totally different
dialects. Regular communications through E-mail help them
understand each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
An official from the competition organizer, the State
Information Center, said that Internet provides an ideal space to
the youth and teenagers to develop their imagination which knows
no borders.
</P>
<P>
Bai Shengnan from a deaf-mutes school in Beijing said that
though she cannot hear any sound, she feels no difference from
normal people when using the keyboard to paint and communicate.
</P>
<P>
"I will work even harder to master computer skills so as to
become a capable person who makes contributions to the society,"
she wrote in the screen.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old girl won the Ambition Award at the contest.
</P>
<P>
Schools in medium-sized and large cities in China have already
been equipped with computers. However, few of them have connected
with Internet.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate school students to attend the on-line
painting contest, the State Information Center donated hundreds of
modems to schools and offered thousands of hours of free Internet
surfing time.
</P>
<P>
"We are advocating new information technologies among the
country's youths and teenagers. We believe that the solo of our
voice will soon receive numerous responses in a loud chorus," a
State Information Center official said.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Chinese teenagers' artistic creation in the cyber
space has already begun to make a mark on the real world. Thirty
teenagers donated the money for selling their paintings to
flood-stricken areas in China at the prize awarding ceremony today.
</P>
<P>
The United States-based Bank of America bought all these
paintings for 25,000 US dollars. Pang Chung Min, managing director
and country manager (China) of the bank, said that he will send
some of the paintings back to his headquarters in the U.S. The
rest of the paintings will be hung at the bank's offices around
China.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police using a
helicopter have recovered most items robbed from tourists during
attacks by gunmen nearby the world famous Masaai Mara Game
Reserve earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven tourists traveling to the park were attacked
Thursday in two separate incidents by two to three armed men
outside Narok Town, where tourists have to go through to and from
the park, press reports here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya Wildlife Service Director Richard Leakey
assured tourists on Friday evening of security, terming the raids
as isolated cases.
</P>
<P>
The armed gang, hiding in the caves and ravines around Narok
Town, has already been identified and police are closing in on
them, said Leakey.
</P>
<P>
The police are now in an intensive search for them, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We know who they are, we know we will get them even today. It
is one gun and three boys... This is a very small group... We
have a massive operation going on," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry in Kenya has plummeted since August, 1997
following tribal clashes, political unrest and insecurity which
hit the east African country especially in tourist areas.

KUALA LUMPUR, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Saturday
launched a month-long Home Ownership Campaign, aimed at increasing
house ownership as a way to spur the national economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Launching the campaign here, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
announced a number of incentives to encourage potential buyers
including foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the easing of rulings for foreigners to buy
properties in Malaysia, Mahathir said foreigners who obtain work
permits in the country can now buy any number of property units
priced up to 250,000 ringgit (65,789 U.S. dollars) or above.
</P>
<P>
The foreign buyers also enjoy the same loan incentive as the
locals from local banks or financial institutions and they now can
borrow up to 95 percent of financing instead of the present 60
percent for the properties they are to buy, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Other incentives included at least 10 percent discount of
market prices for residential and commercial properties offered by
property developers, a 25 percent discount on the insurance
premiums offered by insurance companies for properties bought,
waiver of processing fees and stamp duties as well as reduced
legal fees.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the overhang properties reserved for
Bumiputras (aboriginals) but unsold can now be sold to
non-Bumiputras.
</P>
<P>
The unsold properties for Bumiputras were estimated to be worth
4 billion ringgit (1.052 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Declaring that reviving the property sector is now a priority
pursued by the government, Mahathir said the government believes
that when the property sector revives, it will help revive the
national economy and contribute to the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir admitted the government made mistakes at the initial
stage of the regional financial crisis by squeezing the credit on
the property sector, which badly affected the property sales.
</P>
<P>
Key property developers, banks and financial institutions,
insurance companies and lawyers are participating in the campaign
which was endorsed by the National Economic Action Council (NEAC)
and being organized by Bank Negara (State Bank) Malaysia, Housing
Developers Association and the Association of Banks in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He called upon those involved in the campaign to be honest and
adhere to their commitments to expedite the property reviving
process and make the campaign a success.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Shooters Reach Gold Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China, who set a "double
standard" for its shooters, reached the first gold target as its
markswomen won China's 16th shooting gold in the Asian Games on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
China, which announced before the Games that its shooters set
the gold quotas at 15, disclosed the real target was 20 golds.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women won the sport rifle team title after they
snatched the women's pistol rifle team gold Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan finished second and Mongolia third in the sport
pistol event, while Thailand and Uzbekistan came second and
third respectively in the rifle.
</P>
<P>
China will reach its second target if it wins the women's sport
pistol and sport rifle individual titles this afternoon and sweeps
all four golds on offer at the last day of the competition on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese shooters had a nervous start by winning only four
golds in the first three days of the comeptition. They rebounded
on the fourth day, sweeping seven golds out of eight at stake.
</P>
<P>
"China remains No. 1 shooting power in Asia," said head coach
Zhang Heng. "We met setbacks in the first several days but came
back strongly."

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Decline Slows in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturing activity in
New Zealand has declined for three consecutive quarters, but the
latest figures released by Statistics NZ indicate there are some
signs of improvement, particularly for export-oriented
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
According to a media release issued Saturday, the total
manufacturing sales fell by 0.7 percent in the third quarter,
largely due to the closure of New Zealand car assembly plants
during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Although meat and dairy product processing was down for the
quarter, meat and dairy sales were higher when compared to the
same quarter in 1997. Exports of these products were also higher.
</P>
<P>
Signs of improvements are evident in the wood and paper
products, petroleum and chemicals, and metal products industries.
These industries all had quarterly rises in seasonally adjusted
sales and higher finished goods stocks levels.

<HEADLINE> Thai Snooker Manager to Resign after Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) - With failure to reap any of the
four snooker golds in the previous days, Therachai Vutithum of
Thailand was likely to walk out the snooker squad after the Asian
Games.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it was not the first time for Vutithum to surrender in the
dire circumstance as he resigned as manager of the Thailand
football team after its unsportsmanship show in the Tiger Cup
match with Indonesia in September where neither sides wanted to
win.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has pushed for snooker to be included for the first
time in the Asian Games but its snooker star James Wattana failed
to deliver the expected gold medals.
</P>
<P>
To the worst, Wattana has not won any medal of any colour in
the singles and doubles and second-seeded doubles team Phaitoon
Phonbun and Noppadon Noppachorn were beaten in Friday's final by
Malaysians Sam Chong and Ooi Chin-Kay.
</P>
<P>
"The team event is the last chance for both players and
officials," said Therachai through tears of frustration.
</P>
<P>
Wattana said on Friday that he would not play in the team
competition but stated later he was rethinking the decision.
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of hope in James and the other players to bring
three gold medals but his form has been of a low standard. He has
been under a lot of pressure during his time here," said the
unlucky manager.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Food Prices Fall in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Food prices in New Zealand
fell by 0.5 percent in November for the first time since May when
the prices were down by one percent.
</P>
<P>
In a media release published Saturday, Statistics New Zealand
said that on an annual basis, food prices in November were 4.3
percent higher than in the previous November, with much of the
increase occurring earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
Food prices for November were significantly influenced by price
falls for tomatoes, beef mince, lemonade and pumpkin. Major price
rises were recorded for lettuces, strawberries, potatoes and fresh
poultry.
</P>
<P>
Fruit and vegetable prices made the largest downward
contribution to the November food price index movement. They fell
by 2.1 percent but were still 9.5 percent higher than a year ago.

<HEADLINE> China, Japan Duel in Swimming Pool Heads into Final Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- With Japan taking a minimum
lead in the swimming gold medal fight against China, the swimming
tournament of the 13th Asian Games enters its final day on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese swimmers have a 12-11 edge over their Chinese
opponents before the last six finals scheduled on Saturday, the
last day of the Asiad swimming tourney.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the Japanese will be the final winners as they
had taken lead in four out of six events after Saturday morning
heats.
</P>
<P>
Jo Yoshimi, a 28-year-old veteran, led the men's 200m
individual medley heats with a time of 2:05.30, followed by two
Chinese swimmers Xie Xufeng and Xiong Guoming, who are both eager
to add one gold to the silver medals they have won earlier in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese foursome also finished top of the eight finalists
when they clocked 3:54.14 in the men's 4X100m medley relay. China
again placed second at 3:56.13, followed by Kazakhstan in the
third place at 3:56.81.
</P>
<P>
Sumika Minamoto touched home at 26.26 seconds in the second
heat of the women's 50m freestyle. She will be the top contender
of the title but Shan Ying of China will certainly try hard to win
her second individual goal at the games as she was just 0.34
seconds behind Minamoto in the heats.
</P>
<P>
The easiest final for Japan in Saturday's finals would be the
women's 200m backstroke as Tomoko Hagiwara became a distant leader
with a time of 2:14.07 after the heats. Her nearest rival is Shim
Min-Ji of South Korea who clocked 2:20.35.
</P>
<P>
The women's 200m butterfly and the men's 1,500m freestyle
finals will also be contested on Saturday evening.

<HEADLINE> Chen Yan's Coach Admits Having Underestimated Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Chen Yan's
coach Han Mingyan admitted here on Saturday that they have
underestimated their Japanese rivals, which led to Chen's flop in
the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Favored to win her four individual events of women's 400m
individual medley, 400m freestyle and 200m individual medley and
200m freestyle, the 17-year-old Chen only managed a silver and a
bronze, which pales in contrast to her two-gold performance in the
World Championships in Perth, Australia in January.
</P>
<P>
"We have underestimated our Japanese rivals, and they are
stronger than expected," said Han.
</P>
<P>
"I introduced a rather conservative training method for Chen in
preparation for the games," Han said. "I thought we didn't have to
push too hard for the games, for Chen's superiority was just too
large for her Japanese opponents."
</P>
<P>
But Chen's course went awry from the start when she faded in
her specialty of women's 400m individual medley which was won by
Yasuko Tajima of Japan by a big margin. She only finished third.
</P>
<P>
Then the Chinese team star withdrew from 400m freestyle and
200m freestyle for suffering stomach upset, before making her
appearance in the women's 200m individual medley.
</P>
<P>
But she could not overtake teammate Wu Yanyan, also a world
record holder, in that event and had to settle for the silver,
ending her fisrt Asian Games show on a sour note.
</P>
<P>
"We will never let this happen again," her coach Han said. "I
will scrap the training method after going home."
</P>
<P>
"Next time when the Japanese swimmers meet Chen, I'm sure they
will find a formidable rival in her," Han added.

<HEADLINE> Chile Suspends Visits and Meetings with Spain, Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Chile has suspended an
exchange of visits and meetings with Spain and Britain as part of
counter measures taken by Chilean authorities following Augusto
Pinochet's detention in London.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said on Friday that Chile
would also "revise" its participation in the Ibero-American
summits.
</P>
<P>
Chile's ambassador to London, Mario Artaza, has been ordered to
remain in Santiago for an undetermined period of time.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador was called home earlier in the week in protest
of British Home Secretary Jack Straw's decision to allow Spain to
proceed with its attempts to extradite Pinochet to face charges of
genocide and torture.
</P>
<P>
Insulza said Chile would join Pinochet's lawyers in London in
their legal actions against Straw's decision and the earlier
ruling by the British House of Lords that Pinochet did not have
immunity as a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government has also recommended private airlines to
suspend their flights to the Malvinas Islands off Argentina.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a letter written by Pinochet was read at the
Pinochet Foundation as the 83-year-old general made his first
appearance at a British court since his arrest on October 16.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet declared himself "absolutely innocent" of all
accusations against him and expressed "sincere pain for all the
Chileans who lost their lives" under his regime.
</P>
<P>
He said he was innocent of all "crimes and all the facts" of
which he was accused, and claimed that he was "the victim of a
cowardly political-judicial plot."
</P>
<P>
Pinochet has been accused of being responsible for the deaths
and disappearance of more than 3,000 people under his rule.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet is now under house arrest in Britain on an extradition
request from Spain.

people aged between 15 and 45 to achieve 100 percent literacy by
2006.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Total Literacy Movement Program is also being
implemented in different districts by local registered literacy
societies. Up to now, 1.25 million people have already been made
literate and 460,000 people are still receiving literacy training
under the program.
</P>
<P>
Three districts out of the total 64 have already been declared
free from illiteracy in the country and 10 more districts are
likely to be declared illiteracy free by the end of 1999, they
said.
</P>
<P>
To realize the goal of literacy by 2006, the government has
pledged to set up at least one school in each of the 59,900
villages across the country, where 57.4 percent of its people aged
above 15 are not able to read and write.

<HEADLINE> Peru, Ecuador Found Border Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Peru and Ecuador created a joint
commission Friday for the determination of the common land border
in the city of Tumbes, north of Peru, to start the border
demarcation.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural ceremony for the commission was held at the Costa
del Sol Hotel in Tumbes and presided over by Ambassadors Nicolas
Roncagliolo Higueras and Alejandro Suarez Pasquel, heads of the
Peru and Ecuador demarcation commission.
</P>
<P>
Roncagliolo said in his speech that the joint commission's
establishment shows the consistent will of the two countries to
complete as soon as possible the demarcation of the unmarked
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said the border line will not separate the peoples
of Peru and Ecuador any more and "will become a space of meeting
and cooperation between them."
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Peruvian ambassador said the two countries
will begin a new stage in their political relations, which will
strengthen the basis for economic ties and a deeper and more
creative friendship between the nations.
</P>
<P>
Suarez Pasquel said the work of the joint commission will go
beyond the physical determination of a border since it is also the
recognition of a neighborhood with opportunities for cooperation
and development.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said establishing a common
border between his country and Ecuador will be made in three
stages: determining the exact location of the markers by means of
coordinates, designating areas around the points where the markers
will be placed, and the accurate placement of the markers.

<HEADLINE> Writethrough:100 People Feared Dead in Thai Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- About 100 passengers and crew
members of a Thai Airways International Airbus were believed
killed when the plane crashed into a swampy rubber plantation in
Southern Thailand, Rescue workers said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The plane, carrying 132 passengers and 14 crew members, crashed
and burst into flames while trying to land at the airport in the
southern province of Surat Thani on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fuselage was broken into many pieces and the cockpit torn
apart, rescue workers said.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four survivors, including the pilot, a stewardess and
some Westerners and children, were plucked from the wreckage by
early morning on Saturday and taken into hospital. One was later
reported to have died.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine bodies, including those of Democrat MP Tawat
Wichaidit and two foreigners, were held temporarily in the
airport's departure terminal.
</P>
<P>
Those identified among the dead also included Dr Kowit
Varapongsuttikul, this year's winner of Thailand's Oustanding
Rural Doctor Award and Boonchai Phongpetra, a senator in the Thai
parliament.
</P>
<P>
About 80 people were still trapped in the wreckage, their fate
unknown, as rescuers struggle to reach the crash site through a
swamp impassable to vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said Air Force personnel and
soldiers from the Fourth Army Region were scouring the crash site
for survivors.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed in poor visibility and rain while on its way
from Bangkok to Surat Thani. It left Bangkok International Airport
at about 5:40 p.m. local time and was scheduled to arrive in Surat
Thani at 6:55 p.m. The crash happened at 7:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Rescue work was complicated by rain, which became increasingly
heavy because of an approaching tropical storm.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers waded through waist-deep water to reach the site and
carry out survivors. Hundreds of workers from the army, police and
volunteer organizations were sent to assist.
</P>
<P>
A few survivors escaped with only facial injuries, although
their clothes were ripped. Some were taken to hospital in police
vans while others on pickup trucks supplied by locals.
</P>
<P>
Weather officials in Surat Thani said that before the crash
they saw the aircraft circle over the airport in apparent
preparation for landing. The crash explosion shook the airport
windows and sent flames into the sky, they said.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Theksuban told
reporters at Bangkok International Airport that his sister had
been on the flight and her fate was still unknown. He had
originally been scheduled to join her but cancelled the plan to
attend a wedding elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The passenger list indicated that there were at least 25
foreigners, mostly with British and German names, and some
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
The precise cause of the crash was unknown by early Saturday,
but investigators said they hoped the surviving pilot, who was
injured, would be able to provide crucial information.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus company had released some details of the ill-starred
flight. The plane was an A 310-200, delivered to Thailand in April
1986.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October the twin-engine plane had chalked up
23,000 flight miles.
</P>
<P>
Friday's crash was the first major air accident in Thailand
involving the Thai Airways International for six years. On July
31, 1992, a Thai Airbus 310-300 smashed into a cloud-covered
Himalayan ridge in an attempt to land in Kathmandu, Nepal, killing
113 people on board.

</P>

Olympic Games in 1996, " he said.

the women's marathon. We just put it as an event in which we
might get a medal."

walking, and women's 100m, 200m, 800m, 1,500m, pole vault, triple

<HEADLINE> Chinese Head Coach Belittles Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Although his team was fully
extended in the men's semifinal against Japan on Friday, Chinese
head coach Cai Zhenhua said China's dominance in table tennis
remained unshaken.
</P>
<P>
China survived a five-match marathon against Japan on Friday to
take on long-time rival South Korea in the title clash Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
"China is undisputedly No. 1 in Asia and it will secure the
men's team title tonight," said a confident Cai, who often warned
his players against complacency but changed his usual low profile
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
China, led by Olympic champions Liu Guoliang and Kong Linghui,
outlasted less fancied Japan 3-2 in Friday's semifinal. For the
all-mighty Chinese, the score was a disgrace.
</P>
<P>
The one who helped Japan fully stretch the world champion was
Iseki Seiko, a former Chinese national whose previous name was Wei
Qingguang.
</P>
<P>
Wei combined with Chen Longcan to win a doubles gold for China
in the 1988 Olympic Games. He moved to Japan in the early 90s and
changed the name at his own convenience in the adopted country.
</P>
<P>
Seiko, ranked 26th in the world, put Japan 1-0 ahead in
Friday's semifinals, beating world No. 6 Wang Liqin 2-1 before
doubles Olympic gold medalist Kong Linghui evened the score with a
three-set win over Toshio Tasaki.
</P>
<P>
Ryo Yuzawa grabbed the lead for Japan as he routed world No. 2
and dual Olympic gold medalist Liu Guoliang in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
China avoided an upset by Japan after Wang and Kong snatched
the final two matches.
</P>
<P>
Seiko regained international fame in the Asian championships in
Osaka in October, where he downed top Chinese penhold fast
attackers Liu Guoliang and Ma Lin to finish runner-up in the
men's singles.
</P>
<P>
If Japan had beaten China on Friday, it would have caused a
furious uproar back in Seiko's birth country, just as Koyama
Chire did in the Hiroshima Games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Chire, whose mainden name is He Zhili and who had won the world
singles championship for China in 1987, was branded a "traitor" by
Chinese fans after she upset China's world No. 1 Deng Yaping in
the 1994 Games singles final and spoke broken Japanese instead of
her mother tougne in the post-victory press conference.
</P>
<P>
Chire, who married a Japanese coach, skipped the Bangkok Asian
Games to solve her marriage problems.
</P>
<P>
China is set to meet strong challenges in the men's team final
against the South Korean squad led by World No. 11 Kim Taek Soo,
who had upset Kong in the Atlanta Olympic Games and had beaten Liu
twice this year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Cai said China was a sure bet for the
men's team top honor.
</P>
<P>
"We are not afraid of South Korea," he said. "They only have
Kim Taek Soo while the Chinese team is more balanced."

<HEADLINE> Thai Students Urged to Leave Drugs for Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- To attract more students to
leave drugs for the Asian Games, the Asiad organizing committee
has adjusted its tickets-selling policy with more cheaper tickets
for the students.
</P>
<P>
As the Asian Games go into its seventh day on Saturday, tickets
for the students were lowered to 10-50 baht (one dollar equals to
36 baht) and more tickets were to sell for students only who can
buy them simply by putting up their uniforms in campus, the
authorities concerned said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the number of students audience is still far less
than what we expected due to expensive tickets which cost more
than the entertaining games in the major shopping centers," said
an official in charge of the tickets-selling department.
</P>
<P>
Without their own incomes, the majority of the students had to
hold back from the competition venues, said the education
authorities, urging the organizing committee to cut down the
prices of the tickets and allocate more tickets for the students.
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimated that students made up to some one tenth
of the audience in most of the competition venues.
</P>
<P>
Apart from displaying its confidence against financial crisis,
the Thai government also hopes to exploit the Asian Games as the
means to urge the students to leave the drugs.
</P>
<P>
Bordered with Laos and Myanmar with the Golden Triangle as a
center of drugs, Thailand achieves success in combating against
the drugs generally by confiscating 144,460 kgs of drugs,
including 15,579 kgs of heroines and 71,299 kgs of amphetamine
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the drug dealers, a total of 15,713 were caught up
last year by Thailand, have picked up the students as potential
buyers in the recent years, especially with the amphetamine which
stimulate the customers to crazy for violence and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
A total of 75,086 cases of drugs were reported from the campus
last year, an astonishing jump from 20,358 cases three years ago,
with 10,286 students were prisoned last year, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated some two percent of the Thai students were
drug addicts, which forces Thai government to resort more efforts
in dealing with drugs in the campus.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve success in combating drugs in campus, the
Thai government has granted a one-month vacation for the students,
aiming to smooth the traffic conditions and to shift their
attention from drugs to the world-class sports competitions during
the Asian Games.

BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women footballers
will show up with more feminie attires by throwing away their
current loose uniforms from the beginning of 1999, said a Chinese
soccer official on Saturday.
</P>
<P>

The new attires for the Chinese women footballers will still be

but the sleeves and shorts will have to be shortened and the
uniforms to be more tight against their bodies, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The current uniform is more like for the men, with over-elbow
sleeves, over-knee shorts and loose to the waist, without any

construction or non-agricultural uses, according to today's "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
In its notice, the ministry said that to guarantee the smooth
implementation of the revised State Land Administration Law on the
New Year's Day, individuals and units should comply with the
national overall plan on land use which brings more than 80
percent of the country's farmland under special protection.
</P>

protection of the State laws, and the legal term for farmers to
contract arable land is 30 years.

members or from villager representatives, and permission from
governments at the township level and agricultural administrations
at the county level.
</P>
<P>
Only the State Council and provincial governments have the
right to approve the occupation of farmland for non-agricultural
use, and only the State Council has the right to approve the

<HEADLINE> Norwegians Favor Norway's Entry Into EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of Norwegians who
are in favor of Norway joining the European Union (EU) has
increased in the past six months, according to a survey conducted
by the country's leading newspaper Aftenposten.
</P>
<P>
The number of people considering Norway's membership in the EU
beneficial to the country's long-term interests has gone up to 40
percent, from 34 percent during a June survey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of people opposed to Norway's entry has
declined to 40 percent from 55 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The local press attributed the increase in those favoring
Norway's entry into the EU to the gloomy economy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Oil-rich Norway has suffered seriously in recent years from a
continuous drop in international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
To stablize its financial market, the country has adopted a
policy to raise its interest rates, which has also hampered the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a growing number of Norwegians believe the country
will be more vulnerable in case of an international financial
crisis, if it insists on staying outside the EU.
</P>
<P>
Norway applied for EU membership in the 1970s and in early
1990s, but was forced to withdraw its application since most of
its citizens were against it.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Health experts from the
13-member Asia-Pacific Social Sciences and Medicine have voiced a
warning over the multitude of health problems besieging the
region, the Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The experts also called for close cooperation among members of
the organization to deal with the serious situation in which some
old health problems such as infections, instead of having been
solved, were aggravated by the emergence of new, non-infectious
diseases.
</P>
<P>
The experts made the call at the end of a five-day conference
in Yogyakarta in Central Java on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There's so much to be done. We can't solve the problems if we
don't come together," said Fatima Castillo, a professor at the
University of the Philippines, who was also a member of the
conference's steering committee.
</P>
<P>
Fatima told a media briefing that the conference has called on
all sectors in the community, including policy-makers, community
workers, educators and the mass media, to form partnerships both
within a country and across the region to deal with the problems.
</P>
<P>
The fast spread of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),
which causes Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), the
poor's lack of access to health services, the emergence of
non-infectious diseases related to changes in people's diet and
lifestyle, are all examples of many serious problems that most
Asia-Pacific countries are currently facing.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem, however, was that "while infectious
diseases like malaria have not yet been conquered, there come new
diseases," she said.
</P>
<P>
The conference also noted that health costs are rising in the
region as health care has been increasingly privatized.
</P>
<P>
"More and more people are unable to afford the high cost of
health care, especially that in private clinics and hospitals,"
she said.
</P>

the economic meltdown had further led

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Reform Tops Agenda in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 12 (Xinhua) -- China is to give top priority
to enterprise reforms and work towards a more efficient and
healthy national economy in 1999, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved remarkable success this year despite
unprecedented flooding and the Southeast Asian financial
crisis. Nevertheless, we still have some tough tasks ahead of us,
especially as the reform of State-owned enterprises will enter a
critical stage next year," a senior official said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, minister in charge of the State Economic and
Trade Commission (SETC), was speaking on the first day of
a three-day National Economic and Trade Conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Economic and trade development targets for 1999 are being laid
down at the conference, where work plans are to be drawn up and
discussed by officials from across the country.
</P>
<P>
China will work to achieve eight percent growth in industrial
added value next year, Sheng said. Commodity retail sales and
production material sales are expected to rise by nine percent and
seven percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bottom line for profits made by State-owned industrial
enterprises is to be set at 50 billion yuan (six billion US
dollars) in 1999, he added.
</P>
<P>
The policies the State has adopted to expand domestic demand
and improve the overall economic climate, coupled with efforts in
industrial restructuring and readjustment, have created favorable
conditions for reform and economic development next year, Sheng
said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers Start Meetings to Prepare for Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers and economic
ministers from the nine member countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) started their separate meetings
here Saturday to make preparations for the regional grouping's
summit set for next week.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino told reporters before
the meetings began that top on the agenda of the meetings will be
the measures to overcome the financial crisis now facing the
member countries and recover the economy, which has been ravaged
by the crisis which broke out last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministers from Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are expected to
focus on a draft Hanoi Declaration and an action plan to implement
Vision 2020, a development program worked out by ASEAN leaders at
their summit in Kuala Lumpur last year. The draft will be
submitted to the summit next week for the leaders to consider.
</P>
<P>
The foreign and economic ministers, who will hold a joint
meeting Sunday, began their separate informal consultations Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
After more than four hours of consultations Friday night, the
foreign ministers failed to reach consensus on the admission of
Cambodia into the group as some countries including the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand favored a delay until the
political situation in the country becomes more stable.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's membership was deferred indefinitely last year after
political turbulence occurred in the country, which the ASEAN had
agreed to admit earlier.
</P>
<P>
A coalition government has already been formed in Cambodia, but
the three countries said the conditions set for Cambodia's
admission have not been fully met yet, including amendment of the
constitution and the appointment of senators.
</P>
<P>
But Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam of Vietnam, which is
hosting the ministerial meetings and the summit, said Cambodia's
accession will be decided by the ASEAN leaders at their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions from reporters before the meeting,
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas noted that although some of
its members are in economic difficulty, ASEAN remains united and
are working to realize its set political and economic targets.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Cambodia will join ASEAN soon,
adding that as the foreign ministers had not reached consensus,
the heads of state and government will discuss and solve the issue
at the summit.

of the year deals with trade. Those engaged in industrial
activities accounted for 10.7 percent, the study said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy's economic growth in 1999
will be around two percent, lower than originally forecast, said
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Michael Mossa, chief IMF economist said that last year Italy
was somewhat behind the other nations of the continental Europe,
adding that Italy's recent cut of interest rates will provide a
boost to its economic growth in 1999.

<P>
Speaking at a conference of World Scenarios for the Economy in
Rome, Mossa said that the IMF's growth revision for Italy will be
in line with the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said Friday in
Vienna that growth figures "surely were not as good as we had

<P>
MANILA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Typhoon "Faith" hit Negros
Island, the Central Philippines on Friday, leaving five people
dead and 70 others missing, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
By the time the country's 11th weather disturbance in 1998 has
blown away towards Palawan, five people were dead and at least 70
others were missing, the report said. Three boats sank and the
entire Aklan and parts of Negros Occidental were in disarray.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that on Friday afternoon, the swollen Aklan
River flooded most parts of Kalibo, neck-deep in low areas and
knee-deep in many other parts of the town.
</P>
<P>
In the neighboring town of Numancia, flood waters reached
rooftops of houses, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Fallen electric posts caused power failures in Aklan and the
Northern part of Negros Occidental, it said.
</P>
<P>
A pump boat bound for Libertad from Palawan sank as it was
nearing port.
</P>
<P>
The boat was carrying 60 passengers and crew members, but only
20 people were rescued with the rest missing, it said.

<HEADLINE> Support Project For Tower of Pisa Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy began applying the first
supports to the Leaning Tower of Pisa Friday to ensure the
historic structure does not lean too far.
</P>
<P>
Using large cranes, technicians began putting the first two
steel cable "braces" up on the 800-year-old tower.
</P>
<P>
Noted for its simplicity, the design consists of four narrow
braces, 100 meters long and 50 millimeters wide. Each of the
supports has a 150-ton capacity, and will be anchored 14 meters
under the ground.
</P>
<P>
The long-planned structural project, supervised by a group of
international experts, will also allow for archaeological
excavations to continue on the north side of the monument, as well
as an effort to halt the tower's inclination from underground.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the tower began in 1173 and was completed
nearly 200 years later. Due to the clay earth below it, the tower
began to lean hundred years ago.
</P>
<P>
The famous tower was closed to the public in January 1990, when
experts who regularly monitor its movements declared it unsafe.
</P>
<P>
The eight-story tower, which is 54.5 meters high, adds an
average of 1 millimeter a year to its 4.5-meter lean out of the
perpendicular.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Rescue workers retrieved 44
bodies in the debris of a Thai Airbus which crashed in Southern
Thailand on Friday, an official announcement said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Theksuban told
reporters early on Saturday morning that 52 people, including 13
foreigners, survived the crash, some of them seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Of the 44 bodies, 32 have been identified, Suthep said. The
death toll could rise as more bodies were trapped inside the
plane, part of which was inundated in a pond.
</P>
<P>
TV footage showed rescue work going on in difficult conditions
as heavy rain continued to pour.
</P>
<P>
The plane, carrying 146 passengers and crew members, crashed
into a pond amid rubber trees in the southern province of Surat
Thani while on its way from Bangkok to Surat Thani.
</P>
<P>
The flight TG261, belonging to the Thai Airways International,
exploded into a fireball while trying to land at the Surat Thani
airport.
</P>
<P>
Suthep said poor visibility was the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
It was still unknown how many foreigners were on board the
plane.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Bob Cousy, the Hall of
Famer who organized the first NBA labor movement 40 years ago,
said he is ashamed of his role in creating the players union,
according to a press report here today.
</P>
<P>
"I'm ashamed I ever started the players association," the
former Boston Celtics star said Thursday night from his home in
Florida. "For the first time in my life, I regret starting the
players association."
</P>
<P>
"I'm dismayed, disappointed because I always took great pride
in my association with the players association."
</P>
<P>
Cousy, 70, criticized union chief Billy Hunter and some
high-profile players and agents for their roles in the dispute
with NBA owners.
</P>
<P>
Cousy cursed some top agents, saying: "These agents are just
pulling Hunter's strings. The agents don't love anything but
their percentage, they will suck it dry, the vehicle of the
moment, until it dies. They could care less.
</P>
<P>
"The league has been irreparable harmed because of them,"
Cousy said of the union leadership. "I'm amazed the rank of file
have held together with what has gone on. If i'm making $272,000,
why am I hanging in there for the top 10 percent of the players,
that's the bottom line, that's what this is all about. They've
been brainwashed."

ISLAMABAD, December 12 (Xinhua) -- At least seven civilians
were killed and 11 others injured when Taliban jets bombed a
civilian area Thursday in Taloqan, capital of the northern Afghan
province of Takhar, according to reports reaching here Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
The bombing also damaged four houses in the town.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance told Xinhua
Friday night that the Taliban militia also launched offensives
against them in Baghlan, Faryab and Ghor provinces.
</P>
<P>
Seven Taliban soldiers were killed and 22 others injured in the
fighting, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Reports from inside Afghanistan said fires were also exchanged
between the two Afghan warring factions in the north of Kabul
while the Taliban launched another attack in a bid to retake
Sar-e-Pul area which was captured by the forces of commander Ahmad
Shah Masood a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Taliban sources said they were also planning to attack the
opposition forces in Parwan province.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that these offensives by the Taliban militia
against their opponents are in response to the latest summit of

<HEADLINE> Russia Allows More Kazakh Oil Export Through Pipelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia has decided to allow
Kazakhstan to export an extra 1.5 million tons of oil a year
through Russian oil pipelines, Kazakh Minister of Energy, Industry
and Trade Asygat Zabagin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said in the capital city of Astana that he had received a
protocol on the decision from the Russian Ministry of Fuel and
Power, the Kazakh Interfax News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
As an inland country, Kazakhstan mainly depends on Russia's
pipelines for oil export.
</P>
<P>
Russia, itself a major world oil exporter, had allowed
Kazakhstan to export through its pipelines only 7.5 million tons
of oil a year in a bid to protect its own interests.
</P>
<P>
Zabagin said Russia's decision to relax restrictions on
Kazakhstan's oil export would be instrumental to the growth of the
Kazakh economy as 30 percent of the country's budgeted revenues
are from oil export.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economy Expected to Grow or Fall By 1 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
expects the economy to either grow or shrink by one percent in the
1999/2000 fiscal year starting next April, Finance Minister
Bambang Subianto said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth in the 1999/2000 fiscal year is assumed to
show a fall of minus one percent or a rise of one percent,"
Subianto told parliament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In response to legislators' questions, Subianto unveiled the
government's draft budget for the next fiscal year. The state
budget will be presented in January next year.
</P>
<P>
The economic forecast is far more optimistic than expectations
of an at least three percent economic shrinkage made by
economists. This year, the economy is forecast to shrink by 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
Subianto also said the draft envisages oil prices of between
11.50 U.S. dollars and 12.50 U.S. dollars per barrel with
production standing at around 1.52 million barrel per day.
</P>
<P>
"Although the oil price keeps weakening at present, with an
improving world economy it is expected to rise," Subianto was
quoted by the Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said benchmark interest rates in the next fiscal year were
seen falling to between 20 and 30 percent from the current 40
percent, going back to the rates before the regional currency
crisis started hitting the country in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft budget, the rupiah will hover around
7,000/8,000 rupiah to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The local currency has been trading at 7,500 rupiah against the
dollar in the last few weeks with government ministers predicting
it would continue to strengthen against the greenback on falling
interest rates as well as slowing inflation.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate, Subianto said, is seen slowing to below 20
percent in the 1999/2000 fiscal year against around 80 percent in
the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Subianto said the realization of the 1999/2000 state budget
will heavily depend on the success of the banking recapitalization
program which is targeted to be completed in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said the recapitalization program is a must as banking
restructuring is the key to economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
If the recapitalization is not done properly, the business
sector will still be kept in a standstill while the government's
income sector will also face mounting difficulties, he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs 120 Mln Dollars to Meet Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
needs 120 million U.S. dollars to cope with fertilizer shortages
in some parts of the country, Trade and Industry Minister Rahardi
Ramelan said.
</P>
<P>
"I have instructed PT Pusri (state-owned fertilizer maker) to
import KCL and SP36 fertilizer to meet our farmers' demand,"
Ramelan told reporters before attending a ceremony marking the
launching of a bourse for technological development for small- and
medium-scale industries and cooperative in Denpasar, Bali, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said he made the instruction following the failure of the
Agricultural Ministry to import the needed fertilizers, Antara
News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reported fertilizer shortages, Agriculture
Minister Soleh Solahuddin Friday told reporters in Jakarta that PT
Pusri had begun to distribute 45,000 tons of urea fertilizer in
the northern parts of Java island.
</P>
<P>
Produced by PT Kujang, the 45,000 tons of fertilizer were being
released as the first step to deal with the shortages.
</P>
<P>
PT Pusri would import 14,000 tons of KCL fertilizer, 30,000
tons of TSP fertilizer and 26,000 tons of ZA fertilizer, he said,
adding that the imported fertilizers would be received by farmers
by the end of this year.

BUDAPEST, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Hungary and Turkey will
realize tariff-free trade in some industrial products and to
provide mutually preferential tariffs for agricultural products
beginning in the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reiterated the plan here Friday at the first

accord signed in April 1998 between the countries, the two sides
summed up the implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
This year has seen a positive trend for development of trade
between Hungary and Turkey. During the first nine months,
Hungary's exports to Turkey reached 64 million U.S. dollars and

<HEADLINE> NBA Sides Hold Secret Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- NBA deputy commissioner
Russ Granik admitted today the two sides met privately Thursday
and may do so again this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Granik confirmed Thursday's meeting consisted of himself, NBA
commissioner David Stern, Players Association executive director
Billy Hunter and NBPA president Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
"I expect discussions over the weekend, but we're still miles
and miles apart," said Granik in the show. "I don't even know if
there was any progress. Whether we can get to the point where we
are on the same planet, I don't know."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the chance of a possible agreement, Granik
responded, "I don't have any real objective reason to feel
optimistic."
</P>
<P>
Union spokeman Dan Wasserman admitted he had no knowledge of
Thursday's meeting and said he had not been told whether the two
sides would meet this weekend.
</P>
<P>
With the lockout in its 164th day, the fact the two sides met
at all represented a small form of progress. Negotiations broke
off December 3 after a 10 1/2-hour session in which both sides
admitted little, if any progress.
</P>
<P>
That meeting was the first one since November 20, when both
sdies reported progress following a marathon session. But that
optimism faded quickly and talks scheduled for that weekend were
later scrapped.
</P>
<P>
The owner have rejected a request from the union to have the
talks sent to mediation. With Tuesday's cancellation of the
All-Star game, scheduled for February 14 in Philadelphia, the two
sides took another step closer in the cancellation of the entire
1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
After the limited progress in the December 3 session, Stern
publicly acknowledged the possibility of canceling the entire
season. The commissioner, however, repeatedly has refused to set
a drop-dead ate for canceling the full slate.
</P>
<P>
With seven more games wiped out today, a total of 271 contests
have been canceled due to the lockout. With an expected three to
four weeks needed to sign free agents and draft picks as well as
players getting back into playing shape, almost 200 additional
games are expected to be missed.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio
of the U.S. Baseball League has slipped into a coma, leaving his
doctor with little optimism for recovery.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 18 hours, his condtion took a turn for the
worse," said internist and cardiologist Dr. Earl Barron, who is
treating DiMaggio at Memorial Regional Hospital at a news
conference today.
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio was chosen the three-time American League Most
Valuable Player, and has a lifetime 325 hitter. He holds one of
baseball's most revered records with a 56-game hitting streak in
1941.
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio has fallen into a coma in his battle to recover after
lung cancer surgery. He was hospitalized on October 12 and
underwent surgery to have a cancerous tumor removed from his
right lung two days later.
</P>
<P>
His condition has fluctuated the past few weeks, with the
latest news coming after Barron said DiMaggio's condition had
improved earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio last appeared in public on September 27 when he was
honored at "Joe DiMaggio Day" and presented with replicas of his
10 World Series rings.
</P>
<P>
The center fielder played in 10 World Series, including four
straight from 1936-39. During a 13-season career interrupted by a
three-year stint in the U.S. Army during World War Two, DiMaggio
posted 2,214 hits and 361 home runs.

Most of the 600 million francs will be distributed according
to how big each country's contribution is to UEFA's TV income.
</P>
<P>
Italy, for example, would receive in the region of 60 million
francs to be shared between, for example, their three Champions'
League clubs. Each club would receive half their hand-out at the
start of the season and the remainder at the end.
</P>
<P>
That money is further sub-divided between the clubs involved
-- and that is on top of what bonuses they pick-up during the
competition.
</P>
<P>
A small amount -- five per cent or 30 million francs -- is
also being allocated to the national associations of clubs who
are knocked out in the three qualifying rounds leading to the
Champions' League proper.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 200 million Swiss francs is being kept under
UEFA's control.

<HEADLINE> Ivan Slavkov Re-elected President of Football Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Ivan Slavkov was re-elected
president of the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) for the next
three years Friday afternoon at the Union's regular congress.
</P>
<P>
Slavkov gathered 283 votes, and his main opponent, Sofia Mayor
Stefan Sofianski, received 128. All 411 ballot papers of the
congress' delegates were valid.
</P>
<P>
Slavkov is son-in-law of former communist leader Todor
Zhivkov. He is also chairman of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason to be dissatisfied with the vote," Slavkov
said after the results were announced. "Naturally, I had my
doubts, but my optimism kept me going."
</P>
<P>
Slavkov joked that he was winning BFU elections for the fourth
time, both with and without strongly criticized BFU Executive
Director Ivan Voutsov.
</P>
<P>
"I expected greater resistance from Stefan Sofianski, but
apparently the delegates made their choice without being
manipulated by anyone," Slavkov added.
</P>
<P>
Sofianski said that he recognized the results. "I thank those
who supported me. I wish football success. I am ready to help
if anyone asks me to do so."

<HEADLINE> UEFA Vows not to Make World Cup Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- European soccer's governing
body UEFA pledged on Friday it would not repeat this summer's
World Cup mistakes in ticketing arrangements at the 2000 European
championships.
</P>
<P>
Guido Tognoni, head of UEFA's National Teams Department, told
a news conference in Lausanne: "The ticket allocation will ensure
that a third of every stadium will be filled with the fans of the
competing teams.
</P>
<P>
"At least 16 percent of all tickets will go to the competing
teams, but when any other country plays against the hosts Belgium
or the Netherlands, the fans of the opposing country will receive
20 per cent of the tickets."
</P>
<P>
Tognoni added that there will be a maximum allocation of four
tickets per applicant and that the sale of tickets to corporate
organisations will be kept to a realistic minimum.
</P>
<P>
"We want to do as much as possible to avoid the black market.
We intend to have a very elaborate procedure in place and we do
not want a repeat of the problems that were experienced at the
World Cup in the summer."
</P>
<P>
Ticketing procedures at the World Cup were roundly criticised
as many, sold to agencies around the world, never reached their
intented customers. A number of agencies either folded or face
serious legal problems as a result of alleged mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Tognoni also said that UEFA and both the co-hosts Belgium and
the Netherlands were all agreed on the ticketing procedures and
were just waiting for final approval from the European Union on
their sale and distribution.
</P>
<P>
The competition, the first major championship to be co-hosted,
is being staged from June 10 to July 2, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Warnecke and Rupprath Set World Marks in Euro Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- German swimmers Mark Warnecke
and Thomas Rupprath set world records in men's 50-meter
breaststroke and 50m backstroke respectively on the first day of
the European short-course swimming championships on Friday.
</P>
<P>
There was also a world best for a German quartet in the rarely
swum women's 4x50 meters freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
Two European records tumbled in the morning's heats and two
more in the finals, apart from the new world marks, making it a
lucrative day for all concerned.
</P>
<P>
World records yielded 20,000 German marks (12,130 U.S.
dollars) apiece and European records 5,000 marks (3,032 U.S.
dollars) each from a prize money fund of 1.52 million marks
(921,800 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Warnecke finally broke his own short-course world 50m
breaststroke record with a time of 26.70 seconds after clocking
the previous mark of 26.97 no less than three times in the past
22 months -- in Paris twice and Sydney once.
</P>
<P>
"I never expected to be so fast. I was very happy with the
time. It's perfect for my preparations for Sydney (2000
Olympics)," Warnecke said.
</P>
<P>
Rupprath, who set a European mark of 24.41 in the heats of 50m
backstroke, sped home in 24.13 in the final to beat the 24.25
world mark posted by Canada's Chris Renaud in St Catharines,
Ontario, on February 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Katrin Meissner, Simone Osygus, Marianne Hinners and Sandra
Voelker clocked one minute 39.56 seconds in the women's 4x50
freestyle relay to beat the 1:40.63 set by another German quartet
-- Osygus, Annette Hadding, Daniela Hunger and Franziska van
Almsick -- in Espoo, Finland, on November 22, 1992.
</P>
<P>
Sweden touched first in 1:39.16 but were disqualified because
of a premature final take-over by Therese Alshammar from Anna
Karin Kammerling.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Inge de Bruijn cracked the women's European 50m
butterfly mark for the second time in one day, earning 5,000
marks for each swim.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch sprinter touched in 26.09 to win the final,
bettering the 26.54 she swam in the morning's heats, which in
turn had bettered her own mark of 26.61 set in Imperia, Italy, on
March 26 this year. Her time was just 0.04 seconds outside the
world mark swum by American Jenny Thompson earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Emiliano Brembilla had opened the first session of
finals with a European record in his successful defence of the
men's 400m freestyle title, sweeping home in 3:40.45 to beat the
3:40.58 mark set by Germany's Joerg Hoffmann in Paris on February
8, 1997. Hoffmann failed to make the final here.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Britain celebrated two victories, thanks to James
Hickman and Susan Rolph.
</P>
<P>
Hickman, world short-course champion and record holder,raced
away to win the men's 200m butterfly by more than a second from
world long-course champion Denys Sylantyev of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Rolph swam a storming second half to win the women's 100m
freestyle in which defending champion Voelker, suffering from
flu, faded to fourth. Rolph touched in 53.84 to beat a
Commonwealth record set in 1993 by Australia's Susan O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
Finland's Jani Sievinen, a former long-course world champion,
showed he was once again a force to be reckoned by winning the
men's 100m individual medley in convincing style from Germany's
Jens Kruppa and Hickman. Dutch defending champion Marcel Wouda,
sporting a suit which covered his torso and legs, could manage
only fourth.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's Brigitte Becue dead-heated for gold in the women's
100m breaststroke with Poland's Alicja Peczak, who once served a
two-year suspension for steroid use.
</P>
<P>
Kirsten Vlieghuis of the Netherlands, a strong medal conte
nder, pulled up shortly after the halfway mark in the women's
800m freestyle feeling dizzy and had to be helped out of the
water at the end of the pool.

WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee voted 21-16 today to approve
Article One of impeachment, accusing President Bill Clinton of
perjury before a federal grand jury investigating the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives will hold a meeting on next
Thursday to cast votes on the Article One of Impeachment, where
the outcome is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
If approved by the House, the article would go to the Senate
for only the second impeachment trial of a president in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
The vote in the House will depend on a couple of dozen
Republican moderates. Many political experts still find it hard to
believe that the president will be impeached in defiance of public
opinion, just a few weeks after Republicans received a rebuff from
voters in mid-term elections and lost five seats in the House.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Chile suspended Friday all
its official visits and bilateral meetings with Spain and the
United Kingdom and will "revise" its participation in the
Iberoamerican summits.
</P>
<P>
These are part of a series of measures adopted by the Chilean
authorities after Augusto Pinochet's detention in London, and were
announced to the press by Chilean Foreign Affairs Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza.
</P>
<P>
The measures include the recommendation to airlines operators
to suspend their commercial flights to the Malvinas (Falkland)
Islands and the extension "for an undetermined time" of Chilean
ambassador to the United Kingdom Mario Artaza's stay in Santiago.
</P>
<P>
Artaza was recalled for consultations after learning of last
Wednesday decision of British Interior Minister Jack Straw to
proceed with Pinochet's extradition to Spain, where he will be
tried for genocide, torture and terrorism committed during his
military regime (1973-1990).

The new call center will enable the company to maintain its
high standards and continue to deliver the best customer service

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
apologized to the country Friday for his conduct in the Monica
Lewinsky affair and said he would accept a congressional censure
or rebuke.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to accept that," he said in a rose Garden statement
as the House Judiciary Committee debated four articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has repeatedly expressed remorse for his actions, and
Democrats in Congress have been pushing for a stern censure as an
alternative to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Friday's remarks marked the first time he has expressed
willingness to be censured.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that accountability demands consequences and I am
prepared to accept them," the president said. He said he was
"profoundly sorry."
</P>
<P>
"Painful though the condemnation of the Congress would be, it
would pale in comparison to the consequences of the pain I have
caused my family," Clinton said. "There is no greater agony."
</P>
<P>
"The public consequences of my actions are in the hands of the
American people and their representatives in the Congress. Should
they determine that my errors of word and deed require their
rebuke and censure, I am ready to accept that," he said.

Bangkok, the report said.

<P>
Slogging through a swamp, rescue workers struggled to pull
bodies from the charred wreckage. The rescue operation was scaled
back early Saturday due to dark, rainy conditions and was to fully
resume after daybreak.
</P>
<P>
By 4 a.m., police and workers had discovered 44 bodies among
the burnt, twisted metal of the plane. Two were identified as
Westerners. Scores more bodies were still trapped in the plane,
many of them burned beyond recognition, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At least 50 people survived. About 10 were Westerners, probably
tourists, officials said. Thai television reported the pilot
survived, but that could not be immediately confirmed.

NEW YORK, December 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks closed mostly
lower for the fourth consecutive session on Friday with the
blue-chip index down 19.82 points to 8821.76 and other major
market indicators mixed.
</P>
<P>
Investors' reluctance in buying continued to come from worries
about the outlook of earnings of some big companies, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Among decliners were Coca-cola, Boeing, American Express and
several other financial shares. Helping to offset losses were
Exxon, General Electric, Ford and others.
</P>
<P>
A 0.6 percent rise in consumer spending in November, as
reported on Friday, should be a positive indicator, but investors
might see it as a factor stemming the Fed from cutting interest
rates further, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Dow lost 248 points in the last 4 sessions. Subtracting a
54 point gain on Monday, it lost 194 points this week, sitting 552
points below the record of 9374.27 set on November 23, but still
up 11.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 13.35 to
2029.31 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 1.44 to 1166.46, but
the New York Stock Exchange index and the American Stock Exchange
index fell.
</P>
<P>
On the NYSE, decliners led advancers 3-2 with trading volume
down to 681 million shares from 746 million Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Drinking Benefits Heart Attack Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The consumption of small to
moderate amounts of alcohol lowers the risk of death in men who
have previously had a heart attack, U.S. scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology
Research and Information Center analyzed data on 5358 of 90,150
men from the U.S., who reported a history of heart attack and
provided details of alcohol intake.
</P>
<P>
They compared the results of these 5358 with those of the
remaining 84,792 men who had no history of heart attack or other
major illness.
</P>
<P>
After a five-year follow-up period, the researchers found that
moderate alcohol intake was associated with significant decreases
in mortality from both cardiovasular and non-cardiovasular causes.
</P>
<P>
"The maximum potential benefit of alcohol intake may be reached
by drinking two to six drinks per week," they reported in The
Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
However, the scientists do not recommend alcohol prescription
as a general measure for prevention of coronary artery disease.
</P>
<P>
"Specific recommendations should be tailored to individuals,
taking into account the potential risks of alcohol intake relative
to the likely benefits for cardiovascular mortality." they said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia to Hold Steel Talks Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
has agreed to a request by Russia to discuss how to avert penalty
tariffs on shipments of Russian steel into the United States, said
the Commerce Department Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Commerce Secretary Robert S. LaRussa will meet
in London next week with Russian trade officials to discuss a
proposal the Russian government has put forward to limit steel
shipments.
</P>
<P>
"The Russians have asked us to come talk about a variety of
things including suspension," said Commerce Department spokesman
Morrie Goodman.
</P>
<P>
Russia wants the United States to suspend a case brought by the
steel industry accusing Russia of dumping steel in the United
States, or selling steel at unfairly low prices.
</P>
<P>
The case, which won't finally be decided until next summer,
seeks stiff tariff increases on certain kinds of steel shipments
from Russia, Japan and Brazil to halt a flood of cheap imports.
</P>
<P>
Both President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have raised
the problems of the U.S. steel industry in meetings over the past
month with the leaders of Russia, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. steel industry has complained that imports are up 64
percent this year, pushing down domestic prices and threatening
thousands of U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
In response to the pressures from the domestic industry, the
House passed a nonbinding resolution in October asking Clinton to
impose one-year bans on low-cost steel imports from 10 nations.

<HEADLINE> U.S.,DPRK Make Progress in Talks, but Inconclusive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) have made progress in
six days of talks in the United States but reached no agreement on
the U.S. demand for access to an DPRK underground site, which U.S.
thinks could be part of a revived nuclear weapons program, the
State Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides recognized that progress was made and agreed to
meet again as soon as possible at a venue and date to be
determined," State Department spokesman James Foley told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The talks were conducted in a serious atmosphere. The United
States continued to require the complete resolution of our
concerns regarding the DPRK's suspect underground construction and
has made clear this will require access," Foley said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Although gaps remain, the parties approached the issues in a
problem-solving manner," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-DPRK talks started in New York last Friday. the
negotiators met there two days, then for two days in Washington
and then for another two days back in New York.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charles Kartman led the
U.S. negotiating team while the head of the DPRK team was Vice
Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has denied that the work at Kumchang-ri was not what
the United States had alleged to be possible revived nuclear
weapons program and asked Washington to promise 300 million U.S.
dollars if an inspection turned up no evidence that that the work
has related to the program.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Panel Passes Article to Impeach Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee voted 21-16 Friday to approve
Article One of an impeachment resolution, accusing President Bill
Clinton of perjury before a federal grand jury investigating the
Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
The committee then turned to proposed articles accusing Clinton
of lying under oath in the Paula Jones civil lawsuit, obstruction
of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
Democrats lamented the historic step. "Let history record that
I have fought against the impeachment of the president of the
United States in every way I know how," lawmaker Maxine Waters of
California said.
</P>
<P>
Defining the debate, committee chairman Henry Hyde said the
impeachment question boils down to the president's oath of office.
Clinton's conduct, he said, "cheapens the oath; it is a breach of
promise to tell the truth; it subverts our system of government."
</P>
<P>
The House will hold a meeting next Thursday to cast votes on
the Article One of Impeachment, where the outcome is too close to
call.
</P>
<P>
If approved by the House, the article would go to the Senate
for only the second impeachment trial of a president in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
The vote in the House will depend on a couple of dozen
Republican moderates. Many political experts still find it hard
to believe that the president will be impeached in defiance of
public opinion, just a few weeks after Republicans received a
rebuff from voters in mid-term elections and lost five seats in
the House.

<P>
This is the first launch to Mars by NASA in two years.
</P>
<P>
The Orbiter will arrive the red planet in September 1999 after
416 million miles' flight, and begin to track the movement of
water vapor and dust in the atmosphere over the entire planet for
a full Martian year, or 687 Earth days in a 260-mile-high orbit

</P>
<P>
The next spacecraft the Mars Polar Lander will be sent to Mars
on Jan. 3 1999 and land near the South Pole in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Officials from NASA said that both the Climate Orbiter and
Polar Lander will follow the water on the red planet, tracking how
water evaporates in the atmosphere, how it condenses at the poles.
If you want to look for life on another planet, you have to follow

energy, environment, transport, telecommunications and food
processing.
</P>
<P>
Under this program, about 1000 Russian managers will do
internships in European companies as part of the Managers Training
Program, and Russia-EU industrial joint ventures will receive
substantial support.

<HEADLINE> New Drug Gives Hope of Beating Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A new drug to combat flu has
been found to reduce symptoms and the duration of the infection
and its complications, according to a new study published Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new drug, zanamivir, which can be inhaled, was effective in
initial trials against A and B strains of influenza virus, the
most common flu types, a team from the MIST Study Group in
Australia, reported in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
It is the first of a new series of anti-viral drugs which work
by inhibiting an enzyme essential for virus replication.
</P>
<P>
The study involved 455 patients who visited their family
doctors with flu symptoms which had lasted for 36 hours or less
either took inhaled zanamivir or a placebo.
</P>
<P>
The patients took the treatment for five days and recorded
their symptoms on daily cards, and for another nine days after.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms in patients at high risk of developing flu-related
complications were alleviated about two-and-a-half days earlier
than in patients who took the placebo. They also had fewer
complications and used fewer antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
In patients at lower risk of complications, symptoms were
generally alleviated about one-and-a-half days earlier than those
who took the placebo.
</P>
<P>
Vaccinations are now available for flu, which affects much of
the world's population. But their effectiveness depends on how
closely they are matched to the stain of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Two drugs are also available against flu, but their use is
limited by side-effects, viral resistance and poor availability.
And neither of the current drugs are effective against strain B of
flu virus.

<HEADLINE> Diet Change May Help Prevent Cancer, Doctors Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Many cancers common in the
developed world can be attributed to environmental factors, which
means that they may be largely preventable, British doctors
claimed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Diet is one of the most important lifestyle factors, and up to
80 percent of the bowel, breast and prostate cancer cases may be
preventable by dietary change, researchers from Dunn Clinical
Nutrition Center in Cambridge, wrote in the British Medical
Journal.
</P>
<P>
The authors highlighted red and processed meats and alcohol as
the highest risk foods and cited a diet rich in vegetables and
fruit as the most protective against cancer.
</P>
<P>
The researchers also found that there is no evidence that
vitamin supplements help to prevent cancer.
</P>
<P>
Other environmental factors known to affect susceptibility to
cancer include physical activity, reproductive and sexual
behavior, infection with hepatitis B or C viruses and exposure to
sunlight and chemicals, the scientists said.

WASHINGTON, December 11 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-America
Development Bank (IDB) Friday announced it will provide up to some
3 billion U.S. dollars in financing and debt relief over the next
few years to Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
The resources will be provided to help those Hurricane Mitch
devastated countries rebuild and transform their economies.
</P>
<P>
IDB President Enrique Iglesias made the pledge at a donors
meeting held at the Bank to gather the international support for
Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica in the
wake of one of the worst natural catastrophes in its history.
</P>
<P>
The Consultative Group for the Reconstruction and
Transformation of Central America, which opened its first meeting
on Thursday, will hold a round of pledging on Friday afternoon.
Delegates from over 50 donor nations and multilateral
organizations will offer their support of grants, soft loans and
debt relief.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is providing the region
some 67 million dollars in short-term assistance with the promise
of more in 1999 while the World Bank promised to give up to 1
billion dollars in interest-free loans for the region.
</P>
<P>
The IDB lending program will devote about 2.5 billion dollars
over the next five years to finance programs in the countries hit
by Mitch. Honduras and Nicaragua, the worst-hit nations, will
receive concessional loans totaling about 1.3 billion dollars
during the period.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Greens Talk Over Party Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Greens began a
three-day party conference in Leipzig Friday amid a discussion
over reform plans in the party.
</P>
<P>
Members from the party's "realist" faction are calling for
Green members of parliament and the party's ministers in the Bonn
coalition government to be allowed to hold executive party office.
</P>
<P>
Executive leaders are opposing the plan which if accepted would
require a change in a basic principle of the Greens' statutes
which rule out party posts for members of parliament, according to
a report of DPA.
</P>
<P>
Bonn's parliamentary deputy speaker, Antje Vollmer, said in a
radio interview that the rule was the party's "most expensive and
most difficult" structure.
</P>
<P>
"I belong to those who think the party has probably lost weight
in the last few years as a result of our complicated regulation,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
However, Environment Minister Juergen Trittin, the outgoing
joint executive speaker, said the Greens should retain the
principle of division, but create a new party council to improve
coordination between the executive and the parliamentary faction.
</P>
<P>
Trittin said the coalition agreement with the SPD carried
"Green handwriting" in its essential points, but as the junior
partner in government the party had been forced to accept some
defeats including the issues of asylum policy and tax reforms.

<HEADLINE> EU Survey Shows Continued Fall of Economic Sentiment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 11 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU) survey
published today said that the economic sentiment in the 15-member
EU region fell in October for the third consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
The survey said the the economic indicator, the leading
indicator for the EU, fell back again in October mainly due to the
drop in industrial confidence in October.
</P>
<P>
The industrial confidence deteriorated in all EU countries and
the confidence decline was larger in the 15-member EU than in the
11-country euro-zone, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, confidence in construction sector fell as well and
share prices fell in the EU between September and October on a
monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
Though Consumer confidence in the EU improved in october,
managers in all member states were less optimistic in October than
in recent months, according to the survey. The industrial
confidence indicator for the EU fell below its long-term average
in October, whereas in the euro-zone it remained above average for
the last ten years.
</P>
<P>
And production expectations were revised down in all member
states except Luxembourg and Austria where an increase was noted.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that new orders in manufacturing industry
fell sharply again in October and are now below the long-term
average for the EU. For the euro-zone, the balance is still above
its long-term mean. sharp drop was also noted regarding export
volume expectations both for EU-15 and euro-11, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The Whole economic picture for the European Union region in
October implied a slower economic growth and a need of economic
policy adjustment. However, European consumers are still
optimistic on financial situation of households over next 12
months.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the expected general economic
situation was considered more positively than in September and an
improvement in the appropriateness to make major purchase over the
next 12 months was evident.
