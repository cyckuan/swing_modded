<HEADLINE> China Fail Again to Break South Korea Jinx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Kim Do Hoon's sole goal on Friday
gave South Korea a 1-0 win over China and maintained South Korea's
unbeaten record at the annual soccer conflict between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The striker turned around to cut into China's defence from the
right flank before he slotted past the goalkeeper Jiang Jin in the
66th minute.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean team, which will compete in the Sydney
Olympics in September, kept their glorious record against China,
who have never beaten their regional arch-rivals in the East Asia
for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
But South Korean coach Huh Jung Moo was not content with the
first-half performances of his inexperienced team.
</P>
<P>
"The star players hadn't good understandings with other
teammates, and I'm not satisfied with the first-half," said Huh. "
Things changed in the second half."
</P>
<P>
China had at least four clear chances to open the mark before
the interval. Li Jinyu had the best opportunity to score but his
powerful header was palmed away by the diving South Korean
goalkeeper Kim Yong Dae in the injury time of the first half.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't take the chances to find the goal, but a mistake in
the second half cost us the game," said the Chinese team coach
Bora Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic fielded eight substitutes in the second half and
China lost the control of the game after the changes.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to create a competitive atmosphere in the national
squad," Milutinovic said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavian, who led Mexico, Costa Rica and the United
States to the World Cup Finals before he came to China January,
did not comment on China's lackluster performances in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
He asked Xinhua reporter whether he saw the goalkeeper Kim won
the Player of the Match, and said that award gave the answer to
the final result.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Start Military Pullout From Georgia Since August 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia will begin to withdraw heavy
weapons and arms from its military bases in the former soviet
republic of Georgia since August 1, Russian news agencies reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
By December 31 this year, Russia will leave no more than 153
tanks, 241 military personnel carriers and 140 artillery systems
at the bases, Russian deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov told
journalists here after the third round of Russian-Georgian
negotiations on Russia's military withdrawal from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The two sides of the talks reached a consensus on pulling
Russia's military hardware out of Georgia today in Moscow, and
agreed that Russian troops are to be moved out from the Gudauta
base by July 1, 2001, announced Klebanov, also chief Russian
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
Moscow will firmly abide by the agreement signed with Georgia
in the Turkish port-city of Istanbul in November of 1999 to
gradually remove Russian weapons and technical equipment out of
Georgia's territory, he said.
</P>
<P>
Georgia should guarantee the security for Russia's military
withdrawal, Klebanov stressed.
</P>
<P>
The dates for pulling Russian troops out of their bases at
Batumi and Akhalkalaki were not discussed during the third round
of bilateral negotiations. Under the Istanbul accord, Russia and
Georgia will set the deadlines for dismantling those bases by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of the negotiations will be held in late
September or early October in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi,said
the deputy premier.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican AIDS Cases Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Acquired Immuno-Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) cases are increasing rapidly in Costa Rica, said
Saturday the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry said in a bulletin that 38 new cases of
people infected by the malady of the century were recorded during
the first semester of the year.
</P>
<P>
The total number of AIDS cases accumulated in the country
between 1983 and July 15 of 2000 amounted to 1,830 with the 38 new
cases discovered. Of this number, 1,608 cases are men and 222 are
women.
</P>
<P>
Health Ministry's AIDS Control Office data show that 120 cases
were notified in 1999, while 252 cases were reported in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, those figures are far from being exact, because some
private and state hospitals failed to report the cases, admitted
Xinia Carvajal, Health vice minister.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican capital registers more cases of AIDS, with 1,
077 people affected, which is 60 percent of the national total,
followed by the provinces of Alajuela with 197 cases, and Heredia,
with 151, the two zones closer to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
Carvajal also announced that the cases of AIDS among women have
increased. Only 18 women were infected in 1994, the next year were
29, in 1996 they were 36, and the figure rose to 47 in 1997. Last
year there were only 22 cases recorded, apart of those not
reported.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republican Party Finishes Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The platform committee of the U.
S. Republican Party put the final touches on a platform Saturday
in line with the "compassionate conservatism" proposed by the
party's presidential candidate George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
After a lobbying blitz that involved Texas Governor Bush
himself, the committee restored Bush's education principles in the
platform, which were stripped by a panel a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
The platform includes a six-point program on the subject,
including improving literacy, transforming federal programs into
flexible grants, offering Education Savings Accounts and defending
the option for home schooling.
</P>
<P>
However, the party's hard-line conservatives retain its tough
positions against abortion, homosexuality and sex education.
</P>
<P>
The Republican platform, in an uncompromising stand against
abortion rights, calls for an amendment to the Constitution that
would outlaw abortion.
</P>
<P>
On gun safety, the platform affirmed the right to bear arms,
but recognized "the individual responsibility to safely use and
store firearms" and proposed to crack down on youth violence.
</P>
<P>
The platform was expected to be formally adopted by the
Republican Party at its convention scheduled to be held in
Philadelphia from July 31 to August 3.
</P>
<P>
U.S. party platforms are considered to be general principles,
rather than a manifesto to be implemented once in office.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Clinton's Remark on Moving Embassy to Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Saturday condemned U.S. President Bill Clinton's Friday
remark that he is considering moving U.S. embassy to Israel from
Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Clinton's remark is a clear indication of the fact that the U.
S. is playing with the high goals and ideals of the Palestinian
people," Kharrazi said, quoted by the official Islamic Republic
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that Jerusalem belongs to all Muslims and the
sovereignty of the Palestinian people over it is a symbol of their
deep love for and commitment to the Islamic ideals.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that the creation of an independent Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital is a primary right of the
Palestinians and no power could prevent realization of this
objective.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister also blasted the U.S. for putting
pressure on Palestinians during the recent Camp David summit,
saying that the failure of the talks revealed the true face of the
summit broker.
</P>
<P>
"After failing to achieve their evil aims in the Camp David
summit, Israel and the U.S. are trying to find a way to realize
their objectives," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said it has been made clear that any decision taken
against the will of the Palestinians would remain fruitless despite
pressures on them.
</P>
<P>
He called for the strict implementation of the United Nations
resolutions and the Organization of the Islamic Conference
resolutions concerning Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the international community and the Muslim states
to do their utmost to defeat the realization of the Israeli
expansionist polices and foil its efforts to eliminate the values
of the divine religions and the first kiblah of Muslims
(Jerusalem).
</P>
<P>
Iran, which does not recognize Israel, has strongly opposed the
Middle East peace talks and called for armed struggle to "liberate
the Islamic and Arab lands occupied by Israel."

CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish Environment Minister Fevzi Aytekin said on
Saturday that Spain had extended a 72-million-U.S.-dollar loan for
the Tuz Lake reprocessing plant project in central Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia News Agency quoted Aytekin as saying that the project
is aimed at preventing the environmental pollution of the lake.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary feasibility report will be prepared and the tender
for the project will be opened within three months, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, which is believed to be the biggest
environment investment scheme in Turkey, a number of waste
treatment plants will be built in different places surrounding the
lake.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The Yemeni government has decided to privatize 80
percent of the Yemeni National Bank (YNB), the biggest state-owned
bank in Yemen, said a banking source.
</P>
<P>
Local media Saturday quoted the source as saying that the
cabinet has agreed to offer 60 percent of the bank's assets to
strategic partners, and 20 percent for public underwriting, while
the remaining 20 percent will be kept by the government.
</P>
<P>
Saudi businessman Mahfouz Bin Salem Mahfouz, the owner of the
Saudi Lebanese Bank, is expected to acquire 60 percent of YNB's
stake, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The YNB, established in 1969, has a total of 31 branches
throughout Yemen.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Former Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and State
Minister Tunca Toskay on Saturday inaugurated a Free Trade Zone
near the Black Sea Port of Samsun.
</P>
<P>
In the 73,000-square-kilometer zone, there are bonded
warehouses, 10 business places, 25 offices, a bank building, open
depots and production area.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Toskay said: "The Port of
Samsun, which is the fifth biggest port of Turkey, is the door to
the North. The annual trade volume of Samsun amounts to 500 million
U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
The minister predicted that the free trade zone will have an
annual trade volume of 8 billion dollars and employ 17,000 people.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The civil aviation authorities of Libya and Algeria
have signed a draft agreement for resuming air flights within the
next few days between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The flights, operated by the Libyan Airlines and the Algerian
Airways, were suspended for about eight years due to the U.N.
sanctions imposed against Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan News Agency monitored here said that under the
agreement, the two airlines should refrain from activities which
might result in stopping the commercial flights between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that the two sides should observe the
obligations as member states of the Maghreb Union whose space is
open to all Maghreb members without any restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Syria Seeks to Make Peace with Israel Soon: Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President Mohammed
Zouhair Musharaqah said on Saturday that Syria seeks to achieve
peace with Israel as soon as possible, but it will not cede its
territory.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the second conference of the
Arab Ministers of Education, Musharaqah said "The Arab nation is
facing diverse challenges which require common cooperation,
solidarity and joint actions so as to overcome hurdles and
barriers."
</P>
<P>
He described the liberation of the Arab territories occupied by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East war as the biggest challenge facing
with the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is a strategic goal for Syria and the Arab nation as a
whole. Syria seeks a just and comprehensive peace based on
international legitimate resolutions," said Musharaqah at the
conference, sponsored by the Arab Organization for Education,
Culture and Science.
</P>
<P>
He renewed the call for Israel to pull out from the Golan
Heights, a strategic plateau Israel captured from Syria in the 1967
Middle East war, and other occupied territories, so as to realize
security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Israel of shrugging off its commitments to a
just and comprehensive peace in the region and the implementation
of international legitimate resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Unfair and unjust peace will never lead to security and
stability. Syria is not ready to pay for the failure of the Israeli
government to take decisions to push peace forward," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian negotiations, which were resumed last
December after an almost four-year hiatus, were suspended
indefinitely last January. Differences between the two parties were
centered on the control over the northeastern shore of Lake
Tiberias, Israel's main source of water.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa on Saturday reiterated Tanzania's position over the Taiwan
issue, saying it will firmly support the Chinese government's one
China policy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Rear Admiral Huang Jiang, Commander of the visiting
Chinese naval ships, Mkapa said his government supported all the
measures taken by the Chinese government and its armed forces to
deter the authorities of Taiwan from seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
"We have followed closely the development on Taiwan and let me
take this opportunity again to tell you that we are very disturbed
by the utterance during the elections in Taiwan, and to reaffirm
to you that an important pillar of our relations is our total
support for one China," the president told Huang and Chinese
Ambassador to Tanzania Wang Yongqiu who paid him a courtesy visit.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa extended his warm welcome to the Chinese fleet, which
made Dar es Salaam its first stop of a historic visit to Africa,
saying "it is a reflection of the true friendship between the
people of our two countries and of the great cooperation that
exists between the governments of our two countries".
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with the bilateral cooperation,
especially in the military sector.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Huang also met General Robert Mboma, Commander in
Chief of Tanzanian People's Defense Forces.

Tanzania, consists of the Shenzhen DDG167, China's newest guided-
missile destroyer, and Nancang AOG953, China's largest assorted
supply ship.
</P>
<P>
They were greeted by Tanzanian Navy Commander RADM Ligate Sande
and other senior officers along with hundreds of overseas Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Nude Photos Controversial in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- University freshman Zhen Zhen
just had her photo taken in the nude, something she plans to haul
out in the future to remind herself of those younger, firmer days.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old resident of southwest China's Chongqing city
says that even though she did travel 500 kilometers to the Sichuan
provincial capital Chengdu -- where no one would know her -- to
pose for a local photographer, there's nothing wrong with nude
photos, they aren't necessarily expensive, and it's not illegal.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's indecent," sniffs her mother, Chen, who was
cleaning her daughter's room when she came across the photo in a
bookcase.
</P>
<P>
Like others of her generation, Chen says the popularity of nude
photographs among young people is just one more sign of moral
decay in modern China.
</P>
<P>
Zhen says she just wants a record of her history, and her
boyfriend, who accompanied her on the photo shoot, says it's
nobody's business but Zhen's.
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the argument, a 50-year-old teacher from
Sichuan Education College, who declined to give her name, said
young people should focus their attention on their studies. "
Taking nude photos cannot be simply explained as degeneration; it
reflects unhealthy psyches," she commented.
</P>
<P>
Other girls in Chongqing are even braver than Zhen, deciding to
get their pictures taken in the nude by hometown photographers.
</P>
<P>
Liu Mei had her photograph taken in the nude as a 19th birthday
present to herself. The total cost for the pictures was 1,000 yuan
(about 120 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nude photo fees range from several hundred to several thousand
yuan.

A journalist said she had many nude photos taken during her
pregnancy. "It is my history, and also the growth history of my
daughter," she said. "I would have done as Zhen Zhen has done if
people in my time lived the way they live today."
</P>
<P>
Nude art has always been a very sensitive topic in China.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese exhibition of nude paintings in the mid-1980s stirred
up the hottest debate ever over this branch of art. The husband of
a women who had modeled nude for some of the paintings threatened
her with divorce when she was recognized by others in the pictures.
</P>
<P>
To date, there is no law in China which prohibits taking nude
photos.
</P>
<P>
"Taking nude photos is a serious art," said He Shan, a
photographer in Chengdu. "It is a challenge both for the
photographer and his client," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the work is strictly monitored from the beginning
to the end. He is helped by three female assistants when taking
photos, and negatives and damaged photos from each shoot are
usually destroyed in front of the clients.
</P>
<P>
Ge Peng, a photographer from the Yuan Ye photo studio in
Chengdu who snapped Zhen Zhen's pictures, said he has a problem
with people's double standards when it comes to nudity in art.
</P>
<P>
"Men and women all appreciate nudity in paintings, so what's
wrong with it in photographs?" he asked.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Closely Watching Kashmir Developments: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Reaffirming its support for
Kashmiris' struggle against the Indian rule, Pakistan Saturday
said it has been closely following Kashmir-related events since
India released the leaders of a major Kashmiri group, All Parties
Hurriyet Conference (APHC).
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has been closely following events since the Indian
decision to release APHC leaders, which was a positive development,
" Foreign Office spokesman Riaz Muhammad Khan told a press
briefing here.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, the spokesman said Pakistan supports
the demand of APHC leadership for its involvement in any dialogue
between Islamabad and New Delhi for the settlement of Kashmir
dispute.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian government has also made contacts with some
APHC leaders following their release. "To our information, in
response, the APHC leadership has maintained a firm position on
its principles."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman again demanded India to "reduce and stop
oppression in Indian-held Kashmir and violations of human rights
which are taking place at a massive scale."
</P>
<P>
"We have yet to see any relenting in this regard on the ground,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the recent offer of cease-fire and talks to India
from Hizbul Mujahideen, the biggest Kashmiri military group, Khan
rejected the speculations that Pakistan had a hand behind the
offer.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan does not exercise any control over freedom fighters
and such speculations are totally baseless," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declined to comment on the offer and said, "that
is a matter for Kashmiri leadership to decide as part of dynamics
of their struggle. We do not wish to comment on that further."
</P>
<P>
APHC, the 23-party conglomerate which Pakistan recognizes as
the political representative of Kashmiris, has said that it will
welcome talks between the Indian government and Hizbul Mujahideen,
but maintained that it should not be marginalized in the affair.

<HEADLINE> Official Urges Adherence to United Front Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
urged people to follow the united front policy, one of the three
major principles of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
"United front," "armed struggle" and "Party building" were
known as "three magic weapons" of the CPC in its decades-long
revolution against the Kuomintang regime before 1949.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, a vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and
head of the CPC Central Committee's United Front Department, made
the call in an article to be published by Seeking Truth, a leading
ideological magazine in China.
</P>
<P>
Titled "The Patriotic United Front Has Remained A Major Magic
Weapon for the Party in the New Era," the article highlights the
importance of the united front as it relates to "the leading
status of the Party and the consolidation of the people's regime."
</P>
<P>
Under the united front, non-communist parties are allowed to
participate in the state administration under the leadership of
the CPC, which ensures that the Party and the government make
decision in a more democratic and scientific manner, according to
Wang.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that so far over 120,000 non-communist
party figures have joined in people's congresses at all levels,
over 240,000 are members of people's political consultative bodies
at different levels, and over 9,000 are working on leading
government positions of different levels.
</P>
<P>
The united front also concerns the unity among Chinese of
different ethnic groups and of different religious beliefs, social
stability, and territorial integrity, Wang said in the article. (

<TEXT>
<P>
China has 56 ethnic groups and over 100 million believers of
different religions, correcting implementing the united front
policy will help tackle the ethnic and religious issues that are
long-term, complicated and sensitive, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The official also called for vigilance against the activities
of separatists who attempt to damage China's national unity and
territorial integrity, with the support of international anti-
China forces.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the united front is also related to the great
cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1970s, when the reform and opening-up drive was
launched, the united front organizations have upheld the banner of
patriotism to win over the people and promote the exchanges
between the people of the Chinese mainland and the compatriots
from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and foreign countries, which served
to boost the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the
motherland, according the official.
</P>
<P>
To carry out the united front policy, Wang noted, efforts
should be made to consolidate the leading status of the public
ownership in China's economy and promote the healthy development
of the private sector. Private enterprises that have developed
rapidly since late 1978 have employed more than 80 million people
throughout the country. They are expected to play a bigger role in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Under the united front policy, the initiative of China's
intellectuals, a majority of whom are non-communists, will be
brought under full play, which will guarantee the implementation
of the CPC's strategy to rejuvenate the nation by relying on
science and education, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> New Project Launched to Protect Environment Along Great Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A new environmental protection
promotion project got underway today at the Great Wall, the proud
symbol of China's national spirit.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony of the Great Wall Green Project was held
at Hushan section of the Great Wall, which was built in the Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644), in Dandong city in northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
In the project, journalists and experts will tour the Great
Wall, focusing especially on studying the wall's surrounding
environment, and a documentary will be filmed of the trip by China
Central Television (CCTV).
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall, the only man-made structure visible from the
moon, stretches for 6,000 km, rising and falling, twisting and
turning along the ridges of the Yanshan and Yinshan Mountain
chains, traversing Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi,
Hebei and Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall was rebuilt many times through the centuries;
about one-third of it disappeared and many sections have suffered
serious damage from wind and water erosion, as well as man-made
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection, afforestation and ecological
improvement are urgently needed to protect the ancient wall.
</P>
<P>
Today's venture was initiated by 22 Chinese well-known
scientists last year, and was jointly sponsored by the State
Forestry Administration, the China Great Wall Society, the
Environment and Resources Protection Committee under the National
People's Congress (NPC) and China Central Television (CCTV).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asia-Pacific Countries Urged to Keep Security  Momentum Already Achieved  by Yang Qingchuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 29 (Xinhua) -- As an annual series of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN) meetings closed
here Saturday, encouraging signs are in sight in promoting
political, security and economic dialogue within the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Starting with the 33rd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) on July
24, the meetings also include ASEAN+3 (China, Japan and the
Republic of Korea), the 7th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and ASEAN
meetings with its 10 dialogue partners as a group or separately.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the first attendance of the People's Democratic
Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the 23-member ARF marked a great
achievement of the meetings and a big step forward toward
reconciliation and peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers welcomed the participation for the first time of
the DPRK at the 7th ARF Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok," said a
Chairman's Statement released at the closing of the 7th ARF on
July 27.
</P>
<P>
On sidelines of the meetings, for the first time in over half a
century, the DPRK foreign minister held historical talks with his
South Korean, Japanese and U.S. counterparts, which was widely
hailed by the meeting participants as well as the local media.
</P>
<P>
Also during the meetings, Canada announced its formal
recognition of DPRK, while New Zealand expressed its intention to
establish diplomatic relations with it.
</P>
<P>
To the expectation of political observers here, many
participants voiced deep concerns about the threat of the U.S.
Theater Missile Defense (TMD) and National Missile Defense (NMD)
systems posed to international peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
reiterated China's firm opposition to TMD and NMD, saying the
issue "with endless disasters" is not between the U.S. and China
only, but rather between the U.S. and the world.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of all ASEAN members, Thai foreign minister Surin
Pitsuwan also expressed the grouping's worry toward this kind of "
military buildup."
</P>
<P>
However, progresses were seen in the discussions about other
security issues such as the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free
Zone, situations in East Timor, plans for a drug-free ASEAN in
2015.
</P>
<P>
Social problems consist another important aspect of the region
security, participants noted.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that poverty, social and economic deprivation,
transnational crime, trafficking of women and children, drug
trafficking, "digital divide," diseases and other social
challenges are undermining human security and threatening the well-
being of society of the region.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, they called for a greater cooperation within
ASEAN and with its 10 dialogue partners to push forward a human
agenda, and develop the region in a more comprehensive way.
</P>
<P>
Globalization is also considered as an important factor
affecting the stability and security of the region, which is
recovering from the financial crisis which, started three years
ago, also has brought the ASEAN and East Asian countries more
closer in a common wish to create a more stable and prosperous
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, ASEAN held talks with China, Japan and the
Republic of Korea as a whole and separately, which yielded
agreements to enhance cooperation in various fields, such as human
resource development, the sub-Mekong region development plan,
finance cooperation, among others.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN meetings also witnessed advances in cooperation
between the region and the outside world. Along with the meetings,
Laos and Cambodia were accepted to a cooperation agreement between
ASEAN and the European Union, a positive sign for closer region-to-
region ties.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that the overall security outlook for the Asia-
Pacific region remains positive, uncertainties and challenges
require enhanced dialogues among countries in the region so as to
keep the momentum already achieved, the participants said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Angry at Senate Mass Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Alarmed at revelations of contract
scam and profligacy emerging from the ongoing senate probe,
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo said he had been vindicated
in his rejection of the bloated 2000 budget of the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Saturday quoted him as saying in Abuja on Friday
that "some of the things happening now show that I was right in
putting my feet down on the budget".
</P>
<P>
The president had a long-drawn battle with the legislature over
certain aspects of the budget, especially the increase in the
allocation to the assembly from four billion naira (about 40
million U.S. dollars) made by the executive to 26 billion naira
they allocated to themselves.
</P>
<P>
He finally signed into law the budget in May after the
lawmakers soft-pedaled.
</P>
<P>
Nigerians, benumbed by reports of massive looting of the
national treasury by former military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha, his
family and officials of his administration, have reacted with
anger to the revelation of massive corruption in the country' s
top legislature. Many non-governmental organizations in the
country have pushed for a call that corrupt senators are taken to
court.
</P>
<P>
Testimonies at the seven-member panel, which began sitting in
Abuja Monday, have revealed that some 13 senators shared the 319
million naira capital appropriation for the upper house of the
assembly, in form of contract allocation.
</P>
<P>
They include the self allocation of 35.9 million naira as "
welfare" package for Senate President Chuba Okadigbo and his
deputy, Haruna Abubakar, inflation of a street lighting contract
from 55 million naira to 173 million naira and the award of
contracts to unregistered companies, some of them owned by the
lawmakers.

LAGOS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian armed forces personnel who

</P>
<P>
Already, about 250 soldiers and officers have been caught by
the military police in the web of an exercise tagged Operation
checkmate.
</P>
<P>
The size of Nigeria force is said to be well below the official

<HEADLINE> Putin Calms Business Elite by Admitting Privatization Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on
Friday assured the country's business oligarchs that there will be
no revision of the privatization results coming out after the
former Soviet Union collapse, praising their positive role in
strengthening Russia's statehood.
</P>
<P>
"The authorities are not planning to revise the results of the
privatization of state property auctioned off in the early 1990s,
but oppose the abuse of state apparatus by big businessmen for
their private interests," Putin told a meeting with Russia's
leading business oligarchs in the Kremlin Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
"The president reaffirmed to the heads of Russia's major
companies and commercial banks that the government has no
intention to revise the results of privatization. But he described
as inadmissible the situation in which competing companies try to
use the state apparatus and law-enforcement agencies to its own
ends in competition," Putin's press service said in a statement
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Putin asked the businessmen to spell out their proposals on "
statute of limitations" for economic delinquency, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"During the first five years of reform, the country lived by
some obscure laws. Economic transformation has taken place
somewhere fairly and somewhere unfairly. If things were redone,
there would be a mess," Kakha Bendukidze, head of the company
Unified Engineering Plants, told journalists after attending the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Russia's leading businessmen are playing a positive role in
strengthening the Russian statehood, he cited Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the meeting also agreed to set up a
permanent workable mechanism of consultations between the
authorities and business, Putin's press service said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, under Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov's
proposal, decided to form an advisory body -- a Council of
Industrialists and Other Entrepreneurs attached to the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the business elite, Putin "stressed the need
for the Russian business circle to realize its responsibility for
maintaining social stability in the country and the growth of the
well-being of Russian citizens," the press service said.
</P>
<P>
The president pledged to guarantee his support and
comprehensive assistance to companies and banks guided by the
government's interests in their activity.
</P>
<P>
Boris Nemtsov, deputy speaker of the State Duma, the lower
house of the parliament, told the press that Friday's meeting
between Putin and Russia's leading businessmen actually means "the
end of the revolutionary period of re-distribution of property in
Russia."
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov, one of the leaders of the Union of Right Forces and
one of the meeting initiators, said the most important outcome of
the conference is the president's clear and unequivocal statement
on the revision of the results of privatization.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, "this creates stable and predictable conditions
for the country's economic development, for the repatriation of
fugitive capital, and for attracting foreign investments."
</P>
<P>
Other leading Russian businessmen also positively assessed the
results of the meeting with Putin.
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, head of the famous Yukos oil company,
said he believes that the political risks of investments in Russia
will lower after the meeting.

MADRID, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Spanish club Barcelona on Saturday
turned down AC Milan's 44 million U.S. dollars bid for Brazilian

<P>
BERLIN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Briton David Coulthard took the
pole position for Sunday's German Formula One Grand Prix after the
McLaren driver made the advantage of the weather to win the
qualifying session in Hockenheim, Germany, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Coulthard drove his Mercedes around the 6.825-kilometer circuit
in one minute 45.697 seconds when rain hit the Hockenheim course.
</P>
<P>
But the weather became worse quickly after the first few
minutes. Some part of the circuit were drenched by a shower, on
another section there was light rain and some parts were dry under
sunny skies.
</P>
<P>
With 35 minute left in the one-hour session, a heavy rain fell
as the crews waited for the weather to stabilize.
</P>
<P>
The rain stopped with seven minute left in the session, but no
car matched the best time Coulthard set in the early part.
</P>
<P>
In the last minute, world championship leader Michael
Schumacher, a master of driving on wet conditions, clocked the
second best time of the day in 1:47.063.
</P>
<P>
Giancarlo Fisichella of Italy was third in his Benetton, in 1:

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Pursues First Olympic Title in Third Outing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Lance Armstrong, consecutive
winner of the Tour de France, on Friday announced his intention of
competing at the 2000 Sydney Games for his first-ever medal in the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who captured his second straight victory in the 23-
day cycling race only days ago, said in New York that "this is my
third Olympics. The first two were disappointments. I would like
to have Olympic glory in my career."
</P>
<P>
The world's premier road cyclist is surely to be named to the U.
S. Olympic team on Tuesday, when the four remaining road racing
team slots are filled.
</P>
<P>
At the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Armstrong finished 14th in
the men's individual road race. Four years later, he was 12th in
that event and sixth in the individual time trial.
</P>
<P>
It was soon after the Atlanta Games that he learned he had
testicular cancer, which spread through his body and into his
brain.
</P>
<P>
"In 1996, two months before I was diagnosed, the illness was
raging," he said. "It's not that I felt bad but I didn't compete
well. It's great to go back as a cured person or a healthy person.
"
</P>
<P>
Armstrong will be a favorite in the individual time trial.
American men have traditionally not performed well in the Olympic
road events, earning just three road race medals in the Olympic
history.

<HEADLINE> Qingdao Port Becomes World's 16th Largest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Port of Qingdao in east China
's Shandong Province has become the 16th-largest in the world with
a handling capacity of over 100 million tons of cargo a year.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao Mayor Wang Jiarui said here today that the port now has
navigation routes to more than 400 ports in 130 countries and
regions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The port's container handling capacity has been increasing at
an annual rate of about 30 percent to 40 percent in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the port handled 1.54 million (twenty-feet equivalent
unit) TEUs, ranking second in China, compared with 80,000 TEUs a
decade ago. And all of the world's top ten container shipping
companies are doing business with the port.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said the rapid growth of the port has further
stimulated the city's opening-up and development pace.
</P>
<P>
As an important coastal city in north China, marine economy
plays a pivotal role in Qingdao's overall economy. Statistics show
that in 1999, the city's marine industry output value reached 20.
66 billion yuan, and the sector's value-added output amounted to 9.
92 billion yuan, accounting for 10 percent of the city's gross
domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Marine Economy Plays Big Role in China's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The marine industry will account
for five percent of China's gross domestic product this year,
according to Chen Qingtai, deputy director of the Development
Research Center of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
In a report submitted to an International Forum on Marine
Science and Economy, which is scheduled to open here on Sunday,
Chen said that China's marine economy has seen rapid growth over
the past two decades. In 1998, the total output value of China's
marine industry reached 310.4 billion yuan (37 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Director of the National Bureau of Oceanography Wang Shuguang
also said that the marine economy has become one of China's new
economic growth points over the past decade. Marine output
increased five-fold between the early 1980s and late 1990s, he
added.
</P>
<P>
As the world's most populous country, China's average per
capita land resource is lower than the world's level. So the
marine economy plays a strategic role in the country's national
economy and social development, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is a good prospect for China to develop its
marine economy because it has 18,000 km of coastline and rich
marine resources.

will focus effort on studying methods to tackle seawater erosion
during the development of marine resources, an official from the

Seawater causes huge losses each year because it erodes marine
equipment. The losses are much higher than those caused by
typhoons and other natural disasters, the official said.

seamless manner, 24 hours a day and seven days a week," he said,
adding that under a citizen-centric approach, the design of the
ESD interface would be easy and simple to facilitate public use.
</P>
<P>
The government has installed public computer facilities at
convenient public places, such as district offices, community
centers, public libraries and post offices.
</P>
<P>
As regards security, the ESD will adopt a comprehensive network
security and monitoring system and all personal data will be
encrypted in the process of transmission. All ESD transactions
will be secure.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, the government plans to extend the ESD to all
public services which are amenable to electronic mode of delivery.
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, private sector operators can use the ESD
system to provide business services, thereby facilitating and
promoting the development of e-commerce and making Hong Kong a
leading digital city in the 21st century," Siu stressed.

SuperStar Leo was welcoming a new group of passengers, who would
take a leisure cruise on the high seas Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Having a week long tiring work, the passengers find a shelter
for relaxation on board of SuperStar Leo. The 13-deck vessel, the
largest luxurious cruise ship in the Asia-Pacific, would take them
away from the noisy urban site to enjoy a tranquil, but exciting
lifestyle on the sea.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
"Cruise travel is forming a new vogue for recreation in the
Asia-Pacific. Hong Kong people become very happy with it," said
Magnus Gottberg, captain of SuperStar Leo.
</P>
<P>
Captain Gottberg, from Sweden, began to work as passenger
captain in 1983 and has been captain of SuperStar Leo since its
delivery in September 1998. He told Xinhua that SuperStar Leo is
different from other passenger ships, and it aims to bring the
free and easier cruising pleasure to passengers.

<P>
SuperStar Leo is owned by Malaysia-based Star Cruises.
Incorporated in September 1993, it has grown to a leading cruise
line in the Asia-Pacific, representing a bold initiative to tap
Asia-Pacific's potential as an international cruise destination.

which makes it possible for us to reach the destinations overnight.
</P>
<P>
"Sailing from Hong Kong in the afternoon, we can arrive in
China's southern ports of Sanya or Xiamen the day after. No other

<P>
SuperStar Leo won increasing popularity in Hong Kong, he said,

summer season.
</P>

who take the cruise two or three times," he said.
</P>
<P>
When the night was falling, the restaurants on board began to
serve dinner with a variety of Western and Asian food. All
passengers are free to take meals at two main dining rooms,
Windows and Garden Restaurants, in addition to the casual dining
at the Raffles Buffet.
</P>
<P>
SuperStar Leo also offers the most number of "alternative
dining" restaurants compared with any other cruise ship with four
"alternative dining" outlets serving Chinese, Japanese and French
cuisine. The prices at these restaurants are similar to hotels in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
After meal, a wonderful singing and dancing performance staged
at the Moulin Rouge Showroom. A four-person band was playing the
latest pop music at the Galaxy of the Stars Night Club. Many
youngsters, returning from the swimming pool on board, had fun at
the Celebrity Disco.

<P>
Moreover, the stores on board were attracting passengers with a
wide selection of brand names like Gucci, Fossil and Nautica at
very special prices.

For the convenience of passengers, the magnetic card serves as
both the room key and credit card on board. Passengers can make
payment anywhere on SuperStar Leo with the card.
</P>
<P>
Captain Gottberg said Star Cruises pursues the highest level of
service for each passenger.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 1st lead: Two Filipino Journalists Freed  EDS: Updates With Details, Background </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Two Filipino journalists were freed
Saturday afternoon by the Abu Sayyaf after nearly one week in
captivity in the group's jungle camp in Jolo island in the
southern province of Sulu, a local TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
The ABS-CBN news channel said the release of its cameraman Val
Cuenca and researcher-writer Maan Macapagal were secured without
paying any ransom to the Muslim extremist group.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf was said to have demanded a ransom of 10 million
pesos (about 220,000 U.S. dollars) for the freedom of the two
journalist, who were abducted Monday reportedly by a splinter
group of the Abu Sayyaf after conducting an interview with
Commander Radulan Sahiron in Patikul town, Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said he
personally handled talks for the release of the two Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf Thursday freed German journalist Andres Lorenz
of Der Spiegel weekly magazine, who was kidnapped on July 2. It
has previously released six Malaysians and one German woman from
the original group of 21 mostly foreign hostages seized on April
23 from Malaysia's resort island of Sipadan.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are holding the 14 remaining hostages abducted in
Malaysia -- three Malaysians, two Germans, two French, two Finns,
two South Africans, one Lebanese and two Filipinos. They have also
in their hands three French TV journalists who visited their lair
on July 9.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said negotiations for the release of the hostages
are still on-going. He expressed optimism that they may be freed
in two weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Aventajado moved to implement a four-point guideline
for journalists covering the hostage crisis to prevent further
abductions in the province. He urged all journalists to leave Jolo,
saying police and military cannot guarantee their safety.
</P>
<P>
The chief negotiator warned that armed groups separate from the
Abu Sayyaf, lured by the prospect of making easy money on
kidnapping, have been operating in Jolo as the military fell back
from encircling the rebels.

<HEADLINE> UAE Newspaper Calls on Europe to Broker Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A major daily of the United Arab
Emirates Saturday said the stability of the Middle East is a great
concern of Europe, whose interests in the region and relations with
regional countries will make it a fair broker of peace.
</P>
<P>
As no breakthrough was made at the Camp David summit, Washington
has begun to unleash threats against the Palestinians should they
unilaterally declare independence, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton said the Palestinians will
be making a "big mistake" if they declare independence
unilaterally, and he is reviewing whether to move the U.S. Embassy
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Dhabi-based Al Ittihad said that instead of trying to
broker peace between Arabs and Israelis single-handedly, the U.S.
should seek help from others by admitting the issue is far beyond
its capability.
</P>
<P>
Since the Middle East is an international strategic region,
whose stability is a great concern of the whole world, especially
Europe, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat paid a visit to France,
recognizing the great role Paris can play in rallying European
support and assistance in bringing peace to the region, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Based on its good relations with all the parties concerned in
the issue, Europe has a role to play, especially after observing
that all the efforts so far exerted were focused on making one side
to make concessions while the other continues to benefit from such
concessions, it added.
</P>
<P>
The paper doubted the fairness of American mediation in the
peace process, saying it is high time that Washington gives way to
the Europeans to try their hands on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"A broker of peace in international conflicts must meet certain
conditions, the first of which is to be fair and just, and there is
no reason why Arab diplomacy should not start looking for a multi-
national mediator, who will relentlessly and truly work with both
parties for a just and comprehensive peace," the paper concluded.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN-Dialogue Partners Meetings Close in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reviewing the achievements of the past days, Surin said one of
the major happening in Bangkok was the appearance of the
Democratic People's republic of Korea (DPRK), a country that is to
positively participate in the discussions of regional security
issues.
</P>
<P>
DPRK and other countries have pledged to continue the momentum
already achieved in Asia stability, he said, stressing this means
that DPRK's presence is a continuation of the efforts of the inter-
Korean summit in June.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the ASEAN "Troika" approved at the
current foreign ministers meeting, Surin said the regional
organization's members are still working on it closely, suggesting
the Troika does not constitute a mechanism of decision-making, but
a consultative organ to tackle regional ad hoc questions of
security nature.
</P>
<P>
At the meetings, Surin said, a series of other bilateral and
multilateral issues were also discussed by the participants,
particularly those on regional security, human resources, small
arms trafficking, human-being smuggling and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from 10 ASEAN member countries and its 10 dialogue
partners took part in the press conference, at which, issues like
globalization, technology gap, EU-ASEAN cooperation and illegal
drugs were also raised.
</P>
<P>
The closing of the meeting between ASEAN and its dialogue
partners also means the ending of ASEAN's a series of meetings
that include the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM); the ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF) between ASEAN and its 10 dialogue partners:
China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, the United States, Australia,
Canada, the European Union, India, New Zealand, and other
countries; and the Post Ministerial Conferences (PMC). They were
convened here from July 23 to 29.

<P>
Answering a question at the 33rd ASEAN Post Ministerial
Conferences (PMC) joint conference, Wang Yi stated that the
development of the two missile systems by the U.S. will lead to a
new round of arms race and do disservice to global peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
But, Wang stressed, the NMD, TMD issue is not an issue existing
between China and the United States only, rather an issue between
the international community and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he hoped that the United States could carefully
listen to the voice of the international community and give
serious consideration to the NMD, TMD issue.
</P>
<P>
On China's relations with ASEAN countries, he said, China is
willing to develop relations oriented towards the 21st century in
the spirit of good neighborly partnership of mutual trust, mutual
benefit and mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As all of them are developing countries, the assistant added,
China believes that there is much room for furthering relations
with the ASEAN nations, particularly in the areas of finance,
science and technology, human resources, and the development of
the Mekong region.
</P>
<P>
He said he is optimistic about the future of China's relations
with ASEAN countries because they have common interests not only
in the Asia-Pacific region, but also in the world arena.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers or their representatives from ASEAN members
and its ten dialogue partners including China were present at the
press conference.

NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has welcomed the decision by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
to resume aid to Kenya, local newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo announced Friday that the
IMF had approved a three-year loan amounting to 198 million U.S.
dollars to Kenya under the poverty reduction and growth facility.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205-million-dollar loan to Kenya in July
1997 due to poor governance and high-level corruption.
</P>
<P>
President Moi said Friday in Nakuru town in central Kenya that
his government has met all conditions set by the donors, adding
that the move by the IMF would give Kenyans and foreign investors
a free hand to run their business.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's decision, he said, would boost foreign investment in
the country and enable his government to improve education, health
and agricultural services.
</P>
<P>
Corruption could be effectively curbed if officers handling
public funds were patriotic and used their positions to safeguard

<P>
MOSCOW, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia successfully launched the U.
S. satellite PanAmSat-9 into a desired orbit with the Zenith-3SL
booster-rocket from a sea launch platform in the Pacific equator
waters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The rocket set off at 2:42 a.m. Moscow time on Saturday Morning
(2242 GMT Friday) from the Odyssey platform of the International
Sea Launch Cosmodrome, located near the Nativity Island in the
Pacific equator waters (154 degree of Western longitude),
announced the Mission Control Center outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Zenith has put the 3.7-ton satellite into transfer
geostationary orbit 1,900 kilometers high in perigee and 35,786
kilometers in apogee, said the center.
</P>
<P>
The satellite is designed for direct transmission of TV
programs and communication between East Europe and the U.S. and
Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth launch from the sea platform since it was
put into operation on March 28, 1999. Pre-launch preparations
involved 129 Russian and 39 Ukrainian experts as well as launching
personnel from the U.S. and Norway.
</P>
<P>
The sea cosmodrome, worth 2 billion U.S. dollars, is run by the
Sea Launch International Company. Its shares are held by the U.S.
Boeing aircraft and space corporation, Russia's Energy Corporation
and aerospace companies from Norway and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Sea Launch, which is more mobile and less costly than a land
space base, is expected to send off the next satellite in November
this year, according to the center.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lee and seven other old people, who got to know each other at a
computer training course for the elderly last year, founded the
group in May this year.
</P>
<P>
"We enjoy great fun in learning computer and hope to make more
old people know it," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
However, when he first registered for the training course, he
hardly expected that he could do what he can do today, not to
mention getting any fun from it. "I am too old to learn the young
people's fashion," he told himself.
</P>
<P>
Lee decided to learn to use computer on the advice of his son,
who had migrated to Australia and hopes to communicate with father
via Internet.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the patience of the teacher, Lee and his fellows have
learned the basic skill of using computer.
</P>
<P>
"Sending E-mail is a piece of cake," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
They designed their personal website, send electronic greeting
cards to friends and relatives abroad and make more friends on
Internet.
</P>
<P>
When earthquake hit Taiwan, Or Chi King designed and printed a
number of cards and asked a charity organization to bring them to
people in the disaster area to express his sympathy.
</P>
<P>
Lam Hing Fuk, 69, felt that learning computer brings confidence
to her as well as interest and practical uses.
</P>
<P>
"I used to be a full-time housewife. But now I find I can do
things other than cooking for the family. I can do what young
people do. I have also made many friends," Lam said.
</P>
<P>
Her brother, five years younger, and her sister, two years
younger, also joined her when they saw the happiness brought to
Lam.
</P>
<P>
After the training course paused in March this year, they
decided to form the group to continue communication and meanwhile
share their experience with other senior citizens and advocate IT
knowledge among them.
</P>
<P>
Their idea won support of warm-hearted people.
</P>
<P>
A company provided office for the group's daily activities.
Some people donated computers. Some designed an interesting logo
for the group free of charge. The organizer of Digital World 2000
being held at the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention Center
offered a free stand as well as 1,700 free admission tickets for
them to make advocacy.
</P>
<P>
The group is planning to set up their website at www.hkseniors.
org to advocate to the elderly the advantages of learning to use
computer. They also want to run a training course for the elderly
since they themselves have benefited from it. But this is
definitely not easy for it requires necessary equipment and funds.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy for being able to do something for other
elderly friends," said Lam Hing Fuk.
</P>
<P>
"By the way, we often say this can prevent Alzheimer's," she
joked.

"Central and west China, with about one-fourth of the national
population, contains huge market potential," said Michael Sze Cho-
cheung, executive director of Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(TDC) at a seminar held here Friday on the development of China's
west.
</P>
<P>
West China, especially Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province,
has rich scientific and technological resources, which are
valuable for Hong Kong merchants to develop high-value-added
products in areas like electronics, telecommunication and
mechanical production, said Sze.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an is the third biggest scientific research base of China
following Beijing and Shanghai in terms of the number of
specialists and the technological level.
</P>
<P>
In Xi'an, there are about 20,000 software engineers, whose pay
is less than half of that for their counterparts in the coastal
area, working in the estimated 400 computer software companies,
Internet companies and institutes for research of computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's capital, expertise, information and advanced
business management and west China's advantage in technology and
talents are highly complementary, said Wang Chunxin, economist of
Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is also a field with great development potential in
this area, which boasts the ancient silk road and numerous scenic
spots including terra-cotta figures in Xi'an, Mogao Grottoes of
Dunhuang and the Potala Palace of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong merchants may invest in developing the tourist
facilities or join the local tourist authorities to develop more
tourist itineraries, said Sze.
</P>
<P>
He believed that China's imminent entry into the World Trade
Organization and the further opening of its tourism will create
more favorable conditions for Hong Kong merchants.
</P>
<P>
West China has rich natural resources like Chinese herb but has
the problems of lacking capital, large-scale production capability
and sale channels, while Hong Kong merchants are equipped with
conditions to solve these problems, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The authorities of west China attach great importance to
developing Chinese herb. The Shaanxi and Gansu provinces are
building a special zone with favorable policies aimed to develop
the production of traditional Chinese medicine into a backbone
industry.
</P>
<P>
Developing the vast area of west China is a significant policy
to narrow the economic gap between various regions of China
adopted after the implementation of the strategy of first
developing the coastal area, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"West China marks a new focus in China's economic development
in the 21st century and means new room for Hong Kong investors,"
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang urged the investors to pay attention to the
differences between the conditions of west China and east China
and to take corresponding strategy in participating in the west
development to achieve further growth of Hong Kong's economy.

<HEADLINE> Young Workers Call for More Education on IT Ethics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The warning came from social workers after a recent survey on
school pupils' attitudes toward the use of pirated software,
showing that many of the youth considered such acts acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,089 senior secondary school pupils who took part in
the Boys' and Girls' Clubs Association of Hong Kong poll, 82.1
percent admitted to acts of copyright infringement, according to
the local English language newspaper South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the students felt there was nothing wrong in
making their favorite songs available on the Internet for other
people to download, although only 15 percent had done so.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited the survey organizer Fu Suk-yin as saying
that many youngsters knew it was wrong to infringe other people's
copyright but went ahead with actions for a very simple reason -
cost.
</P>
<P>
The price of licensed software or the cost of its use may prove
to be too expensive for them to bear, and therefore, in order to
encourage the youngsters to use the real thing again, a rethink in
policy is required, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more should be done to strengthen young
people's ethics through both academic and civic education, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that more than 60 percent of the
students believed IT knowledge picked up from school could help
them with their studies and employment.

<HEADLINE> China to Work for Lifting Sanctions Against Iraq (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to work for
lifting sanctions against Iraq within the United Nations, Chinese
top legislator Li Peng said today.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in a meeting with Abdul Hadi Al Al-Majali,
speaker of Jordan's House of Representatives, in this coastal
summer resort, about 300 kilometers east of Beijing, this morning.
</P>
<P>
Li said it is unreasonable to remain such sanctions against
Iraq since the Gulf War has ended for 10 years, adding such
sanctions would only bring about sufferings to the innocent Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East issue, Li, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said that China
has long supported the right cause of the Arabian people, and the
Palestinian people's struggle for restoring legal national rights.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Palestine and Israel will, under the
framework of relevant UN resolutions and in accordance with the
principle of "land for peace", continue their peace negotiations
and resolve differences, so as to settle the final status of
Palestine at an early date.

the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the guests on China's NPC system and its
strategy to develop the west.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Hadi Al Al-Majali said that Jordan places great
importance on developing relations with China, especially economic
and trade cooperation, praising China's consistent support for the
Palestinian people's right struggle.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jordan's parliament hopes to increase exchanges
with the Chinese NPC, thus creating a favorable atmosphere for the
growth of bilateral relations.
</P>

<P>
CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in

</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) are unconditional, said Ashraf Za'zaa, secretary general of
the Egyptian Fund for Technical Cooperation with CIS.
</P>
<P>
The fund unconditionally meets the demands of CIS, unlike the
big countries' policy which might lead to meddling in the internal
affairs of the countries which receive assistance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt's parliamentary elections are due to start in November,
said Prime Minister Atef Obeid. Two 10-day phases will cover both
Delta and Upper Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers in charge of the elections will meet to
discuss preparations for the elections, and judiciary monitoring
will cover elections from voting to sorting out of votes, said
Obeid.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt's Ambassador in Berlin Mahmoud Mubarak on Friday
praised Egyptian-German relations, citing progress in bilateral
ties especially after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's visit to
Germany in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In his statements, the ambassador anticipated the two countries'
relations will grow following the projected visit of German
Chancellor Gerhard Shroeder to Egypt late in October.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Mail:
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Friday the continued
sanctions imposed on Iraq 10 years ago are creating an unacceptable
and illogical situation for Arabs.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian and Arab position is clear in this regard. It
demands an end to the economic embargo on Iraq, preserving its
people's interests and respecting the Security Council resolutions
which are being implemented," he told reporters in Cairo.

<P>
CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish cabinet has cut down customs duties on a
variety of import goods in order to keep in line with the European
Union's Common Customs Tariffs.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision published on Official Gazette Friday,
duties on cigars were reduced from 30.3 percent to 26 percent,
cigarettes from 63 percent to 57.6 percent and tobacco from 81.9
percent to 74.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Duty on beer dropped from 9 percent to 6 percent and that on
ginger beer from 10.5 percent to 9.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish government plans to take structural
measures within one month to deter automotive imports.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister Ahmet Tanrikulu told reporters Friday that car
imports are responsible for widening trade and account deficits,
adding the steps will conform to Turkey's undertakings to the World
Trade Organization and to a customs union with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Car imports in the first five months of 2000 amounted to 1.7
billion U.S. dollars, up 74.9 percent from 976.7 million dollars in
the same period of 1999, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- German auto producer Volkswagen has set the goal of
automobile sales in Turkey at 45,000-50,000 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The managing director of the Volkswagen distributor Dogus
Otomotiv, Omer Aksac, told reporters Friday there was an unexpected
rising demand for Volkswagen in the Turkish market in the first six
months of this year and, therefore, the company will increase its
production within three or four months to meet the rising demand in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He explained the Turkish domestic auto producers have
consistently failed to invest in new models and consequently
consumers have turned to imported cars.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish construction company, DHT Insaat ve
Ticaret Ltd., will build an international airport in Almaty, former
capital of Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The international airport will be built 60 kilometers away from
Almaty on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) model.
</P>
<P>
The airport is expected to cost almost 300 million dollars and
will start operation in October 2004.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The European Commission (EC) offered a 450-million-
euro (about 415 million dollars) credit package to Ankara to
strengthen and consolidate the Customs Union agreement between the
European Union and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the Representation of the EC
to Turkey Thursday, the package will be submitted to the European
Parliament and the Council of Europe for approval before the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The package, considered as a special action plan for Turkey,
will be administered by the European Development Bank in the 2000-
2004 period.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used to enhance Turkey's competitiveness at
international markets and in such infrastructure investments as
communication and transportation.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Tourism Industry Reports Good Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan Province in southwest China
received 19.8 million domestic tourists in the January-June period
this year, up 9 percent from the same period last year, with
tourism income standing at 8.8 billion yuan, an increase of 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of overseas visitors to Yunnan dropped by
14 percent to 410,000, foreign exchange from the tourism sector
reached 10 billion yuan, 10 percent up from the corresponding
period last year, according to the provincial tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry has reported a rapid growth in Yunnan since
Kunming, the capital city, successfully hosted the '99 World
Horticultural Exposition from May to October last year, which
attracted 10 million Chinese and foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the rapid development of tourism industry
to Yunnan's various activities and the country's long holidays
during the Spring Festival, May Day and the summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
From April 10 to May 10, some 5.55 million Chinese and overseas
people visited Yunnan, with tourism income standing at 100 million
yuan a day.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to attract one million overseas visitors and
35 million Chinese this year. Tourism income will surge to 20
billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Chang, Gimelstob, Gambill Triumph Advance in Mercedes Bank Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Michael Chang signaled a
comeback Friday night after rallying from a 3-5 deficit and facing
two set points in the tiebreaker to beat fifth-seeded Wayne
Ferreira 6-3, 7-6 (7) at the Mercedes-Benz Cup.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who has yet to lose to Ferreira in seven career
meetings and hasn't dropped a set in three matches here, advanced
to Saturday's semifinals against Justin Gimelstob.
</P>
<P>
Gimelstob, who upset No. 2 Mark Philippoussis in three sets
Thursday night, was leading 3-0 in the first set when Paul
Goldstein retired from their quarterfinal with tendinitis in his
left foot.
</P>
<P>
Goldstein of the United States became the 10th player lost to
injury, illness, default or upset this week.
</P>
<P>
No. 8 Arnaud Clement of France defeated countryman Lionel Roux
6-3, 6-2 and will play No. 6 Jan-Michael Gambill, who beat
Australian Jason Stoltenberg 6-1, 3-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Chang is much improved from a year ago when he was in tennis'
equivalent of the minor leagues, playing a Challenger event with
others whose rankings aren't high enough to get into the main draw
of ATP Tour events.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 11 years, Chang failed to win at least
one title in 1999 and finished the year ranked 50th in the world _
shocking results for the former French Open champion who has won
33 career titles and more than dlrs 18 million in prize money.
</P>
<P>
Working with his brother, Carl, Chang cut back on the weights
and started sprint work to regain his speed. So far this year, he'
s made the quarterfinals of seven tournaments and lost in the
final of another.
</P>
<P>
"I almost feel like I've started my career over. I definitely
feel I'm moving better out there," he said. "If I'm able to get to
the ball and hit what I want to hit, I'm going to be a better
player. I've gone back to basics and given up on trying to
overpower guys to the extent I wanted to."
</P>
<P>
Chang's busy summer includes the U.S. Open and the Sydney
Olympics, a place he never could have expected to be a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I've been able to pull through that stuff. I've
learned a great deal about how to handle circumstances, whether
they be good or bad," he said. "I'm excited about future things."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's First Deluxe Train to Be Operated from Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Railway is expected to
start operation of the country's first-ever air-conditioned deluxe
train service between the capital city and Chittagong, the largest
port city by early next year, The Daily Star reported here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The commercial activities of the new service will be vested in
the private sector, railway sources said.
</P>
<P>
The railway authorities have already invited proposals from
private entrepreneurs in this regard. Apart from security and
mechanical maintenance, the railway authorities will fix the fare,
while the private sector will be responsible for the sale of
tickets.
</P>
<P>
The private sector will also be responsible for its management
for five years on the basis of BOT (build-operate-transfer), the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The railway has already vested commercial service of 23 pairs
of passenger trains in the private entrepreneurs, and the new
system of service under private management has proved profitable
except on one or two routes in the eastern zone.
</P>
<P>
During the 1999-2000 fiscal, Bangladesh Railway earned 28.44
million U.S. dollars, ferrying a total of 38.6 million passengers,
the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Miss Global IT Job Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is set to miss the
magnificent chance to share a huge emerging global job market for
information technology (IT) professionals because of delayed and
inadequate policy support to the sector, the Financial Express
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mostafa Jabbar, former president of the Bangladesh Computer
Association, was quoted as saying that "this is almost certain
that we are going to miss the opportunity. We won't be able to
share even a small percentage of the market."
</P>
<P>
He said things are changing very fast in the sector and
Bangladesh, being the late starter, should have been even faster
to cover up its backwardness and keep pace with the global changes.
</P>
<P>
The United States reportedly will need more than 250,000 IT
skilled professionals by the year 2002, Germany will need more
than 20,000 IT-skilled people immediately and Britain, South Korea
and many other countries will recruit a significant number of
people with knowledge of computer programming for their domestic
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Experts and analysts here pointed out that Bangladesh has not
any chance to grab the opportunities. The country is late in
adopting suitable policies, they said.
</P>
<P>
Only a small number of IT graduates are passing out from a very
few institutions and most of them are not up to the global
standard. The country's educational institutions are not
developing human resources in line with the requirement of the
world.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken a few steps recently to promote the IT
sector. But, there are no allocations for the planned IT village,
installation of optic fiber cables and improvement of the talcum
sector.
</P>
<P>
The whole education system in the country is not conducive to
developing required skilled IT professionals and the allocation
for IT is much lower than what is needed, experts noted.
</P>
<P>
On numerous emerging computer learning centers and institutes,
they said that they are only creating IT users, not experts who
can really make a breakthrough in the sector.
</P>
<P>
An awareness reportedly has been created among the policy
makers in the country about IT. But that has not yet been
materialized into actions in real sense.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Americans Surfing Primarily for Entertainment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Americans are surfing the
Internet primarily for entertainment purposes, according to a
survey released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The survey from U.S. research firm Greenfield Online found that
over 80 percent of more than 3,000 respondents believe the
Internet is "a rich, diverse source of entertainment."
</P>
<P>
Rather than using the Net principally "for information," 83
percent said they play games on their computers both on- and off-
line. And more of the study participants subscribe to fun/jokes/
games updates (52 percent) than daily news updates (43 percent), e-
mail newsgroups (31 percent), business update (30 percent) or
stock market updates (22 percent).
</P>
<P>
People are also discovering the convenience of the Internet's "
entertainment-on-demand." Some 66 percent of those with
multimedia capabilities are downloading music, for instance.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of respondents are watching less TV since bringing
the Internet into the home. Furthermore, a nearly equal number of
respondents consider the TV and the Internet as the most important
items in the household.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted between April 20 and April 26, 2000, also
found that some children are surfing the Web for entertainment,
even more than channel surfing, perhaps offering the clearest
glimpse of how the Internet will impact the family of the future.
The study reveals the older the child, the more likely they are to
log in rather than tune in.
</P>
<P>
Greenfield said all the signs indicate that the Internet will
continue to be a common source of household entertainment in the
coming years.

training program for the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
KONI official in charge of athletes' development Mochamad
Hindarto said the fund would be disbursed to some 27 sports
organizations, whose sports have been ensured a place at the
biennial event.
</P>
<P>
"The amount is not enough to support all competing athletes. So
we will subsidize the organizations. We are expecting city
administrations and KONI's provincial chapters to help finance
their athletes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said KONI would receive the money in October.
</P>
<P>
He said the decentralized training, which is expected to begin
between September and December, would take place in the athletes'
home towns.
</P>
<P>
"After December, we don't know where we can get the money. We
hope the government will allocate some more money from its extra
budget," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
KONI aims to stage a long term training program in order to
retain the overall champion title from arch rival Thailand and
improve Indonesia's position in the medal tally, after falling to
the third place last year behind Thailand and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto also said that KONI has been registering athletes who
are likely to join the training program. Some potential athletes
were netted in the National Games in East Java last month.
</P>
<P>
KONI is scheduled to stage physical and medical tests to
examine athletes' training progress by the end of December or
earlier next year.
</P>
<P>
"We have set a target for them. They must reach a certain
physical condition before they attend the centralized training
program next year. They must achieve a similar condition as that
required in the SEA Games," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia considers its achievement in the SEA Games in Jakarta
as successful. The athletes trained for one year and made
Indonesia the overall champion.

<P>
OSLO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Norway's Trine Hattestad broke her
own world record in the women's javelin with a throw of 69.48
meters Friday at the Bislett Games track meet.
</P>
<P>
The former two-time world champion, Hattestad improved her own
mark 68.22 set in Rome in July 2 by more than one meter.
</P>
<P>
It was the 52nd world record set at Bislett Stadium since 1924,
but the first since 1997. Only Stockholm's Olympic Stadium, built
for the 1912 Summer Games, boasts more world records.
</P>
<P>
The former two-time world champion started the competition with
a throw of 63.50 meters and 65.40 in the second round before
fouling on her next throw. She hit 65.01 and 64.44 meters before
ending the contest with the world record.

<HEADLINE> Congo's Peace Pact in Serious Danger: Political Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The government of President Laurent
Kabila is a major stumbling block to the implementation of a peace
agreement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a Sunday
Mail newspaper report quoted a ministerial committee overseeing
the pact as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Political Committee, which comprises ministers and senior
officials from all sides in the DRC conflict, suggested that the
peace agreement reached in Lusaka a year ago was now in serious
danger, a statement released here said.
</P>
<P>
The committee states that the undermining of the agreement is
reflected in the DRC government's impeding "the efforts of the
facilitator to commence the national dialog, the violation of the
Lusaka cease-fire agreement and the absence of a conducive
environment for the second phase of the deployment of the United
Nations Mission Observers in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The statement was released at the end of the committee's
seventh meeting in Lusaka on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the deliberate absence of the DRC delegation, the committee
was briefed by the neutral facilitator of the Inter-Congolese
Political Negotiations, Ketumile Masire, on the status of the
preparations for the National Dialog, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said Kabila's government had prevented the negotiator of
Botswana from starting an all-party national dialog on the country
's future, violated a cease-fire agreement and had not created a
conducive environment for the deployment of U.N. forces.
</P>
<P>
The Political Committee expressed grave concern over the
deliberate actions of the DRC government which have undermined or
obstructed the implementation of some crucial aspects of the
agreement, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The committee called for a heads-of-state summit to resolve the
many problems posed by Kabila's administration.
</P>
<P>
The last summit was held in February and set up a timetable for
the deployment of U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola are fighting alongside Kabila's
forces while former allies of Rwanda and Uganda back splintered
rebel groups trying to end Kabila's rule.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Power Rationing to Ease: Official  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
finalized arrangements that could reduce the hours of the current
crippling power rationing by more than a half by the end of
September this year, according to a senior official.
</P>
<P>
After minor rationing began last September, industry now has to
deal with 32 hours of power a week and private homes with between
six and 12 hours of electricity per day.
</P>
<P>
"The government has taken emergency measures to address the
power shortages and the situation should return to nearly normal
within the next two months," Permanent Secretary for the Finance
and Planning Ministry Martin Otieno was quoted by the Sunday
Standard newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Otieno said on Saturday that the government had approved bids
for the provision of multiple diesel engines and the required
equipment should be in place in the next four weeks.
</P>
<P>
The government will also sign a 75 million U.S. dollars power
emergency loan with the World Bank next week, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Power and Lighting Company, the mostly state-owned
distributing monopoly, has also announced that it had made
preparations for the installation of 75 megawatts emergency
generators, which are due in September.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here estimate that the prolonged power rationing
has caused an economic loss of between 5 and 9 billion shillings (
about 66 million to 120 million U.S. dollars) in the past 11
months.

the Peruvian Andean zone paid homage to Peru marching with the
national flag.

the Navy, the Air Force and the Army went past the official
platform, exhibiting modern ordnance and equipment from their
military arsenal.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian businesses have the painful
distinction of paying the highest electricity and inter-urban

<HEADLINE> UN Secretary-General Visits His Home Country Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan
arrived in Accra, Ghana's capital, on Saturday night kicking off a
five-day official visit, the first to his home country since his
election.
</P>
<P>
His wife, Nane, accompanied him. Already in the country are his
two children, Kojo and Ama, reported the Pan-African News Agency
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
President Jerry Rawlings and his wife, Nana Konadu Agyeman, met
Annan at the Kotoka International Airport in the capital.
</P>

Speaking to reporters, Annan expressed his delight to be home
to meet fellow Ghanaians.
</P>

He said one of the main areas of the UN is the provision of an
early warning mechanism in conflict prevention, adding that the

troops to such areas, a venture which is expensive.

He said that the Security Council is considering a draft
proposal on the trial of Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United
Front and its leader, Foday Sankoh.
</P>
